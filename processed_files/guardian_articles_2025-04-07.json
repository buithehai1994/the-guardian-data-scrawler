She said: “It was just hard to believe she was real. I knew she was ours, but it’s just hard to believe.”View image in fullscreenGrace and Angus Davidson with baby Amy Isabel, and the baby’s aunt and the donor of the womb, Amy Purdie.Photograph: Joe Daniel/PAThe couple always had “a quiet hope” the womb transplant would be a success and enable them to start a family, Davidson said. “But it wasn’t really until she arrived that the reality of it sunk in.”The development will offer new hope to women born without a womb or whose womb fails to function. Three more womb transplants have been carried out in the UK, using deceased donors, with medics hoping the recipients of those wombs will have babies.About 10 more women are going through the process of approval for a £25,000 womb transplant in the UK, but hundreds more have expressed an interest in the programme, which is funded by Womb Transplant UK.The charity has permission for 10 deceased donor transplants and five living donor transplants. It hopes the NHS may provide funding in future.The arrival of Amy Isabel follows 25 years of pioneering research led by Prof Richard Smith, clinical lead at the charity, who was in the operating theatre with Quiroga when the 2.04kg (4.5lb) baby was delivered.View image in fullscreenAmy Isabel.Photograph: Womb Transplant UK/PASmith told PA Media: “I feel great joy actually, unbelievable – 25 years down the line from starting this research, we finally have a baby, little Amy Isabel. Astonishing, really astonishing.”Smith, a consultant gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust, said: “There’s been a lot of tears shed by all of us in this process – really quite emotional, for sure. It is really something.”Quiroga, a consultant surgeon at the Oxford Transplant Centre, part of Oxford University hospitals, said: “For me, it’s total joy, delight. I couldn’t be happier for Angus and Grace, what a wonderful couple. It was overwhelming actually, it remains overwhelming. It’s fantastic.”Davidson, an NHS dietitian from north London, was born with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, a rare condition that affects about one in every 5,000 women, meaning they have an underdeveloped or missing womb. The ovaries remain intact and still function to produce eggs and female hormones, however, making conceiving via fertility treatment a possibility.Before receiving the donated womb, Davidson and her husband had fertility treatment to create seven embryos, which were frozen for IVF in central London.She had surgery in February 2023 to receive the womb from Purdie, 42, who has two girls aged 10 and six. Several months later, one of the stored embryos was transferred via IVF to Davidson.Angus Davidson said the moment his daughter arrived was very emotional. He said: “Having waited such a long time, it’s kind of odd getting your head around that this is the moment where you are going to meet your daughter.“The room was full of people who have helped us on the journey to actually having Amy. We had been kind of suppressing emotion, probably for 10 years, and you don’t know how that’s going to come out – ugly crying, it turns out!“The room was just so full of love and joy and all these people that had a vested interest in Amy for incredible medical and science reasons. But the lines between that and the love for our family and for Amy are very much blurred – it felt like a room full of love.“The moment we saw her was incredible, and both of us just broke down in emotional tears.”Purdie said watching her sister and brother-in-law become parents had been “an absolute joy” and “worth every moment” of what she had been through to donate her womb.Davidson took immunosuppressants during her pregnancy to ensure her body did not reject her sister’s womb. She said she definitely wanted to have another child.More than 100 womb transplants have been carried out worldwide, with at least 50 babies thought to have been born as a result.The first successful birth after a transplanttook place in Sweden in 2014, with the baby – Vincent – born to a 36-year-old woman who described him as “perfect”.Explore more on these topicsFertility problemsPregnancyWomenHealthFamilyParents and parentingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It was organised by the Rochdale MP Paul Waugh.In a statement in the Commons, Falconer said both were given clearance for entrance by Israeli before travelling and said the ban “appears to have been taken on the basis of comments made in this chamber”, calling the treatment “unacceptable and deeply concerning”.He said the UK government had made that clear at the “highest level” in Israel and praised Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed for their dignity.Yang and Mohamed both rose in the house to cheers. Mohamed said her treatment was “unprecedented” and the views she had expressed in theHouse of Commonswere “legitimate political opinions which are firmly aligned with international laws”. She said many Israeli people and charities had also called for change in a similar manner.“This was not about security, this was about control and censorship,” Mohamed, the MP for Sheffield Central, said, adding that she “desperately wants to see a two-state solution, desperately wants to see peace”.Yang, the MP for Earley and Woodley, said she had been heartened by the solidarity shown by other MPs from across the Commons. Yang said she had understood the risks of travelling the region but “I did not anticipate the risks of detention and deportation by a British ally”. She said: “If my experience has proved anything, it is that what we say in this chamber matters.”Falconer said the MPs had initially believed they were going to be detained overnight without their phones and were eventually released after intervention by both him and theforeign secretary, David Lammy, who spoke to his Israeli counterpart.“All members should be worried about what this decision means and the precedent it sets. We have warned that actions like this only damage the image of the Israeli government in the eyes of honourable members across the house,” Falconer said.The minister also condemning the killing of 15 paramedics in a convoy of ambulances near Rafah, calling it an “outrage” and demanding a return to ceasefire negotiations. “This conflict cannot be won by bombs and bullets but by diplomacy, he said.At the photocall in support of the MPs, Streeting told the Guardian he had been on a similar visit led by the Council for Arab British-Understanding (Caabu) and Medical Aid for Palestinians – and questioned why the two had been targeted.“The way that two really excellent colleagues were treated was totally unacceptable,” he said.“I think this is really important that this is understood in the context of two highly respectedLabourmembers of parliament held in high regard across the parliamentary party who were going on a delegation just like the one I was on with Caabu and Medical Aid for Palestinians – without the sort of challenges they had.“In the context of what is going on in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the moment, having insight, meeting a range of voices is really important. It’s highly regrettable the Israeli authorities have acted in this way.”MPs joining the show of solidarity included the chair of the foreign affairs select committee Emily Thornberry, the Treasury select committee chair, Meg Hillier, Melanie Ward, the Labour MP who was the former chief executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians, and the former development minister Anneliese Dodds.Caabu has taken a total of 161 MP and peers to the region since 1997, including Streeting, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, the former education secretary Kit Malthouse and the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey.Other high-profile politicians who have visited as part of their delegations include former ministers Nick Herbert and the late Tessa Jowell and the Lib Dem MPs Alistair Carmichael and Christine Jardine.Speaking in the chamber, Falconer condemned thecomments of the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, who said on Sunday that the two MPs were not allowed entry because the Israeli authorities “did not believe they were going to comply with Israeli law”. Falconer said that was not the reason that the Israeli officials gave, adding: “The leader of the opposition should apologise.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsIsrael-Gaza warLabourHouse of CommonsIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It’ll go on Saturday. We have a very big meeting, and we’ll see what can happen,” he told reporters.“And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious. And the obvious is not something that I want to be involved with, or, frankly, that Israel wants to be involved with, if they can avoid it.“So we’re going to see if we can avoid it. But it’s getting to be very dangerous territory. And hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran’s best interests if they are successful.”He gave no details of where the talks would take place or which officials would be involved. When questioned by journalists, Trump issued a thinly veiled threat if the talks failed, saying Iran would be in “great danger”.“I think if the talks aren’t successful with Iran … Iran is going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it – because they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” he said.“It’s not a complicated formula. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Right now we have countries that have nuclear power that shouldn’t have it. But I’m sure we’ll be able to negotiate out of that too as part of this later on down the line.“And if the talks aren’t successful I actually think it will be a very bad day for Iran.”During his presidency, Trump pulled out of a deal signed by Barack Obama known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. That deal offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for limitations on its uranium enrichment activities – resorting instead to a policy of “maximum pressure” that tightened economic embargoes.Critics say Iran nevertheless accelerated its nuclear program and is now closer to building a bomb than ever before. Attempts by Joe Biden at reviving the deal negotiated by Obama faltered.Netanyahu, who views Iran as an existential threat to Israel, actively undermined Obama’s agreement and has long railed against any deal that would allow the country’s theocratic rulers to maintain a program that could converted to nuclear weaponry.Iran, for its part, has consistently denied any intent to build a bomb and said its program is meant for purely civilian purposes.Iran and the US have had no direct diplomatic relations since 1980, when ties were severed after revolutionaries stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 53 diplomats hostage for 444 days.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyIranDonald TrumpIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Paired with battery storage, solar is set to be an unstoppable force. As the fastest-growing and largest source of new electricity, it is critical in meeting the world’s ever-increasing demand for electricity.”Overall, solar power remains a relatively small part of the global energy system. It made up almost 7% of the world’s electricity last year, according to Ember, while wind power made up just over 8% of the global power system.The fast-growing technologies remain dwarfed by hydro power, which has remained relatively steady in recent years, and made up 14% of the world’s electricity in 2024.Hydro power is one of themodern world’s oldest renewable energy technologies, and made up a large proportion of global electricity in the 1940s – when the power system was about 50 times smaller than it is today.The continuing growth of solar means clean power – including nuclear and bioenergy – is on track to expand faster than the world’s overall electricity demand, according to Ember. This should mean fossil fuels beginning to be squeezed out of the global power system.Ember had previously predicted that 2023 would be the year in whichemissions from electricity reached a peak, after a plateau in the first half of the year.Climate experts hoped then that emissions would begin to fall, buta series of heatwaves across the globeignited a surge in demand for electricity to power air conditioning and refrigeration systems, which caused fuel electricity to grow by 1.4% that year.The report, which accounted for 93% of the global electricity market across 88 countries, found that the surge in demand pushed emissions from the global power sector up by 1.6% to an all-time high last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Iraq almost quadrupled its executions from at least 16 to at least 63 and Saudi Arabia doubled its yearly total from 172 to at least 345.Iran executed 119 more people than in 2023, raising its tally to at least 972 – a figure that included 30 women and represented 64% of the global total. All known executions inIraqwere for terrorism offences, while about half of those in Iran were for drug-related offences.Other countries where executions increased included Egypt (from eight in 2023 to 13 last year); Singapore, where executions nearly doubled (from five to nine); and Yemen, where the total more than doubled from at least 15 to at least 38.The total of 25 executions in the US was one more than in 2023 and the most since 2018. The period studied covers Joe Biden’s last year in office. His successor, Donald Trump,has said he aimsto “vigorously pursue” the death penalty as a tool to protect people “from violent rapists, murderers, and monsters”.Only 15 countries were known to have executed people in 2024, the lowest on record for the second year running, Amnesty said, adding that 113 countries were now fully abolitionist and 145 had abolished the death penalty in law or in practice.The campaign organisation also noted that several countries had legally limited their use of the death penalty, and that for the first time, more than two-thirds of all UN member states hadvoted in favour of a resolution on a moratorium.Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said it was clear that countries that retained the death penalty were an “isolated minority”. She added that the tide was turning against “a cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment”.But Callamard said the death penalty was still being weaponised in some countries under the “false pretence” it would improve public safety, and in others such asIranand Saudi Arabia to silence political dissent from “those brave enough to speak out”.Amnesty also noted that more than 40% of executions in 2024 were carried out for drug-related offences, which it said was not only unlawful under international human rights law and standards but had no proven effect in reducing drug trafficking.Explore more on these topicsCapital punishmentAmnesty InternationalHuman rightsIranIraqSaudi ArabianewsShareReuse this content"

Fuck off” on stage at the Q Awards in 2004, and accused her of lip-syncing.The pair have traded a number of remarks since, but in a post on Instagram on Monday, Madonna, whose full name is Madonna Ciccone, said: “We finally buried the hatchet.”The singer said John’s recent appearance on SNL reminded her of when she snuck out of her home while at high school to see him perform in Detroit, which she described as an “unforgettable” performance that changed the course of her life.She said: “I had always felt like an outsider growing up and watching him on stage helped me to understand that it was OK to be different, to stand out, to take the road less travelled. In fact, it was essential.“Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist. I didn’t understand it. I was toldElton Johnwas the musical guest on SNL and I decided to go.”Madonna said that she confronted John backstage, where he asked her to forgive him. She said the pair then hugged and the pianist told her he had written a song for her and wanted to collaborate.John and Carlile performed Little Richard’s Bible on SNL from their collaborative album Who Believes In Angels?, which is on course to become the Briton’s 10th UK No 1 album.In response to Madonna, John thanked her for coming to see him on SNL and for forgiving his “big mouth”.He wrote on Instagram that he was not proud of what he had said, praising her advocacy for HIV/Aids in the 1980s and her “groundbreaking work” that paved the way for an entire generation of female artists.He said: “I’m grateful we can move forward. I’m increasingly distressed by all the divisiveness in our world at the moment.”John said he and Madonna had been wholeheartedly accepted and embraced by communities who are under threat around the world, and that he hoped to make “great things happen” together for those who needed support.Explore more on these topicsMusicMadonnaElton JohnPop and rockSaturday Night LivenewsShareReuse this content"

Rishi Sunak useda helicopter owned by Harpinfor campaign stops in the run-up to last year’s general election.A source close to Harpin said that while he had paused his donations, he remained a strong supporter of the Conservatives.Until recently, Harpin, who grew up in Northumberland, made a monthly £33,000 cash donation to the party, which paid for its northern HQ in Leeds. This has now ended and the Leeds HQ is likely to close as a result, two Tory sources said.The Tories announced their plan to establish a northern HQ in October 2020, almost a year after Boris Johnson’s landslide election victory, in which dozens of “red wall” seats in the north of England flipped from Labour to Conservative. The new offices were opened by Oliver Dowden, then party chair, in the spring of 2022 on the outskirts of Leeds city centre.Labour won back most of those red wall constituencies last summer, and there has since been speculation that the northern Tory HQ was slated for closure as the party faced financial difficulties.View image in fullscreenDuring Kemi Badenoch’s leadership, several Tory donors have been successfully wooed by Reform UK.Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesA Conservative party source said Harpin had agreed to fund the Leeds office for an extra year to cover the general election period after an initial two years. The source said that although the party was reviewing its properties, there were no plans to shut down operations in the north.Despite cash woes, the Conservatives outperformed other parties’ fundraising efforts at the end of last year –raising nearly £2m in the last three monthsof 2024, which was twice as much as Labour and seven times more than Reform. A Conservative party source said they were expecting a strong showing in the first quarter of 2025 too.One Tory insider said Harpin took his decision to stop donating after a meeting with party co-chair Dominic Johnson, who has faced some internal criticism, but sources close to the HomeServe founder and the party denied this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is speculation that the party will move out of its headquarters in Westminster to cut costs.Last spring, the Conservatives were fined nearly £11,000 for under-reporting the value of non-cash donations received from Harpin for three years. On top of his cash donations, he funded the secondment of an employee to the party.Harpin, who began his career as a brand manager for Procter & Gamble in Newcastle upon Tyne and stepped down as chair of HomeServe in January. He and his wife secured a reported £500m in 2022 after he sold the company to a Canadian firmfor more than £4bn. The Sunday Times rich list placed him as the Britain’s 242nd richest person last year, with a worth of £670m, up £40m on the year before.During the run-up to the election in July several Conservative donors including the Phones 4u founder, John Caudwell, and the carpet tycoon Philip Harris switched to support Labour.In the past six months, several other Tory donors including the billionaire property developer Nick Candyhave been wooed by Reform.

A number of institutions have since taken down their trans and non-binary equality policies while the content is reviewed.A statement on the University of Bristol website, for example, said: “Please note that university guidance and policy related to trans and non-binary inclusion are currently being reviewed in light of the ruling by the Office for Students of 26 March 2025.”On Monday, Times Higher Education (THE) reported it had seen a letter to vice-chancellors from Arif Ahmed, the OfS’s director for free speech and academic freedom, which urged universities to consider whether they were meeting their own regulatory obligations in light of the Sussex investigation.University of Sussex taking legal action over £585,000 free speech fineRead moreIt said that Ahmed wrote: “If you are not doing so already, I encourage you to review relevant policies in light of the OfS’s findings … and consider the steps you may need to take to ensure the university is meeting its regulatory obligations in these areas.“I am keen to meet you to discuss the steps you are taking and would be pleased to support your work in an appropriate way.”The letter goes on: “We took action to ensure that students have a high-quality education and are exposed to a wide range of academic thought and argument.“Our action also ensures that academic staff can teach and research lawful topics with confidence, even if they are controversial.“The OfS’s interest is in ensuring the protection and promotion of lawful speech – irrespective of the views expressed.”It was not clear how many universities received the letter.The OfS ruling against Sussex focused on a trans and non-binary equality policy statement passed in 2018, which the regulator argued had “a chilling effect” that could result in self-censorship by staff and students. One of the clauses required academics to “positively represent trans people and trans lives” in course materials.Sussex was planning to take legal action to overturn the fine. It claimed the OfS’s findings meant it was now all but impossible for universities to prevent abuse, harassment or bullying on campuses.An OfS spokesperson said: “It is important to emphasise that none of this means providers can’t have policies which set out how they will protect students from harassment – indeed, our new harassment condition will require them to do so.”Explore more on these topicsHigher educationUniversitiesFreedom of speechTransgenderUniversity of SussexnewsShareReuse this content"

It also found that wastewater was left to run into the forest.View image in fullscreenGuests at Stedsans, which has now shut, were promised an idyllic rural stay.Photograph: Stedsans/InstagramStaff said multiple animals – including ducks – had died as a result of being left outside through the night by the couple, and others were left abandoned after the owners vanished.Stedsans was declared bankrupt in March and the couple reportedly registered themselves as living abroad before Christmas.According to the investigation, they left the Danish capital, where they owed millions of kroner in debt to Danish tax authorities, in 2016 to move to Sweden. There they set up Stedsans, but started accumulating debt to Swedish tax authorities, which reportedly amounted to 6m SEK (£470,000). They have since started a new hotel business in Guatemala.In a message posted on their website, they said: “We came very far with Stedsans, but we also had to realise on the way that being soul-driven entrepreneurs on a mission in a country where taxes are some of the highest in the world and bureaucracy is relentless, it is an impossible task.”They added: “When you read this we have probably been declared bankrupt by the Swedish tax authorities.

It was the biggest two-day loss of wealth ever recorded by Bloomberg’s billionaires index.Global stock markets tumble further as Trump insists on tariff ‘medicine’Read moreWithin that, a coterie of tycoons who have supported Trump orattended his inauguration in Januaryhave seen their wealth shrink. Here, we look at the four who have been worst hit by the market turmoil – and one billionaire still riding high this year.Elon MuskThe world’s richest man and the chief executive of Tesla – who has already seen his wealth drop precipitously after becoming ahigh-profile and controversial figurein Trump’s administration – has taken the biggest hit by some margin.Tesla was alreadyfacing a potential buyer backlashover its CEO’s controversial behaviour, and as its shares plunged, $31bn was wiped off Musk’s net worth between the opening bell on Thursday and the market closing on Friday. The recent fall in Tesla’s stock has meant his private rockets and satellites business, SpaceX,became his most valuable asset.So far this year, Musk’s estimated wealth has fallen by $130bn, although he still comfortably remains the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $302bn. Tesla’s shares fell nearly 5% on Wall Street on Monday afternoon, adding to these losses.Mark ZuckerbergView image in fullscreenMark Zuckerberg.Photograph: Manuel Orbegozo/ReutersThe Facebook founder and owner of Instagram and WhatsApp had the next biggest loss, at more than $27bn.The world’s third richest person, with an estimated net worth of $179bn, was hit by a plunge in the value of Meta. Its stock dropped almost 14% over two days as the tariff war hittech companies particularly hard. Its stock edged slightly higher on Monday, up almost 1%.Many of theworld’s biggest companies rely on markets in Asia, which had the heaviest tariffs imposed on them by Trump, for manufacturing, computer chips and IT services.Zuckerberg, who performed aremarkable “Trump pivot” of Metaweeks before Trump took office, has seen more than $28bn wiped off his personal fortune so far this year.Jeff BezosView image in fullscreenJeff Bezos.Photograph: CraSH/imageSpace/Rex/ShutterstockThe Amazon founder and Washington Post owner had the next biggest two-day loss, at $23.5bn.The market value of Amazon, a leading seller of imported goods from around the world, has fallen by hundreds of billions of dollars this year.China-based sellers havemore than a 50% market shareof Amazon’s third-party marketplace, while its cloud services business also relies on tech produced primarily by manufacturers in Asian countries, such as Taiwan.Bezos, the world’s second richest person, with a net worth estimated at $193bn, has seen $45bn wiped off his fortune so far this year. Amazon’s shares were marginally higher – up 0.4% - on Monday.In February, Bezos’s $10bn climate and biodiversity fundhalted funding to one of the world’s most important climate-certification organisations, in a move viewed by some as a “bowing down” to Trump and his opposition to climate action.Bernard ArnaultView image in fullscreenBernard Arnault.Photograph: Christian Hartmann/ReutersThe owner of the LVMH luxury goods empire lost $6bn on Thursday and more than $5bn on Friday as Trump’s tariffs hit the Asian factory hubs that underpin the global garment industry. Shares fell even further on Monday, by more than 4%.The net worth of Europe’s richest person, and the fourth wealthiest individual in the world according to Bloomberg, has dropped to $158bn – down $18.6bn so far this year.Arnault has been friends with Trump since the early 1980s when they met at a charity dinner, and the US is his business empire’s largest market, equal in size to all European sales.Arnault,also known as the “wolf in cashmere”, had prime seats at Trump’s second inauguration along with his wife, son and daughter.“I have just returned from the US, and I have witnessed the winds of optimism in that country,” he said on his return. “Coming back to France is a bit like taking a cold shower.”A 20% tariff has since been imposed on the EU, while key countries for garment manufacturing in Asia have tariffs of up to 54%.... and Warren BuffettView image in fullscreenWarren Buffett.Photograph: Scott Morgan/ReutersNot all billionaires have seen their net worth decrease, despite the two-day rout.The canny chair and largest shareholder in the investment company Berkshire Hathaway,known as the “sage of Omaha”, has seen his wealth increase to $155bn this year.The world’s sixth richest person, whose annual shareholder meetings have been called“Woodstock for capitalists”, did take a $2.57bn hit in the two-day meltdown, but he has seen $12.7bn added to his net wealth so far this year.On Friday, Trump shared a video on his social media site, Truth Social, that erroneously claimed Buffett had praised his recent economic policies.Berkshire Hathaway subsequently issued a statement sayingreports on social media attributing comments to Buffett were false.

Anything that happens at the steelworks has a massive, massive, massive impact on this town.”Rahman is a co-owner of the north Lincolnshire town’s football club, which at the weekend offeredreduced price tickets to British Steel workersfor the home match against Southport. “It was the least we could do,” he said. Thankfully, they won.He also, a number of years ago, researched the people who came to Scunthorpe because of steel work. “Whether it was the Polish, the Ukrainians, the Irish, the Italians, the south-east Asian communities – they were all drawn here by the steelworks.”View image in fullscreenRoj Rahman, the co-owner of Scunthorpe’s football club, said people had come from all over the world to work at the steel plant.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianThey included his late father, who came to the UK from what is now Bangladesh and headed to Scunthorpe because of the steelworks. “He worked there 35 years and loved it.”Rahman, who owns Mortz Property Services, was speaking a few days after the Chinese owners ofBritish Steel, Jingye, said it was starting consultations on redundancies.It plans toclose two blast furnaces and steelmaking operationsin the town, putting at risk 2,700 jobs, as well as a large number of jobs in the supply chain.Jingye said the Scunthorpe site had run up losses of £700,000 a day. It is understood to have rejected a £500m state rescue package.There was a mix of anger, sorrow, fear and hands in the air in resignation in Scunthorpe when the Guardian visited on a sunny April day.For Rahman, the feeling was shock. “It’s unbelievable. Just the thought of it … it will cripple the town. It’s going to bring people to their knees. People are reliant on it to pay their mortgages, to pay their bills. Mums, dads, grandparents … it is going to have an impact on everybody in the town.”Since thenews brokethe town centre had been “shockingly quiet”, said Tracey Miller, the owner of theButton Box haberdashery.While attending a “knit and natter” session at Miller’s shop, Catherine Anderson recalled the sheer volume of workers at the steelworks in the 1960s. “I can remember there being nothing but bikes as they left work on the 6-2 shift … bikes and bikes and bikes. People went to work there and they got a job for life, full stop,” she said.Like many businesspeople Miller was concerned about the ripple effect closure will have on businesses like hers.View image in fullscreenTrefor Edwards says the town would survive without the steelworks.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian“Obviously a lot of the steelworkers wouldn’t come in here any way but it affects everyone, it affects families, extended families. My son works at the steelworks as well but on the rail side so we’re hoping he might be all right. But no, it’s not looking great.”Some people hope that a deal can be done but even then, said Rebekah Nunn, one of the younger knitters, “if it does survive, people aren’t going to think their jobs are safe. We have been here before.”That sentiment was echoed by a woman in a hurry who asked not to be named. “My ex-husband has worked at the steelworks all his life, 40 years, but all the time I’ve known him, it’s been closing.“It is terrible news though, it will be a big shock to a lot of people.”No one knows how things will develop. Jingye has said closure.Local councillors have backed calls to nationalise British Steel. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told the BBC he was “deeply committed” to finding a solution.It leaves a gnawing anxiety for the people of Scunthorpe.“It’s a worry for the whole town because it’s a loss of income for everyone,” said Sally Wright, the owner of a sandwich and catering company calledUpper Crust. “It’s not just 2,700 jobs at the steelworks it’s all the jobs which are tied in to the steelworks. Steel is everything to Scunthorpe, we’re known as a steel town. It is going to have a massive effect.”The town is already facing incredibly challenging trading conditions.

It is so many jobs, everything could go down hill very fast for businesses.”Claire Kilty, the owner of Kilty Cuts salon, was probably joking when asked about her steelworks closure plan. “We’re moving to Canada,” she said.She said business was tough already. “With the steelworks closing people are going to tighten their purses even more. We’ve had to put special offers on just to keep people coming in.”One steelworker, who asked not to be named, said he had received an email telling him he would be out of a job this year.“There are lots of conspiracy theories going round about who is to blame. Some think the Chinese have planned it all along,” he said. “The thing is there has been investment. We are not driving round clapped out shovels [that] break down every 10 minutes like we used to … there’s lots of new machinery.”Not everyone is full of gloom. Trefor Edwards, 71, of Broughton in northLincolnshire, spent 40 years at the steelworks, working in gas control. “It is time, I think. They’re finding new ways of doing things. If it goes they’ll sell off the land and do something else on it … Scunthorpe won’t die. It will recover,” he said.View image in fullscreenAnna Da Silva Tavares, a florist, says trading conditions in Scunthorpe are very tough.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianMany people expressed concern about the effect on young people but four teenage college students were clear: they never saw their future in steel anyway.“The steelworks is just not appealing,” said Eve Woods, 16. “Maybe 20, 30 years ago but not now. There are so many more options.”Joan Drury, 76, and Janet Lawson, 74, two straight-talking born and bred Scunthorpe pensioners, were having a sitdown and a smoke in the April sunshine. They were not optimistic about the town’s future.“The town is dead already so if the steelworks goes it will be a ghost town,” said Drury. “People won’t have the money, will they?”Lawson’s husband worked at the steelworks for 20 years. “He had a good job, he was a crane driver. But everyone knows someone who worked there or works there.“Without the steelworks, this town hasn’t got anything.”View image in fullscreenA ‘knit and natter’ session at the Button Box haberdashery owned by Tracey Miller, who said the town had been ‘shockingly quiet’ in recent days.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSteel industryBritish SteelLincolnshireEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It also asks: how much was Europe to blame – and is any nation immune from antisemitism?Rachel AroestiMon 7 Apr 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 17.02 EDTShareIt is 80 years since the liberation of Auschwitz. That means it won’t be long before all the people who lived through the Holocaust are gone. It is now left to those who weren’t there – such as the historianSimon Schama, born in London two weeks after the liberation – to ensure it is never forgotten or misremembered, and to preserve its lessons for future generations.But how to go about it? In his new show, one of Schama’s main methods is to unflinchingly relive the depravity. The Road to Auschwitz holds you in its grip and forces you to absorb the details. We hear of Jewish people being murdered using high-pressure water hoses. We see photographs of the cramped, repellent ghettoes, in which they were starved until they resembled walking skeletons as children froze to death in the streets. We see the piles of shrivelled corpses in Auschwitz. We hear that the slaughter was so prolific that the camp’s purpose-built crematoriums became clogged with fat; in Schama’s words, “the furnaces were gagging”. An inmate of Auschwitz – who buried his testimony in the ground before he perished – describes the burning of corpses: the skin blisters and bursts in seconds, the stomach explodes, blue flames come out from the eye sockets, the head burns longest.Told in this way, the Holocaust will never not be shocking to the point of utter incomprehensibility. But The Road to Auschwitz is also concerned with how the murder of Jewish people on an industrial scale was tolerated by Europe as a whole. This is not a journey back to the advent of antisemitism (that was a subject for Schama’s 2013 series, The Story of the Jews), although centuries of hatred obviously played a key role. Instead, Schama returns to the early years of the second world war.First, he visits Kaunas in Lithuania, occupied by Germany in 1941. There, a local rabbi was decapitated before Jews were killed in the town centre as their neighbours watched. A local film-maker has spent decades interviewing witnesses, including a man who remembers crying at the spectacle as a child – because he couldn’t get a clear view. In footage seemingly from the 1990s, a woman shows off her gold tooth, which was wrenched from the mouth of a Jewish person. She seems to be repressing a smile.Lithuania was a test case for the Nazis – it proved, we hear, that there was a voracious appetite for the murder of Jews. The allies knew what the Nazis were doing in eastern Europe, but believed it could never happen in “tolerant” Britain. This is one misapprehension that still needs to be corrected, and by examining how the Holocaust took hold in the Netherlands – which had hitherto been the safest place in Europe for Jews – Schama lands on an extremely effective way of doing so. Initially, the Dutch deplored German antisemitism, “doffing their hats” to those forced to wear yellow stars and putting them at the front of queues. They even staged a widespread strike against their persecution. In the end, it didn’t make any difference: the public became fearful of their new overlords and 75% of Dutch Jews were murdered. The moral is simple: no country is immune to the forces of fascism.Yet there are moments in this documentary when the very act of remembering the Holocaust feels hopelessly complicated. Schama’s decision to retell it via graphic depictions of the violence and horror does an important job: it ensures the Holocaust continues to rank as one of the very worst events in human history. However, the events in the Netherlands suggest the power of sympathy is negligible. Rather than naked fear or a vicarious sense of personal trauma, “pity is what others [who] aren’t Jews feel” about the Holocaust, says Schama, standing on the site of Auschwitz for the first time in his life. “Screw the pity.”What should go in its place is a question this programme doesn’t answer, unless you count a close synonym. Schama spends much of this documentary bumping up against the limits of language when attempting to articulate his response to the atrocity; “deeply distressing” is sometimes the best English can do. He gives the final word to the Holocaust survivor Marian Turski, who died in February this year. “Evil comes step by step,” says Turski. “And therefore you shouldn’t be indifferent. Let’s start with reducing hatred.” He reads from a poem: “The most important thing is compassion. Its absence dehumanises.” Pity, compassion, sympathy: they can’t fight fascism alone – but a world without them doesn’t bear thinking about.Simon Schama: The Road to Auschwitz aired on BBC Two and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSimon SchamareviewsShareReuse this content"

Gary Archer on crafting amazing gnashers for starsMon 7 Apr 2025 10.34 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 21.31 EDTShareAimee Lou Wood has been one of the standout stars of the third series of The White Lotus, stealing almost every scene with her character’s wild one-liners and wide-eyed obsession with astrology. Butthe Bafta winner from Stockporthas in recent weeks been getting as much attention for her teeth as for her winning turn in the hit show about a luxury resort. Vanity Fair and the New York Times have been notable fans of Wood’s natural look but there has also been a backlash, with beauty magazine Alluresaying that“fawning over a rejection of perfection is misplaced”.Gary Archer doesn’t know what the fuss is about. “They look all right to me,” he says of Wood’s teeth. He would know, because after working on 350 films and TV shows, plus 200 adverts, he is called the Godfather of FX Teeth in Hollywood and beyond. It was Archer who fashioned the unforgettable gnashers that Mike Myers sported in the Austin Powers films, a design that he feels actually led to the term “British teeth”.Julia Roberts was saying: ‘This is so disgusting. Can’t we stop?’ I was proud she was so horrified“I’m asked for them all the time,” he says. “Manky, twisted, rotten, stained or with a gap – not what most Americans think of as perfect and blinding white, essentially. But I call them ‘character teeth’, and that’s what I specialise in.”Born in Edgware, London, Archer was 11 when his mother died and his father, a noted dental technician, was intrigued when a cousin living in Los Angeles suggested they try their luck there. “For the first three or four years, I just wanted to go home,” says Archer, 60, who was the only British pupil at his new school. “I said I was mad keen on football, but then I was thrown this ball shaped like an egg. On seeing my reaction, the coach said, ‘Son, you’ve got some learnin’ to do.’”View image in fullscreenLed to the term ‘British teeth’ … Mike Myers in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.Photograph: New Line Cinema/AllstarArcher played soccer instead with kids from Central and South America, using “jumpers and coats for goalposts”. He also suffered the teeth-staining effects of an antibiotic called tetracycline and, when he later lost a tooth playing in goal, it prompted the filing down of part of his front row and their replacement with veneers and crowns.He was thinking about college and a career in IT when his father had a heart attack and asked him to help out at his AA Dental Labs, which did dentures, partials, crowns and other restorations. “When he came back to work, he asked whether I might want to be a dental technician, so I apprenticed.”View image in fullscreenBoxes containing actors’ dental moulds in Archer’s Hollywood workshop.Photograph: Gary ArcherIn the early 1990s, they got a call. “My dad said he was too busy and handed the phone to me.” The caller was a dentist who had the great makeup artist Greg Cannom in his chair. Cannom asked how he might get a set of teeth that would fall out during a restaurant scene in a forthcoming comedy he was working on called Mrs Doubtfire.They were able to oblige – and things snowballed. Archer gestures towards hundreds of small white boxes lining the walls of his workshop in Woodland Hills, north of Hollywood. They’re identical and unremarkable until you notice the names on each one – a who’s who of Hollywood stars: Kevin Bacon, Drew Barrymore, Adam Driver, Kathy Bates, Ralph Fiennes, Helen Mirren.View image in fullscreenGary Archer, right, with actor Glen Powell, creating dental prosthetics for the film Hit Man.Photograph: teeth_by_archer“Each box has the mould I made of their teeth,” says Archer, “plus their measurements and other data. I keep them because so many performers come back when they need character teeth for another role. I encourage them to keep the character teeth, because they’re specially made to fit them. No one else can ever use them.”In the last few years, improvements in special effects and the rise of CGI have changed some practices Archer and his late father used. “We might create a set of teeth, but paint them green with the colouring you’d put on a birthday cake. It then becomes a green screen in the mouth – and characteristics, words, gold and diamonds can be added in post-production.”Other improvements have meant that moulds can now set in the mouth in under a minute, the results lightweight but also rigid and tough. They have to be. “Actors can be very rough on them,” says Archer.Digital dentistry has also become something Archer uses more frequently. “We have a device that’s about the size of a wand, lined with tiny cameras. It can be run slowly along the teeth, creating a picture that we can then produce in a mould, or via a 3D printer. Then we just ship it off to the set or location. Sometimes I never even meet the person I create character teeth for.”We return to the subject of perfect teeth, in particularThe White Lotusand the fact that Aimee Lou Wood and her onscreen partner-in-crime Charlotte Le Bon have been lauded as “inspiring”, “charming” and even regarded as trend trailblazers just for having teeth that look, well, just like millions of other people’s.‘I don’t know whether I’d describe it as fun’: Aimee Lou Wood on the intensity of making The White LotusRead more“Dental care wasn’t great in Britain from the 1930s to the 1960s,” says Archer. “There had been wartime shortages, plus a lack of awareness about vitamins. And the newly formed NHS focused more on purely practical needs, less on how you looked. British people often didn’t seem so bothered about their teeth. It was the luck of the draw. But in booming postwar America, white teeth were a symbol of success, so the use of braces, crowns and bridges was more advanced, more commercialised, and more common.”He goes on: “In fact, to give Aimee Lou Wood a set of ‘perfect teeth’ would be really difficult – though I’d love to take it on, if she ever needed them for a role. From what I can tell, she has a slightly prominent lateral with a twist and rotation. So we would have to create veneers to go over that. Saying that, however, I think she looks lovely. She looks real.”Gary Archer’s top 10 teethCharlie EvansinLeave the World Behind“Archie, Charlie’s character, wakes up one morning and seems to be sick. He puts his fingers in his mouth and pulls out a loose tooth – then another and another. His mother, played by Julia Roberts, begs him to stop. I was on set for the shoot, with three sets of teeth for Charlie, who was being filmed from several angles. Julia was saying, ‘This is so disgusting! Can’t we stop?’ I was so proud that she and the crew were horrified by my work!”Jonah Hill in The Wolf of Wall Street“Jonah loved his teeth and he keeps them in a safe at his home. I’ve seen them in there!”Anthony Hopkins in Nixon“The eyes and teeth are the most distinctive parts of a face. You can really change someone’s appearance by changing them.

Robin came in for the fitting, the team liked what we did and word got around. Then everything changed.”Mike Myers in Austin Powers“Mike and I both loved talking about British humour.

Season four will have some redeeming to doStuart HeritageMon 7 Apr 2025 17.40 EDTShareWarning: this article contains spoilers for the finale of season three ofThe White Lotus. Do not read on unless you have seen episode eight, season three.Inthe Hollywood Reporter’s recent oral history, Mike White bristled at the thought of The White Lotus lapsing into a formula. For most of its third season, this didn’t make a lot of sense. After all, in its depiction of the obliviously wealthy, its whodunnit structure and its now mandatory transgressive sex scenes, a lot of this year’s season felt like The White Lotus by numbers.The finale went a little way to change things up, though. In the first two seasons, the long-promised deaths were both whoops-a-daisy accidents – in one, someone walked into the blade of a knife; in the other, Jennifer Coolidge fell off a boat – but this season ended in good old-fashioned murder. After last week assaulting the man he thought killed his father, Rick (Walton Goggins) was tracked by him back to the hotel. In retaliation, Rick shot him. Rick’s girlfriend, Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood), was caught in the crossfire of the ensuing shootout, and then Rick was shot by hotel security. Where The White Lotus was once led by farce, it now found itself being led by grim violence.It was at least in keeping with the episodes that preceded it. This year’s White Lotus was darker and slower than previous outings. Realistically, this was always going to be the grimmest ending to a season since the series began. However, it was also perhaps the least satisfying.Much as White might protest, there is a formula to The White Lotus. A death is always hinted at in the first episode, and the narrative is propelled by the discovery of what happened. And that means that, while all the headlines today will be about Rick and Chelsea, everything else that happened over the last couple of months ends up feeling like a red herring.This was especially true of the finale. So many promising storylines, simply by dint of the fact that they didn’t result in death, just dissolved. Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger) arguably had the most interesting plot of the show, as an obnoxious materialistic alpha-bro whose eyes were gradually opened to life’s deeper meanings through drugs, spirituality and (to some extent) incest – but essentially sat the episode out, his journey unresolved. The story White has described as a “blond blob” – about three women who bitch about each other a lot – ended with a nothingy monologue that came out of nowhere and relied entirely on the ability of Carrie Coon (as Laurie) to elevate weak material through sheer strength of will. Remember when Victoria (Parker Posey) blanked Kate (Leslie Bibb) in episode two? It was never mentioned again.Even the big deaths failed to stand up to much interrogation. The man Rick killed (who was his father, but everyone guessed that a month ago) was married to the owner of the hotel. And yet Rick returned to the hotel anyway, after invading his home and assaulting him. Why not immediately leave the country? Why not spend even a second acknowledging the danger he was now in? It was such a startling, lazy lapse in logic that it undermined the entire plot.View image in fullscreenCould Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), pictured here with Zion (Nicholas Duvernay), be the next big thing in a future series?Photograph: HBOThe White Lotus has always been a brilliant moment-to-moment show. And, in fairness, the finale did some terrific work building a sense of inescapable dread purely through cutaways. As the climax drew near, monkeys screamed. A hotel worker spraying some foliage became something out of Apocalypse Now. Somehow, a simple shot of the island panning into view became the most terrifying thing you have ever seen. But this all means much less when the show forgets how to hang itself together properly.But there’s always next time. The White Lotus has become a wildly important show for HBO, so more is certainly to come. And, if nothing else, White used this finale to plant the seeds of something that could end up being very special indeed. I’m talking, of course, about Belinda.In the first season, Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) was a hotel worker who found herself bonding with and then being screwed over by Tanya (Coolidge). This time she found herself becoming extraordinarily wealthy after meeting Coolidge’s ex-husband, and then screwed over Pornchai, her colleague turned love interest who wanted to start a business with her. The season ended with Belinda sailing away into the distance, her wildest dreams achieved at the cost of her humanity.Might Belinda turn up for season four, just as rich as patronising and oblivious as all the White Lotus guests she has spent years rolling her eyes at? If so, it would be a heel turn for the ages. At the very least, it would go some way to salvaging what has ended up being a frustratingly middling season of television.The White Lotus aired on Sky Atlantic and is available on NOWExplore more on these topicsThe White LotusTV reviewTelevisionJason IsaacsreviewsShareReuse this content"

If only. More like a quarter-witted, human tsunami. Keir Starmer andRachel Reevesmay still be unwilling to mention He Who Cannot Be Named. But this is no natural disaster. It’s one entirely created by the lunatic in the White House.World stock markets down by another 4% on Monday. A war zone. The chart looks like someone has been shot while holding the tracker. Buckle up for the next Great Depression, where the only winners are the traders betting on markets going still lower and the vultures trying to buy up bankrupt businesses. The one bright side? The UK is no longer top of the charts for the single most stupid decision made by a G7 country in the last 80 years. Drinks all round.Spare a thought for Keir. The man can’t buy a break at the moment. He’d never really had much of a plan other than to get Labour elected, and in the past eight months things have gone from bad to worse. He wants us all to feel good about NHS waiting lists and the minimum wage, but the reality is everyone feels more broke and less secure. Almost all of which – national insurance increases aside – has little to do with him.Right now, Starmer and the rest of the world are being played by The Donald and there is almost nothing he or they can do about it. To make himself feel better – more powerful – he pretends that his strategy of fawning to Trump has paid dividends. But there is no evidence to support this. In all likelihood we would be on a 10% tariff even if we had a trade deal with the US. That’s the way the Sunbed King rolls. Right now,the penguins of Heard Islandhave about as much clout as Keir.But a prime minister can’t be seen to be doing nothing. He has to remain upbeat. He can’t stand before the TV cameras and tell the country: “You know what? We’re in deep shit and I can’t see a way forward unless the tariffs are reversed.” He has to believe in some master plan. That a new industrial strategy can be plucked out of thin air, one that might mitigate Agent Orange. That some new global realignment can stave off a recession. He’s allowed to dream.So Keir and Rachel headed off to the Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands to try to sprinkle a little stardust on the economy. To generate some confidence that they themselves don’t feel. That no one does. That’s the problem. No one thought The Donald would actually do anything quite that dumb. Make his own country and the rest of the world substantially poorer.And Trump only did it because he could. There was no great economic rationale behind it. Just some fag-packet theory dreamed up by someone who didn’t even exist. Imagine. And now the Donald is in too deep. Way over his head. And he can’t back down because that would mean admitting he had made a mistake. So we all get to suffer. Not just mad, but dim. Threatening a further 50% tariff increase on China. Where does he think Americans buy their TVs from?Reeves got to go first. A speech so shouty that it hinted at panic. As if the only way she could get herself to believe it was if she yelled. Not that there was a lot to understand. Jaguar Land Rover was brilliant. People were worried. The global landscape had changed. Still no mention of He Who Cannot Be Named. Yet again, the impression being given that this was just some minor natural correction. Something that had been expected. We must change. She had no idea how.Over to Starmer. I’m not sure who wrote this speech. It can only have been a corrupted beta version of ChatGPT. No human could come up with this level of mindlessness. Keir was meant to be cheering up the JLR workforce. By the time he finished 10 minutes later, most would have been reaching for the Valium to fend off the PTSD. Convinced there was no point in going on.“These are challenging times,” Starmer began. “But we will back you.” How? By rising to the challenge. It was all vague platitudes. Sentences that made sense taken on their own, but collapsed into emptiness once heard consecutively. Semantic entropy. He had everyone’s back and was going to seize the possibilities. Once he had discovered what those possibilities were. He would get back to you on that.The future was in our hands. Just blatantly untrue. Whatever plan we came up with, the EU or the penguins could just as easily be derailed by the next Bonfire of the Insanities from the White House. But don’t mention the trade war. Pretend everything can be fixed. That we’re not in too deep. That the pain is temporary.More words. It takes a lot to make Reeves sound like a convincing orator, but Keir nailed it. Talking of the cars coming off the production line, he said we were watching British brilliance in the flesh. Er … they are metal. Soon we were playing Starmer bingo. Dad was a toolmaker. Then a list of some minor measures on easing minor targets for car emissions that were already being planned before the tariffs. Hooray! These were going to neutralise the 25% levy. Take that, Donald. It was like watching someone sinking beneath the waves.The questions were no more enlightening. Nor did the answers offer up much hope. The BBC pointed out there was no way of shielding the UK from the Trump effect. Keir looked startled. Someone had mentioned He Who Cannot Be Named. We have to step into that space with a driving sense of purpose, he said. Any idea what that means? Me neither. Nor was it entirely clear if he was planning on sticking to the government’s fiscal rules or not. I guess it doesn’t matter much either way any more.ITV went straight for the doomsday scenario. The markets were in freefall. This was Trump’s global crash. Why not at least regain some self-worth by not rewarding the maniac with a second state visit? Otherwise you were only encouraging him to do something even more daft. Not that he needed much encouragement. Starmer’s answer was A-grade waffle. Keep calm and carry on.

When I played it to the band, the look on their faces said, “We’re in trouble, boys”’Interviews byHenry YatesMon 7 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.44 EDTShareChristopher Neil, producer/writerI was a pop producer working with the likes of Sheena Easton and Dollar. Mike Rutherford was a prog rock musician withGenesis. But the band’s publishing company thought the two of us – the yin and yang – would do well together. And they were right. We hit it off immediately.Mike likes to have a cassette rolling all the time and put everything down there: not fully formed ideas, just little sketches, odds and sods. He gave me a tape that was full on both sides and said: “Pick out anything you like.” Ordinarily, I’m not sure I’d have had the patience. But I’d just done nine months in the studio with another artist and I was knackered and my management had sent me away to a health farm in rural Sussex to rest up. I was bored by the third day, so I forensically went through the cassette.Mike already had the “All I need is a miracle / All I need is you” section. I loved that. While I was meticulously going through the second side, I found what became the verse instrumentation and pre-chorus. I pretty much wrote the verses in the health farm, then came back to Mike and we welded it all together.In the lyric, the guy has been a twat to this girl and she’s said: “I’m off.” The minute she’s gone, he thinks: “What the fuck have I done?” He knows it’ll be a miracle if he gets her back. If you just read the song on paper, it’s incredibly sad. But you can write your own ending into it depending on your mood. If you’re driving along an open road on a sunny day, then it’s a happy song.In the Mechanics, we wrote the songs and chose the keys first, then auditioned singers based on what we had – which is a really weird way of doing it. We had both Paul Young [of Sad Café] and Paul Carrack singing on the first Mechanics album, and the songs chose them. Paul just sounded better on Miracle: he had a rockier voice. It was a big shock to us all when hedied suddenly of a heart attack [in 2000].The only time I’ve ever stood up in the control room and said to everybody, “This is a massive hit, trust me” was when we finished the mix on The Living Years, but we knew Miracle was a contender. Honestly, though, these things are in the lap of the gods. American radio got it straight away and it went Top 5. I remember getting into a taxi in New York just as it was coming on the radio. It sounded fantastic.Mike Rutherford, guitarist/writerMost musicians make solo albums because they’re frustrated in their main band. I think Genesis were uniquely different: we all loved being in the band but ran solo projects. There were loads of bits on the cassette I gave Chris – and they were pretty crap. But Chris has great ears. He can hear a few chords and go: “That’s worth looking at.”I’ve never written a song like Miracle since. I can’t think of any other song quite like it – it’s uplifting without being sugary, hopeful rather than smug. There’s a bit of sadness in there. But there are some clever key changes and it really lifts the audience.Phil Collins is an amazing drummer, but I wanted to try something different with the Mechanics. Drum machines were coming in, and I always liked programming stuff, so it felt natural to write the drum part on Simmons drum pads. Miracle has a great beat, an energy that carries it along.Chris rang me on a cold, wet November day, saying: “What about we record in Montserrat?” In those days, there were no mobile phones, so you went away for three weeks and there were no distractions, although later on the boys did start saying: “Will we be done by 4pm? Because the sunset catamaran is going out.”I’d sung on my previous solo album [1982’s Acting Very Strange] and I thought: “I’m never going to do that again.” When I played the band the demos on the first day with me singing, you could see their faces, like: “We’re in trouble here, boys.” I wanted the best voices to sing my songs – and that’s not me.It seemed so unlikely that another member of Genesis would have solo success: you already hadPeter Gabrieland Phil Collins. At the time, our manager wasn’t sure we’d even get a deal. But Miracle came out in America and just took off. There was a weird moment when, in the US Top 20, there was a Gabriel song, a Collins song, a Genesis song and a Mechanics song.I haven’t actually been in the situation described in All I Need Is a Miracle. But I remember, when my wife and I were just friends, she was about to get engaged to someone else. Genesis were going on tour in the US and I said: “Just come with us and let’s hang out.” We’re still together 48 years later.Mike and the Mechanicsare touring the UK until 14 April.

This is what they saidMadeleine AggelerMon 7 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 12.02 EDTShareFish oilis a perennial wellness topic, partly because there’s so much conflicting information.“People perceive fish oil to be a wonder supplement,” says Amelia Sherry, clinical nutrition coordinator at the Mount Sinai hospital.Fish oil supplements are high in omega-3s, essential fatty acids that our body does not produce on its own. These play an important role in cardiovascular health,brain function, eyesight and immune systems. As a result, fish oil supplements have beentoutedas a way of reducing the risk of heart attacks and inflammation, and improving cognitive function and skin health.This has made fish oil supplements a booming business. Omega-3 supplements are some of the most popular nutritional supplements in theUSandUK, andestimatesput the value of the global fish oil market around $3.1bn.Are whole-grain foods really healthier?Read moreBut the scientific data isn’t as emphatic. A2018 meta analysisfound that taking fish oil supplements “does not benefit heart health or reduce our risk of stroke or death by any cause”. Last year,a studyfound that fish oil may increase risk of heart conditions and stroke for those without cardiovascular disease. Also, a lot of fish oil supplements seem to berancid.We asked experts what to know about fish oil supplements.What are fish oil supplements?Fish oil for supplements is extracted from fatty fish such as mackerel, salmon, herring, sardines andanchovies.This oil is rich in two types of omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).“Aside from fish, seaweed and algae are the only other sources of these two types of omega-3s,” Sherry says.In supplement form, fish oil is often sold as soft gel capsules. However, what each supplement contains – say, how much EPA and DHA are in each pill – is not consistent. In the US, dietary supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, explains Dr Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic. (Supplementsare regulatedin the UK.)“You’ve got to turn the bottle around to look at the ingredient label,” Kopecky says. Companies, he warns, “can change their labels week to week”.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’What are the benefits of fish oil supplements?Experts say it is important to differentiate between the benefits of eating fish and the benefits of consuming fish oil supplements. Omega-3s in fish have been shown to help reduce inflammation and plaque formation, lower blood pressure and triglycerides – a type of fat in the blood – and stabilize and protect cell members in the heart and brain, says Sherry.But nutrition is complicated. Kopecky says it is unclear whether these benefits come from the omega-3s alone, or a combination of the fatty acids and the way the fish was caught, prepared and served. “There’s all these other factors,” he says.The current fish oil boom is partly attributable to a 1985paperin the New England Journal of Medicine, says Dr Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic.The paper found that “mortality from coronary heart disease was more than 50 percent lower among those who consumed at least 30g of fish per day than among those who do not eat fish”.Indeed, says Nissen, people who eat more fish tend to have better health outcomes. But it’s probably not just because they consume more omega-3s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the same time, she adds, “there has also been some research that shows no benefits and even some harm”. More study is needed on specific dosages and formulations, she says.If you do have high triglycerides or cardiovascular concerns, experts suggest you talk to a doctor before taking fish oil supplements. Prescription fish oil is available, says Sherry, and tends to be more regulated than over-the-counter supplements.What are the risks of fish oil supplements?Some studies have found that potent fish oil supplements can put people at higher risk of atrial fibrillation – an irregular heartbeat thatcan lead toblood clots, stroke and heart complications. One trial of 13,076 patientswas halted in 2020“based on evidence of a low chance of clinical benefit and a statistically significant increase in atrial fibrillation”.The one change that worked: I loathed all forms of exercise – until I moved to a big city and walked milesRead moreThere are less serious potential side effects as well, says Sherry, such as burping, heartburn and stomach upset.“The main side effect is they can burp a fishy taste,” says Kopecky.How can you get the benefits of fish oil without taking supplements?It’s quite simple: eat fish. “Eating more fatty fish in the place of proteins that are high in saturated fats would offer many more benefits than popping a fish oil supplement,” says Sherry.Kopecky says if someone doesn’t eat a varied and nutritious diet, supplements of any kind are unlikely to help them.The story of a fish oil supplements is “a microcosm of our world”, says Kopecky. “We find some food that’s beneficial for us, we say we know exactly what part is beneficial and we reduce it, desiccate it, put it in a pill, and sell it to you for 10 times as much money.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyFish oilFishHealthFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How do we know this?A new surveyfound that 10% of gen Z – a generation already renowned for their inability to interact normally – do not like being put in a position where they may have to say thanks.First of all,the peculiar foibles ofgen Zdo not necessarily reflect a wider cultural shift.Try telling them that – they won’t thank you for it.And second,10% isn’t a lot.Perhaps not, but nearly a fifth of those between the ages of 13 and 28 claim to feel uncomfortable saying thanks.That’s still not that many.In addition, 55% of those surveyed feel they are being thanked less often.Maybe they’re doing less to deserve it.The survey also found that Bristol, Manchester and Brighton are the most polite cities in the UK, where residents say thank you on average 15 times a day.There you are: thank you is still going strong.But the phrase “thank you” is by no means Britain’s most popular way to express gratitude.What is?“Cheers”, which migrated from pub use to more generic appreciation in the 1970s, is now the favourite, with 42% of people using it. Other options include “much appreciated” and “ta” or “ta la” (if you’re a scouser).Where did thisstrange survey come from?It was commissioned to generate publicity for The Big Nationwide Thank You campaign – where the building society is giving customers £50 each after taking over Virgin Money.Doesn’t that colour the findings?It’s a survey, not a scientific paper.It has got me thinking: why do we even say thank you in the first place?In Old English,the noun “thank” meant “thought”. To thank someone eventually came to mean to offer kind thoughts – or goodwill – in return for a favour granted.Interesting.Unlike the equivalent in some other languages, “thank you” expresses gratitude rather than indebtedness.So it basically means: praying hands emoji.More or less, yes.Cheers, mate.No problemo.Do say:“What do we say?”Don’t say:“You’re welcome, but to be honest I’d rather have £50.”Explore more on these topicsLanguagePass notesYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But which creature won?Mon 7 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.18 EDTShareIf you didn’t vote in the recent ballot, you missed out. Here was a vote where all 10 candidates were creative and morally upstanding, a vote unsullied by dubious lobbies, dodgy polls or demagogues. And if you’re seeking inspiration from a figure of strength who is also strangely cute then look no further than the winner of2025:Milnesium tardigradum, a microscopic multisegmented animal that resembles a piglet wrapped in an enormous duvet.Thousands of Guardian readers around the world voted in the contest, which we invented to celebrate the overlooked, unsung heroes of our planet.It is easy to remain indifferent to invertebrates. In cities or in the countryside, small, spineless things barely touch our lives. The animals we adore tend to have spines: birds that have adapted to living alongside us or mammals we’ve co-opted as pets or sources of protein.But we backboned beasts are a tiny minority, barely 5% of the planet’s species. Most life on Earth has chosen a spineless path, and they are animals of amazing diversity: beetles, bivalves, bees; corals, crabs, cephalopods; snails, spiders and sponges.Many of these animals perform vital functions for our habitable planet.Invertebratessupply the vast majority of pollination that enables us to grow food, and enjoy flowers. Invertebrates make soil, and keep it fertile. They clean water and tidy land, devouring poo or decomposing animals, repelling everything from bad smells to deadly diseases. Of course, some also spread diseases, and may swarm, pest or plague human life. But were invertebrates to completely disappear – and in human-dominated places, they are irrefutably disappearing – sapiens would swiftly follow.View image in fullscreenThe tongue-biting louse.Composite: Guardian Design/Getty Images/AlamySomehow, however, stressing their importance to human prosperity diminishes these animals. They are not simply dull little butlers dutifully scurrying in the service of their human masters. They are gloriously independent animals. They don’t need us half as much as we need them. They also embody ways of life that look extraordinarily exotic to our eyes.Among the 10 shortlisted animals – all nominated by the global community of Guardian readers – is thetongue-biting louse, a tiny crustacean that burrows into a fish’s gills and clings to its tongue, eating what the fish eats and sharing enough so the fish stays alive – for years. Then there’s thefen raft spider: it runs on land, walks on water and even dives beneath it in search of prey – small fish and dragonflies – larger than itself.The winner, one of the tardigrades, is particularly impressive.Milnesium tardigradumhas endured all five previous planetary extinction events. Given that, it was a doddle for some individuals to survive being chucked into outer space as an experiment. Its victory might show we are drawn to tiny but resilient animals in times of global political turmoil. When we feel small and powerless, the mighty, microscopic tardigrades give us hope.View image in fullscreenThe number of sustainable fen raft spider populations has increased from three to 12 in Britain, but they are still highly vulnerable to extinction.Composite: Guardian Design/Getty Images/Alamy/ShutterstockIn crude journalistic terms, all these invertebrates are great stories. For me and my colleagues, spending most of our days dutifully reporting more examples of how we are degrading and destroying life on Earth, the Invertebrate of the Year contest is light relief – for us and hopefully for you too.But something happens when we start sharing more of these spineless stories. Each animal challenges our anthropocentric worldview. We realise our own lifestyles are just as weird as thewētāpunga, a giant flightless, jumpless grasshopper. Perhaps we reflect on the value of diverse thinking within our own species too.And most of all, we start to notice small things around us. What is that fly rubbing its body with his forearms on my windowsill thinking? Why is that ant in such a hurry? We begin to take an interest in the doings of our neighbours.View image in fullscreenThe wētāpunga’s unconventional beauty is celebrated in its name, which means ‘god of ugly things’.Composite: Guardian Design/Getty Images/iStockPhoto/AlamyThe great American biologist EO Wilson predicted that human life would not long survive the demise of the invertebrates. But he also devised a plangent term for this epoch from ancient Greek: the Eremocene, a new, isolated place. Our era is not just the human-dominated Anthropocene; it is an age of loneliness.When I glanced around me the other day on a bustling London railway platform, I could not see another friend or neighbour. There was no trace of any other animal, plant or fungus. Just us. We are a gregarious species and we are becoming solitary, and we barely realise this is breaking our hearts.Top genome scientists to map DNA sequence of invertebrate winner 2025Read moreSo the Invertebrate of the Year contest helps us seek connection with friendly neighbours, who live so differently from us but who thrive all the same.Compiling the shortlist of 10, I came to see them as global celebrities. Then I popped into my ordinary suburban garden for a break in the sunshine. Idly staring into space, I spotted a little flying narwhal. She was humming like a bee, cute and fluffy like a bee but was actually a dark-edged bee-fly – one of our shortlist. Her long, stiff proboscis was like a narwhal’s tusk. As she flew, she dropped eggs on to the grass – near unseen nests of solitary bees so her babies could eat the bees’ offspring. Gruesome, perhaps, but one small sign of a healthy ecosystem – pollinators, predators and parasites, all fitting together.Now it is us who don’t fit. Noticing invertebrates is one small step in recognising that we are not alone, and we share our planet with a wondrous multitude of life and must do better to live gently alongside them.Patrick Barkham writes for the Guardian on natural historyExplore more on these topicsInvertebratesOpinionAnimalscommentShareReuse this content"

But there is a precedent for the US causing short-term chaos and reaping long-term gainMon 7 Apr 2025 11.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.33 EDTShareIt’s less than a week since Donald Trump’s sensational announcement that he was unilaterally ending the world’s trading system with the imposition of a 10% minimum tariff for trading with the US – and a very much higher rate for those countries unfortunate enough to have the US as a major export partner. Long-term allies suchas JapanandSouth Koreahave been hammered with tariffs of around 25%, while export-dependent poorer countries such as Vietnam, which sells about a third of its exports to the US, have been hit withtariffs in excess of 45%. A further round of global debt crises is possible as heavily indebted countries face the sudden loss of export earnings.Globalstock markets have tumbledas panicked investors dump shares, and political condemnation has been near-universal. China has alreadyretaliated with 34% tariffs, threatening an escalating trade war. Right now, it looks and feels like disastrous overreach by a uniquely erratic administration at the behest of a president with a terrifyingly limited grasp of how the modern economy works.Trump has talked about imposing tariffs on the world since he first rose to prominence in the 1980s, when his target was Japan. In a political career notable for its jack-knifes in policy and direction, tariffs – “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” – have been a constant. But this is about far more than his long-cherished whims. However inconsistent or even confused Trump may sometimes appear to be, those around him have a clear-eyed view of what they want to achieve.Corporate America won’t stop Trump’s tariffs. Here’s why | Alex Bronzini-VenderRead moreHis Treasury secretary, hedgefund billionaire Scott Bessent, has spoken of a “global economic reordering” that he intends to shape to the benefit of the US’s elite. Trump’s new chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, wrote alengthy paper, A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, shortly before his appointment. The latter is particularly ambitious – detailing how the US should use not only tariffs but also the threat of withdrawing its security support to compel its friends and allies to accept cuts in payments due from the Federal Reserve on their US Treasury bills. This would be a potentially massive loss to them, akin, in reality, to a US debt default. But it is tariffs that are the cutting edge of the plan – leveraging the US’s power as the world’s largest consumer and greatest debtor to compel other countries into a negotiation on terms.After decades winning in an international trading game it wrote and refereed the rules for, the US is now facing serious competition – primarily fromChina, but with Europe as an expensive irritant. The response of this administration is to kick over the table, and demand everyone starts again. What it ultimately wants is a cheaper dollar to revive US manufacturing and Chinese competition held off, all the while keeping the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the rest of the world will pay the price.There are precedents. In October 1979, Paul Volcker, newly appointed as chair of the Federal Reserve,drove up interest ratesto a remarkable 13% in a bid to tackle inflation, later raising them to 17%. Soon the US was in recession. Millions lost their jobs over the next two years, notably in manufacturing, where soaring interest rates had driven up the value of the dollar, making US exports less affordable on the world market. After a light easing of interest rate hell by the Fed, Volcker applied a second dose of the medicine, driving interest rates up to 19% and forcing the economy back into a double-dip recession. Unemployment peaked at around 10% in late 1982.View image in fullscreenRonald Reagan and Paul Volcker in the Oval Office at the White House, Washington DC, July 1981.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveBut by mid-1983, inflation had come down to 2.5%. For the rest of the 1980s, the US economy boomed. The “Volcker shock” appeared to have worked. Volcker is today a folk hero among central bankers: Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve during the 2008 crisis, praised Volcker’s “independence” and willingness to brazen out the political storm.More decisive than lower inflation, however, was the reshaping of theUS economyVolcker’s interest-rate shock accelerated: with manufacturing in freefall, investment flooded into finance and property, firing up what became the great credit bubble of the 1990s and 2000s. The world economy was reordered around a US that acted as a giant sink for its output – swallowing exports from the rest of the world on seemingly limitless borrowing. China’s extraordinary boom was the flipside of US debt and deindustrialisation. The Volcker shock, more than any other single action, created the globalised world system that Trump is now bent on destroying.Few would have bet on Volcker’s world-shaping capacity at the time. The stock market response to the shock was immediate and unanimous. US shares plunged by a record 8% in the two days after his announcement.The S&P 500 lost 27% of its value before August 1982 – two years of grinding decline. Manufacturers and unions hated it, understandably: they were on the wrong side of an epochal reconfiguration of US capitalism. But they were not the only losers: rising interest rates in the US meant less developed countries had to spend more onservicing debts, just as recession squeezed their major export markets. The result was the so-called “third world” debt crisis, as heavily indebted countries across the global south plunged into spirals of economic decline and soaring indebtedness.Over the weekend, Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick were doing the media rounds, insisting that therewould be no climbdownon the tariffs. Trump is not for turning on what is clearly for him a personal crusade. Already, countries such as Vietnam are promising to cut all their tariffs on US goods – a clear and brutal demonstration of the US’s continuing economic power. The administration hasclaimed 50 other countrieshave also asked to open negotiations. By the end of the week, expect Trump to be triumphantly announcing more such concessions from economies in the global south. His real target – China – will be a far tougher nut to crack, if it breaks at all.Perhaps the rolling market chaos will become too much. Perhaps the administration will blink first. There is no guarantee this extraordinary gamble will work, not even for those in the clique around Trump. But it would be a mistake to assume it cannot work – and however the pieces now land, they will not return to their old places.James Meadway is the host of the podcast MacrodoseExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionTrump administrationTariffsChinaUS politicsUS economyAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

This must never happen again | Jagan ChapagainRead moreGraphic images. Distressing footage. Blurred-out posts that only clicking a consent button will reveal. For a year and a half now, disclaimers have hung over what the world sees from Gaza. Sometimes, the scenes stop me in my tracks as they are suddenly recalled, like a nightmare forgotten but then vividly remembered. Except without the relief that it was all a dream. Last week, I watched footage that showed what appeared to be the shattered, headless corpse of a baby. I have seen shredded body partscollected in plastic bags. Heard the screams of the dying and the silence of the dead, as cameras capture them piled together, some inentire families. Israel’s assault on Gaza defies inurement. As time goes by, even as the threshold for what is seen as intolerable increases, the graphic and varied forms of killing continue to scale the hurdle of numbness.All the while, politics does one of two things. Either it smoothes over this historic calamity, resorting to the bland language of encouragements to return to the negotiating table, as if it were all some regrettable falling-out that could be resolved if only heads cooled a little, or the calamity is reversed. Calling for it to stop, rather than being the most natural of human instincts, is now an impulse that in some countries meets the bar ofarrest or removal. This narrative renders the people of Gaza, so ever-present on our screens and timelines in their daily massacre, distant and remote. Gaza has been deported to another dimension in which no rules apply. Geographically it has been sealed off and wrenched away from the Earth. Foreign journalists and politicians are not allowed in.Local journalists are killed. Foreign aid is blocked. Localrelief workers are murdered. International courts and human rights organisations speak with one voice about the criminality of what is occurring. They are summarily ignored or attacked by Israel’s sponsors.And still, despite efforts to block outsiders and silence those inside, the evidence of the illegality and disproportionality of Israel’s campaign in Gaza continues to mount. Last month, the Israel Defense Forceskilled Red Crescent workersand buried them along with their vehicles.Footage recoveredfrom a mobile phone shows that Israel’s claim that the team’s activities were suspicious was false. The worker who filmed the video was found with a bullet to the head. Before he died, he asked his mother for forgiveness for his death, for the fact that he chose such a dangerous occupation. How many such crimes, committed and buried under cover of Gaza’s darkness, without footage to contradict Israel’s claims, have taken place?It may seem as if Israel has managed to act as judge, jury and executioner and is succeeding, with US and western sponsorship, in carving Palestinians out from the rest of humanity. But it is a task now that requires coercion. The war escalates and frustrates any justification, so it must be normalised by force. And that force might be suppressive in the short term, but it is degrading in the long. It requires resources and confrontations and volatility. Intargeting studentswho speak out against what is taking place in Gaza, the US government has gone to war with its own universities, and triggered conflict within them. By moving to deport students and academics, the Trump administration has become embroiled in a tussle with its own legal system. Germany’s efforts to deport those involved in pro-Gaza protests extendalarming authoritarianism further. The mobilising of the machinery of state is necessary because alarm at the scale of the crisis in Gaza can no longer be shushed with castigation alone.And that mobilisation and associated conflict only serve to highlight further what Israel has dragged the rest of the world into. It only makes high-profile figures of protesters, such as Columbia University graduate and green-card holder Mahmoud Khalil, who through his lawyer has beendictating devastating dispatcheson what his detention reveals about the war and about the US immigration and justice system. It tightens the connections with Palestinians that their opponents would like to sever. And by raising the stakes of protest, it makes clear how much those stakes are indeed everyone’s – the right to free speech and due process, to protection from state overreach, and to practise the very basics of humanity. The demand is that to be safe from persecution, you must pluck out your eyes. Instead of ejecting Gaza from domestic politics, Israel’s allies have brought the war home.Combine that with the death and starvation that continues to intensify in Gaza, and you have a recipe not for a cowing, but an increase in the appetite for moral pressure and witnessing. With political abdication, the sort of urgent condemnation and raising of the alarm that should come from leaders has not been extinguished, but passed on. Last week alone, atrauma surgeon’s video diaryand interview on BBC Newsnight revealed even more killing of innocents, even more children waking up paralysed, or with a bellyful of shrapnel and calling for their mothers. In London,a protest stopped traffic. In Washington DC, at another protest, a banner bearing thenames of the dead was unfurled. At Columbia University in New York, Jewishstudents chained themselvesto the gates in protest against the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention of their fellows. The account of the Red Crescent killings was passed on from corpse, to UN official, to media outlets. A shadow government of accountability, made up of people long divested from trust or hope in political establishments, is being cobbled together. The opposite of fatigue, something to be reasonably expected after a year and a half, has set in.It may seem like life goes on, as does the war on Gaza. It may seem like a defeat has come to pass, withIsraeland its allies staring down the public and the entire global order to force through the war. And Donald Trump’s presidency has flooded the zone with multiple shocks, from the economic to the political. But it is a restive, turbulent status quo, because what is happening to many is simply unbearable, and if protest and testimony and confrontation might save even one life or bring forward the end of the war by even one minute, it will continue.Every corpse, every city pulverised into rubble, every bloodied child exists not in a hopeless land far away, but within people’s human hinterland. Because it is impossible for a world to be shown the daily ravaging of a people and become intimidated or exhausted into habituation. Some may choose to ignore it, or justify it, or even support it, but they can never normalise it.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Does 10% capture it? Or 12%, which was roughly the S&P 500 index’s three-day decline by the time the London market closed on Monday? Or 15%? How about 20%? More? A lot more?Duringthree straight days of heavy falls in the share prices everywhere, a striking feature has been the absence of wise old market heads popping up to argue that the panic is perhaps a little overdone and fair value is emerging. Instead, the collective mood is stuck in bewildered mode for understandable reasons.Bill Ackman urges Trump to pause ‘economic nuclear war on every country’Read moreFirst, Donald Trump shows no sign of softening his language, which would be the first step towards softening his policy on tariffs. Rather,his weekend comments– “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something” – were intransigent. Unlike others in the US administration, he didn’t choose to emphasise that the tariffs are the opening shot in a negotiation. He simply said the nasty-tasting stuff must be swallowed.It remains hard to believe he won’t change tone if the damage to American’s 401(k) savings plans becomes substantially more severe, but one cannot be certain. For the time being, and despite the blizzard of research reports being produced by City and Wall Street analysts, the market has zero insight into whether the average US tariff rate on imports will stand at 24%-ish, which is what a full dose of Trump’s medicine would mean, or whether the practical level will be meaningfully lower.Second, corporate America, a constituency even Trump can’t ignore entirely, hasn’t found its voice. Bill Ackman opined that Trump’s action could lead to an “economic nuclear winter”, and he may be correct. But he’s a hedge fund billionaire and one doubts he has cut through outside Wall Street. It would be a different matter if famous bosses of Apple or Nike were warning US consumers in stark terms that they would pay more for their iPhones and trainers, especially if they added that they won’t be reshoring many jobs because it still doesn’t make competitive sense to make the products in the US. But we’ve heard no plain speaking in that style.Jamie Dimon, the chair and chief executive of JP Morgan, has argued that the tariffswill “likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession”, but it was measured stuff. For the most part, US bosses look terrified of being labelled unpatriotic.Third, investors’ usual source of solace during market crises is the thought that the US Federal Reserve will save the day by cutting interest rates. On this occasion, the Fed is constrained if the first effect of tariffs is higher US inflation. Slower economic growth, which could justify cheaper money, only arrives over months. The Fed surely has to wait for evidence.Fourth, share prices were probably too high in the first place. At the start of this year, the US stock market was priced at roughly 23 times expected earnings, a rich valuation by traditional yardsticks thanks to hype around artificial intelligence and a naive faith that Trump’s rhetoric on tariffs was nine-tenths for show. So stock market investors are grappling with two valuation problems: first, the possibility of lower earnings if companies have to absorb some of the inflation by taking a hit in their profit margins; second, the worry that the base position was already too high. Amid the drama, note, the S&P 500 is still only about 4% below its level 12 months ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Quite. The fact the policy has been justified on the basis ofabsurdly simplistic calculationsmakes it even more damaging.Investors are clearly also primed to react to anything that sounds like a softer stance from the White House – witness the brief rally on Monday on rumours (quickly denied) that a 90-day pause was on the cards. But, until something substantive arrives, the market is trading on guesswork. Another week of Trump intransigence could make the sell-off uglier yet.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsNils Pratley on financeTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationJamie DimoncommentShareReuse this content"

This is no time for him to get bored and move onMon 7 Apr 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 21.31 EDTShareWhen the first season of The White Lotus arrived, it took a while to notice how dazzlingly political it was. The director, Mike White, has since congratulated himself about that little hook at the start: before we know anything, we know that someone is going to die. He has said thathe wishes he had started all his shows that way. It is so simple yet so effective. You meander into it thinking it is a whodunnit, with a side order of who-did-it-get-done-to? Then there are some beautiful beaches, and there is some astronomical wealth. By necessity, there are some characters who are not wealthy, since who else is going to fetch the drinks?It is not until around the seventh minute that it becomes obvious how catastrophically unhappy all the characters are, how horrible they are to one another, how disappointing and thin their existences. It had started off looking like wealth porn – the term affixed, post-Big Little Liesin 2017, to any show that was mainly about rich-people-problems and their gigantic kitchens. (In the US, with their peculiar coyness around saying “wealth” like it was a bad thing, they always called it “lifestyle porn”.)But the first season of White Lotus emphatically wasn’t that. This wasn’t a cute reversal of expectation – “Hey, who’d have thought, even rich people get unhappy?” It was a wealth dystopia. Their money had made them coarse, stripped out their empathy, destroyed their human connections. The obsequious valet class stood in for all of us, trying to anticipate the needs of the wealthy while simultaneously despising them, unable to act on any destiny but theirs.It was not the first show to make that point, of course.Successionlanded in 2018, three years before, and there were films afterwards that pushed the greed-is-the-root-of-all-evil point harder.Glass Onionhad a billionaire setting fire to the Mona Lisa, which stood in for the entire richness of human history and culture – these supervillains are coming after your stuff and they won’t stop until they have destroyed it.The Menu, if anything, made the point even more urgently: these plutocrats have to be stopped – they are going to take everything and just eat it. InThe Triangle of Sadness, the delusions of the super-wealthy are revealed in a storm at sea: they think they are superhuman, but they are not even as good as one regular human.Three years ago, culture seemed to be saying what modern democratic politics struggled to articulate – that concentrations of wealth weren’t modern and neutral, they were existentially perilous to civilisation – and it was a story as old as time.Then came White Lotus, season two: White said afterwards that if the first season had been all about money, the second was all about sex, and if I had read that, I might not have watched it. I wouldn’t have been happy surrendering to the idea that rich people have more interesting sex than everyone else. Happily, it didn’t require such a roll-over. It was still about money, insofar as it was still set in one of the most expensive hotels on Earth, following rich people going around, being rich. And that did impact their gender relations and power dynamics, in ways that did debase their human connections, so it still functioned pretty well as Marxist propaganda.As season three draws to a close, the message hasn’t cohered in the same way; there is a lot more melodrama in their personal struggles, patricide in their pasts, suicidal ideation in their future. Wealth is no longer their unspoken truth, their lodestar; it is more of a quest – how to get wealth, how to keep it, how to hide it, how to use it. It feels a lot more like early 21st-century wealth porn, in other words. My sister disagrees with this, incidentally – she thinks the (spoiler alert!) incest subplot is a metaphor for the intrafamilial transfer of wealth, the way it’s hoarded. She thinks the nepo-baby casting of Patrick Schwarzenegger as the main carrier of this message is its subtle reinforcement. Fine; if she is right, then this is economic critique. But I think White simply got bored of his powerful eat-the-rich message and moved on to new pastures, which is what creative people do – they’re mercurial. The rest of us, however, must be more workmanlike and remain on point; in the arc of human history, this is exactly the wrong time to get bored of having a problem with rich people.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s why it is time to embrace the French exitMon 7 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.44 EDTShareTurns out it’s not onlyintricate dancesand lip-syncing – there is common sense on TikTok, too. An idea circulating there is that a new wedding rule should be introduced, stipulating that guests must not say goodbye to the happy couple, but should just leave. That way, the newly spliced spouses are allowed to enjoy the most expensive party they will ever throw, rather than being persistently interrupted and pulled off the dancefloor.While your kneejerk reaction may be that this is rude, ungrateful ghosting on the most special day of their lives, stop for a moment and think about it rationally – and mathematically. A wedding reception can easily have 150 guests, some of whom will be in couples. Even if they’re bored witless, social convention dictates that people usually stay until the last, say, two hours of the night, which means one or two goodbyes a minute. So, in fact, the couple won’t be repeatedly pulled off the dancefloor, because they won’t have enough time to get back on it after the previous guests bid them adieu.Of all the wedding presents you could give, quietly slipping out of the reception is probably the one that would be most appreciated. Most weddings are already an endurance test of the same conversations ad nauseam – everyone tells you that the service was beautiful, you look lovely and they are so happy for you. These may seem like sentiments it’s impossible to tire of hearing; this is not the case.The French exit should not only become the norm for weddings – it should be rolled out for all gatherings. If you left a concert early to beat the rush, you wouldn’t stop Taylor Swift in the middle of Shake It Off to thank her for a lovely evening, would you?There is never any need to say goodbye – especially in Britain, where the rules of small talk dictate that you reply: “You off then?” when someone announces their departure, even though that is what they just said. A message to the host the next day happily suffices; it will probably mean more, as any big do at which you are the focus is a blur anyway. No need to say goodbye at the end of that, either.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsWeddingsOpinionSocial etiquettecommentShareReuse this content"

What’s not to like?Mon 7 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.19 EDTShareAdispatch from the menus of the capital’s fancier pubs, Instagram restaurants and wine bars: there’s a new favourite dish in town. Though maybe “new” is the wrong word. Cropping up in the types of establishments where you’ll easily pay a fiver for olives is the humble but universally beloved cheese toastie.I’d call it a renaissance, but that would ignore the fact that the toastie is and has been for decades a staple of busy lunches, sick days and CBA dinners, when all you’re after is instant satisfaction. Let’s say instead, then, that the cheese toastie has had a bit of a culinary glow-up.I’ve seen them recently on lots of different menus acrossLondon. Bar Levan in Peckham lists a croque monsieur, while the Library, a swish cocktail bar in Maida Vale, promises a straight-up toastie dripping with strong cheese, plus tart chutney served on the side for dipping.Elsewhere, Farringdon’s Quality Wines – whose head chef, Nick Bramham, is something of a trendsetter across the capital when it comes to sharing menus – has also had a croque monsieur on the pass (replete with provolone, Brie de Meaux, Prince de Paris ham and truffles), while the Knave of Clubs in Shoreditch has devoted a whole section of its menu to toasties. Marceline in Canary Wharf recently held a croque monsieur competition, where chefs competed to have their sandwich crowned top of the croques.If you ask me, this is all excellent news, first because who has ever refused hot molten cheese between slices of crisp bread after one to three drinks? Second, the sudden prevalence of the toastie in restaurants signals a sea change among the attitudes of people designing more “upmarket” menus.Where once it felt like these were lists of dishes detailing what chefs thought the rest of usshouldwant to eat – plates of meats with uncommon provenances (sorry to say, these tend to pretty much taste like premium supermarket salami), or patés en croûte that take dozens of steps to create – now it’s more like they’re catering to what the majority of people actuallywant.Cheesetoasties and croque monsieurs represent accessible, widely enjoyed flavours, and while I’d agree with the purists who say the two are not the same, the comfort-food sentiments they convey are inarguably pretty similar.Either way, it’s reasonable to ask: why the change in outlook on small plates menus? As with most things concerning food and lifestyle trends, we can probably look to social media. While quality ingredients are as important as ever, the ability to grab attention now plays a huge part in the success of a dish, particularly in the Instagram economy, where a great photo can cause a viral sensation. TheXXL three-cheese toastieat the Wigmore in central London, for example, has been a staple on the menu for years, foreshadowing the 2025 trend, largely because it looks so impressive.Not all of the toasties I’m thinking of here are extra-extra-large, but they do appeal to people’s sense of novelty and nostalgia – both of which hit hard on social media. Dishes like cheese toasties stand out on a posh menu precisely because they typically feel so ordinary – and in recent times, everything from Viennetta to bread and butter pudding has been given the restaurant treatment.Chefs and potential customers scrolling through the algorithm get excited by new twists on familiar dishes, or the opportunity to make or try an “ultimate” version of a classic: look at Quality Wines’ superlative version of the croque, for example. As such, the cheese toastie boom feels like a symptom of that impulse – a bit like an updated version of the gourmet burger boom of the early 2000s.Ultimately, cheese toasties popping up on the menus of wine bars and posh pubs is a positive thing. This is a hearty, filling dish, which, let’s be honest, feels like better value for money than a plate of fancy charcuterie. Plus, it also seems to signal movement in the small plates world. Of course, where a bougie wine bar is found, a devilled egg won’t be far behind, but these places are now beginning to serve a few more dishes that cater to the appetites that see us craving kebabs and chips after a night of drinking.

While I am there, crossing busy roads, wearing tidy clothes and carrying out my duty, I think of faraway places where life is getting on without me.Logrunners are turning leaf litter on the rainforest floor, albatross are cruising the wind beyond sight of the coast. Why does thinking about these creatures, who have no idea that I exist, bring me such comfort?Because they are free, because they are beautiful, and because of their utter indifference to me.1:06Last chance: the extinction crisis this election is ignoring (series trailer) – videoI was in a pub in Newcastle a few weeks ago chatting to a stranger with a lot going on. He runs a business selling household appliances, employs dozens of people, is negotiating a divorce and paying a mortgage. He seemed sceptical about what people tell him about climate change. Given how much else he has to think about, that didn’t surprise me. I asked him, if he was free next week to do anything he wanted, what would he do? He said he would bundle his kids into a van and drive to Seal Rocks to go camping.If you’re not familiar with it, Seal Rocks is among the most beautiful places anywhere on theNew South Walescoast. I’d love to be there next week myself.People seek and find freedom in wild places. There is toil in the rest of the natural world and there are dependants to care for, as there are in civilisation, but there is also a sense of boundlessness.This feeling catches me up and I get carried away. I want to cruise in the great ocean currents like a tuna. I want to gather grass and spider silk and nest in the shrubs with the wrens. I suspect the tug of freedom is what takes some people out on hunting trips, and some to earn their living as jackaroos or prawners.Get Guardian Australia environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as an emailThen there is the beauty. Survival is necessary but being gorgeous, creative and excessive has played as important a role in evolution as survival skills. This has filled the world with the resplendent detail of iridescent insects, curly liverworts, currawong song and the synchronised courtship flight-dance of terns.And it is not just living creatures making this beauty. Rays of sunlight bend through a running creek and make bright moving patterns of line and form on its bedrock. All beings have the urge to expression, even including non-living beings: rivers have it, waves have it, the wind. The wind heaps sand in rhythmic curls in the desert.The freedom and beauty of nature guide my sense of right and wrong. If I am to be free, I must care for the freedom of other earthlings.

A friend and I once sat by a creek in a rainforest. A rose robin flew down to drink beside us, unaware we were there. The marvellous world is turning without me and my own life is as dear, marvellous, fleeting and irrelevant as a rose robin’s. What lightness!People talk about cosmic vertigo but how about the giddiness of knowing that the ancestors of the lyrebird you’re listening to have been living in the forests of this continent for 15m years, since there were still trees in Antarctica?We’re living in a thin film of biosphere that is creating its own atmosphere, recycling its own wastes, cleaning its own water, producing and metabolising in complex self-organising systems that we are too small and silly to understand.When we talk about “protecting nature” it makes sense at a certain scale but it is quaintly hubristic. Nature is not all lovely creatures and majestic landscapes. It is mutating viruses, poleward-creeping cyclones and vengeful orcas. Just who needs looking after from whom?Australia is in an extinction crisis – why isn’t it an issue at this election?Read moreNow that greenhouse pollution and the global environmental cataclysms of the last hundred years have broken long-familiar patterns of living within the biosphere, nature will reclaim its place as a terrifying quasi-divine force that cannot be mastered. This, too, is strangely comforting.I often feel overwhelmed with sadness to be living in a culture that doesn’t seem to value all of this but I know that I am not alone in loving the living world.The Biodiversity Council of Australia takes the trouble to ask people how they feel about nature, why and how it is important to them. The overwhelming majority of people feel as I do: that they are part of nature (69%); that being in nature helps them deal with everyday stress (79%); that it is important to them to know that nature is being looked after (88%). The vast majority want more to be done to protect it (96%). The wayAustralian politicstreats “the environment” – either as a decorative irrelevance or as an insidious threat to our prosperity – doesn’t reflect the way the people feel about it.Love and affinity for nature cuts across political, social and economic divisions. Of course, if you ask someone to choose between their own livelihood and the livelihood of a greater glider or a Maugean skate, they’re likely to choose their own – even more so for the non-specific thing they call “net zero”. But why should anyone be asked to make that kind of awful choice?Nature shows me that we don’t have to choose between beauty and freedom on the one hand, and good living on the other. Australians’ desire to be part of and safeguard the living world is a good start but we’re going to lose so much of it unless we take some responsibility for what we’re doing.Georgina Woods is a poet, environmentalist and head of research and investigations at Lock the GateExplore more on these topicsWildlifeLast chanceConservationAustralian politicsClimate crisisTrees and forestsBirdsPlantscommentShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump’s imposition of swingeing US tariffs has unleashed mayhem on stock markets across the world, upending assumptions governing the world trade order sinceBretton Woods. As Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury,saidat the weekend: “Globalisation as we’ve known it for the last couple of decades has come to an end.”What that means for the Labour government he serves and for Britain is both fraught with consequence and, to a significant degree, beyond Whitehall’s control. Second-guessing Mr Trump’s ultimate intentions – and the political and economic risks that he is willing to take, as consumerssufferthe consequences of a trade war – is a futile exercise. But as the White House seeks to bully, intimidate and coerce its way to a new settlement between the US and the rest of the world, the risk of aglobal recessionis clear.What Sir Keir Starmer described on Monday as a “new era” will require strategic boldness from an habitually cautious prime minister. Sir Keirshould, for example, now go further and faster to reset relations with the EU, the UK’s biggest trading partner by far. That may involve an uneasy balancing act if EU countries decide to retaliate against Mr Trump, as the government seeks atrade dealwith the White House and related tariff mitigation. But the alternative is unsplendid and impotent isolation, and a future “special relationship” with the US that approximates ever more closely to vassal status.Domestically, a reset is also required.Speakingin the West Midlands, Sir Keir announced modest measures to assist the UK car industry, hammered by 25% tariffs on exports at a time when it is also dealing with the pressures of the green transition. The prime minister described this as a “downpayment” on future support. But supply-side plans to relax electric vehicle targets for manufacturers send the wrong environmental message, when what is needed are radical measures to turbocharge consumer demand.The problem, paradoxically for a prime minister who defines himself as a pragmatist, is ideology. As the UK faces potentially huge economic headwinds, Labour’s industrial strategy will need to be bigger, more interventionist and less constrained by the redundant economic orthodoxies to which it continues to pay obeisance. Aspirations to drive significant growth through a combination of budgetary conservatism andderegulationwere already lookingdoomedprior to Mr Trump’s act of sabotage last week. Following “liberation day”, Sir Keir’s ongoing insistence that the government will stubbornly persist with its fiscal rules begins to look like an act of national self-harm.Mr Blair’s old message on globalisation, addressed to post-industrial regions suffering the effects of unleashed market forces, used to be to adapt or face the consequences. As Mr Trump gambles on the fate of the world economy, making up the rules as he goes along,Labourwill need to do precisely that, and at pace.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The increased entitlement to free places, which was announced by the last government and is being rolled out gradually, is hugely welcome.Bridget Phillipson’s decisionto prioritise new nurseries in the north and Midlands in the first round of funding was a good one.High-quality preschool settings are a crucial foundation for future learning. They are particularly important at a time ofrising concernabout young children’s development – with growing numbers arriving in reception classes unable to feed themselves or go to the toilet. Currently, early learning opportunities are not evenly or fairly distributed – partly because providers rely on income from fees as well as public funding. The 4,000 new state nursery places that are due to come on stream by September should provide a boost to preschoolers in poorer parts of the country.Nearly all nurseries are safe. Many are excellent. Overall,97% were judged either good or outstandingunder the old Ofsted system – which will soon be replaced with new report cards. As well as benefits to children, free places offer parents, and especially mothers, the chance to combine paid employment with caring duties – lifting their incomes. This is why investment in early years education has long been regarded as afeminist issue.But as in health and children’s social care settings, concerns about safety must be taken seriously. An ongoing investigation by Stockport council into the circumstances surrounding thedeath of Genevieve Meehan, who was nine months old when she was killed at Tiny Toes nursery in 2022, should provide vital information. It is disturbing that the nursery, at the time of her death, had a good Ofsted rating. The sharp rise in the number of safety reports to Ofsted,uncovered by the BBC, requires a response from ministers. Claims that some nurseries cheat inspectors, for example by requiring sick staff to come in, need to be looked at carefully.Ms Phillipson is right to champion investment in the early years and remind voters about theSure Startprogramme built up by a previous Labour government before being dismantled under the Tories. At the same time, the government must be clear with the public about the situation it inherited, in which the three largest providers – with around 70,000 nursery places between them – are businesses, and that the chain that expanded most last year, Kids Planet, is funded byprivate equity. In the same period, the two largest voluntary-sector groups shrank, while the number of childminders (mostly self-employed women) also fell.Affordable early years education is a social good. So is a commitment to rising standards. Currently, nurseries are inspected less often than schools (every six years instead of four), which is both wrong – given their importance and small children’s vulnerability – and in keeping with the sector’s lowly, overlooked status. Recent changes to staffing ratios haveworsened the situationin some places. Particularly when they are new and settling in, babies and toddlers need attention.It is hard to raise the quality of early years education while keeping it affordable. But this is what needs to happen. Ms Phillipson’s new nurseries are a promising start, but there is much more to do.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In fact, I am expecting nothing other than what I did from its predecessors, ie a complete refusal to condemn these most atrocious and clear examples of war crimes and genocidal actions, and also of the denial of our right to peaceful protest. I don’t expect much different from our European neighbours, and as for the US, well…I appreciate the Guardian giving a platform to those like Nesrine Malik who give voice to our bewilderment, grief and frustration (Politicians want to normalise what’s happening in Gaza. Our moral outrage won’t let that happen, 7 April). But what I don’t see anywhere is anyone trying to answer the question: why? Why does Israel have to be supported no matter how reprehensible its actions? Why are Palestinians different from Ukrainians in deserving to live in peace in their land?There is a moral vacuum at the heart of western politics, that much is certain. Even the expressions of sadness regarding suffering in Ukraine ring hollow. The pain and human rights of “little people” clearly do not matter to our leaders. So what is it that does? Who is going to break the silence on what has happened to shared values and common humanity?Abi Lupton-LevyHebden Bridge, West YorkshireYour editorial (3 April) on the massacre of rescuers and healthcare workers in Gaza approvingly quotes David Lammy’s response to this latest atrocity, commending his call for those responsible to be held accountable.But Mr Lammy should also be held accountable for doing nothing other than wring his hands yet again at this latest atrocity. What could he and his government do? They could call in the Israeli ambassador to condemn this outrage; suspend their trade agreement withIsraeland ongoing negotiations on a deeper free trade agreement; ban the import of goods from settlements, as called for by more than 20 NGOs; recognise a Palestinian state now; and end all arms sales to Israel.I have been a longstanding and active member of the Labour party, but can no longer be an accomplice to its complicity in the war in Gaza. Like many others, I have resigned my membership.Tony WhitstonTorpoint, CornwallYou have given a detailed and horrifying account of the Israeli massacre of eight Palestinian paramedics (Report, 5 April). The Israel Defense Forces claimed that the ambulances were carrying terrorists, which has been refuted by the Red Crescent. It said the paramedics were providing humanitarian services. This is only the latest in a string of atrocities carried out by the IDF.Alongside that report, there is another about bombing in the Gaza Strip, where at least 1,250 Palestinians have been killed since 18 March (Israel restarts ground operations in northern Gaza Strip in renewed campaign, 4 April). The international criminal courtlast year issued arrest warrantsfor Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant for war crimes, yet the UK government continues to sell arms to Israel. This means that it is complicit in war crimes. All arms shipments should be stopped immediately.Rae StreetLittleborough, Greater ManchesterI suggest kicking Israel out of the UN, whose organs and dignitaries it has mocked and whose resolutions it has ignored. Of course, that wouldn’t stop Israel committing massacres, but at least the international community could be a little proud of itself for having tried. One day, it might even realise that no longer arming the pariah state would have been even better for global peace and security.Elizabeth MorleyTrisant,CeredigionWe need more voices like that of Jagan Chapagain (Our aid workers were brutally killed and thrown into a mass grave in Gaza. This must never happen again, 5 April). It is the only way we will get through this horror, which every day brings more pain – not just in areas that are constantly in the headlines but in places like Sudan that are also struggling but get much less attention. His balanced view, his clarity – outlining the basic principles of humanity – must ring out not just in the UN but across the media, our government and in schools.His rage, though tired, his ability to keep the line, and his wisdom, is what we so lack at the moment – not just in our leaders but also in those who either vehemently condone and blame, or support their policies of action or inaction. We have to be brave enough to stop hating, and wise enough to know that with violence and oppression, more will follow, as history shows. Most important, we need to say: “Enough. Stop the killing of civilians, among whom are humanitarian aid workers and tens of thousands of children. We are better than this.Thank you, Jagan Chapagain, for your clear, powerful voice and wisdom.Elena IsayevLondonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

PlusMike Leonardon how the future homes standard should ensure low-carbon constructionMon 7 Apr 2025 12.32 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 12.34 EDTShareCraig Bennett of the Wildlife Trusts highlighted some issues with the way UK housebuilders are delivering (or not delivering) housing (UK housebuilders ‘very bad’ at building houses, says wildlife charity CEO, 1 April). But should we be lumping every housebuilder together?In December, theFederation of Master Builders reportedthat small housebuilders deliver only 10% of new homes today, compared with 40% in the 1980s. This diminished contribution has been called out by the housing minister, Matthew Pennycook, as a top priority for Homes England to address. Competition and innovation beget sustainability, affordability and quality in housing delivery. As someone who has made the jump from a larger housebuilder to a smaller one, I have seen this firsthand.Small and medium-sized enterprises like Greencore Homes are finding new ways to deliver housing that performs better in terms of biodiversity, nature and wildlife preservation, among other environmental measures. It is this diversification of the market and competition that pushes everyone towards better performance, and ultimately better results for the UK.At Greencore, it saw us continue to refine our product until we could ensure that each home achieved better-than-zeroembodied carbonin its structure, ultra-low embodied carbon overall and a net zero energy balance in occupation (meaning that each home generates at least as much energy as it needs from solar panels on the roof and therefore it will export at least as much energy to the grid as it draws out).Imagine the impact of more smaller housebuilders having the space to push the boundaries of what’s possible.Jon Di StefanoCEO, Greencore HomesHousebuilders are failing to supply much-needed new homes – but the reasons for this are complex. Larger home builders do speculate on land to build on at a future date, as this is part of their business model. However, the primary reason for the very low number of house builds is affordability, particularly for first-time buyers. This is causing an ever-deepening housing emergency and stopping the delivery of the inclusive economic growth the country is depending on.At Birmingham City University, our Centre for Future Homes is working with social and private home builders to research and facilitate a smooth transition to thefuture homes standard, which the government is legally obliged to bring in this year. We fully support the Wildlife Trusts in encouraging all new developments to protect and invest in natural habitats, and would ask them to challenge the current trend to build timber-frame homes that rely on mass deforestation in other parts of the world.Mike LeonardVisiting professor, Centre for Future Homes, Birmingham City UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He had watched his team go 1-0, 3-1 and 4-3 down, the game heading into extra time before Antonio Rüdiger’s goal after midnight finally gave them a 4-4 draw, allowing them to scrape through 5-4 on aggregate. But still he said no.“Because,” he reasoned, “anything can happen here.” And that, you couldn’t help wondering, may be precisely the problem. One day,anythingwould not happen, and then what?Valencia end years of misery at Real Madrid to extend Corberán’s revival | Sid LoweRead moreThe pity for Arsenal may be that Madrid found that out three days later, tangible warning arrivingin time for their visit to London. It’s one thing to say it, another to actually experience it, to be faced with your own flaws, your own vulnerabilities when you felt invincible.No one has made the ridiculous as routine as have Madrid, the implausible happening so often it feels inevitable. Destiny, fate, fortune … whatever you call it, whichever theory you favour or conspiracy you subscribe to in explaining the endless comebacks, there was a certain logic there, too: they have the players, the talent. Everyone knows that; so do they, which may not always help, willing them on to take risks, to play the odds, which one day become too great even for them.On Saturday afternoon, Valencia went 1-0 up at the Santiago Bernabéu. Four minutes into the second half Vinícius Júnior equalised and, although it lacked the drama or noise of a European night, Madrid began to tighten the screw. The minutes went by, the final whistle coming closer, which only made the comeback feel more inevitable, until in the 95 minute the winner arrived. Only this timeit came at the other endand may have cost Madrid the title, Hugo Duro’s header leaving them four points behind Barcelona with eight games to go.This was Madrid’s fifth league defeat. Ancelotti was entitled to say that it was not the same as the others. Vinícius missed a penalty, although that is a problem in itself when they have missed five of 16 this season. Giorgi Mamardashvili, the Valencia goalkeeper, made six saves, one from Fede Valverde especially impressive. Kylian Mbappé did everything but score, including hitting a post. The xG was 3.16‑0.46. Valencia had three efforts on target and two went in. “Teams score against us with not very much,” Ancelotti complained. In seven days Madrid had conceded eight at the Bernabéu, against Leganés, Real Sociedad and Valencia.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé, pictured at the Emirates Stadium, did everything but score against Valencia.Photograph: Vince Mignott/EPAThe good news for Madrid is that of the four defenders and goalkeeper who started against Real Sociedad, conceding four, only one will likely be there against Arsenal; the same is true of the five that began against Valencia, although Ferland Mendy’s absence creates doubts at left-back and Aurélien Tchouameni, entrusted with protecting that defence when he doesn’t play in it, is suspended. The bad news is that this goes deeper – in their two games against Barcelona, they have conceded nine – and there was little sympathy.If perhaps they hadn’t deserved defeat on Saturday, they had those other times. Keep tossing a coin, it won’t always come up heads. Madrid had played with fire that often, one day they were going to get burned; eventually they would run out of time. In the cup, they had needed extra time to defeat Celta Vigo and a last-minute goal from a youth-teamer, Gonzalo García, making his debut to knock out Leganés before the comeback against Real Sociedad.In the Champions League, they had defeated Atlético Madrid on penaltiesin surreal circumstances. They finished the league phase 11th: outplayed and deservedly beaten by Liverpool and Milan, they had been 2-0 down at half-time against Dortmund, scored two second-half goals to edge Atalanta and beat Stuttgart despite being second best.At the Bernabéu it had all started to wear a bit thin, too: the epic comebacks that excite everyone, that make matches all the more memorable, also revealed flaws, a lack of care. However fun it is, it shouldn’t always be this way. The fact that it felt almost willing, as if they needed to feel the jeopardy before they started playing, made it worse; even during the comeback against Real Sociedad, there were whistles, a growing irritation that it had to be this way, a kind of: “Oh, sonowyou run?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That night, Ancelotti had pulled Vinícius aside and threatened to take him off. Asked about it he didn’t deny it; instead he said, yes, and then the Brazilian started running. In extra time, Vinícius was extraordinary; for most of the 90 minutes he hadn’t been.Get Real: serial Champions League winners Madrid face fresh threat | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThat Madrid’s problems, despite Ancelotti’s insistence to the contrary, can feel like an attitude thing invites the assumption that they are easily resolved: theChampions Leagueis different. On Saturday, for many supporters, there was almost a weird satisfaction in the players finally getting whattheydeserved, lesson delivered in time.How easily it can be applied is another matter. At what point can you no longer just flick that switch? Beneath that surface analysis, beyond the injuries and the fatigue which are undeniably there, beyond the lack of someone who can run the midfield, there’s also something systemic and even more simple: Madrid really haven’t been very good this season, and still less of late. Try to think of a genuinely impressive performance and onlythe Manchester City tiecomes to mind. But then that’s Manchester City.“Now the season starts for real,” Ancelotti said that night. It hasn’t really, and yet Madrid are still there, time still on their side, the treble still possible, as they set off to London. If they do lose there, well, there’s always the old Bernabéu comeback routine to repeat.Explore more on these topicsReal MadridChampions LeagueArsenalEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eddie Howe’s side jumped to fifth in the Premier League to intensify their push for the Champions League after dismantling a sorry Leicester City, a club with a decision to make.Newcastle’s business was in effect complete after 34 minutes, courtesy of two goals by Jacob Murphy and one from Harvey Barnes. For Leicester, it is now a record eight home defeats in a row without scoring and 15 losses in their past 16 matches. Such damning statistics do not bode well for Ruud van Nistelrooy.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreAfterwards the noises from Van Nistelrooy were ominous. Asked whether he had the fight to continue, the Dutchman said: “It’s important to analyse this and sleep on it and recover.” Asked if he was committed to the job for the season, he replied: “The most important thing is the club and these players, that’s what I would say for now.” He repeated his previous answer when pushed whether he would carry on.As Newcastle’s supporters sang of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Leicester fans faced up to the reality of trips to Preston and Portsmouth. “Say hello to Sunderland,” came the call. They have known for a while. Judging by the swathes of empty seats, many locals voted with their feet. Others have long since checked out. Leicester could be relegated as early as Easter Sunday. Until the second half fizzled out, it felt plausible that Newcastle could chalk up their biggest win, eclipsing an8-0 victory over Sheffield Unitedat Bramall Lane 18 months ago.It has been a fine few weeks for Howe and Newcastle, backing up their first major trophy in 70 years with successive league victories. “It was a big question mark: how do we react to the big high that we had?” Howe said. “The players have responded magnificently. It is a real tick in the box for our psychology.”The Newcastle manager said another reset is required, with three games in six days from Sunday, the first at home to Manchester United. “We need to keep that fine balance between confidence and needing to improve, because there are areas that haven’t been perfect. We need to look to continue to grow.”Undoubtedly the most enjoyable moment from a Leicester perspective was the arrival of the sought-after 15-year-old Jeremy Monga, who juggles school with first-team training. The youngster, wearing the No 93, entered for his debut in the 74th minute wearing a shirt without a sponsor owing to Leicester’s partnership with BC Game, a betting company. The other highlight was the opportunity to relive better days by singing Barnes’s name after he made it game, set and match.Leicester’s “Foxes never quit” motto was again under the microscope early on. Last Wednesday it wasJack Grealish after 70 secondsand this time Leicester’s defence held out a bit longer, with Murphy scoring his first goal with 115 seconds played. Jamie Vardy had prompted Nick Pope into action inside 11 seconds but from there it was a matter of how many Newcastle would finish up with.View image in fullscreenLeicester’s demoralised players head back to the centre circle.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesNewcastle mauled Leicester in midfield. The visitors profited to score their first; Bruno Guimarães was too strong for Wilfred Ndidi, Joelinton kept Boubakary Soumaré at arm’s length and Barnes spied Tino Livramento on the overlap. Livramento sent the ball towards the back post and Murphy side-footed in. For the 26th time in 31 league matches, Leicester had conceded the first goal.Leicester were so brittle it seemed Newcastle could score with every attack. The second goal, on 11 minutes, stemmed from Fabian Schär cracking the crossbar with a shot from inside his own half. Schär’s effort cannoned towards Murphy, who could afford a rusty first touch. The ball bobbled off his left knee but he soon found the net. “[It] only took me about seven touches to get it under and stick it in,” Murphy said. He could afford to smile.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Leicester? Not so much. “You’re not fit to wear the shirt,” came the chant from the increasingly apathetic home support. Bilal El Khannouss tested Pope from a tight angle after a rare attack but Newcastle responded by adding a third. Barnes started and finished the move, dribbling across the pitch with conviction. Joelinton took over the baton and then chopped inside Wout Faes before forcing Mads Hermansen into a save. Barnes was alive in the box to dispatch the rebound.Leicester adopted damage-limitation mode at the Etihad Stadium but here Van Nistelrooy’s half-time changes at least appeared positive, with Facundo Buonanotte and Stephy Mavididi introduced. Newcastle grew a little lax – as if they had privately declared – but Leicester could not punish them. Faes flashed a header wide in stoppage time but it was another unhappy ending.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeicester CityNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Robert MacIntyre’s love for Oban, shinty and all associated is endearing. He has also proved that he is perfectly comfortable in the company of golf’s aristocracy.MacIntyre missed the module where sportspeople are advised not to speak about lifetime aspirations. Mention the Masters to the Scot and he lights up. Absence makes the heart grow fonder; after impressing at Augusta National in 2021 and 2022, he failed to qualify for the next two stagings. MacIntyre returns for the 89th edition as the 17th-ranked player in the world.“A Green Jacket,” MacIntyre says. “Imagine taking a Green Jacket back to Glencruitten … boy, it would get ripped off me I think. I am a big dreamer. I see things and believe in them. I just want a chance … I picture the 18th hole, standing on that tee and what I would do. I still don’t know what I would do. It would be nerve‑racking but that is why you build a team around you.Jordan Spieth: ‘I feel more comfortable at the Open and the Masters’Read more“That’s why I have one of the best caddies in the world to help me. I would be shaking like I have never shook before on that tee but it is your job, go and execute it. I just want to have that shot.”MacIntyre has cause to think big. The Scottish Open was a lifetime goal; one he realised bywinning in East Lothian last July. The previous month,he had become the Canadian Open championwith his father on the bag. In his own words, it was the stuff of “absolute fairytale”. Storied, magical moments seem to attach themselves to the 28‑year‑old. He is well within his rights to contemplate Masters glory. The first major of the year, after all, has a tendency to favour left-handed golfers.“It is my favourite place in the world to play in a golf tournament,” MacIntyre says. “It is where I want to be, it is something I want to win. It is not just playing in it, it is trying to win the tournament. I have played well to get there; you have to be in it to win it. I am looking forward to it, I cannot wait to be back out there competing. It is a special place, a kid’s dream.“Every time I pitch up there, it has been a dream and I try to enjoy that. When you are not at something so special, you are disappointed, but that just made me work harder. I watched almost every shot. Even if I am not playing golf I will watch it.”View image in fullscreenA young MacIntyre competing in the Jacques Léglise Trophy in Harlech, Wales, in 2013.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/R&A/Getty ImagesShinty, though, is his first love. MacIntyre played in goals for Oban Celtic during a pre-season fixture – he reckons that is marginally safer than an outfield role – and was on FaceTime with squad members immediately before his third round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He adores the sport and the environment keeps him grounded. “I go in there with a lot of young guys, a lot of my mates, and they just treat me as Bob,” he says. “If I wasn’t playing this game, I would be on the tools with my mates. Simple as that.”Scratch deeper into MacIntyre’s backstory and you will find no silver spoon. Indeed, he was absent from many of the leading amateur events that elite golfers participate in before turning professional.“I didn’t play because I couldn’t afford it,” MacIntyre says. “I played in the odd Lytham Trophy and maybe two British Amateurs but I couldn’t afford to go to others. I remember the year Bradley Neil won the British Amateur [in 2014 at Royal Portrush], I won the Sir Henry Cooper. I could have got into the British Amateur but I was going to the Henry Cooper with ScottishGolfbecause they were paying for it. I had two older sisters, mum and dad were working regular jobs, so I couldn’t fly to Ireland and spend three or four grand on a week when we were just trying to get by. It was just about finances.“I think that makes me fight harder. I am just from a regular background, I have been given an opportunity by my parents and others around me … I am determined to make the most of it. I have fought for everything. Playing shinty was the same, it was about fighting. It doesn’t need to be pretty, it can sometimes be an absolute dogfight and that’s when I do my best.”Against this backdrop, it feels even more impressive that MacIntyre has adapted so well to golf’s prime events. His home base remains Oban, not Florida. “Winning on thePGA Tourmakes you believe. I know Canada didn’t have the strongest of fields but I am still being chased down by Rory McIlroy at the end. The Scottish Open had a strong field. I am a big believer that on my day I can compete with the best of them. When you are in the top 20 in the world, that is how you have to think every week.“It is not so much performing, it is about the standards you set yourself. Since Mike [Burrow] has been on the bag, my standards of practice, preparation, eating have been raised. This is my job, man, I have to give it my absolute best.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Drones on golf courses have caused irritation. But MacIntyre is self‑deprecating. Perhaps that, and a refusal to seek publicity, is why he has not really received the sporting prominence he deserves in the UK.The Ryder Cup is understandably on his radar. He formed part of thewinning team in Romelast time. “That is exactly the same as the Masters. You taste it once and you want it for ever. I know that if I play well, I will be there. That is in my hands.”MacIntyre arrived in Georgia having undertaken a “boot camp” at Isleworth in Florida. He did likewise before the Arnold Palmer Invitational and Players Championship, where he posted high finishes. This time, green speeds and pin positions were set up to mirror what MacIntyre will encounter at Augusta.“It was a massive benefit,” MacIntyre says of the first trip. “That was the first time I have done it, as a team we decided to give it a try and I didn’t know how it was going to work. I had everyone out there with me; a proper, proper camp over four days. I pitched up at Bay Hill on the Monday and was knackered. That is when you taper off because you have prepared as hard as you can.“It worked brilliantly. You know where you are with your short game. Otherwise it would be two weeks off back in Oban, chipping on to greens that are six on the Stimpmeter. I enjoy that, it is part of my life, but to prepare to compete against the best players on the planet, that is not working.”Lofty targets, perfectly happy in his own skin and playing well. MacIntyre’s Masters chance is a live one. “I want to prove to myself and other people that I belong at the top end of golf,” he insists. “OK, where I come from and how I have gone about it might be different but there is more ways than one to skin a cat. You have got to shoot for the stars.” It feels impossible not to root for him.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersPGA TourGolfUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But that did not stop Rob Key, director of men’s cricket,openly ponderinga move to split the white‑ball roles and see if Stokes could combine the 50-over job with his Test duties.County cricket day four: Essex v Surrey, Middlesex v Lancashire – liveRead moreIn the end, mindful that Stokes is on thecomeback trail from hamstring surgery, and about to start an Ashes year that will define his Test captaincy, Key offered both the Twenty20 and one‑day international jobs to Brook.It hands the 26‑year‑old the chance to lead England during the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka next year, plus its 50-over equivalent in Africa in 2027.“It’s a real honour to be named England’s white-ball captain,” Brook said.“Ever since I was a kid playing cricket at Burley in Wharfedale, I dreamed of representing Yorkshire, playing for England, and maybe one day leading the team. To now be given that chance means a great deal to me. I’m excited to get going and give it everything I’ve got.”It will likely be required, with Brook’s status as an all-format international meaning a significant workload lies ahead. This summer, for example, features six Tests and 12 white-ball fixtures at home, plus a short T20 tour of Ireland in late September. Given his centrality to the Test side, fears about overloading Brook are understandable, not least given tours of New Zealand, Australia and the subcontinent next winter.Key said: “[Brook] has been part of our succession planning for some time, albeit this opportunity has come slightly earlier than expected. Harry is not only an outstanding cricketer, but also has an excellent cricketing brain and a clear vision for both teams that will help drive us towards winning more series and major global tournaments.”England’s view is that the physical strain is far less for specialist batters and, while he may in time miss the odd white-ball series to rest, there are enough breaks in the schedule to make it manageable. It may be that Brook is now rarely seen in domestic cricket, however, having already withdrawn from the Indian Premier League this year.That decision also means April and May are clear next year, with players who pull out from the IPL for reasons other than injury suspended from two editions of the tournament. Brook notably cited the need to prioritise England when he gave up his £590,000 deal with Delhi Capitals: a call to rest that perhaps reflected his expected promotion and, more broadly, the financial security of his top-tier central contract.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was also previously captain of England Under‑19s, even if he was suspended for the final match of the Under-19s World Cup in 2018 foroff-field disciplinary reasons.There was, though, an encouraging spell in charge of England’s ODI team last summer when Buttler was injured: a3-2 series defeat against Australiain which Brook averaged 78 with the bat.Ultimately, with all England men’s teams coached by Brendon McCullum since the start of the year, there is a belief that Brook’s naturally aggressive outlook makes him a good fit. In time, he may well be seen as successor to Stokes in the Test setup.Ollie Pope is the Test vice-captain but ended the 2-1 win in New Zealand last December with his position in doubt after playing as a stand-in wicketkeeper and Jacob Bethell impressing in his preferred No 3 spot.Selection for the one-off Test against Zimbabwe in late May could yet hinge on the IPL, however, with Bethell unlikely to be back should his Royal Challengers Bangalore side reach the playoffs.Explore more on these topicsHarry BrookEngland cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Delap previously made two top-flight substitute appearances for the champions.City hold a £40m buy-back option for Delap but do not currently plan to use this. While the fee for the player is set to be £40m or a little more, United may face competition, with Chelsea reportedly also interested. Ipswich are 12 points from safety with seven games left so are likely to be relegated. If so, this will increase Delap’s availability.United’s other potential centre-forward targets are thought to include Napoli’s Victor Osimhen.Meanwhile, André Onana has shrugged off criticism from United fans over his slow distribution by stating he takes that approach to assist his teammates.The goalkeeper has been the subject of supporter discontent for sometimes lingering over the ball rather than executing a quick pass but he said: “It doesn’t affect me because the decision I make is to help the team. Sometimes I will make the right decision, sometimes I will make the wrong decision. When I feel my players need to rest I have to take my time; when I feel we need to speed up the game I will do it.”View image in fullscreenAndré Onana has been criticised for playing too slowly at times and admits there is extra pressure at Old Trafford.Photograph: Nigel French/Allstar Picture Library Ltd/SportsphotoOnana referenced thegoalless derby draw with Cityat Old Trafford on Sunday, pointing to how Pep Guardiola’s team dominated the ball. “Sometimes, [as] in the second half with an opponent that has a lot of control – they have more possession than us – I have to let my guys breathe.

The strategy was introduced by South Africa in awarmup match against New Zealandbefore the 2023 World Cup, and they have used it on a number of occasions since.Stuck paratrooper prevents play before Sale slump to Toulouse defeatRead moreThe Scotland head coach, Gregor Townsend, expressed concerns at a World Rugby “Shape of the Game” conference during the Six Nations and also stated his views afterhis side’s win against Wales. “I don’t think the bench was set up to suddenly have a new forward pack coming on,” he said. “But that’s for World Rugby to decide what you do with the bench, and to make any changes. But just now you can put eight forwards on the bench if you want.“Where do we think the game might end up? Is it going to be more a game where we need forwards in a 6-2 or 7-1? Or is it a game where we need backs because it’s going to be so open that we’ve got to make sure we’re bringing backs off the bench?”Townsend is not blessed with power forwards in the same way France or South Africa are but after Ireland’s Dublin defeat byLes Bleus, the former second-row Donncha O’Callaghan described it as a “defining day for rugby”.The World Rugby chairman, Brett Robinson, acknowledged that 7-1 splits raise questions over the spirit of the game but, having made it a priority to increase fatigue in the sport, the governing body does not see a scientific issue with teams loading their benches with forwards.World Rugby’s chief executive, Alan Gilpin, said: “We looked at it from a science, medicine perspective. Was there a distinctive view that a bunch of fresh players coming on with 20‑30 minutes to go is going to create a more injurious position, and the science said that’s not the case. So there was no reason from that perspective to look at how we might do replacements differently. Ultimately, there are a lot of different ways to win a rugby match.”The World Rugby council, meanwhile, will vote next month on whether to introduce permanently into law 20‑minute red cards. There were four such red cards shown during the Six Nations this year – to Romain Ntamack, Ross Vintcent, Giacomo Nicotera, and Garry Ringrose in the first half ofIreland’s win against Wales. He was replaced early in the second half by Bundee Aki who excelled as his side came from behind to clinch victory in Cardiff.In the final round, France’s Peato Mauvaka was shown a yellow card and allowed to return to the field after appearing to launch himself head-first at Scotland’s Ben White.He was citedand banned for three matches, raising questions as to why he was not shown a straight red card. The incident was sent for review via the bunker referral system, but the only option for upgrade at that point would have been to a 20-minute red, which is not meant to apply to deliberate acts after play has stopped, and which in any case was not applied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve taken decision-making away from referees.”There was no little irony to the fact that Ireland and France have been the two most vocal opponents of 20‑minute red cards and both appeared to profit during the Six Nations. If the vote passes, 20‑minute red cards will be introduced to the Premiership and theWomen’s World Cupthis year.Gilpin said: “There’s a lot of evidence to support that it’s keeping the contest alive, which is obviously important to us. There are definitely those in the game who are against it and believe that 20-minute red cards mean there will not be any old‑fashioned red cards and therefore they’re against the proposal, and there are a lot of people supportive of it.”Explore more on these topicsWorld RugbyRugby unionSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The case has been adjourned.Evanilson doubles up as Bournemouth rescue draw against West HamRead moreOwing to the lawyers’ other commitments, it is understood the hearing will not resume until June, leaving Paquetá in limbo. The Brazilian withdrew from World Cup qualifiers against Argentina and Colombia last month so he could take part in the hearing but has made himself available for West Ham and played all of their Premier League games againstWolvesandBournemouthlast week.West Ham are backing Paquetá and are unhappy with the FA’s handling of the most high-profile corruption case in English football since Bruce Grobbelaar was acquitted of conspiring to fix five Premier League games in a criminal trial 27 years ago. The club had asked the FA to put back Paquetá’s hearing until the summer to avoid disrupting their season.West Ham sources have expressed frustration that Paquetá has experienced the worst of both worlds, with a hearing that began on 17 March not concluding until the summer. There could be a further delay if Paquetá is found guilty and a separate hearing is required to determine the punishment.The case could overshadow another summer transfer window for West Ham. Manchester City hadagreed to pay £80m for Paquetá in August 2023but pulled out after it emerged the FA was investigating suspicious betting patterns surrounding four bookings he had received in the preceding nine months.Paquetá was charged with four counts of spot-fixing and two of obstructing an FA investigation in May 2024 after allegations that he was deliberately booked in Premier League games to earn money for family and friends in Brazil. He strongly denied wrongdoing.“I am extremely surprised and upset that the FA has decided to charge me,” he said. “For nine months I have cooperated with every step of their investigation and provided all the information I can. I deny the charges in their entirety and will fight with every breath to clear my name”The FA has alleged that Paquetá “directly sought to influence … matches by intentionally seeking to receive a card from the referee, for the improper purpose of affecting the betting market in order for one or more persons to profit from betting”. The charge sheet is understood to include the recommendation of a life ban if he is found guilty.The FA and West Ham declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsFootballThe FAWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Their area is expanding by around 90,000 hectares a year and, without proper management, could invade about a quarter of New Zealand’s land within 30 years, the majority of which would be conservation land.The report traverses how New Zealanders will be affected by the climate crisis and the increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather eventssuch as Cyclone Gabrielle in 2023. Around 750,000 people and 500,000 buildings, are near rivers and in coastal areas already exposed to extreme flooding, while low-lying communities are vulnerable to sea-level rise, and rural communities are at risk of wildfires.“We’ll face some tough choices about our priorities as a country, including about where we put our efforts and our scarce dollars,” Palmer said.The report identified some environmental improvements, particularly in air quality. While road transport remains the main source of nitrogen oxide pollution, air pollution from motor vehicles was reducing due to stronger emission standards, more people choosing to use lower-emission vehicles, and improvements to engines and fuel.“We’ve started to turn the corner in meaningful ways on some of our measures – choices about the cars we drive, the heating we use for our homes, for example, are showing up in better air quality, which is likely to flow through into better health,” Palmer said.“That underscores that we can make a difference, and we can build on the momentum that is already underway by doing more.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandBiodiversityAsia PacificClimate crisisWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

We must now explore extreme optionsDavid KingWe do not have the luxury of rejecting solutions before we have thoroughly investigated their risks, trade-offs and feasibilityMon 7 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.34 EDTShareAs a lifelong scientist, I have always believed that if something is possible, we can find a way to achieve it. And yet, one of the starkest realities we now face is that the world is failing to meet its climate goals. Last year marked a historic and deeply troubling threshold: for the first time,global temperatures exceeded 1.5Cabove pre-industrial levels.Without drastic and immediate climate action, this breach will not be temporary. The consequences –rising sea levels,extreme weatherand devastatingloss of biodiversity– are no longer projections for the distant future. They are happening now, affecting millions of lives, and likely to cause trillions in damages in decades to come.But we must think beyond our immediate horizons. When I read The Iliad, I am reminded that it was written 2,800 years ago. I often wonder: in another 2,800 years, what will people – if humanity as we know it still exists – read about our time? Will they see us as the generation that failed to act or one that made the choices necessary to safeguard the planet for the future?I was an independent observer in the Greenpeace trial. What I saw was shocking | Steven DonzigerRead moreWemust act with this longterm perspectivein mind. Scientists agree we need to bring greenhouse gas levels down to below 350 parts per million by the end of this century to ensure a liveable planet for future generations. Achieving this will require afour-pronged approach:reduce, remove,repairand resilience.Reduction – cutting emissions rapidly and deeply – of course remains a critical priority. But we must also pursue the removal of excess carbon, explore repair techniques to stabilise key ecosystems and build resilience against the escalating impacts we are already experiencing.One of the greatest challenges of climate science today is that many of the necessary levers to regain control are uncomfortable, even controversial. Ideas such asthickening sea iceto prevent collapse orbrightening marine clouds to reflect sunlightmay once have seemed extreme. Yet, as we contend with an escalating crisis, we must at least explore these possibilities. We do not have the luxury of rejecting solutions outright before we have thoroughly investigated their risks, trade-offs and feasibility.As scientists, we must never advocate for deploying unproven interventions. Any repair or removal techniques must undergo rigorous research and assessment before we evaluate full-scale suitability. However, we must also be clear: these investigations must happen with urgency. The longer we delay, the fewer options remain on the table and the more likely that deployment will happen without the proper due diligence at a point of desperation.Privately, many scientists acknowledge the need to advance research into these solutions, but there is a widespread reluctance to say so publicly. I understand this trepidation – some fear backlash, while others worry about giving ammunition to those who would use climate repair as anexcuse to delay emissionsreductions. There are also many who object on ethical, political or environmental grounds, often for entirelyunderstandable reasons. We must respect these concerns and ensure that any research is conducted transparently, with input from affected communities and with the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous rights-holders.Yet, my question remains: if not now, then when? The climate crisis is worsening before our eyes. We cannot afford to remain silent on the necessity of responsible research into nature-based climate repair. We must explore these approaches as part of a holistic climate response, not in place of deep emissions reductions, but as a complement to them.I commend the advocacy groups, scientists and policy leaders who have alreadybroken their silence. Groups such asOperaatio Arktis,Ocean Visionsand theAlliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineeringare fostering open and inclusive dialogue about what responsible research should look like. It is time for more of us to speak up.As a young man, I fell in love with the US. The country’s soul is still there, despite Trump’s best efforts to destroy it | John HarrisRead moreThroughout history, scientific breakthroughs have changed the course of humanity when leaders and communities worked together to act on the evidence before them.The Montreal protocol successfully phased out CFCsafter the discovery of the ozone hole. Decades of renewable energy researchhave madesolar and wind the cheapest power sourcesglobally. We have faced existential challenges before and found solutions – because people were willing to pursue bold, responsible action.Today, we face an even greater challenge. We must advance research into climate repair urgently, transparently and with the utmost scientific and ethical rigour. To do so, we must use our voices, collectively and courageously, before the choices are no longer ours to make.Professor Sir David King is the head of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group. For more than 60 years, he has been a scientist and vocal advocate for acting on climate change.

It is often oak woodland notable for its spectacular epiphytes such as moisture-loving lichens, mosses and ferns.Swaths of the woodland, which is a valuable carbon sink, once covered western Scotland, Wales and south-west England, as well as Ireland, but it has been reduced to tiny fragments, a fraction of its former size. Globally, temperate rainforest covers less than 1% of the Earth’s land surface, making it one of the rarest ecosystems on the planet.Awareness of the Atlantic rainforest was raised byGuy Shrubsole’s book The Lost Rainforests of Britain. In 2023, the government published atemperate rainforests strategyfor England, including a commitment to invest £750,000 on research into protecting England’s rainforests. Those funds are yet to be allocated.Shrubsole has called for a target of doubling the area of British rainforest by 2050.Hanbury-Tenison, who manages Cabilla, hosted 20 MSc students last year, with a further six PhDs being partly based in its Cornish rainforest from six universities that the Thousand Year Trust has partnered with. He hopes to double that number this year but lacks the facilities to host further scientific endeavours – until the research station is built.View image in fullscreenComputer generated image of the research station interiorPhotograph: Unknown WorksIt will be constructed from local wood sourced by the Woodland Trust and comprise bunkhouse accommodation for students, senior academics and volunteers, a laboratory/work station, canteen facilities and a modest amphitheatre area where talks and informal meetings can take place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Robin is celebrating his 89th birthday next month by doing a sponsored row 25 miles along the River Tamar, the boundary between “Cornwall and England” – as the Cornish often put it – to raise money for the research station.“We hope it will serve as a nexus for temperate rainforest research across the whole range,” said Merlin Hanbury-Tenison. “I truly believe that we’ll only be able to make headway in protecting and expanding the Atlantic temperate rainforest when we love it and we’ll only love it when we understand it and that comes from scientific research.“In 10 years’ time, when my children are beginning their GCSE studies, I’d like for the British public and education system to know that we are a rainforest people living on a rainforest island, just as people in Brazil or Borneo are proud of their rainforests.”Explore more on these topicsConservationBiodiversityCornwallnewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, the impact on carbon emissions as a result of these changes is negligible.”Under the measures, luxury supercar companies such as Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep producing petrol cars beyond 2030 because they manufacture only a small number of vehicles a year.New hybrids and plug-in hybrid cars will be allowed to be sold until 2035. Petrol and diesel vans will be able to be sold until 2035, as well as all hybrid models.The Green party MP Siân Berry said: “The government is wrong to apply the brakes on the sale of EV cars.“This is just the latest in a series of boosts the Labour government has given fossil fuel industries. We’ve also seen thegreen light being given to airport expansionand anew road tunnel under the Thames.“This suggests Labour is weakening its climate commitments, and its health-related policy goals because all these moves will have a detrimental impact on air quality.“Slowing down the move away from fossil-fuelled transport makes no economic sense either, since green sectors of the economy are growing three times faster than the overall UK economy.”Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “In weakening the mandate elsewhere by extending flexibilities and allowing the sale of standard hybrids between 2030 and 2035, the government risks reducing the competition it has stimulated between manufacturers, meaning prices for families seeking an EV might not fall as fast, and sales could slow.“The growth of the secondhand EV market, where most of us buy our cars, would in turn be stunted, leaving millions of families stuck in petrol and hybrid cars paying a petrol premium of hundreds, and even thousands, of pounds a year.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We want people to be able to benefit from those lower running costs as well.“And so it’s important that, as a government, we do everything that we can – not only to support British businesses and manufacturing to grow the economy, but also to cut those carbon emissions, and I think we’ve struck the right balance in the package that we’re announcing today.”Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if Starmer was prepared to use the relationship he has built with Trump to ask him to change course, she said: “Obviously when the prime minister has discussions internationally with allies he will be honest about what is in the best interests of the British people.”Challenged that the EV measures were planned before the announcement of the tariffs and were a tweak to policy rather than dramatic change, she told Today: “These are significant changes to the car industry. You are right to say we started the consultation on Christmas Eve and that we closed the consultation in the middle of February.”She said Trump’s imposition of tariffs meant the UK government had to look at its EV plans with “renewed urgency”.Explore more on these topicsTransport policyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsLabourTravel and transportEthical and green livingGreenhouse gas emissionsGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has been sent to the prime minister in response tocomments he made before the Organised Immigration Crime Summiton 31 March, where more than 40 countries came together in London to focus on tackling organised immigration crime including people-smuggling gangs.Starmer said: “But we all pay the price for insecure borders – from the cost of accommodating migrants to the strain on our public services. It is a basic question of fairness.”In anopen letterto the prime minister, the organisations say: “Now is not the time to play into the hands of those seeking to build them-and-us division between local communities and refugees. It is the time to move away from the hostile politics, racist rhetoric and demonising language of the past and unite our communities for a different way forward.”The 136 signatories are from a range of organisations across the UK including City of Sanctuary UK, Choose Love, Freedom from Torture, One Strong Voice, Rainbow Migration, Refugee Action, Refugee Council, Safe Passage International, Scottish Refugee Council, Welsh Refugee Council and the Public and Commercial Services Union.The letter states: “You told us this week that immigration ‘is a basic question of fairness’.

But the searing experiences of last summer, when hate-filled mobs tried to burn down hotels hosting asylum seekers, make it clear that the path to fairness is not to be found in those pitting local communities against refugees seeking safety from persecution and war.”The letter also responds to the summit’s focus on targeting smuggling gangs, saying: “Rather than the border security summit’s focus on expensive new ways to disrupt people smugglers, often making the journey more dangerous for refugees, the government should be looking at safe routes for refugees to get here without risking their lives.”Tim Naor Hilton, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “We need the prime minister and his government to be brave and ditch the divisive language that scapegoats migrants, including refugees and people seeking asylum.“Hostile policies and rhetoric risk fuelling more of the racist, Islamophobic and anti-immigrant riots that tore through our communities last summer.“The government must use language that focuses on unity and community resilience, and develop a new asylum system that is grounded in rights and justice.”Nico Ndlovu, a signatory and the representative of the lived experience campaign group One Strong Voice, said: “The prime minister’s words this week make no recognition of our suffering and why we desperately need to find safety, or our contribution to this country, its economy and culture.“It’s painful to hear him add his voice to this kind of hostile rhetoric. Rather than this summit’s narrow and expensive focus on people smugglers we need a proper vision for the asylum system, with a plan that is fair, compassionate and well managed.”The letter calls for a new plan for refugees that is compassionate and well managed including fair, rapid decisions on their application for asylum, and the chance to rebuild their lives, stronger global cooperation to tackle the root causes that force people to flee their homes and safe routes for refugees.A government spokesperson said: “As the prime minister made clear, there is nothing compassionate about turning a blind eye to the vile gangs who ruthlessly exploit vulnerable people and trade in human misery. This is why we have launched an unprecedented global fight against these criminals to secure our borders as part of our plan for change.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmerImmigration and asylumOrganised crimeRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

This will not impact our investigation, which remains ongoing.”The IOPC will decide at the end of the investigation whether Chilton should face disciplinary proceedings, and added that no criminal offences had been identified.Jones, the Conservative PCC for Hampshire, said: “The chief constable has retired after 33 years of service. The IOPC investigation will continue notwithstanding his retirement.” She said she had appointed the deputy chief constable, Sam de Reya, as acting chief constable to continue leading the force.After the first allegation was made known in February, Jones had voiced her support for Chilton. “The chief constable remains in post and has my full support to continue reducing crime, increasing detection rates and making communities safer across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight,” she said at the time.Chilton was alsothe national lead, on behalf of all chief constables, for investigations – which included standards and accreditation, retention and recruitment of detectives, homicide and coronial investigations, as well as being lead for tactics, training and equipment.The allegations against Chilton were first made by the former DCI Roger Wood, who himself was found to have committed gross misconduct after striking up sexual relationships with junior police staff.Asked at his own hearing if having an affair was misconduct, it is understood that Wood – who quit while under investigation – said: “Well the chief constable had an affair.”That led to a mandatory referral to the police watchdog on 27 February, a week after Wood’s hearing concluded with him being banned from serving again.Explore more on these topicsPoliceHampshireIndependent Office for Police ConductnewsShareReuse this content"

He also sacked his legal team before the trial and was unrepresented in the case.Jurors at Loughborough crown court deliberated for more than 12 hours before finding Brooks guilty of all the charges against him.The court heard how the surgeon, who specialised in burns and plastics, cycled through the snow to Perks’ home in Halam, near Southwell in Nottinghamshire, in the early hours of the morning during a Covid lockdown, dressed in camouflage gear and armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches and a knife.View image in fullscreenGraeme Perks was given a 95% chance of dying after the attack.Photograph: BAPRAS/PAThe court heard that Perks, a consultant plastic surgeon, had provided evidence in disciplinary proceedings against Brooks, who faced potentially losing his job with Nottingham University hospitals NHS trust.Tracy Ayling KC, prosecuting, told the court it was “clear that the defendant hated Graeme Perks” and wanted him “out of the way”. The court heard that Perks, who was 65 at the time and had retired the month before the attack, suffered “extremely life-threatening” injuries to his liver, intestines and pancreas, and was given a 95% chance of death.He had woken up when Brooks smashed through his conservatory, and when he went downstairs, his feet “felt a bit damp” from the petrol before he felt a “blow to his body”, the jury heard.The jury was told that Brooks had also thrown petrol up the stair walls while his victim’s wife and youngest son were asleep upstairs.Brooks was found asleep on a garden bench later that morning, and was arrested after he was taken to hospital for injuries to his hand.The convictions followed four years of legal hearings, which included a mistrial and seven other aborted trial dates. His first trial, in July 2022, was adjourned because he was suffering from a medical complication of radiotherapy, which required surgery.Brooks had put forward numerous possible defences, including self-defence and lack of intent, but never gave evidence directly to a jury.The defendant could be seen lying on the floor during a court appearance, because he said sitting in his wheelchair made him “feel unwell”.“I would rather be dead than in prison so I continued with my hunger strike. I have had enough of being in prison,” he said. “I don’t particularly want to die but if my choice is between incarceration and death, I would rather be dead than incarcerated.”The judge, Mr Justice Pepperall, ruled that Brooks had on “no fewer than eight occasions” since 2021 “used hunger strikes or the threat of some other self-harm to achieve some advantage”.The judge thanked jurors for their service in “particularly unusual circumstances” and excused them from jury service for five years.Manjeet Shehmar, the medical director at Nottingham University hospitals NHS trust, said after the verdicts: “We have been following the case of Mr Brooks closely and respect the decision made in court today.“We would like to offer our sympathies to those who were affected by Mr Brooks’ actions, including Mr Perks and his family, and other colleagues from within the trust.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

After visiting, he described an unprecedented situation which more closely resembled a refugee camp in an unstable country than aHome Officetemporary staging post for new arrivals to the UK in a tranquil corner of Kent.At the time that Baxter said Manston was in crisis, marquees that were supposed to be used for a matter of hours before asylum seekers were moved to more permanent accommodation were used for more than a month in some cases. People slept on the dirty ground on pieces of sodden cardboard. There were outbreaks of diphtheria, a disease rarely seen in the UK thanks to vaccination, and scabies. One man died after contracting diphtheria while claims of guards assaulting asylum seekers were investigated byKentpolice.But it was only in the months after this bleak period – between June and November 2022 – that the full details of what happened there began to emerge.Those bringing claims against the government include a 19-year-old from Sudan who was a victim of torture and trafficking, although his vulnerabilities were not recorded while he was detained at Manston for 33 days. He said he was often hungry and was only allowed one shower the whole time he was there. He was not given any change of clothes. He said that some of the officials he encountered at Manston told him to “go back to your country”.Another claimant, a 17-year-old Kurdish boy from Iraq, was given a birth date five years older than his actual age, despite insisting he was a child. He was detained for 12 days.A Syrian woman had a particularly difficult time. She arrived in the UK with her husband and their five young children, but when her husband complained to guards about the conditions at Manston he was removed from the site and placed in an immigration detention centre.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She and the children spent 11 days in a freezing, filthy tent, and were only allowed to leave it to go to the toilet. When her children contracted a sickness bug that was circulating at Manston, she had nowhere to wash their vomit-stained clothes as there was a shortage of running water, so she tried to wash them using bottled water.She herself vomited every morning and later discovered she was pregnant. She was unable to access medical care while in Manston, and when she was released and could seek treatment, it was discovered that the baby had died inside her. After she and her children were released from Manston, she was finally able to reunite with her husband but says that the impact of being detained in Manston continues to affect them all.Emily Soothill of Deighton Pierce Glynn, who is representing some of those bringing legal action relating to their time at Manston, said: “We consider that our clients were falsely imprisoned and that the conditions in Manston were such that their human rights were breached. People seeking asylum are more vulnerable to physical and mental illness; they have the right to be treated with dignity and should not be detained in this way.”Jed Pennington of Wilsons solicitors, representing others legally challenging their time in Manston, said: “The humanitarian crisis that unfolded at Manston in the autumn of 2022 is not what you would expect to see in a country with well-developed systems for accommodating refugees. Our clients want the truth about how it happened, who let it happen and how to prevent this from happening again.”Explore more on these topicsManston asylum centreImmigration and asylumHome OfficeKentRefugeesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The disorder afterwards included violent clashes with police and damage to property.Malcolm McHaffie, the head of the CPS special crime division, said: “Our thoughts remain with the families and friends of the two teenagers following their tragic deaths in May 2023.“Following a thorough and detailed review of the evidence in relation to a single allegation of dangerous driving in this case, we have decided that no criminal charges will be brought against a South Wales police officer.“We have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. We fully understand that this will be disappointing news for the families of both boys and will offer a meeting with them to explain our reasoning further.”The decision is subject to the victims’ right of review (VRR) scheme, which provides a victim or their families in some classes of case with a specifically designed process to exercise the right to review certain CPS decisions not to start a prosecution or to stop a prosecution.The deaths provoked a night of violent disorder that left 15 police officers wounded. Rioters claimed they had gathered to pay respect to the dead boys before clashes broke out with officers from South Wales police.The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it submitted a file of evidence to the CPS to consider an offence of dangerous driving for the driver of a police van.David Ford, an IOPC director, said: “We know that the boys’ deaths have had a deep impact on the local community and I want to thank everyone again for their patience while we carried out our detailed investigative work.”He added: “We are finalising our position over any potential disciplinary proceedings in relation to the driver of the police van and will provide a further update once final decisions have been made.”The watchdog said an additional investigation into family complaints against South Wales police, which covered a number of areas including the families’ treatment at the scene of the incident, was close to concluding.Explore more on these topicsPoliceWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The details of the TCN remain unknown.Journalists were not allowed into a hearing last month related to the case.Multiple media organisations, including the Guardian, the Financial Times, the BBC and the PA news agency, asked the tribunal to confirm who was taking part in the hearing on 14 March and for it to sit in public.Neither journalists nor legal representatives on behalf of the media were allowed into the hearing, and the identities of the parties involved were not disclosed before the hearing.The judges added that it could be possible for “some or all future hearings to incorporate a public element, with or without reporting restrictions” but that could not be ruled on at this stage in the process.Recipients of a TCN cannot reveal the existence of an order unless they are given permission from the home secretary. The tribunal’s website states that hearings should be closed to the public only when “strictly necessary”, but itsrulesdeclare there must be no disclosure of information that is “prejudicial to national security”.Ross McKenzie, a data protection partner at the law firm Addleshaw Goddard, said despite the ruling it was “highly unlikely” there would be any in-depth revelations of the Home Office’s case for accessing Apple user data.“We may get a skeletal decision similar to what has been shared so far, which summarises the rationale without any meaningful detail,” said McKenzie.A Home Office spokesperson said the department did not comment on legal proceedings, but added that “longstanding and targeted investigatory powers” had “saved lives, prevented incredibly serious terrorist plots against the UK, and put dangerous criminals behind bars”.The spokesperson said those powers needed to be sustained as technology changed.Apple declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeAppleData protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

Troponin blood tests are already used in hospitals to diagnose heart attacks after they have occurred.Research suggests the inexpensive tests could also be used to detect “silent” harm to the heart, helping to predict a patient’s future risk of cardiovascular events.The tests, which can be done alongside routine cholesterol tests at GP surgeries, could enable preventive treatment, such as statins, with the potential to avoid thousands of heart attacks and strokes.The study’s lead author, Anoop Shah, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: “Troponin, even in the normal range, is a powerful indicator of silent heart muscle damage.“As such, the test provides an extra layer of information that we can use to boost our accuracy when predicting people’s risk. We want to identify as many high-risk people as possible, so that no one misses out on the opportunity to get preventative treatment.”Adding troponin tests into existing heart-risk estimation guidelines could help spot high-risk patients who would benefit from preventive treatment, said Shah, which would reduce their risk of future circulatory issues.The study found people with higher levels of troponin in their blood were at greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke within 10 years. Modelling suggests that, for people currently found to be at intermediate risk on existing cardiovascular health assessments, the tests would prevent one heart attack or stroke for roughly every 500 people tested.Researchers analysed the health data of more than 62,000 people across Europe and the US.Each person had their troponin levels measured, as well as conventional risk factors such as age, blood pressure, history of diabetes, smoking status and cholesterol levels. Participants were then tracked for a decade to see if they had a heart attack or stroke.Current cardiovascular health assessments use an algorithm to predict a patient’s risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years based on their risk factors, including cholesterol levels measured using a blood test.By adding troponin results to these existing risk factors, the algorithm’s predictions were up to four times more accurate than adding cholesterol results alone, the researchers said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Offering preventive treatments, such as statins, to reclassified patients could prevent thousands of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or strokes.Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer at the BHF, said: “Developments in risk prediction have helped doctors to build effective algorithms that can spot those most at risk of heart attacks and strokes. But, with around 100,000 hospital admissions for heart attacks alone in the UK each year, it’s clear that there is still plenty of room for improvement.“This new data suggests adding this blood test to current risk-prediction models could help medical professionals identify more people who are at higher risk and deliver advice and treatment to reduce their risk of future heart attack and strokes.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchHeart diseaseHeart attackStrokeHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

About 15,000 people are expected to work on the construction at its peak.Nisbet, a project director, was sacked for gross misconduct by Notus after he gave Daniels a quad bike to get more work out of him, the hearing in Bristol was told.Nisbet told the tribunal that Daniels was a “greedy little toad” and was “hard to say no to”.It was heard Nisbet and other senior staff at Notus had bribed Daniels, who had been appointed as head of lifting and temporary works at Hinkley by EDF. Daniels was bribed to “ensure that work was directed their way”, it was heard.Nisbet was also caught up in allegations he bribed Daniels with tickets to a boxing event in London and with a refill for his Montblanc pen. He argued he had nothing to do with the boxing invitation and said the refill was a spare that he got for himself.He also argued that his “favours” were simply lunches, coffee and biscuits. The tribunal found he could not provide an “innocent” explanation for the quad bike, however.A judge found that Nisbet was involved in the bribery for more than two years before he and another colleague were sacked by Notus at the start of 2023.Daniels was “under investigation” by EDF and HPC, the tribunal heard.Nisbet told the tribunal he “did not accept that the evidence indicated that he was clearly involved”. He said he was “exasperated” by Daniels, adding: “He was known as asking for favours, was self-entitled and greedy, was cheeky and a greedy little toad.”Nisbet won a claim of unfair dismissal as the employment judge Colm O’Rourke found his dismissal had been pre-decided and did not go through a proper process. But Judge O’Rourke said Nisbet did not deserve compensation.He said: “While [Notus] clearly had not followed a proper procedure and presented sham correspondence to [Mr Nisbet], [Notus] witnesses readily admitted that … they felt that they had no option but to proceed as they did.“In contrast, [Mr Nisbet] was on occasions evasive and self-serving in his evidence.“While [he] may have been able to explain away some of the allegations against him, or challenged the level of seriousness of them (the pen refill, for example) … the core allegation against him, in relation to the quad bike, which has been forensically examined in this hearing, still remains incapable of an innocent explanation.“I conclude, therefore that the following of a fair disciplinary procedure would, in any event, have made no difference to the outcome of this case, [Mr Nisbet’s] summary dismissal for gross misconduct and that therefore no compensation is awardable to [him].”“It is clear from the evidence that [Mr Nisbet] was, on the balance of probabilities, complicit in bribery and corruption involving Mr Daniels, over a two-year plus period and thus engaged in culpable behaviour.”Daniels declined to comment.A spokesperson for Hinkley Point C said: “The project sets and enforces high standards for all employees, contractors and suppliers and will rigorously investigate and take action over inappropriate conduct.”Explore more on these topicsHinkley Point CSomersetnewsShareReuse this content"

She was last seen in the company of British soldiers in a bar in a hotel in Nanyuki, a town in eastern Kenya where theBritish armyhas a military base, BATUK.Her body was found two months later, stuffed inside a septic tank at the Lion’s Court hotel. Six years ago, an inquest in Kenya found she had been murdered by one or more British soldiers.In 2021, a suspect was named by several soldiers who at the time were attached to the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, with one providing startling testimony in which he claimed that the killer, a fellow soldier, had confessed to him on the night and shown him Wanjiru’s body in the septic tank.In a new statement, prosecutors in Kenya said that after the conclusion of police investigations, a file had been submitted for consideration.“The DPP [director of public prosecutions] has constituted a team of senior prosecutors to conduct a comprehensive review of the file,” the statement said. “The DPP acknowledges the significant time that has elapsed in this matter and remains fully committed to ensuring justice for the family of Agnes Wanjiru.”On a visit to Kenya on Monday,John Healeymet Wanjiru’s family and emphasised his “determination to see a resolution” to the case, promising the UK’s “full support” for the investigation.View image in fullscreenRose Wanyua holds up a picture of her sister, Agnes Wanjiru, in October 2021.Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPAAs shadow defence secretary, Healey had previously called for more to be done to “pursue justice for Agnes and her family”. Kenyan prosecutors have already flown to the UK to interview witnesses and potential suspects, but no charges have been brought.Last year, the British armyannounced an investigation into the wider behaviour of troops stationed at BATUK, after what the Ministry of Defence described as “alarming allegations of unacceptable behaviour by service personnel deployed to Kenya”.Healey said he planned to discuss Wanjiru’s murder later on Monday in a meeting with William Ruto, the president of Kenya, adding: “I will emphasise the need to accelerate progress in this case.“It was deeply humbling to meet the family of Agnes Wanjiru today. In the 13 years since her death, they have shown such strength in their long fight for justice. I reiterated my determination to see a resolution to the still-unresolved case.“Our government will continue to do everything we can to help the family secure the justice they deserve.”After the meeting with Healey, Wanjiru’s family said: “The death of our beloved Agnes has had a profound and devastating impact on our family.“It was not only the shock of losing Agnes at such a young age, but also the horrific circumstances in which her body was found and all the trauma and struggle our family has been put through in trying to seek justice and accountability for her death that has taken a very heavy toll on all of us.“We are grateful to the secretary of state for defence for agreeing to meet with us, but we have waited for too many years and been offered too many empty promises.“We hope that our meeting with the secretary of state marks the beginning of the UK government and Ministry of Defence taking decisive action to ensure that what happened to Agnes is properly investigated in Kenya and in the UK and to make sure that what happened to Agnes never happens again.“We expect the UK and Kenyan governments to act and bring closure to this matter.”Explore more on these topicsBritish armyKenyaMilitaryAfricaDefence policyJohn HealeynewsShareReuse this content"

Dozens of US students’ visas abruptly revokedNearly 40 students report canceled visas over minor infractions as Trump intensifies crackdown on universitiesAva Hu in Berkeley, CaliforniaMon 7 Apr 2025 11.18 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 13.03 EDTShareLisa was eating takeout at a friend’s place when the email from her university landed. She clicked into her inbox and skimmed the message:“ISS [International Student Services] is writing to inform you that your SEVIS record was terminated …”The wording felt unfamiliar. She read it again, but it still sounded like a scam – absurd and unreal.Lisa is an international student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, just one month away from graduation. She asked to use a pseudonym due to concerns about retaliation and an ongoing legal case.Before going to bed, she found someone posted a similar notice on social media. It was through these posts that Lisa understood what the email had actually meant: with her Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record terminated, she was now considered out of status in the US. Staying could mean violating immigration laws.The Department of Homeland Security maintains the Sevis database that tracks international students and scholars on F, M and J visas. Once a Sevis record is terminated, a student’s legal status becomes immediately invalid. They must either leave the US within the grace period, typically 15 days, or take steps to restore their status. Otherwise, they risk deportation and future visa restrictions.She dug through comment sections. Joined group chats. Searched for patterns. One emerged: most of the affected students had been fingerprinted. Some had been cited for non-criminal offenses, but the messages they received said they had criminal records.That’s when she remembered: a year ago, she was driving home when she got two speeding tickets: one for speeding and another for failing to stop. She hadn’t seen the police car behind her until it was too late. To get the charges dismissed, she showed up in court, where she was fingerprinted.Lisa is one of several students across states who found their legal status revoked by the US government on 4 April, without prior notice or clear explanation. University statements show that at least 39 students have been affected, including UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, Stanford, Ohio State, the University of Tennessee, the University of Kentucky, Minnesota State University and the University of Oregon.An online self-reported data sheet created by affected students suggests the issue may be more widespread. Students from 50 universities reported their visas were canceled around 4 April, with many noting that they had prior records, some limited to citations or non-criminal offenses.View image in fullscreenPeople protest in support of Rumeysa Ozturk in Somerville, Massachusetts, on 26 March 2025.Photograph: Faith Ninivaggi/ReutersThis secret wave of revocation came a few days after the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, announced the revocation of 300 or more student visas. “We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,” he said at a news conference on 27 March, referring to students he described as national security threats.Lisa’s university had included a screenshot of her Sevis record in the message. Termination was logged on 4 April by a system administrator, with a note: “Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.”Shenqi Cai, a Californiaimmigrationattorney and managing attorney at Lashine Law, said she got the first call from a student on 3 April. “At the time, we thought it was a one-off. It seemed strange.”But by Friday, more cases kept coming in. She contacted designated school officials at several partner universities and confirmed that the terminations were visible in the Sevis system.Cai said this round of Sevis terminations appeared to be unprecedented. “Students weren’t given any chance to explain their situation. As long as the system flagged them, what we believe is a kind of criminal screening trigger, they were terminated under one broad directive.”Based on the information collected so far, Cai said about 90% of the affected students had been fingerprinted. But she explained that the criteria used to flag students can vary by state. “Each state defines these triggers differently. The thresholds are inconsistent. A student may be arrested in one state, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be convicted, because the power to decide guilt or innocence lies with the judge.”David, a Chinese student who completed his undergraduate degree, was immediately unable to continue working. He requested a pseudonym due to fears of retaliation and an ongoing legal case.In 2024, David was reported to police after a verbal argument with his partner. When officers arrived, they were still arguing, but there was no physical contact, he said. Because of a language barrier, his partner couldn’t clearly explain what had happened. David was detained overnight and later ordered to appear in court.“My partner wrote a statement to the prosecutor explaining it wasn’t domestic violence,” he said. The charge was eventually dropped. Court records show the case was dismissed with prejudice, and the judge ordered the arrest record and biometric data to be destroyed.Three years later, David received a Sevis termination notice.Unlike enrolled F-1 students, David is working under Optional Practical Training, a work authorization linked to the Sevis system. Once a Sevis record is terminated, that authorization ends and is nearly impossible to recover.David was nearing the end of his first year of employment when he got the notice on Friday. He scheduled a lunch meeting with his manager, who said the company would try to help him relocate to Canada. But because the termination took effect immediately, he was subjected to the 15-day departure rule.“I told my family, and they felt just as powerless,” he said. “But we don’t come from wealth, and there’s not a lot they can do.”Bill is facing the same dilemma. He graduated in December 2024 and is currently job-hunting. He asked not to use his real name due to a pending case.In early 2025, Bill hit another car while making a turn. At the time, his driver’s license had just expired. Police cited him for driving with an expired license. After renewing it, he followed the instructions and appeared in court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The court staff were friendly,” he said. “One even joked, ‘This is no big deal, handsome,’ while taking my fingerprints and photos. It felt like a scene out of a movie.”His initial appearance only involved ID verification. When he asked if the hearing could be held that day, a staff member told him it was scheduled for May and suggested he come back then.“I thought it was fine. My license was updated, I just had to show up again.” But on 3 April, he suddenly received a notice from the school that his Sevis record had been terminated.Now, Bill has no idea what to do. Legally, he should leave the country immediately, but his case is still open and he’s required to appear in court in May. He doesn’t know whether showing up would put him at risk of detention.On 4 April, he met with his university’s international office. Staff there were willing to help, he said, but had few tools. They asked him to write a personal statement, which they promised to pass along to university leadership. The only formal support offered was a referral to a discounted lawyer – $150 an hour.View image in fullscreenBoston University students protest outside the office of the dean of students on 3 April 2025.Photograph: Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe via Getty Images“The dust of history falls on me, and it becomes a mountain. That’s all there is to it,” he said.By Sunday evening, the panic had spread. Three hundred students joined a Zoom info session hosted by Brad Banias, a federal court immigration litigator and former justice department trial attorney. Questions poured into the chat box: “Should we leave our apartments right now in case ICE shows up?” “Will an unpaid parking ticket be a problem?”Banias called the terminations a political move, not a legal one. “It makes me angry to see 19-year-olds just trying to study, and suddenly a parking ticket they didn’t even know about shows up on a criminal background check,” he said. “Don’t let them convince you it’s reasonable to leave the country over a parking ticket.”For Lisa, the future was just starting to take shape. She is about to graduate in one month, with a job offer and grad school acceptance. But now, she said she wasn’t even sure if she should go to class on Monday.Back in April 2024, she was pulled over in Madison for speeding. She hadn’t noticed the patrol car behind her right away, and by the time she stopped, two officers approached. One told her not to worry – it was her first offense, and all she needed to do was pay the fine. But the other issued two citations: one for speeding, the other for failing to stop.They told her it was just a miscommunication, something she could clear up in court.But that never really happened.US student journalists go dark fearing Trump crusade against pro-Palestinian speechRead more“My first court date was just for ID,” she said. “They fingerprinted me, took a photo, measured my height. The judge barely said anything. No hearing, just a new court date.”She asked if the case could be resolved sooner and was told to schedule an online meeting. She did. During that meeting, the case was dropped. No record. They asked if she accepted. She said yes.Everything after that went smoothly: her work visa was approved, the company background checks cleared, and she had no trouble leaving and re-entering the country. She thought it was behind her.Then the email came.“I don’t know if I’m still allowed to graduate,” she said. “If I don’t get my degree, does the grad school still take me? Does the company push back the offer? Worst case, I don’t graduate. I go home and start college again. Four more years.

But in a statement on Thursday, the culture ministry said permission had been refused because “the proposed scenes are incompatible with the symbolism … and the values the Acropolis represents”.Bugonia is Lanthimos’s latest collaboration with Emma Stone, who won the best actress Oscar for her role in his 2023 comedy Poor Things. In their new film, whose scheduled November release date suggests a major awards push, Stone stars as the CEO of a major pharmaceutical company kidnapped by a conspiracist bee-keeper, played by her Kinds of Kindness co-star Jesse Plemons.The scenes in question depicted 70 dead bodies placed between two of the Greek citadel’s key sites: the Propylaea, its complex of Doric entrance buildings, and the Parthenon, the temple dedicated to the goddess Athena.View image in fullscreenViggo Mortensen and Kirsten Dunst in The Two Faces of January.Photograph: Jack English/AllstarLanthimos’s request appears to have initially been welcomed by the ministry of culture, who agreed to waive the standard filming fee for the Acropolis – around €1,984 (£1,700) per day – in recognition of the director’s international standing.However, this offer was subject to the approval of theCentral Archaeological Council, which oversees the Acropolis. They rejected Lanthimos’s proposal, citing symbolic inappropriateness and insufficient reverence, and suggested nearby alternatives where he could film.The ministry of culture is said to have delayed its final ruling until producers from the film indicated whether they would pursue another location. On Wednesday, culture minister Lina Mendoni received a letter from Lanthimos’s team, reiterating their previously rejected request, but reportedly not providing sufficient grounds for her to ask the Central Archeological Council to reconsider.Despite being widely regarded as one of the planet’s most important cultural artefacts, the Acropolis in Athens has often been used as a filming location. It featured extensively in Sophia Loren’s 1957 breakthrough, Boy on a Dolphin, as well as in more recent films such as Patricia Highsmith adaptation The Two Faces of January (2014) and Before Midnight (2013).Comparable sites, such as Stonehenge or the Vatican, are usually rebuilt as replicas.Born in Athens, Lanthimos, 51, was among the creative team behind the TV visuals for the 2004 Olympics held in the city. He made his breakthrough film with 2009’s Dogtooth, which won the Un Certain Regard prize at Cannes and was nominated for the best international Oscar.View image in fullscreenYorgos Lanthimos, Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, Mark Ruffalo and Ramy Youssef at the 2024 Golden Globes.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPAAlps (2011), The Lobster (2015) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017) cemented his reputation for challenging absurdist comedies, before he found mainstream acclaim with Queen Anne comedy-drama The Favourite (2018), which was nominated for 10 Oscars, winning best actress for Olivia Colman.Lanthimos’s first photography monograph, titledDear God, the Parthenon Is Still Broken, featured photos shot behind the scenes on Poor Things. A second book, I Shall Sing These Songs Beautifully, collected shots from the production of Kinds of Kindness.An exhibition of some of these photographs – Lanthimos’s first bricks-and-mortar show – has just opened at a gallery in Los Angeles.Explore more on these topicsFilmYorgos LanthimosGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, he had stopped short of endorsing the MMR vaccine, which he minimized as merely a “personal choice” rather than a public health and safety measure that long ago was proven effective.In atweeton Sunday following his presence in Seminole at the funeral of Daisy Hildebrand, an unvaccinated eight-year-old who died on 3 April, Kennedy said he had visited with Richard Bartlett and Ben Edwards – and claimed without evidence the anti-vax physicians had treated and healed “some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children”.The Texas Medical BoarddisciplinedBartlett in 2003 for his “inappropriate treatment of patients with intravenous antibiotics and other medications”.Kennedy’s tweet said Bartlett had used “aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin” to treat children with measles, two drugs Bartlett reportedlypreviously claimedwere also ingredients in his “magic bullet” treatment for Covid-19.Bartlett, who ran a short-lived congressionalcampaignin 2019, has something of a checkered past. During a lengthy medical career that he has said was “acalling from God”, patientscomplainedof receiving “unnecessary diagnostic tests, medications or treatments”. And in 2021, he received a criminal trespasswarningafter being caught allegedly rifling through trash bags at an Ector county hospital where he did not work.Edwards, meanwhile, has a vaccine-free “wellness practice” at a converted barn building in Seminole where he promotes better nutrition and treats patients with cod liver oil and vitamins to control the measles outbreak, according toNBC News.Like Bartlett, Edwards is an advocate of budesonide, a corticosteroid more commonly used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease – and inhaled to open airways in asthma patients.Kennedy has previously expressed admiration for the pair, tellingFox Newslast month that budesonide has produced “very, very good results”, and that patients had experienced “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries.Conversely, Kennedy talked up theMMRvaccine during his visit to Texas. He said the purpose of the trip was to comfort the families of Hildebrand and Kayley Fehr, a six-year-old whose death in February was the first from measles in the US in a decade.“My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” he said in an earlierposton Sunday to X.“In early March, I deployed a CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] team to bolster local and state capacity for response across multiple Texas regions, supply pharmacies and Texas run clinics with needed MMR vaccines and other medicines and medical supplies.“Since that time, the growth rates for new cases and hospitalizations have flattened. The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”Kennedy said as of Sunday there were “642 confirmed cases of measles across 22 states, 499 of those in Texas”.The US health and human services department confirmed the death of Hildebrand toNBClate on Saturday, stating that the cause of the child’s death remained under investigation.On Sunday, a spokesperson for the UMCHealthSystem in Lubbock, Texas, said that the child had been hospitalized before dying and was “receiving treatment for complications of measles”, which is easily preventable through vaccination.According to authorities, Fehr was also unvaccinated. NBC reported that Gaines county, which incorporates Seminole, has one of the highest vaccine exemption rates in Texas, atnearly 18%compared to3% nationally.Explore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrMMRHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

They are too small to have any negative or distorted impact on your country.”Mottley warnedCaribbeancitizens that the tariffs would mean “higher prices for all of us”.Volatility grips global stock markets as Trump insists on tariff ‘medicine’Read moreThe finance minister forSt Vincent and the Grenadines(SVG), Camillo Gonsalves, who is visiting the UK to promote foreign investment, particularly from the Caribbean diaspora, said the US tariffs – which range from 10% to 38% on Caribbean countries – could have a detrimental impact on his country’s agricultural and fisheries sectors, and drive up the prices of imports, leading to unsustainable inflation and rises in the cost of living.“We import many, many products, fruits, vegetables, manufactured goods, meats … cement, steel, through Miami and other US ports,” Gonsalves told the Guardian. “And not all of those products are of American origin … but it’s a convenient point of transit for the Caribbean.”Going through these US ports, he added, meant they would be subject to the increased US tariffs. “Those tariffs will become a cost; they will become a tax, essentially to Caribbean consumers,” he said.The minister said SVG was working closely with other countries in the region who are part of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) to engage with the US on the matter, and that it was also looking at solutions such as developing partnerships with other countries in the Commonwealth.He said: “I think that if the United States has made a policy decision to withdraw from global trade, it does not mean that global trade is dead. It simply means that one major player has withdrawn from the game … I believe that other countries that continue to see the advantages of global trade and globalisation will adapt … and I think that the Commonwealth connection is advantageous.”Investment from SVG nationals living abroad could drive rapid growth, he said, estimating that their “economic strength” was about five times that of their fellow citizens at home.Here’s one key thing you should know about Trump’s shock to the world economy: it could work | James MeadwayRead moreOn Friday,Mottley, who is also the chair of Caricom, issued a statementstressing that the Caribbean was already reaping the benefits of work to diversify economies and shake off the “legacy of our colonial dependence”, but admitting that the region was still “largely reliant on imports”, as she expressed concern about the impact of the tariffs.“We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but I want every Caribbean man and every Caribbean woman to hear me. This trade war and the possibility of a $1m to $1.5m levy on all Chinese-made ships entering US harbours will mean higher prices for all of us at the corner shop, higher prices at the supermarket, higher prices at the electronic store, higher prices for us at the shop, higher prices for us at the restaurant, higher prices for us at the car dealership and beyond,” she said.In her statement, the Caricom chair proposed a set of actions to respond to the crisis. First, she said, the Caribbean community should “re-engage urgently, directly, and at the highest possible level with our friends in the United States of America”. She also urged countries to unite and avoid fighting “among each other for political gain”.She said it was important to “redouble efforts to invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing” and “build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada”.“We must not rely solely on one or two markets. We need to be able to sell our Caribbean goods to a wider, more stable global market,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsCaribbeanMia MottleyDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policyBarbadosnewsShareReuse this content"

He identified himself as Kintu and said he had been deported from the US against his will.Trump administration revokes all South Sudanese visas in repatriation rowRead moreOn Sunday, the US announced that ithad revokedthe visas of all South Sudanese passport holders in reaction to the refusal by immigration authorities at Juba international airport to repatriate the man, accusing the east African country of “taking advantage of the United States”.Mayen, the foreign ministry spokesperson, said that South Sudan “deeply regrets” the blanket measure against all of the country’s citizens based on “an isolated incident involving misrepresentation by an individual who is not a South Sudanese national”.She added that the government of South Sudan was open to receiving its citizens, whether they voluntarily leave the US or are deported, and had maintained open communication with the US, despite claims by Washington that it had been rebuffed.Trump administration officials have said the individual’s documents were verified by South Sudan’s embassy in Washington DC and that South Sudan had “violated” its obligation “by refusing to accept one of their nationals certified by their own embassy in Washington and repatriated to their country”.In a post on social media, the US deputy secretary of state, Chris Landau, said: “Specifically, on February 13, 2025, the South Sudanese Embassy issued the individual an emergency travel letter certifying his nationality as South Sudanese and giving his date and place of birth (in what is now South Sudan, which then was part of Sudan).”Landau added that it was “unacceptable and irresponsible” for South Sudanese authorities to then reject a decision made by their embassy and “as far as we’re concerned, the Embassy’s certification is conclusive and the matter is closed”.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said a visa and entry ban for South Sudanese citizens would go into immediate effect and would be reviewed once South Sudan, in the US government’s eyes, begancooperatingagain.Jok Madut Jok, an academic specialising in South Sudan at Syracuse University, in upstate New York, said if the mistake was made at South Sudan’s Washington embassy, that doesn’t “get the US off the hook for this measure”. “On humanitarian grounds, this needs to be rolled back because it is too broad,” he said, adding that many people attempting to come to the US could be refugees fleeing conflict.South Sudanese passport holders have enjoyed “temporary protected status” (TPS) in the US since 2011 which affords them legal protections against deportation due to instability and fighting in their country of origin. The Department of Homeland Security believes 133 people from South Sudan were on the US TPS programme last year.Donald Trump wanted to end TPS during his first term and the US president has attempted to do so again, targeting nationals from Nicaragua, Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba.TPS was renewed for South Sudanese nationals last September but is set to expire in May, which comes as South Sudan faces an escalating risk of renewed fighting by leaders from its two largest ethnic groups.South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, gained independence from Sudan in 2011, and has since struggled with armed conflict and poverty. Between 2013 and 2018, fighting between factions loyal to the current president, Salva Kiir Mayardit, and his vice-president, Riek Machar, killed nearly 400,000 people.Alexandra Ribe, an immigration attorney who specialises in humanitarian issues, said it is too early to tell what impact the measure would have on South Sudanese in the US as it was not clear what enforcement action immigration authorities would take, but described it as “punitive”.Ribe said the measure would “send a chill down the spines of nationals from the targeted country who have nothing to do with the issue at hand”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsSouth SudanUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The group received money from organisations affiliated with Leo and Koch in 2022. A spokesperson for Stand Together, a group partially-funded by Koch and that has supported the alliance, said it was not involved in the legal case.The alliance has tabled its action on behalf of Simplified, a Florida-based home goods company whose business is heavily reliant on imports from China. It argues that the president has exceeded his powers in invoking the IEEPA to justify tariffs.“This statute authorizes specific emergency actions like imposing sanctions or freezing assets to protect the United States from foreign threats,” the alliance said in astatement. “It does not authorize the president to impose tariffs. In its nearly 50-year history, no other president – including President Trump in his first term – has ever tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs.”The alliance also argues that power to impose tariffs lies not with a sitting president, but with Congress, and warns that those imposed by Trump could run afoul of US supreme court rulings.“His attempt to use the IEEPA this way not only violates the law as written, but it also invites application of the supreme court’s major questions doctrine, which tells courts not to discern policies of ‘vast economic and political significance’ in a law without explicit congressional authorization,” its statement said.Mark Chenoweth, the alliance’s president, said the court in Pensacola – where the suit has been filed – would have to observe this legal precedent.“Reading this law [IEEPA] broadly enough to uphold the China tariff would transfer core legislative power,” he said. “To avoid that non-delegation pitfall, the court must construe the statute consistent with nearly 50 years of unbroken practice and decide it does not permit tariff setting.”The suit argues that there is no connection between the fentanyl epidemic – which Trump has cited as a reason for invoking the emergency powers – and the tariffs.“The means of an across-the-board tariff does not fit the end of stopping an influx of opioids, and is in no sense ‘necessary’ to that stated purpose,” the complaint filed on behalf of Simplified argues.“In fact, President Trump’s own statements reveal the real reason for the China tariff, which is to reduce American trade deficits while raising federal revenue.”The legal case adds to rumbling disquiet on tariffs among some of Trump’s usually vocal supporters, including the billionaire hedge fund managerBill Ackman.Paul, a senator from Kentucky who has been one of the most consistent congressional anti-tariff voices,told the Washington Postthat other Capitol Hill Republicans shared his concern.“They all see the stock market, and they’re all worried about it,” Paul said. “But they are putting on a stiff upper lip to try to act as if nothing’s happening and hoping it goes away.”Speaking in support of last week’s Democratic amendment, sponsored by the Virginia senator Tim Kaine, Paul said: “I don’t care if the president is a Republican or a Democrat. I don’t want to live under emergency rule. I don’t want to live where my representatives cannot speak for me and have a check and balance on power.”Trump attacked Paul and the three other Republican senators who backed the amendment and suggested they were driven by “Trump derangement syndrome”.In another sign of Republican concern, the GOP senator from Iowa Chuck Grassley – along with a Washington Democrat, Maria Cantrell – introduced a bill that would limit Trump’s ability to impose or increase tariffs by requiring Congress to approve them within 60 days. The White House budget officesaid on Mondaythat Trump would veto the bill.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS politicsUS economyDonald TrumpTariffsEconomicsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

She died on 23 March at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, weeks after her daughter announced she was no longer responding to treatment.Hundreds of mourners entered her service from a walkway lined with American flags at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Institute of Religion on the University of Utah campus. Long tables displayed framed family photos and bouquets of red and white flowers.Love served only two terms in Congress before suffering a razor-thin loss to Democrat Ben McAdams in the 2018 midterm elections as Democrats surged. Yet she left her mark on Utah’s political scene and later leveraged her prominence into becoming a political commentator for CNN.She was briefly considered a rising star in the GOP, but her power within the party fizzled out as Donald Trump took hold. Love kept her distance from the US president and called him out in 2018 for vulgar comments he made about immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and some African nations.Jason Love, her husband, drew laughter from the somber crowd at Monday’s service when he told stories of his wife’s “superpowers”.View image in fullscreenPeyton Love, front center, and Jason Love, right, carry the casket of their mother and wife, Mia Love, to a hearse after her memorial service at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City on Monday.Photograph: Melissa Majchrzak/APHe described discovering her influence after he tried to return the many toasters the couple received as wedding gifts and failing because he didn’t have receipts. His wife then entered the store and came out three minutes later with cash in hand.“I thought: ‘Wow, I have married a Jedi knight,’” he said with a laugh.Her motherhood, he said, was her greatest superpower.“She was an extraordinary mother, and she believed that the most important work she would do within her life was within the walls of her own home with her children,” Jason Love said. “She always made it a special place for each of them to feel loved and to begin to achieve their full potential.”A choir of Love’s friends sang some of her favorite hymns, as well as Ed Sheeran’s Supermarket Flowers. Her children, Alessa, Abigale and Peyton, read an op-ed their mother published in the Deseret News shortly before she died in which she shared her enduring wish for the country to become less divisive.Love’s sister Cyndi Brito shared childhood memories, including how Love used to rehearse all day and night for starring roles in her school plays. She was always the best at everything she did and made everyone around her feel important, her sister said.Brito read an excerpt of a speech her third-grade daughter gave at a recent school assembly for Black History Month honoring Love’s legacy.“Mia Love played many roles and had many titles, but the most important role and the most important title that Mia Love played in my eyes was auntie,” Brito recalled her daughter, Carly, telling classmates.Love did not emphasize her race during her campaigns, but she acknowledged the significance of her election after her 2014 victory. She said her win defied naysayers who suggested a Black, Republican, Mormon woman could not win a congressional seat in overwhelmingly white Utah.On Sunday evening, state leaders and members of the public visited the Utah capitol to pay their respects at Love’s flag-covered coffin behind ropes in the building’s rotunda.Love, born Ludmya Bourdeau, was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2022 and said her doctors estimated she had only 10 to 15 months to live, which she surpassed. With aggressive treatments, Love lived for nearly three years after receiving her diagnosis.Her close friend, Utah’s lieutenant governor, Deidre Henderson, told the audience on Monday that Love had asked her friends and family to rally around her like a campaign team when she was diagnosed.“‘I’m in fight mode,’ she told us, ‘and what I need from you all, more than anything, is to help me fight it. This is a campaign, and we are going to win,’” Henderson recalled.Love entered politics in 2003 after winning a city council seat in Saratoga Springs, 30 miles (48km) south of Salt Lake City. She was elected as the city’s mayor in 2009, becoming the first Black woman to serve as a mayor in Utah.In 2012, after giving a rousing speech at the Republican national convention, she narrowly lost a bid for the US House against the Democratic incumbent. She ran again two years later and won.Explore more on these topicsRepublicansUtahRaceCancerUS CongressUS politicsRepublican national convention 2012newsShareReuse this content"

When police cross-checked the data – and fingerprints – they confirmed it was the same individual.According to what is known so far, Dos Reis began presenting himself as Wickfield in the early 1980s.Police sayhe falsified his birth certificate, entered the University of São Paulo’s law school and began working as a judge in 1995, remaining on the bench until his retirement in 2018.When police uncovered the alleged fraud, he was summoned for questioning. This time identifying himself as Dos Reis, heclaimed that Wickfield was his twin brother, given up for adoption as a child to a noble British couple.He gave no further explanation for the names, though apieceby the Folha de S Paulo newspaper noted that they appear inspired by literature – such as the Round Table’s Lancelot or Mr Wickfield, the lawyer in Charles Dickens’s David Copperfield.A public prosecutor charged Dos Reis with identity fraud and using false documents. Court officers have been unable to locate him, so he has yet to be formally summoned to respond.Last Friday, the São Paulo Court decided to suspend his pension payments as a retired judge – in February alone, he received R$166,413.94 (more than $28,000).Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The actor put his actions down to trying to be amusing in a strained and claustrophobic setting.“We were all stranded in this one room listening to this crazy scene,” he said. “I dunno what prompted me to do it.” The action was one he had previously performed on someone else, he said.“I thought it was funny, and every time it happened, itwasfunny,” continued Murray.He continued: “It was a great disappointment, because I thought I knew someone, and I did not. I certainly thought it was light. I thought it was funny. To me it’s still funny, the idea that you could give someone a kiss with a mask on. It’s still stupid. It’s all it was.”Production was suspended on Being Mortal, directed by Aziz Ansari, after the crew member filed a complaint against Murray, and was eventually shut down completely.The film was backed by Searchlight Films, the production company now owned by Disney, which Murray said he feels handled the incident inappropriately.“It still bothers me because that movie was stopped by the human rights or ‘H&R’ of the Disney corporation,” he said. “It turned out there were pre-existing conditions and all this kind of stuff. I’m like, what? How was anyone supposed to know anything like that? There was no conversation, there was nothing. There was no peacemaking, nothing.”Once production was suspended, Murray said they “went to this lunatic arbitration”, while recommending that “if anyone ever suggests you go to arbitration: Don’t do it. Never ever do it. Because you think it’s justice, and it isn’t.”Shortly after the complaint, Murray had said that he hoped the incident could be resolved swiftly. “We’re talking and we’re trying to make peace with each other,” he said, something he appeared to refer to speaking to the New York Times.“I tried to make peace,” he said. “I thought I was trying to make peace. I ended up being, to my mind, barbecued.View image in fullscreenMurray with Naomi Watts in The Friend.Photograph: Matt Infante/AP“I don’t go too many days or weeks without thinking of what happened in Being Mortal.”Murray, 74, remains one of the US’s most iconic comedians for his roles on Ghostbusters, Saturday Night Live and many of the films of Wes Anderson.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I used to feel guilty about behaving badly, and I met Bill, and it feels so much better.”Murray told Saturday’s New York Times it had taken him many years to reconcile himself to his status as of many people’s most prized celebrity sightings.“I’ve walked down the street with a hat down over my head, glasses on my eyes. I loved Covid,” he said, going on to say that he put “so much energy” into navigating requests for photographs from strangers.“What a screw head,” he said. “So now what I do for a living is, I take cellphone photographs.

However, therevised pageno longer includes these elements, and several references to enslaved people and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 which Tubman as well as the Underground Railroad defied have also been removed.The revised webpage now starts with images of stamps depicting five Black and white abolitionists, includingTubman, with text overlaying the images that reads: “Black/White Cooperation”.In the previous version of the page, the first sentences described the Underground Railroad as “the resistance to enslavement through escape and flight, through the end of the Civil War”, adding that it “refers to the efforts of enslaved African Americans to gain their freedom by escaping bondage”.But now, the first paragraph no longer mentions slavery – which the US abolished in 1865 – and instead describes the Underground Railroad as “one of the most significant expressions of the American civil rights movement”.The second paragraph states that the railroad “bridged the divides of race, religion, sectional differences, and nationality” and “joined the American ideals of liberty and freedom expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution to the extraordinary actions of ordinary men and women working in common purpose to free a people”.These changes were first reported by theWashington Poston Sunday.Since taking office in January, theTrump administrationhas actively worked to roll back initiatives and efforts it sees as related to DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) across the federal government.In February, the Pentagonsent out a memoordering a “digital content refresh” across all defense department public platforms. It involved removing any mentions that “promote diversity, equity and inclusion” from the department’s website postings, photos, news articles and videos.According toCNN, Pentagon officials were instructed to search for keywords like “racism”, “ethnicity”, “LGBTQ”, “history”, and “first” when looking for articles and photos to remove from government-owned sites.And in recent weeks, according tothe Associated Press, thousands of pages honoring contributions by women and minority groups have been removed in an effort to delete material the administration sees as promoting DEI.Two National Park Service employees also toldthe Washington Postthat at the interior department, which oversees the park service, political appointees directed senior career officials there to identify webpages that may need to be changed.In February, the National Park Serviceremoved references to transgender peoplefrom its Stonewall national monument webpage.In mid-March, the defense department made headlines after itremoved a webpagehonoring an army general who served in the Vietnam war and received the country’s highest military decoration – and the letters “DEI” were added to the site’s address.The removal sparked backlash, and the page wasrestored.A spokesperson for the defense department said that the page was taken down mistakenly but defended efforts the administrations efforts to remove content promoting DEI.“I think the president and the secretary have been very clear on this – that anybody that says in the department of defense that diversity is our strength is, is frankly, incorrect,” the spokesperson said.TheWashington Postreported several additional recent changes it has spotted to government-owned webpages, including that a webpage which examined Benjamin Franklin’s relationship with slaverywas taken offlineand now displays the message: “This page is currently being worked on. Please check back later.”Additionally, asectionon the Minute Man National Historical Park webpage about the unrecognized contributions of Black soldiers in the revolutionary war was deleted, the Post reported.Asked about the website changes, a park service spokesperson did not address any specific edits but told theWashington Postthat the agency has “been entrusted with preserving local history, celebrating local heritage, safeguarding special places and sharing stories of American experiences”.“We take this role seriously and can point to many examples of how we tell nuanced and difficult stories about American history,” he added.In late March, Trumpsigned an executive order targeting the Smithsonian Institution,asserting his administration’s intention to eliminate what they consider to be “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” from the prominent cultural and educational establishment, which holds the world’s largest set of museums and research entities.The directive ignited backlash, with critics accusing the administration of attempting to erase diversity from US history.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsSlaveryRacenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s TV that could alter your whole world viewJack SealeMon 7 Apr 2025 17.40 EDTShareWhat They Found, the first documentary by the film and theatre director Sam Mendes, is a short, stark shock. The film straightforwardly combines two precious artefacts held at the Imperial War Museum in London: 35mm film, shot by Sgt Mike Lewis and Sgt Bill Lawrie of the British Army Film and Photographic Unit, before and during the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near the town of Celle in northern Germany in April 1945; and audio interviews given by the cameramen in the 1980s. Lewis and Lawrie did not record sound when they visited Belsen; the words they spoke years later are the only sounds we hear.Lewis and Lawrie do not arrive at Belsen until almost halfway through the film’s 36-minute running time. First, laid over generic archive footage, we hear how they came to be army photographers, and we get a flavour of their prewar civilian life. This is particularly pertinent in the case of Lewis, a son of Jewish immigrants from Poland who looked on in dismay in 1936 as fascists held rallies in his parents’ adopted home country. “I could not, like most English Jews, really believe this of England,” he says. “But the world began to assume a shape more real than those things we were taught about it.”In April 1945, Lewis and Lawrie converge on Celle, filming devastating destruction caused by aerial bombardment: what used to be streets are now discernible by spotting where the rubble is not heaped quite so high. There they meet a handful of Belsen inmates who have already left the camp and are wandering, unwashed, thin and dazed, but apparently not significantly more damaged than other displaced civilians. On hearing about more “political prisoners” who have just been liberated nearby, Lewis thinks this sounds like a less dangerous assignment than the frontline: the term “political prisoners” strikes him as “a bit vague and rather dull”.View image in fullscreenOriginal footage of Bergen-Belsen, shown on What They Found.Photograph: BBC/Imperial War MuseumsBy their own admission, Lewis and Lawrie are not prepared for what is inside the camp gates, having only heard rumours about what the Nazis have been doing to Jews and other minorities. A little like viewers of this film who may have read and heard about theHolocaust, but who have not before encountered moving images of the unique terror of Belsen, what Lewis and Lawrie are about to see will change them and stay with them for ever.First, we are shown extreme closeups of corpses, mouths wide open, deaths anything but peaceful. Next, there are bodies, scores of them, face up and face down on the open space between the camp’s buildings, the camera catching juxtapositions of the dead in the foreground and the living behind.Then come the pictures no one can ever forget. Belsen contained thousands more dead who had to be moved by the truckload to mass graves. Lewis and Lawrie are there as these figures – more shocking because they are naked, more grotesque because starvation has robbed them of a recognisable human shape – are transported to 20ft-deep holes and then thrown, pushed or rolled in, their fragile limbs twisting unnaturally as they fall and join the pile. Lawrie says: “As the days went on, the bodies – they were dummies, they were dolls. You lost contact. Reality went.”These few minutes of the film, surely among the most disturbing images ever shown on British TV, are more or less the whole piece: everything on either side is context and, elsewhere, the austerity of the format – if Lewis and Lawrie don’t explain something, it is not explained – can make What They Found slightly perplexing. Existing knowledge or post-viewing research is required to provide details on, for example, why the Nazi camp guards – described with bitter English reserve by Lewis as “arrogant” – are still present, or why the corpses were disposed of in that way, or why the buildings were all firebombed when the liberation was complete.Often, though, the men find the necessary words. “Why in Germany? What was there about the Germans that made them do this?” muses Lewis, before the tape runs out and the last moments of the film play to blank silence. “The discovery came to me. It was a horrifying discovery. [It was] not only the Germans: any race was capable of it. Anybody, given the circumstances of Germany, could achieve this.”Lewis also talks lucidly about how, despite having been there in person, the camera formed a barrier between him and what he saw. “It pushed the reality of the sights away from me, and protected me.” It is, of course, always the same for us, gazing back from the safety of now. But What They Found forces us to glimpse the clearest and most terrible truth.What They Found aired on BBC Two andis on BBC iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewHolocaustreviewsShareReuse this content"

It feels shocking that it's taken so long for a show like this to existLucy ManganMon 7 Apr 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 17.01 EDTShareIn many ways, Reunion is a fairly conventional thriller. Daniel Brennan (Matthew Gurney) is released from prison after serving a long sentence for killing his childhood friend Ray (Ace Mahbaz). He confessed to the murder but has never explained why he did it. Brennan’s wife died when he was inside and he is now trying to reconnect with his daughter, Carly (Lara Peake), while seeking vengeance (also unexplained) on a figure from his past and putting himself in danger of being recalled to prison as he does so.Beyond Brennan himself, we have Anne-Marie Duff as Ray’s widow, Christine, and Rose Ayling-Ellis as their daughter, Miri, whose fragile new life is hit hard by the news that the killer of their beloved husband and father is out on probation. Christine’s boyfriend, Stephen (Eddie Marsan), is a former police officer and promises to look out for them.What sets Reunion apart is that it takes place at least equally – perhaps even primarily – in the world of Deaf people as in the hearing world. Brennan – and actor Gurney – are deaf from birth, as is Ayling-Ellis/Miri. The production is bilingual, moving between British Sign Language and spoken English. The script, by screenwriter William Mager, who is Deaf, incorporates many salient experiences that come with being without hearing in a society not set up for you, but never skates anywhere close to agitprop.You can feel the waves of rage and frustration roll off Brennan as a prisoner who has been unable to sign – to communicate effectively – for the first six years of his sentence because no accommodations have been made for him. The intricacies of interpretation and the risk those dependent on it must take are clear. “Hang on,” says the BSL interpreter, when Brennan’s probation officer eventually remembers to book her for a meeting with her client’s Deaf parents: “One sign can mean two different things depending on context.” Are his parents trying to talk of their disappointment? Or regret? Imagine a lifetime full of such subtleties, of navigating potential slips and wonder where you would be. There is also a hugely touching moment when the tide of fury swamping Brennan’s troubled daughter – wounded by her mother’s death, her father’s incarceration and (as she sees it) her abandonment by her best friend, Miri, when they were 10 – first recedes, when her father calls her by name. “Long time since I’ve seen anyone sign ‘Carly’,” she says.Hints of the underlying bond between the two boys and the cause of Brennan’s apparently murderous anger towards his friend one fateful night in the pub are given in fragmentary flashbacks, along with possible explanations of why he cannot provide Christine with the answers she desperately wants. Meanwhile, the goodwill extended to him by the probation officer, Anna (Olive Gray), as a result of her failure to provide the necessary interpreter (then the embarrassment of unthinkingly telling him she will call him to confirm his next appointment) is running out as he breaches more terms of his licence. Aggravating that situation is Stephen, who may not be the good guy he appears. Unsettled by his first sight of the late Ray – in a photo on Christine’s fridge – he begins to agitate for Brennan to be recalled. The question of what he has to hide runs alongside the question of what Brennan has to reveal.The performances in Reunion are uniformly excellent (with the possible exception of Marsan’s Sheffield accent – but it’s likely that his presence helped the thing get off the ground, so we will cut the man’s odd vowel sounds some slack) and the seamlessness of Peake’s BSL dialogue had me checking to see whether she is a native speaker. Ayling-Ellis, thanks to her two-year stint as Frankie Lewis in EastEnders, is a known talent but Gurney is a revelation. He is an effortlessly compelling physical presence, but makes Brennan a mass of delicate layers – volatile, but wrapped in the frustrations of circumstance; a grieving widower longing to make up the loss to Carly; a man capable of being the father his damaged child needs but divided against himself by an unexorcised trauma; and a murderer? Maybe. That he has had to wait until now for a lead television role says at least as much about the blinkered, ungenerous world of unchallenged norms we live in as Reunion itself does.Reunion aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

His talent, energy and passion for music were unmatched, and his contributions to our sound and success are immeasurable … His vibrant spirit, infectious enthusiasm and rock solid work ethic touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.”Burke was one of only three band members, alongside Harry and Stein, to play on every one of Blondie’s 11 studio albums. Together the group defined the American new wave sound of the 1970s and 1980s,scoring six UK No 1 hits and four in the US, including Heart of Glass and The Tide Is High.Alongside his work with Blondie, Burke played in supergroups such as the International Swingers, Slinky Vagabond and Magic Christian, and guested with artists as varied as Ramones, Eurythmics, Bob Dylan and Nancy Sinatra.Born and raised in Bayonne, New Jersey, Burke tinkered with local covers groups and a drum corps before moving to New York, auditioning for Blondie in 1975 to replace the band’s original drummer, Billy O’Connor. “My quest was to find my David Bowie, my Jim Morrison or my Mick Jagger to front a band,” he said in 2022. “I was emphatic about that. I needed to work with people that I felt had that sort of charisma and creativity.”He had previously auditioned for Patti Smith, for the band that would end up recording her debut album Horses. “She asked me who my favourite drummer was … I said John Bonham, and I think that might’ve been the wrong answer,” he remembered.Blondie released their debut single, X-Offender, in 1976 but success took a little time to arrive, with Stein and Harry later crediting Burke as the motivating force in the band, convincing Harry not to quit. “He really wanted to get out of New Jersey,” she said.Their first chart success came overseas, in Australia then the UK, with songs such as Denis and Hanging on the Telephone, but the group swept to global fame in 1979, including in their native US, with Heart of Glass. It was powered by a drum machine but Burke was sanguine about this development: “It was threatening, I suppose, at first, but I’ve never really found myself in the situation where a drum machine was going to take over,” he later said.View image in fullscreenBlondie in 1977, with Clem Burke in a polka dot shirt.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesLike the whole band, Burke drew on the cosmopolitanism of late-70s New York, playing high-tempo punkish rhythms or sensual, swaggering disco with equal charisma. “We all had a common aesthetic, whether it be the New York Dolls, or the Velvet Underground, or the Shangri-Las,” he said. Hits continued with Call Me – introduced by a tumbling yet precise Burke drum fill – as well as Atomic, a masterclass in cymbal impact, and The Tide is High, the band’s foray into reggae. The three singles were back-to-back No 1s in the UK.The group’s success tailed off with their 1982 album, The Hunter, and they split later that year. Burke took high-profile sessions with the likes of Bob Dylan, Pete Townshend (“a real gentleman … a dream come true”, Burke said) and Joan Jett. He also worked with the former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones in the supergroup Chequered Past and later joined another Pistols-related supergroup, the International Swingers, with Glen Matlock.He played live with Ramones – “not a happy place to be” – and formed various other supergroups and rock’n’roll outfits including the Empty Hearts. His connection with Iggy Pop began when Blondie toured with him in the late 1970s – Burke later toured in his backing band, and in recent years Burke performed Pop’s Lust For Life album on tour with Matlock and Katie Puckrik. He even appeared with a Blondie tribute act, Bootleg Blondie, while his career with the band itself continued.Blondie reformed for gigs in 1997, and triumphantly returned to the studio: the 1999 album No Exit reached No 3 in the UK and contained another No 1 single, Maria. They continued touring and released four more studio albums.Among those paying tribute to Burke was another of his creative partners, Nancy Sinatra, who wrote: “My heart is shattered. Clem became an icon as a member of Blondie, but he was also a important part of my band, the KAB. I was blessed to call him my friend. If I ever needed him, he was there.”Gerald Casale of Devo said: “His unmatched style and New York City ‘cool’ set the performance standard for decades.”Explore more on these topicsBlondiePop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

But there was reason to celebrate in the Netherlands, too. The bold West End productions Oedipus and The Years, which picked up four awards between them, have their origins atInternationaal Theater Amsterdam (ITA).View image in fullscreen‘We are an international house’ … ITA’s Eline Arbo with her Olivier award.Photograph: Ian West/PAThe theatre’s artistic director is Eline Arbo, who adapted and staged a version of Nobel prize-winner Annie Ernaux’s The Years for an all-female cast. After its success in the Netherlands, Arbo was invited to London’s Almeida theatre to direct the show with British actors. Among them was Romola Garai, who won the Olivier award for best actress in a supporting role, while Arbo was named best director. The production received rapturous reviews and has transferred to the West End where its run (which ends on 19 April) has been accompanied by regular reports of audiences fainting during its abortion scene.Garai calls Arbo a “genius” and said that the production’s power is a result of fusing several elements of theatre-making from around Europe. “Eline is Norwegian so she comes from that tradition of Ibsen. Amsterdam has ITA’s incredible tradition of physical and quite conceptual work. And England has this usually narrative-based, text tradition. I think The Years is a perfect example of how when you marry those elements together you can make really great, exciting work that feels very challenging in the best way to an audience.”Arbo, who became the sixth woman to win the best director Olivier award, said she was delighted by how British audiences had responded to The Years. “There are talks [for ITA] to come more to England,” she said. “For us to be able to show these productions to a British audience, and have that collaboration, is so important. It’s one of our biggest missions: how to share different perspectives from different cultures. We are an international house.” Arbo said that increasingly “politicians want to close borders” but it is vital “to have that exchange of perspective to develop culture”. Brexit, she said, had not been a significant obstacle for her to work in the UK.When Rufus Wainwright’s version of the film Opening Nightflopped in the West End, the composer suggested British audiences lack “curiosity” after Brexit and that the British press had turned on the project for being “too European”. Opening Night was directed by the Belgian Ivo van Hove, Arbo’s predecessor at ITA, who combined a 20-year tenure leading the Dutch ensemble with high-profile, often star-powered freelance productions in London. It was Van Hove who invited Britain’s Robert Icke to Amsterdam to adapt and direct a new version of Sophocles’ Oedipus in 2018. “I’d written an English script that was translated – they acted and talked to each other in Dutch and to me in English,”Icke told the Guardian. “It had the potential to be profoundly alienating but I loved it.View image in fullscreen‘It had the potential to be profoundly alienating’ … Hans Kesting as Oedipus and Marieke Heebink as Jocasta in Oedipus at the Edinburgh international festival in 2019.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIcke won best revival for Oedipus at the Oliviers and said in his acceptance speech that the chance to stage a new version of his adaptation at the Wyndham’s theatre had been “amazing”. After an ensemble of ITA actors performed itat the Edinburgh international festival in 2019, the London production paired Mark Strong, in the title role, with Lesley Manville as Jocasta. Manville, who won the Olivier award for best actress, said that Icke’s time at ITA had “shaped a lot” for him. “After that production he did some reworking of Oedipus. He was very happy and comfortable working in Amsterdam … He obviously saw that it could have another life here.” Its success has left Manville “almost wanting to text Sophocles!” she joked.‘How many litres of blood do we need?’: Ivo van Hove’s ITA on 20 years of shocking theatregoersRead moreThree years ago, Rebecca Frecknall was the toast of the Olivier awards as her version of Cabaret picked up seven prizes. ITA took note of the rising star director. She was invited to Amsterdam to directa version of Strindberg’s Miss Juliewith the ensemble in 2024, designed by another Brit, Chloe Lamford. Earlier this month, Frecknall was announced as ITA’s Ibsen Artist in Residence, a position previously held by Icke. Frecknall said that Arbo had been “a great support in delivering my first ITA production last year” and added: “It’s going to be wonderful to have a home at this incredible theatre for the next three years and to keep working with their talented ensemble of actors.” You wouldn’t be surprised if she and Arbo are back celebrating at the Oliviers before too long.Explore more on these topicsOlivier awardsTheatreAwards and prizesRomola GaraiWest EndNetherlandsIvo van HovenewsShareReuse this content"

In China, where Hollywood blockbusters don’t always connect with a mass audience, the filmearned around $14.5mand dethroned another record-breaker, Ne Zha 2, which becamethe most commercially successful animated film of all time in March.In the UK, the box office was even higher, at £15.5m, making it the strongest performer outside North America.With more than 300m sales and over 140 million players each month, Minecraft is the bestselling video game of all time, with more than 1.3tn views of Minecraft-related videos on YouTube; its developers, Mojang,were acquired in 2014 by Microsoft for $2.5bn.A movie version had been in development since 2014 in conjunction with Hollywood studio Warner Bros, and with the involvement of production company Legendary (Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, Godzilla and Dune), the film started shooting in January 2024.

But now air travel is one big grumble: it’s degrading, everyone is ill-mannered and you used to get free peanuts in this country, but now the peanuts are not free. Air travel, like everything else, is about the politics of resentment. The skies are feeling a lot less friendly, and that’s before you get to a year in which Americans haveexperienced profound tragedy in the air, as well as significant cuts to an already strained Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).In this turbulent time for flying lands Sky Daddy,the unusual debut novel by Kate Folk, a San Francisco author and screenwriter whose short story collection Out Therewas released in 2022. Sky Daddy is narrated by a woman called Linda who, like many of us, lives her life in dogged pursuit of love. She just wants that love to come from a commercial airplane in freefall. “I believed this was my destiny,” Linda tells us, “for a plane to recognize me as his soulmate mid-flight and, overcome with passion, relinquish his grip on the sky, hurtling us to earth in a carnage that would meld our souls for eternity.”Yes, Linda is kind of the female protagonist for whom the descriptor “quirky” is not quite strong enough. She gets off on simulations of aviation accidents. She calls airport terminals her own “personal red-light districts”. Her style of objectifying airplanes is impressive: she admires their “testicular engines” and ogles at a “naughty landing gear shot”. The Boeing 737 is the “sky’s narrow-bodied workhorse”, the Airbus A320 has the “handsomest face of any commercial airliner”.And then there is the retired McDonnell Douglas DC-9, an airplane that she says “flaunts a ‘bad-boy’ image” given itshistorically spotty safety record. Linda spends as much time as her paltry salary affords her up in the sky. “Like dating,” she tells us, “death by plane crash is a numbers game.”Sky Daddy is a very strange and very funny book. But it does not exist as mere provocative gag, or mean-spirited attempt to belittle one woman’s absurd romantic delusions. Linda defies diagnosis: her aims are more spiritual than they are symptomatic. “She’s a singular character,” says Folk. “I kind of imagine her as a real person, it’s hard for me to accept that [she’s] just something I’ve made up.”When Folk was a child growing up in landlocked Iowa, she read a version of Moby-Dick that was modified for children. What stood out to her most was the description of Ishmael’s experience of waking up as a child and feeling a ghostly presence hold his hand. “A supernatural hand seemed placed in mine,” writes Melville, “and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery.” It had a lasting effect on Folk. “I still never sleep with my hand outside the covers,” says Folk. “Because I’m afraid of that happening and I don’t want to invite it.”View image in fullscreenKate Folk.Photograph: Andria LoLater, when she was drafting a novel about a woman sexually obsessed with airplanes, she returned to Melville’s classic. “I saw Linda as a mixture of Ishmael and Ahab,” says Folk, adding that she felt both her work and Melville’s were about humans trying to dominate the natural world. “Both planes and whales involve oil.” She loved the many different registers of Melville’s novel, its playfulness and its enthusiastic anthropomorphizing of whales. “It’s very silly a lot of the time,” says Folk. “Calling them gentlemen and fellows.”Linda too has a strict understanding of how things in her fantasy world are sexed and gendered: “I allowed people to assume I was heterosexual,” she explains, “and I suppose I was, as all planes are male in spirit, just as all boats are female, and helicopters possess the souls of mischievous children.”Unlike Ishmael and Ahab however, Linda is a creature of the internet. “That’s how she’s fueled her obsession,” Folk says. “It’s how she researches her plane lovers and keeps tabs on them, and looks at past plane incidents.” Linda’s life revolves around planes, but her passion is sustained by her work as a content moderator in the Hate & Harassment sector of a tech company, where she and her colleagues make near minimum wage scrubbing the internet of its various maladies: violent images, crude and predatory pornography, onslaughts of verbal threats and assaults. Their office amenities are a yoga ball in a so-called wellness room and monthly pallets of Rockstar lemonade. Sky Daddyis a workplace novel as much as it is an epic romp. “It’s this unseen pool of workers who are doing this like terrible labor that supports our use of the internet,” explains Folk. “They’re absorbing the trauma for our sakes.”The fact that Kate Folk dreamt up and drafted this book years before the recent spate of high-profile plane crashes filled the news, and before the new administration firedseveral hundred workers at the FAA, is a coincidence. But it’s also not. Governments have a special way of corrupting and polluting those things that literally keep us afloat: social services, environmental protections, any semblance of a humane healthcare system. There is no premium on the dignity of human life in the US. To be an American is to believe fundamentally in the power of one’s destiny.But Sky Daddyreminds us that air travel in a way is the opposite of the agentic American dream. To get on a plane is to submit to a fate you have no control over. “Even in better times when there weren’t these incidents … it is such an act of surrender,” explains Folk. “When I get on a plane, I really am not in control of what happens. I have to just put my faith in the machine and also in the pilots and air traffic control and everyone working to make sure the flight gets to where it’s going safely.”View image in fullscreen‘Even in better times when there weren’t these incidents … it is such an act of surrender.’Photograph: Jeffrey Milstein/Gatwick Airport/PAThen there is the existential question of the climate crisis, and how it threatens to upend any notion of the future we might have previously conceived. Theday the sky in San Francisco turned a shocking orange due to wildfiresmoke haunts Folk’s fiction. The distinction between literary fiction and sci-fi or genre fiction became less meaningful to her. “Basically my entire life is just this sense of hurtling toward a catastrophe,” she says, referring to the climate crisis.Linda’s obsession with flying is part of that. Her death drive, her lust for this carbon-intensive mode of travel, is inevitable ending; it’s not hard to feel like to some degree we are all Linda, hurtling towards a fiery conclusion. “There is no greater intimacy than to be fellow passengers on a doomed flight,” Linda tells us. She is an accelerationist. She dreams of self-annihilation, sure. But she also dreams of being chosen. She hopes her life amounts to something more than eating work-grade string cheese and deleting lewd comments on a video of a busty kindergarten teacher reading The Very Hungry Caterpillar.During our conversation, I got the sense that Folk had a fond appreciation for her fictional character Linda, which I shared. Linda is a little freak for sure, but she’s endearing to me, and somewhat pure (I like how she calls joints “cannabis cigars”.)Maybe I could learn something from her. It just so happened that the week Folk and I were talking, both of us were taking flights. I asked her if she wanted to text me when she was taking off, to see what she noticed about the miracle of flight to which I had maybe been deadened and desensitized. I told her I would do the same.She texted me in the middle of the day that she was boarding aninfamous Boeing 737 Max, the model that made headlines for its previous history of nosedives.Linda would love that, I thought.“We’re turning left,” Folk wrote. “A plane is like a bird,” she added, “clumsy and slow on the ground.” Then she told me the engines were firing up and changing tenor. What was the inadvertent rhythm of our conversation reminding me of? I thought. And then with a little pang of shame, I realized it had the faint whiff of sexting.Two days later I was crawling through that yonic jet bridge, feeling dispirited. Historically I have been afraid of flying or at least dreaded it. I was on Linda’s beloved 737-800/900 (“a long boy”, Kate texted me when I told her), and it looked dingy, worn-in and world weary.But then we began to move, the wings wobbling as we inched forwards on the tarmac, a polite row of seemingly animate planes lining up behind us. And then we lifted off into the sky. I could see all of Manhattan and Brooklyn before me: the wide sandy beaches of the Rockaways where I swim every summer, the dark patch of cemetery by my apartment, the skyscrapers in the distance. I held their gaze until suddenly everything was vaporous and white, occluded by cloud. I had no romantic attachments to the plane, but I could feel the eternal romance of it, Like maybe Linda was holding my hand as we flew closer to the sun and left the whole world behind.Sky Daddy by Kate Folk (Hodder & Stoughton, £18.99).

As the Filter’s researcher, it’s my job to not only help find and source products but also rehome them when they’re finished with. I’ve been tasked with getting everything, fromblenderstoelectric toothbrushesand evenfood, from writers’ homes across the country to charities that can benefit from them the most.For some samples, such as leftovers fromthe food filter series, choosing where to donate them was a no-brainer: theCopenhagen Street food bank, which is dedicated to alleviating food poverty in Islington, London, where the Guardian is based.For others, including electrical items, it’s harder. I know, I know: giving away nearly new, top-of-the-range products should be a breeze, but it can be trickier than you think.Take electric toothbrushes. When I was asked to organise donating those we’d reviewed (just the bases, not the used heads obviously), I thought the biggest obstacle would be finding a charity that would take them – many don’t for hygiene reasons. However, modern slavery charityCausewaysaid it could put them to good use; it distributes bedding, clothing and toiletries to help bridge the poverty gap. We just needed to get them to the charity’s Sheffield storage unit.The real challenge began with getting the toothbrushes collected from the writer’s home. After four courier “attempts”, and a frustrated writer who’d stayed in all day – sorry, Alan! – we were forced to change tack. Thanks to a different courier company, the package was collected on the fifth go. Two delivery attempts in Sheffield later (I was close to the edge when the first one failed), and the toothbrushes successfully made it to Causeway’s storage unit.It was worth it. “Having these great-quality electric toothbrushes has been brilliant,” says Causeway’s LifeSupply coordinator Mary Tear. “We will be distributing these to our service users and their families to help with their health, hygiene and budgets.”Rehome is where our heart isView image in fullscreenAll cleaned up with nowhere to go.Photograph: Rachel OgdenUnpredictable courier companies are just one hurdle, though. When I was asked to arrange a collection of kitchen blenders from our writer’s home in south London, I quickly learned that there would be no doorstep charity collections in her area for weeks. To speed things along, we had them sent to the office, assuming we’d easily find a charitable home for them around central London. But I soon discovered that many charities don’t take electrical items full stop, let alone collect them. After calling about eight shops (even walking to one that wasn’t answering the phone to ask in person), I was relieved to find one that took them at all and ferried them over myself a few at a time, taking three trips in total.And it’s not just box-fresh blenders that we go the extra mile to rehome.

Congratulations – you’re growingRather than running away from disappointment, we need to face it and learn from it. Otherwise we will never try anything newMoya SarnerMon 7 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTShareIdon’t remember the context in which my psychoanalyst first brought to my attention how much I hate to feel disappointed. I do remember that I laughed. Who doesn’t hate it? That’s why it’s called disappointment, as Seinfeld would say.But then I reflected on what she had said, and it really made me think.I began to wonder why it is that disappointment is so particularly loathsome for me – even more than grief, or pain, or envy. I hate the way it makes me feel a little bit sick, as if I’m keeping it in my body so I don’t have to let it into my mind. I hate the way it makes my throat hurt, as if tears would come if I let them, but I won’t – or can’t. I hate the way I struggle even to recognise it because I am working so hard, unconsciously, to keep it at a murky distance.But, unfortunately, I have learned through my work as a therapist, and my work as a patient in analysis, and through my experience of life, that disappointment – as detestable as it is – is absolutely vital. Counterintuitive as it sounds, I think a better life is one with more disappointment in it.If we are too afraid of this feeling, we will remain stuck where we are, unable even to step outside the front door. It is easy to see how seeking to avoid disappointment could lead us never to try anything new, never to embark on a new relationship in case it ends badly, never to apply for a new job in case we don’t get it, never to take a risk on something we might enjoy or might not enjoy. This, of course, is the surest way to live a disappointing life. Allowing this feeling in and listening to it is crucial for learning from experience and working out what is truly important to us. I used to consciously lower my expectations so that I didn’t have to feel disappointed if something didn’t work out – but I’ve realised now that this is just another way of turning away from something that really needs to be faced.But I think it goes even deeper than that. I think the experience of being disappointed and tolerating that feeling establishes the foundations for all mental health.You may not like Freud’s theory of the oedipal complex; many don’t. His revolutionary conceptualisation of family dynamics – that every child feels desire for the parent of the opposite sex, and murderous rage towards the parent of the same sex (and, at the same time, desire for the parent of the same sex, and murderous rage towards the parent of the opposite sex) – is a shocking thing to contemplate, as shocking today as it was when he wrote about it in 1899.Critics have come up with all sorts of defences against the truth of this theory, and abusers have tried to corrupt it to defend their indefensible acts. I think there is a great deal of meaning in the shape of it and, much as I would like to, I find it impossible to deny that every child, deep down, wants to have each of their parents all to themselves, and to get rid of all rivals that stand in their way. I have seen how this can play out in different dramas throughout a person’s life, and how many of our relationship difficulties echo this triangularity, from children “stealing” each other’s friends at school, to adults “stealing” each other’s partners. There’s a lot of it about.The only healthy conclusion of this triangle is for the child to be disappointed. Every son and daughter has to come to terms with the fact that they cannot marry their mummy or their daddy, they cannot take the place of either parent, because they are a child. They might feel they want to be a grownup, might feel absolutely desperate to be elevated above their siblings, might enjoy feeling helpful or responsible – but they have a deeper need to be treated as a child, with all the disappointments that brings.As I learned in my training, and in my own life, if a child steps into the role of an adult too early, they can end up with a sense of themselves as someone who looks like an adult on the outside, but who doesn’t feel as if they’ve really grown up on the inside.So as I try to help my daughter to bear her disappointments in the most understanding and loving and robust way I can, I am also in a process of developing my own capacity to tolerate my version of this feeling. I can understand why she is outraged and disappointed when I tell her no – and sometimes I find myself wanting to say yes out of fear of her reaction, especially if we are in a public place – but how will she ever be brave enough to say no if I’m too afraid to? I often notice that after the tears and the comforting, she seems to feel more settled, more held than she did before. But it is hard: apart from anything else, I am trying to help her digest something that I find quite indigestible myself.Some good friends recently told me their young son was crying and raging because, in his words, “I want everything that I want.” It’s cute when it’s a child, but I think there are many adults who still haven’t grown out of this, who rage and fight against the word “no”. The truth is, we all have our moments. One of the lessons my friends are helping their son to learn, which we all have to re-learn again and again throughout adulthood, is that sometimes – perhaps all the time – you cannot have everything that you want. It’s a very painful fact of life, and it is extremely disappointing. But, out of that rich and fertile disappointment, a better life can grow.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I sometimes use purple sweet potato, but you get a nicer colour contrast with the bog-standard orange variety. The beetroot will still have a little bite after 30 minutes in the oven, so if you prefer it completely soft, cut it into smaller chunks or use precooked instead.Spiced roast sweet potato and beetroot with chickpeas and fetaThis easy weeknight dish is even nicer the next day, so it’s worth making the full amount even if you’re cooking for fewer people.Prep15 minCook40 minServes2-32tbsp olive oil3 generoustsp baharat1tsp sea salt flakes3garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated600g sweet potato, cut into 1½cm-thick half-moons (and quartered if the potatoes are very large)450g fresh beetroot, peeled and cut into 1½cm wedges400g tin chickpeas, drained and rinsed1 red onion, peeled and very finely sliced1 lemon, juiced½tsp sea salt200g feta, roughly crumbled25g fresh coriander, roughly choppedGreek yoghurt, to serveHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.

Even a whiff of beef can keep me up at night. As a journalist, I’ve learned to listen and to probe only gently, never raising my voice or outwardly judging. Yet, for a long time – until quite recently – I would occasionally engage in fierce political arguments with certain friends and family members.The trigger would usually be a passing comment about, say,renewable energy, the character of Boris Johnson or the#MeToo movement. Wine often had a place at the table. It never involved swearing or insults, but there would follow a familiar spiral: a steady increase in volume, a hardening of tone, a grasping for poorly remembered evidence, an admission that “we’re just going round in circles here”, followed by another go around anyway.Eventually, both sides would realise the futility of it all and we would move to safer conversational territory, nobody having gained ground or anything else. Or we would withdraw altogether from a dinner-table war zone strewn with failed zingers and Quality Street wrappers. Sometimes, I could hear myself saying something like: “It’s good to have these debates,” while also immediately regretting them.So, at some point in the past year or so, I decided to quit fighting. I am always reading about terminally fractured families and friendships. I’ve seen it happen. I like to think my peacemaker instincts would have prevented permanent damage in my own circle, but if differences are aired without hope of resolution, then what’s the point? Doing so can only create stress and ill will. I don’t need that.The one change that worked: I loathed all forms of exercise – until I moved to a big city and walked milesRead moreWhen triggers crop up, I hold myself back, changing the subject or laughing off an objectionable statement. I say things like: “Yeah, it’s a tricky one, isn’t it?” or: “It’s such a mess!”It’s not surprising that ever more polarised politics these days are straining friendships and family ties. Brexit, Trump, the climate and cost of living crises, as well as widening gaps in generational thinking, have bred resentment and entrenchment. I feel like we have become more suspicious of the morals and motivations of those we disagree with.I also think we tend to clash with the person we think sits across the aisle or the dinner table, assuming that they are more extreme in their views and political leaning than perhaps they are. Ad hominem arguments are even less effective when one’s true adversary isn’t actually in the room.There is merit in testing our beliefs, outside our bubbles, but there are ways to do that without threatening close relationships. Ducking out may look cowardly, not least when the stakes feel so high. I prefer to see myself as a conscientious objector. I try to look for common ground, rather than the battleground, and try harder to understand where people are coming from along the way. At the risk of sounding virtuous, it feels good. I recommend it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This must be affecting unsuspecting fans at every match.I had been directed to park on a nearby street by men wearing hi-vis jackets with “official match day parking” written on them. They demanded a £10 parking fee in cash. I later discovered they were rogue operators and that they had tricked me into parking on private land.The operatorthat enforces parking rules on the road, Ocean Parking,has admitted to me thatit has known for years that this scam is happening onits client’s property.It seems disgraceful that Oceanis profitingamid this criminal activity.GT, BoltonThis scam has been going on for at least five years, judging by social media threads, meaning that the con artists (and legitimate ­parking enforcers) have been making thousands of pounds from unwitting drivers. Your ire is understandable.Since the council, the police, Ocean andManchester Unitedare aware of the fraud, why are criminals still getting away with it? I put this to Greater Manchester police, which told me to ask the council.Old Trafford council, which does warn of the scam on its website but you’d have to be looking to find it, confirmed it was aware of the problem. “The council undertakes patrols to identify and prevent the use of illegal popup car parks and takes part in joint operations with Greater Manchester police,” said a spokesperson. So far, so ineffectual.I asked Manchester United what it was doing to warn fans. It said the streets in question had ­nothing to do with the stadium and fans should book official match-day parking.What about Ocean, which charges the misdirected drivers three-­figure sums for parking on the ­privately owned land? It refused to disclose how much it makes from event-day parking contraventions. It told me it shared “the frustration” of those who had been affected and had been aware of illegal activity on event days for the “some considerable time” it had managed the area.It says it alerts police when its patrols spot the fraudsters and in a recent policy change only issues PCNs for very specific contraventions on match days. “The road has marked double-yellow lines as well as contractual warning signage, which states: ‘No Parking or Waiting at Any Time’,” said a spokesperson. “However, we recognise that drivers who are deceived may mistakenly believe they are parking legally.”Your appeal against the PCN was thrown out by the Independent Appeals Service, by which time the charge had risen from £100 to £170. The adjudicator stated they sympathised with your situation but that extenuating circumstances could not be taken into account. Sadly, therefore, you have no option but to pay up or risk court action.The lesson for all of us is study the signs in streets and car parks before parking and be suspicious of any instruction to ignore them.Explore more on these topicsScamsYour problems, with Anna TimsConsumer affairsManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Drivers of EVs have lost their exemption from the tax and also have to pay an “expensive car supplement” for five years if a new vehicle costs more than £40,000, which many do.The move has prompted concern that people will be put off buying EVs.Buyers of petrol and diesel cars will face charges that are often double what they were last year if they buy a new vehicle.How does VED work?Sometimes called car tax, VED is paid every year by drivers of cars, vans, motorcycles and other vehicles for using the public roads in the UK.How much you pay in VED depends on when your car was first registered.If it was between March 2001 and April 2017, you will pay a rate based on the amount of ­carbon dioxide emissions from the ­vehicle. The lower the emissions, the lower the tax. This applies to a car that was bought new before 2017 or a ­secondhand vehicle. The duty ranges from £20 up to £760.For cars registered since then, drivers pay under a different ­system. For the first year of registration, they have to pay a “showroom tax”, which is based on the vehicle’s CO₂ emissions. After that first year, they then pay a flat rate. If the car is worth more than £40,000, then they have to pay an additional £425 tax for the second to the sixth year after registration.For the first time, EVs have been brought into the tax system this year, having previously been exempt. Owners now also have to pay the same standard rate after a lower rate for the first year if it is a new vehicle and pay the “expensive car” levy if it is new and cost more than £40,000.How much have prices increased?For someone buying a new petrol or diesel car, the first year’s tax could be double what it was last year.For example, that new 1-litreFord Puma,with 122g/km of emissions, now costs double what it did last year. The bill then goes down to the new standard rate of £195.The owner of a newLand Rover Defender, which has emissions of 240g/km, now has to pay £4,680 in the first year. The cost was half that last year. The vehicle will also be hit with the £425 expensive car tax for five years. This has also increased, from £410 last year.The standard rate payable from year two onwards, for cars registered since 2017, goes from £190 to £195. Up to 1 April, EV buyers were exempt from the tax but now have to pay £10 for the first year and the standard rate after that.The significant change for cars registered between 2001 and 2017 is that vehicles that emit less than 100g/km, which includes many hybrid cars, will also have to pay tax at £20, instead of nothing.Future salesWhen the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced the changes to the tax system in the budget last October, she said they would increase demand for EVs as the gap between what was paid for electric and petrol or diesel cars was being widened.But some commentators say that the move now makes it more ­difficult to go electric, as the ­overall cost has been increased by the scrapping of the exemption.John Cassidy, the managing ­director of sales at Close Brothers Motor Finance, says some buyers are already put off by a limited battery charging infrastructure for EVs. “Applying VED to EVs provides one less incentive for buyers to make the switch,” he says.View image in fullscreenAutomatic number-plate recognition cameras monitor cars on the road for compliance.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesJon Lawes, the managing director of Novuna Vehicle Solutions, a Surrey-based firm that supplies fleets of cars to companies, says most EVs cost more than £40,000 and will be subject to the expensive car supplement. This may prompt employers to look for cheaper ­alternatives to EVs, he says.Lorna Macpherson, a motor finance expert at Ocean Finance, which offers car loans, says that while the changes to the tax regime do make cleaner cars cheaper to run, drivers may be ­unable to switch due to the rising cost of motoring.“For petrol and diesel cars, an increase in VED means higher ­running costs for owners, ­making newer, more efficient cars even more attractive,” she says. “But with rising interest rates on car finance and the general cost of living ­crisis, many will hold on to their ­current vehicles for longer rather than upgrading.”Vauxhall says all of its EVs are now priced below £40,000, so that the expensive car supplement does not apply. Macpherson says other manufacturers with cars around the same price could follow suit.Paying your VEDYou will be reminded of when your vehicle excise duty is to be paid at the end of the month before it is due. The car can be taxed for six or 12 months. You are liable for VED once you own the car. You need to tax the vehicle before it can be used on the road.A network of automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) cameras around the country monitor cars on the road for compliance.If you don’t pay your car tax – which can be done online or on the phone via the DVLA - you can be issued with a fine for £80, which is reduced to £40 if paid within 33 days. If this is unpaid, it is referred to a debt-collection agency. If you use the untaxed vehicle on a road, an out-of-court settlement letter can be issued, which demands £30 plus one-and-a-half times the cost of the outstanding tax. If that is not paid, the case can be pursued through the magistrates court.Explore more on these topicsCar taxThe ObserverTaxMotoringAutomotive industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Well, a week or so ago, I lived this joke when I reached for a dishcloth that was, rather oddly, sitting on a plate, and for a nanosecond I thought that things really had reached a low for the cloth to be not just grubby, but slimy. That was before I realised I was about to pick up an aubergine and future baba ganoush.Other things occurred that evening, too, and in the end the aubergine was put in Tupperware with some peeled cloves of garlic and a squeeze of lemon (which I hoped might preserve it), and the box put in the fridge. It should not be a confession for a food writer whose job is to be resourceful, but I am going to admit it anyway: every time I put sealed Tupperware in the fridge, I wonder if it will get out in time. Quite often, it doesn’t, which also confirms a friend’s observation that putting Tupperware in the fridge is the equivalent of telling someone you will call them back, then forgetting. Happily, this box did come out in time (the very next day, in fact), and the contents – which still looked like a dishcloth, but a welcome one – had almost become baba ganoush.It was lunchtime, and we had a packet of gnocchi to eat up. That was the reason I heated everything up, mashed the fillets of aubergine with a fork, took out the peeled garlic, minced it and mixed it in with red chilli flakes and a bit more lemon juice, then tossed the lot through cooked gnocchi. We enjoyed the almost velvet-like dishcloth cream so much that I made something similar a few days later, only this time cooking cubed aubergine in a frying pan. I have also roasted it, and I am hoping someone will give me notes about air-frying some, too. However you cook the aubergine, though, remember that the aim is a soft, beige cream, and to add chilli, garlic and lemon to taste, while keeping in mind that it will be mixed with gnocchi (shop-bought or homemade) or pasta (fusilli,mafalde, ridged tubes).I suggest topping this with grated salted ricotta because it goes so well with aubergine – plus I’m thinking of pasta alla Norma and other Sicilian dishes. That said, parmesan, pecorino, grana padano or a spoonful of ordinary ricotta (in which case, add a bit of lemon zest, too) will work just as well, along with more chilli flakes or a few turns of black pepper.Gnocchi or pasta with aubergine, red chilli, lemon and salted ricottaServes41 large or 2 medium aubergines4-6 tbspextra-virgin olive oilSaltDried red chilli flakes1-2garlic cloves, peeled and mincedA squeeze of lemon juiceSalted ricotta, or parmesan or pecorino, grated, to serve400-500ggnocchi or pasta(fusilli, mafalde, ridged tubes)Use a potato peeler to pare strips off the aubergine, so it looks like a zebra crossing. Cut the aubergine into 2cm chunks, put them in a bowl and toss with olive oil and a good pinch of salt.You now have two choices. The first is to fry the aubergine cubes in a large frying pan over a medium-low heat, moving them around regularly, until they start softening. Then add a dash of water and cover so they half-fry/half-braise, until very soft. Add a generous pinch of chilli flakes, the garlic, a squeeze of lemon juice and a bit more oil and salt, if you think it needs it. Cook for a minute more, so it is creamy not watery.The other way is to spread the aubergine cubes on a baking tray and bake at 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½ for 20-30 minutes, turning halfway, until soft and just a little golden (you don’t want them to be crisp). Tip the cubes into a frying pan, mash gently and, as before, add a generous pinch of chilli flakes, the garlic, a squeeze of lemon and a bit more olive oil and salt if you think it needs it. Cook for a minute more, so the mix is creamy and not watery.Meanwhile, cook the gnocchi or pasta in plenty of fast-boiling salted water untilal dente, then drain or lift directly into the aubergine pan. Toss well, then divide between plates and serve topped with grated cheese and more chilli flakes or black pepper.Explore more on these topicsPastaA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkFoodMain courseVegetablesCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

In the lower parts of town, rustic charm turns into abandonment – branches grow out of walls and roofs have fallen in. The only bar closed at Christmas, after the owner died. Some “For Sale” signs have been up so long the phone number is illegible.The town, with its faded ochre and orange hues, is listed as one of Italy’sI Borghi più belli(an association of historic towns). In 1920, about 5,000 people lived here, now thepopulation is 390. It resembles many others in Italy’s south-central Abruzzo region, home to a shrinking, ageing population. One nearby town has been almost completely abandoned, and is home to just 12 people.View image in fullscreenA postcard of Pettorano sul Gizio from about 1920, when the town’s population was 5,000.Photograph: Angela Tavone/Rewilding ApenninesBut Pettorano sul Gizio is different – set apart by its passion for bears. A lifesize model of a brown bear and cub stands in the town square, and paintings of bears look down from the walls.At dawn and dusk, a bear known as Barbara is known to wander the narrow streets – sometimes trailed by cubs – to see if she can pilfer any food.Now known as “the town that went wild”, it has attracted a new crowd of younger people working in nature restoration. Yet, making peace with the town’scritically endangered Marsican, or Apennine, bears(Ursus arctos marsicanus), which are endemic to the Abruzzo region,was not easy.View image in fullscreenAn adult Marsican, or Apennine, brown bear in Abruzzo.Photograph: Bruno D’Amicis/NPLThe biggest threat to the bears is humans, so conservationists realised that people living in these remote towns needed to want to protect them.There was a climate which was against the bear. We had to do something in a more practical wayMario CipolloneOne reason the bear population is doing so well is because so many people left the region. A blurred photo of the village in 1905 shows hills stripped bare by grazing livestock and deforestation caused by thecarbonari, or charcoal-makers.After the second world war, as Italy’s economy boomed, rural people left to work in the cities. As human pressure on the landscape declined,nature bounced back– the Marsican brown bear population now numbers about 60 individuals, and appears to be increasing. But the people who remained had forgotten how to live alongside large predators.View image in fullscreenBear claw marks on tree bark in an Abruzzo beech forest.Photograph: Bruno D’Amicis/NPL/AlamyRelations were at their worst 10 years ago during the reign of Peppina, a 135kg“problem bear”, who raised cubs in the area for several years. She was known for her raids on people’s chickens, bees and orchards, hoovering up any food she could find. Mario Cipollone, of Rewilding Apennines, says she was “most vicious in these raids”.In 2014, tensions between local people and animals came to head when a young male bear was shot by a hobby farmer after it raided a chicken coop. Many people supported the man, who claimed he was attacked by the bear. There are no documented cases of Marsican bears killing humans, and they are generally shy and avoid contact with people.Cipollone says: “There was a climate which was against the bear.” The bear’s death created a paradigm shift. “We had to do something in a more practical way,” he says.View image in fullscreenMario Cipollone, of Rewilding Apennines, with a bear-proof bin in Pettorano sul Gizio.Photograph: Angela Tavone/Rewilding ApenninesSo in 2015, Pettorano sul Gizio became the first“bear-smart” communityin Italy. Electric fences were erected around more than 100 properties to protect bees, chickens and other farm animals; gates and bear-proof bins were installed; and manuals on how best to live alongside bears were distributed around Pettorano sul Gizio and the neighbouring town of Rocca Pia.These places make me think that we can do something, that best practices really existValeria BarbiResidents are urged not to leave food out; ripe fruit is picked off the ground in orchards and food waste kept indoors until the rubbish is collected. Since 2014, “there has been a dramatic decline in damage”, says Cipollone.Peppina’s successor, Barbara, prowls the alleyways of Pettorano sul Gizio but she no longer causes any damage. By 2017, there had been a 99% reduction in bear raids compared with three years earlier, according todata from Salviamo L’Orso, a bear conservation organisation, who also says there have been no damages since 2020.“The amount of damage has almost been eradicated,” says Cipollone. “We made everything bear-proof.”View image in fullscreenAn infographic in Pettorano sul Gizio outlining the lifestyle and habits of the Mariscan bears.Photograph: Phoebe Weston/The GuardianOther European countries are taking note. There are now18 bear-smart communitiesacross Europe, funded by the EU’s Life environmental programme.While depopulation may have drawn bears to the region, in Pettorano sul Gizio bears are now bringing back people.It’s not just about tourism.

In November voters are set to choose a governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and house of delegates. The election will be a bellwether not only for Trump’s presidency buttech billionaire Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, which has hit Virginia hard because of its proximity to the federal government.Wisconsin and Florida races give jolt of energy to Democrats in fight against TrumpRead more“It is his work and efforts that are going to be litigated in this election,” saidHeather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), which focuses on building power at state level. “We see the Doge efforts take on a local spin, meaning they’re not just talking about the machete that he wielded without any care or concern but the very real local impact and how it is affecting individuals.”Republican victories in last year’s elections for the White House and both chambers of Congress plunged Democrats into recriminations and soul searching. AnNBC poll last monthfound that just 27% of registered voters have positive views of the party, its lowest rating since the question was first asked in 1990. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, recently described the Democratic brand as “toxic”.But the party’s favoured candidate, Susan Crawford, overcame $25m in spending from Musk last week todefeat a conservative opponentfor a seat on Wisconsin’s state supreme court. Democrats also slashed Republicans’ margins in two ruby red congressional districts in Florida, while in Washington DC, Senator Cory Booker deliveredan epic 25-hour speechthat suggested a party rediscovering its mojo.Democrats see state legislators as crucial in pushing back against harmful policies emanating from the White House and have beenthriving in special electionsso far this year. They have defended majorities in five chambers and over-performed by 10 points on average, flipping two districts that Trump won by double digits.On Monday the DLCC will attempt to build on the momentum by launching a Roadmap to Victory in Virginia memo, including a list of target races in November andanongoing seven-figure investment in the house of delegates, whereDemocratshave a narrow 51-49 majority.Unusually, the DLCC is also adding the highly consequentiallieutenant governor’srace to its target map to secure the ability to win tie-breaking votes in the state senate, where Democrats currently have a one-seat margin.The memo describes legislative Democrats in Virginia as being on the frontlines responding to Trump’s chaos and havoc, while Republicans such as the governor,Glenn Youngkin, expressed support for Doge cuts. State Republicans unanimously voted against a constitutional amendment to protect abortion access and voted nearly entirely in lockstep against a ban on assault weapons.Democrats claim to be seeing mounting enthusiasm and have launched campaigns in 97 of 100 districts, whereasRepublicanshave recruited candidates for just 63 districts. The memo observes: “Opportunities to move policy and build power aren’t happening in Washington – they’re happening in the statehouses.”Youngkin is ineligible to run in November because Virginia bars governors from seeking consecutive terms in office. Instead Winsome Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, will be the Republican nominee in the gubernatorial race whileAbigail Spanbergeris the presumptive nominee for the Democrats.North Carolina judges back Republican colleague in bid to toss votes and overturn electionRead moreWilliams said:“Democrats have been winning elections again. Voters made it clear in 2024 that their issues were around the economy and affordability and economic opportunity, and they asked their elected officials to pay attention to that.“What we are seeing in these election results is an understanding that Republicans are unfocused and harming communities when they needed support and government to work on their behalf. Voters are not standing for it.”The DLCC advocates a back-to-basics approach of grassroots organising and face-to-face conversations with voters, addressing issues such as housing, US healthcare prices and wages. Williams said: “You’ve got Democrats in the legislature or candidates who are putting forth agendas around the economy and affordability and trying to address the very real, honest issues that Americans are dealing with.”Last week’s election results were ominous for Republicans in Virginia, a state that DemocratKamala Harris wonby six percentage points. Trump’s slashing of the federal government, chaotic tariffs and threats to social security could galvanise Democrats while turning off independent and moderate Republicans.Williams commented: “Yes, Trump is responsible for this, Elon Musk is responsible for this, but local Republicans are also complicit. They are falling in line with a reckless approach to government and a reckless political party withDonald Trumpat the helm. They don’t get off the hook.”Musk burst onto the political stage last year, spending nearly $300m supporting Trump and other Republican campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission filings. On Wednesday, the world’s richest person donned a cheesehead hatand gave out $1m chequesto two Wisconsin voters, declaring them spokespeople for his political group and claiming that the supreme court election was vital to “the future of civilisation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gleeful Democrats pleaded for him to come to their districts and campaign for their Republican opponents in next year’s midterms. Wisconsin congressman Mark Pocantold the Axios website: “I’ll pay for his coach flight.”Musk’s indiscriminate and unconstitutional assault on the government has had an outsized impact onVirginia, which is home to thousands of federal workers who commute to Washington as well as some key military bases.Williams observed: “Government is very present in Virginia and it has served them historically well. You’ve got hard workers doing good things, protecting our country, and they’re being tossed around as if nothing matters and that is going to have a big impact.”But having become addicted to Musk’s patronage, Republicans will struggle to untether themselves. “He committed to buy elections and he’s not getting out of that because Republicans are going to need money to save themselves in these races.“They’re going to be up against voters who are unwilling to be bought or have that level of assumption about what can move them. Musk is going to be a part of this. Republicans are going to need his resources and we’re going to continue to hear about this all election cycle.”Don Scott, a Democrat who last year becamethe first Black speakerin the Virginia house of delegates’ 400-year history, agrees that Musk will continue to cast a long shadow.“I think Republicans are begging him to come to Virginia because they have not gotten the memo from Wisconsin and Florida and Pennsylvania that voters don’t like the policies,” he said. “Because they haven’t gotten the memo yet, they continue to embrace him and they will not tell him to go away because he’s out of touch. They’re going to find out, I believe, in November how out of touch they are in Virginia.”Scott noted that whereas Democrats in Washington are shut out of power, their counterparts in the Virginia house of delegatespassed resolutionsin January enshrining rights to abortion, voting and marriage equality.She’s a waitress raised on a farm – can Rebecca Cooke win a key Wisconsin seat?Read more“We’ve got to stop whining,” the speaker said. “There’s no whining in this state. There’s no need to do any handwringing. You don’t get to have a pity party. If you really believe that this is an existential threat, do the work. We have to continue to show folks how we deliver, what values we stand for. Our values are not losing.“That’s why I’m tired of people talking about the message. We don’t need a hero. We don’t need someone to come in with a cape. Get over Michelle Obama and Barack Obama. We need every day normal Americans to come to the forefront.”Scott added: “Virginians know exactly who Donald Trump is and we’ll have the opportunity to be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the country here in November. We’ll be sending a message of hope to the rest of the country that we haven’t been snowed by this guy.”Explore more on these topicsDemocratsRepublicansUS politicsVirginiaElon MuskDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

What really happened?Nearly five months ago, the Indigenous land rights defender went out to herd animals in the forest and vanished. Her family say she had been threatened – and no trace of her has been foundSupported byAbout this contentCharis McGowanin Los Rios, ChileMon 7 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 07.03 EDTShareJulia Chuñil Catricura’s home is a wooden cabin nestled within the dense foliage of the hilly Valdivian rainforest. It has no running water, electricity or mobile phone coverage. It is a modest setup – for Chuñil, living here was an act of resistance, a vindication of her rights.Chuñil, 72, is Mapuche,Chile’s largest Indigenous group. A land defender who fought for Mapuche land rights and practised ancestral farming methods and medicinal techniques, she moved to this spot in 2015.View image in fullscreenThe road leading to Julia Chuñil’s house in a remote area of Máfil, Los Ríos region, Chile.Photograph: Ailen Diaz/The GuardianAfter a few years, she was subjected to threats and harassment from a local business owner, who offered her money on several occasions in an attempt to get her to leave. But she repeatedly refused to go.Last November, Chuñil set off on a habitual hike with her three dogs to herd some animals, journeying up into the forest’s steep hills. But only two dogs returned; Chuñil and her three-month-old hound, Cholito, have not been seen since.“She knew the land like the back of her hand,” says her son Pablo Chuñil, gesturing towards the trees. “It is impossible she would have gotten lost or fallen.”View image in fullscreenPablo Chuñil, Julia’s eldest son, at his mother’s house in Máfil, Los Ríos.Photograph: Ailen Diaz/The GuardianFive months on, the search for her has made no significant progress, despite the efforts of her family, community and authorities. Footprints thought to be hers were found near an abandoned cabin along with tyre tracks, but no further evidence has surfaced.View image in fullscreenJulia Chuñil, who disappeared last November in the commune of Mafil, ValdiviaThe case highlights the struggle over land rights and the vulnerability of Indigenous defenders inChile.Supported by the NGO Escazú Ahora, her family filed a lawsuit demanding that authorities approach Chuñil’s disappearance as a criminal investigation.Before Chuñil moved to her property, it had been acquired by the government agency Conadi (National Corporation for Indigenous Development) as part of a Mapuche territorial recovery programme. It was initially assigned to another Mapuche community, which allegedly abandoned it because of its steep terrain, making it impractical for livestock.The activist spotted the vacant land and moved in with her community, the Petreguel, believing that Conadi would transfer the land rights to them.Clear title to land in this area is crucial, as evidenced by the marks of change on the forested hills that shape the skyline – acres of native oak trees are interrupted by the neat squares of pine and eucalyptus plantations. It is this burgeoning industry that Chuñil’s family and friends fear could have led her to harm.View image in fullscreenA forestry site near Santa Juana, Biobío region, Chile. The Mapuche’s lands were seized at the end of the 19th century, and demands for the return of ancestral territory have grown louder in recent years.Photograph: Cristobal Olivares/Bloomberg/Getty Images“The forestry companies squeeze and pressure the Indigenous,” says Jaime Raipan, a leader of a neighbouring Mapuche community and a close friend of Chuñil. “The businessmen never leave [our] communities in peace.”The Mapuche struggle for land rights is a deep-seated issue rooted in colonial injustice. In the 19th century, in its infancy as an independent nation, the Chilean state seized Indigenous lands and gave them to European – primarily German – settlers. The Mapuche were subjected to atrocious living and working conditions under European estate owners.View image in fullscreenA Mapuche man and woman in Chile, circa 1890.Photograph: Hum Images/Alamy“There is a history of dispossession the state did not take responsibility for,” says Salvador Millaleo, a lawyer and human rights lecturer at Universidad de Chile. “That has generated a multitude of conflicts to this day.”Over the past decade, several Mapuche land defenders have gone missing under murky circumstances or have died suspiciously.“Although the number of cases is not comparable to somewhere like Colombia, this has been happening in Chile for quite some time,” says Millaleo. “But no ruling has found anyone responsible for their deaths – so impunity prevails.”A minority of Mapuche groups in the Araucanía and Biobío regions have taken up arms to defend their land and families, resulting in violent clashes with authorities. However, police have also been accused of using disproportionate force against Mapuche groups across the country, resulting in allegations ofkillings,attacksand harassment against unarmed civilians.View image in fullscreenMapuche activists on horseback at the funeral of 24-year-old Camilo Catrillanca in 2018, shot by a special unit of the Chilean military police.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyIn 2021, then president Sebastián Piñera announced a state of emergency in the two regions to confront armed groups accused of arson and violence againstforestry companies.Incumbent president, Gabriel Boric, made anelectoral pledge to end military controlin the area and promote dialogue in its place. In 2023, the government launched theCommission for Peace and Understandingto resolve tensions over land rights.Initially scheduled to be published in November, the commission’s report has been pushed back until the end of April. Meanwhile, Boric’s government has presided over one of the longest periods of state of emergency in Chile’s democratic history – more than 1,000 days and counting.“The government has had a terrible policy in terms of Indigenous groups; it has made a lot of symbolic gestures, but little has been done,” says Millaleo.Escazú Ahora is similarly critical of the government, highlighting the prolonged implementation of the Escazú Agreement, alegally binding pact in South Americato protect land defenders.Boric signed the Escazú Agreement as one of his first acts after taking office. Yet, three years on, Escazú Ahora calculates that only 20% of the agreement has been implemented, and a law to protect land defenders is still crawling through Congress.View image in fullscreenMapuche supporters at a protest over the disappearance of Julia Chuñil outside the presidential palace in Santiago in January.Photograph: Juan González/ReutersSebastián Benfeld, director of Escazú Ahora, says the government must “take part in the legislative discussion” and allocate a budget to ensure the law is enacted with sufficient resources.In 2024, Escazú Ahora documented47 cases of human rights violationsagainst environmental defenders in Chile, almost half of which were physical attacks. If the law had existed before Chuñil went missing, says Benfeld, it could have protected her from the alleged threats against her.In Máfil, Chuñil’s family claim they were raided by police five times, with dozens of officers searching their house. They describe the experience as traumatic.Raipan, Chuñil’s neighbour, says the residents distrust the authorities: “The police do not help Chile’s Indigenous groups.”View image in fullscreenMembers of Julia Chuñil’s family sit outside her home in Máfil, Los Ríos.Photograph: Ailen Diaz/The GuardianAfter Chuñil’s disappearance, the family discovered that Conadi had given the land back to its original landowner, the same businessman who they claim made the threats toward Chuñil. Pablo believes Conadi failed in their responsibility to notify his mother that they had sold the land.“If he was the real landlord, why would he offer my mum money to leave?” he says. “He could have just put a judicial order to get her out.”In writing, Conadi argued that the land was initially bought for a Mapuche community called Blanco Lepin. Yet, “due to breach of contract and other complexities that the families had, this process was reversed,” which resulted in the “restitution of the land to its [original] owner”.Conadi has not replied to inquiries relating specifically to Julia Chuñil.Justice minister Jaime Gajardo Falcón told the Guardian that the government has launched a “roundtable” in the region; a dedicated taskforce that will use the human rights framework outlined by the Escazú Agreement – taking into consideration Chuñil’s role as an environmental defender.“We have expressed solidarity with the family and have offered them psychological and material support,” he wrote. “There is concern and action from various national and regional state agencies in the ongoing search for Mrs Julia Chuñil.”View image in fullscreenLyssette Sánchez at her grandmother’s house, where the Mapuche Wuñelfe flag still flies.Photograph: Ailen Diaz/The GuardianChuñil’s granddaughter, Lyssette Sánchez, walks around her grandmother’s house, tidying her garden and pruning medicinal plants – chamomile, oregano, rue and matico. She learned about medicine from her grandmother and knows all the plants and their properties.Sánchez says Chuñil taught her many things; the first was to be proud. “You get racist people here – they don’t say ‘Mapuche’, they say ‘Indian,’” she says. “It affected me a lot when I was younger, but [my grandmother] told me not to be ashamed of our roots.”The family has rehomed Chuñil’s animals and has now left the property for good. “We have followed vultures – if she was somewhere on the hill, they would have led us to her,” says Pablo, pointing to the sky. “She is not here. I’ve climbed these hills every day for months.”View image in fullscreenJulia Chuñil’s home, which her family has now left for good.Photograph: Ailen Diaz/The GuardianThey will not fight to keep Chuñil’s patch of land. All they want is to know what happened to the fierce, strong-willed woman who made this place her home.“It’s so sad: a person who worked so hard for so many years … and someone comes along, maybe makes them disappear as if it were nothing,” says Sánchez, breaking down in tears. “They don’t see the harm they left behind.”Explore more on these topicsIndigenous peoplesSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanLand rightsChileAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But sales are fallingAmy Hawkinsin HaikouSun 6 Apr 2025 23.00 EDTShareMany cities across southernChinaare known for the art of relaxing. Chengdu in Sichuan province is the tea house capital. Guangzhou is the birthplace of dim sum, a time to share steamed dumplings and chew the fat with friends. And in Haikou, the capital of Hainan province, people have been chewing the betel nut for centuries.You don’t have to walk far in Haikou to find a vendor. The small, hard, green fruits are sold in little piles alongside fresh coconuts and bottled water at pretty much any convenience store, for about five yuan (£0.52) a piece. Some vendors, mostly women, sit by the side of the road to dish out betel nuts to passing drivers on mopeds, nearly all of them men.Betel nuts, the fruit of the areca palm, are popular across Asia, particularly in India, which produces about half of the world’s crop. Excessive consumption is linked to oral cancer and tooth decay, but they also produce a natural high, thanks to the presence of arecoline, a natural (and carcinogenic) stimulant in the nuts. Like other legal highs, they are enduringly popular. A Chinese folk song written in the 1930s, still sung on state television today, tells the story of a young couple who fall in love on a mountain while picking betel nuts from the tree.Haikou mapAbout 95% of China’s betel nuts are produced in Hainan, a tropical island that is China’s southernmost province. The warm, humid climate is well suited to growing areca palm trees. More than 2.3 million people are involved in the betel nut industry, according to state media, accounting for more than one-fifth of the island’s population. By some estimates, the planting, growing and selling of the fruit accounts for 8% of Hainan’s total GDP. Between 2010 and 2021, the size of the land used for betel nut farming in Hainan more than doubled.Far away from Hainan, there have been efforts to crack down on betel nuts in the name of public health. Since 2020, it has been illegal to sell them as a food product. In 2022, a singer called Fu Song died of oral cancer at the age of 36. Before his death he said on social media that his illness was caused by his betel nut habit, and urged others to stay away. Some cities have urged shops not to sell the nuts to children. In Xiamen, 750 miles away along China’s southern coast, betel nuts are banned. Some media reportscall it“the fruit of the devil”.The message hasn’t got to Haikou. Reports of negative health effects are “just rumours”, says a woman surnamed Fu, who has been selling betel nuts for more than 30 years. “It’s a fruit, there’s nothing harmful to the body,” she says. “It’s actually good for your teeth.”But in the sluggish post-pandemic economy, business is starting to slow, even by sleepy Haikou’s standards.A few shops down from Fu, a woman whose surname is Wang also sells betel nuts. Like Fu, she’s heard nothing of the restrictions elsewhere in China. But she is ambivalent about the industry’s future. “These past two years have been really bad economically. Honestly, it’s been tough,” she says.View image in fullscreenBetel nuts for sale in Haikou, Hainan province. In Xiamen, 750 miles away, betel nuts are banned.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The Guardian“In the past, we might sell 10 to 20 catty [5-10kg] per day, but now we’re lucky if we sell five. The volume went down not because people no longer like betel nuts, it’s more about not having enough money to buy betel nuts and have proper meals at the same time. So consumption has gone down quite a bit compared to a few years ago.”But while business is slow, the number of people trying to get into the trade is increasing, Wang says, in part because there are so few jobs in other industries.Youth unemployment has beenstubbornly highsince the pandemic. In February, the unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds in China’s cities reached 16.9%, a two-year high. The overall urban unemployment rate was 5.4%, also a two-year high.Many young people, including graduates, have responded to the turndown by returning to their home towns and taking on menial work or “lying flat”.That has created competition for middle-aged sellers such as Wang and Fu. “In the past, people who sold betel nuts were mostly older, in their 50s or 60s,” Wang said. “But now, a lot of young people in their 20s or 30s are selling. It’s because there’s not much work.”Nationwide, the betel nut industry is expected to keep growing, in part because improved technology is increasing yields on industrial farms. But a market research report published in March by China Research Network, a corporate intelligence firm, predicts that the price of betel nut will be pushed down by increased competition among sellers, meaning that big, industrialised producers may survive at the expense of street-side vendors. China Research Network also predicts that the health warning about betel nut may finally start to catch on this year.Wang’s shop sells drinks and other snacks, but she thinks the betel nut business may finally decline. “There are almost no customers. No one has money. They need to save money for food first before buying betel nuts.”Additional research byJason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaHealthAsia PacificCancerFarmingFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He added: “FREE MARINE LE PEN.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump described the verdict as a ‘witch hunt’.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesAs Francereeledfrom the political upheaval, opponents of liberal democracy jumped at the chance to peddle their claims that some justice systems are being used as a blunt tool to silence the will of the people. “When the radical left can’t win via democratic vote, they abuse the legal system to jail their opponents,” wrote Elon Musk. “This is their standard playbook throughout the world.”The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described the verdict as part of a broader pattern of European capitals “trampling over democratic norms”, while Italy’s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, likened the ruling to Romania, wherecourts overturnedthe first-round results of the presidential election andlater uphelda decision to ban the frontrunner amid suspicions of Russian interference.“People who are afraid of the judgment of the voters are often reassured by the judgment of the courts,” Salvini wrote. “In Paris they have condemned Marine Le Pen and would like to exclude her from political life – an ugly film that we are also seeing in other countries such as Romania.”View image in fullscreenItaly’s Matteo Salvini said the ruling reflected a fear of the judgment of voters.Photograph: Roberto Monaldo/LaPresse/REX/ShutterstockLegal experts pushed back against the claims. “The decision is extremely well reasoned, the court handed down a judgment that seems to me implacable on its merits and without any real possible dispute,” said Mathieu Carpentier,a law professor at Toulouse Capitole University, citing the more than 150-page ruling delivered by the three judges. “If Madame Le Pen had not broken the law, she would not have been convicted.”It was a point that leaders in countries such as the US, Russia and Hungary – all of whom havefacedaccusationsofunderminingtheir country’s judiciary – were seemingly content to overlook.“It’s very interesting because these are the same people who call for absolutely exemplary sentences for delinquency and for justice to be severe,” said Carpentier. Le Pen, for example,called in 2013 forlifelong ineligibility for politicians convicted of criminal acts while in office.Ultimately, said Carpentier, Le Pen and her defenders “don’t like the rule of law, they use justice always and only as a political instrument”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now she is working out how best to meet the challenge of Trump, Musk and the politics of chaosMon 7 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTShareMy conversation with Abigail Disney opens with the kind of bog-standard line that starts most chats. But because she is a left-leaning American, with a record of righteous criticism of the man now once again in charge of her country, I suspect it might invite a very long answer indeed.Still, out it comes: “How are you?”“It’s a good question,” she says, “because we’re all struggling with it.”A deep breath. “I spend a lot of time trying to think of reasons to be optimistic, because I don’t know how to function without that. And I want to find the energy and the grit for a really long fight. This isn’t just four years … you know, there’s a whole civilisation-level reset to be done. I mean, I heard the other night when Trump spoke, he mentioned that we wouldget Greenland one way or another. And then there was laughter. Laughter! I just thought, ‘Oh, we have sunk so low.’”The film-maker (and the grand-niece of Walt Disney) is speaking to me on video call from her home in Manhattan. She talks with a mixture of speed, eloquence and certainty – partly because her view ofDonald Trumpand his allies is all about something with which she is well acquainted: wealth, and what it does to people.I don’t think it will take much time for a lot of the people who voted for him to regret it, especially on the economy“Trump is aninheritor,” Disney tells me. “He never acknowledges it, but he wouldn’t have been able to do any of the things he did without an inheritance. He absorbed the lessons of inheriting money almost unfiltered: ‘You have this money because you’re special.’ If you read about his childhood, it’s like the textbook worst way to raise a person – you know, he was violent, he was a bully and he was rewarded for that, even as a very small child. And the more money he had, the more he exhibited these bad qualities, and the more people told him he was wonderful.”I then mention something she well knows: that Trump’s sidekick Elon Musk is also from a very wealthy background, having started his first business ventures with money provided by his father, and then becoming rich beyond the dreams of avarice. This, she tells me, partly explains the frazzled morals of someone who has just imposed all those cuts to overseas aid, with apparently no regard for the consequences.Among the schemes Musk has frozen, Disney points out, wasthe Pepfar programme, AKA the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, which is estimated to have saved 25 million lives by supplying medicine to people with HIV and Aids around the world. “There are people suffering and dying today because of that cut,” she says. “There are children who have HIV who shouldn’t because of Elon Musk. Now. As we sit here and talk.”She exhales. “That natural human proclivity to say, ‘Hmm, that doesn’t feel right’ – he doesn’t have it. Trump doesn’t have it. They’re spending no time in shame, and shame is a righteous emotion. It’s not an emotion you want to live in, but it’s an emotion you want as a motivator sometimes. And where is it? Where’s the shame?”View image in fullscreenDisney (in red hat) marching with Jane Fonda (in sunglasses) during a climate crisis protest in Washington DC in 2019.Photograph: John Lamparski/Getty ImagesWhat makes Abigail Disney fascinating is that she is also an inheritor. To quote froma speech she recently made– at the Vatican, where she took part in an event focused on making wealthy people around the world pay more tax, and the idea that large concentrations of wealth now threaten democracies – she acknowledges that she is rich “only because of some quirks in the tax system, some good luck, and some very loving grandparents. But nothing else.”Now a 65-year-old mother of four, she is the granddaughter of Roy O Disney, who, with his brother Walt, founded the Walt Disney company in 1923. In her early 20s, she resolved to start giving away large chunks of her inheritance. By 2021, she had donated approximately $70m to causes centred on women living with HIV, women in prison and women affected by domestic violence. She has long been a member of the Patriotic Millionaires, an American organisation focused on changing the system so that people as rich as its members – and those who have even more money – pay more of their income in tax.“I am of the belief that every billionaire who can’t live on $999m is kind of a sociopath,” she says. “Like, why? You know, over a billion dollars makes money so fast that it’s almost impossible to get rid of. And so by just sitting on your hands, you become more of a billionaire until you’re a double billionaire. It’s a strange way to live when you have objectively more money than a person can spend.”She has also campaigned – successfully – to improve wages and conditions for workers in the theme parks that bear her family name (she still owns shares in Disney, though not, she says, enough to give her substantial clout). As an active Democrat, she was among the big political donors who, in the summer of 2024, said they would withhold money from the party until Joe Biden stepped down as its candidate in the presidential election.View image in fullscreenDisney as a child.Photograph: Justin Jun Lee/The GuardianBut aside from all that work and her advocacy on wealth and tax, Disney is chiefly known as a film producer and director, some of whose work has presciently looked ahead to the polarised, angry country the US seems to have become.In 2015, for example, she made The Armor of Light, an acclaimed and very sobering documentary about Rob Schenck, an evangelical pastor based in Washington DC who was long associated with the American hard right, with views on abortion to match. The film portrays him trying to find the courage to speak out about the scourge of American gun violence and pull his followers out of their love affair with firearms; after it was released, he and Disney began to regularly make their case to gatherings of rightwing Christians.But as Trump began his march towards the White House, they started to get a sharp sense of what his politics were going to do to American society. “When I first started asking about Trump, the people we met were like, ‘Are you kidding? No way – he’s a joker, he’s nothing.’ And then, halfway through the summer of 2016, it was like the iron curtain came down, and we stopped getting invitations. And when Trump was elected, we never got another request to speak.”For Schenck, things were about to get very ugly indeed. Over decades, he had been involved in the campaign to nullifyRoe v Wade, the US supreme court judgment that established women’s constitutional right to abortion – which, in 2022, was overturned. But three years before that watershed decision, he wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times announcing that he had changed his mind. At that point, Disney tells me, former allies who were now staunch Trump supporters turned on him.“Death threats and all kinds of things came in,” she says. “He was told he was going to hell by people he had been friends with for 40 years. It’s horrible what he’s been through.”World leaders have a chance to raise taxes for rich people like me. I’m begging them to take it | Abigail DisneyRead moreThat kind of belligerent nastiness is arguably the defining feature of the mindset of the president and his followers, but Disney is adamant that the roots of his politics lie in wealth and privilege, and how Americans view those things. As she sees it, Trump and Trumpism are not some sudden bolt from the blue: his rise to power, she says, highlights a cultural shift that began in the 1980s, when the US really started to venerate the wealthy.“Our magazine covers did not used to be littered with CEOs,” she says. “They used to have pictures of Martin Luther King on them, or a war hero, or the woman who founded the Girl Scouts. Just look at the magazine covers and you’ll see the way this country has lost its way.”Soon enough, along came reality TV, the frenzied worship of a new kind of celebrity, and social media. Trump, clearly, has skilfully used them all. “We all laughed and said he was stupid, but obviously he’s not,” she says. “In the 19th century he would have sold a lot of snake oil. He came along right at the correct moment. And he played his role brilliantly. You’ve got to give it to him.”View image in fullscreenAt home in New York City.Photograph: Justin Jun Lee/The GuardianOne question hangs over the whole of our conversation: what is to be done?For now, Disney tells me, pursuing political activism via film-making probably isn’t an option. She is understandably worried about what Trump and Musk might have planned for such outlets as the non-profit Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), which might once have played a key role in holding them to account. The fact that the TV and movie industries are in crisis – thanks to recent writers’ strikes, and the impossible economics of streaming – makes things even more difficult. “I’m thinking of maybe pivoting to short videos – just talking at the camera, and doing that low-maintenance kind of thing,” she says. “I feel like I’m missing an opportunity if I don’t go on social media and try to be present as a public voice.”As the Trump revolution gathers pace, I tell her, I often wonder when massed opposition will materialise. Put another way, why aren’t millions of people already in the streets?She sighs. “We could all show up on the streets. But what would be the uniting message? The chaos is deliberate: it’s meant to give us too much to handle. Do we go out there about the environment? Do we go out there about DEI [diversity, equality and inclusion policies]? Do we go out there about gay rights, about women’s rights?“You know, the difficulty of being progressive is that it’s difficult to unite everybody around a single issue. So most of the progressives I know are trying to figure that out. And even if we did go out [on the streets], what is our leverage? We have none.”What does she mean by leverage?“Well, we [Democrats] have a minority in the House and the Senate. We have a cabinet that is so radical, and they are lining the government with people who are beyond radical and there is no place where we can exercise visible dissent … We’re being shut out. And the way of communicating has completely changed. An op-ed in the New York Times isn’t going to change things.”View image in fullscreen‘We need barnstorming!’ Disney speaking at a Patriotic Millionaires protest on Capitol Hill.Photograph: Nathan Posner/ShutterstockDisney is at pains to talk about the necessity of slow and arduous work: building opposition from the grassroots up – which will be helped, she says, by the fact that Trump and his cronies will sooner or later hit no end of problems.“I really don’t think it will take very much time for a lot of the people who voted for him to regret it, especially on the economy,” she says. “We’re going to have so much inflation: the tariffs are terrible. I think that there’s going to be some turning, and in the meantime we have to really work on building institutions. Black associations, neighbourhood associations, PTAs – we need to do the work of rebuilding those spaces. We need the basis of a really vibrant progressive society. We let it die.”When I mention the progressive flag-bearers Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who have recently been organising Fight Oligarchy events across the US, Disney speaks with an urgency that sounds almost optimistic.“We need Bernie barnstorming,” she says. “We need AOC barnstorming. We need, you know, the people we have that are greeted as authentic in the real world, not focus groups, to go out and be authentic with their passion and their smarts about where to go from here.”She mentions a handful of impressive young Democratic politicians such asMaxwell Frost, the 28-year-old congressman from Florida who had a key role in the pro-gun-control movement March for Our Lives. “There’s a bunch of people,” she says. “And what we need to do is put together a coordinated campaign. But you’ve got to build the infrastructure to do it.”We end as we began, with Donald Trump, and how awful he has made so many Americans feel. “He has a critical mass of 35% to 40% of the American public – which is far too many people – who are completely on board with the cruelty and the derision and the trolling,” Disney says. “But that leaves everybody who’s either too tired, or too alienated or estranged from the process.”She suddenly brightens. “They’reours,” she says. “But we have to do the work.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Can the country’s new government create enough jobs and prospects to make them stay?ByTracy McVeighin BargnySupported byAbout this contentMon 7 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 08.35 EDTShareThe view from the plastic chair in which Fatou Samba sits, looking out to sea, takes in many of the elements of the sorry tale of Senegal’s lost men. She can see the distant shapes of the big industrial foreign fishing ships and tankers, from Europe and China, strung across the horizon.Closer to shore are dozens of empty pirogues, Senegalese wooden fishing boats, rocking idle on a sea mostly denuded of fish.On the beach itself, just where the small waves break, bringing in their crust of plastic waste, is a heap of masonry rubble. “That was the mosque,” Samba says. The ends of her own house, a U-shape with the two arms facing out to the beach, have also crumbled, including her bedroom. “On 19 August the sea took it, the bed and the walls,” she says, nodding at the rubble. “Soon the sea will take it all, this house my grandparents built.”The dramatic coastal erosion here in Bargny, where generations have built lives around fishing, has been exacerbated by the dredging of a deep water port for international shipping further along the coast. Samba says the homes of 17 neighbouring families have been washed away in the past six months, dragged out on tides that keep on rising.But the saddest sight Samba saw from her plastic chair was in November, when her 22-year-old son, Thierieno, left for Spain.“I sat here watching him go, swimming out to the boat,” she demonstrates a one-armed breast stroke, “one hand holding up his phone out of the water.”For Thierieno, getting a job was difficult. He couldn’t follow his father into the dying fishing industry, but it was the peer pressure that finally got to him, sending him overseas to join the mass migration of men – and increasingly women and children – who are leaving a Senegal where they cannot see a future.“He didn’t want to go; his father didn’t want it; but his friends were sending him messages, videos, from Madrid to come. It looked as though he had no courage if he stayed. It shamed Thierieno,” Samba says.The 930 miles (1,500km) of Atlantic Ocean from Senegal to the Canary Islands, where people apply for papers to allow them to work in mainland Spain, is one of the riskiest migrant routes in the world, taking five or six days in an open pirogue.Last year there were10,457 officially recorded deathson the route, but many more never make it to the status of an international statistic, drowning without anyone recording their loss.Youth migration was a key topic in the closely fought elections last March; not just a demand to tackle Senegal’s raging unemployment and build climate resilience but also to wrest back the country from France’s colonial grasp, including taking back control of fishing licences being sold off to too many EU boats.The newly elected president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, has called on young people to stay in Senegal rather thanseeking the “illusion” of a better futureelsewhere.“From now on, the relentless hunt for these illusion-peddlers, these peddlers of death, will be stepped up,” he said, announcing that a hotline to report the activities of people smugglers would be set up.But a year on from the excitement and hope around his taking office, there are few signs of change in the scale of the dangerous exodus.View image in fullscreenFrom left, Maguette Dieng, Khady Diack, Dethié Ndoye, aged 10, and Adama Khoule waiting for the fishing boats to return with their catch in Kayar – the town used to be a busy working hub for the local fishing industryThe number of west African migrants taking small boats to reach the Canaries has seen a dramatic rise over the past three years – under 20,000 migrants arrived in 2022, 32,000 in 2023, with a record46,843 reaching the archipelago in 2024, according to the EU’s border agency, Frontex.Samba and her two friends list the names of 13 people they know who have died out there in the past three months. “Even last year it was better, now people go in secret.”I pleaded with Usman not to go. But he was so tired of trying to work enough to feed all the mouthsNdeye Sall, widow of Usman JouffThe risk is not just from dangerous sea conditions, but from poor quality of navigational equipment and even engines – although manufacturers in several European countries are enjoying huge profits from the sales of both.Delirium and sunstroke are also commonplace among people on the open boats. Ndeye Sall’s husband, Usman Jouff – a construction worker and a ceremonial drummer – was one of several men from her street who drowned on 23 September.Jouff was among those whose death at sea was not due to a sinking, but who were so delirious from being in an open boat for days at a time with little shade, food or water that they slid over the side. “The ancestors called him,” Sall says. “This is not something he wanted to do. The other man told his shipmates he was going to the shop and jumped overboard. Others slip into the water at night.”Sall is now trying to raise the couple’s eight children alone.“I pleaded with Usman not to go,” she says, then covers her face to weep. “But he was so tired of trying to work enough to feed all the mouths. I will forbid any of my children from taking the ships.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Ibrahime Niang, Birane Mbaye, Ass Mbaye and Mayoro Niang. Three of the four are planning to leave Senegal in the near futureJouff’s friend, 63-year-old healer Ousseynou Ndiaye, moves out of earshot of the crying widow to express his own frustration. He is angry at those who go abroad and then fill the heads of struggling Senegalese people about a glittering new life through “lies and boasts”.“The young people are not guilty here, it is not their fault. It is the ideas put into them about other countries.“No one is starving in Senegal, there is some little job for everyone – but they see that a family who has someone abroad can build a little house with money sent home.“So they think they are nothing if they cannot do this for their families too. Our young people are wandering around looking for work; they need training and they need work.

Now, the processing building, the fishmeal factory, the long rows of drying tables, the concrete gutting pools, are all empty or closed.“This was always full of people. Now it’s so empty, even in just a few years,” says Jiban Sourey, a local politician in Kayar. “In October 2023 a ship from this town disappeared, full of people and still there is no information. But despite this, the young people take the risk, some are going at even the age of 15.“It’s not easy to get the message out that it’s possible to be successful here: you are fighting against a tide of what young people have seen on social media. In Kayar, just along the beach, we have some new houses being built by those who have sent money home, so people see this and think they can also go to Spain and earn money for a house.“And if they are not being properly taught at school; if they are not being trained in anything else but fishing; of course they feel obliged to take the risk. Now they don’t tell their parents, they just go. We would all prefer our children to stay here.”Dozens of people would have worked here a few years ago, but today just three women, swatting away the omnipresent flies, sit on nylon mats under the sunshield of a plastic sheet tied to driftwood posts. They buy fish when a boat brings in its catch, then gut it and sell it on. These days business is slow to dead. All have seen family leave.When we were younger, there was no question of leaving Senegal. Who would want to, we had our fishing and a good lifeAss MbayeMaguette Dieng didn’t know her sons’ plans. They were there one evening and gone in the morning. The eldest, Mussa Gueye, 21, arrived safely in Spain last month but she has had no calls from Babacar Gueye, 19. “He is missing,” she says.Khady Diack looks at her phone constantly, a lovesick woman waiting for a message from her husband. “I miss him like … aaaaahhh,” she folds over, thumping her chest. “I am lonely. If I had the opportunity I would go too,” she says. “I just want him to come back,” says Diack.Adama Khoule nods: “There is no one left to help, so it’s hard; even the youngest go. Many of them borrow the money. My son has gone and left his debts, which has caused a lot of problems for me. We’re really tired.“They say‘Barca wala barsakh’– Barcelona or death – this slogan is what they all say,” she says.Like most people left behind there is as vague an idea of where Spain is as there is of who owns the great vessels on the horizon that have been sold licences to fish out their waters. “Strangers,” says Khoule. “Foreigners,” says Diack.Ass Mbaye has only come tantalisingly close to Spain. On a Sunday evening at Thiaroye, a Dakar suburb, children are playing on the beach, swimming out in a sea glowing pink as the sun drops. Mbaye is sitting on a beached pirogue with friends Ibrahime Niang, Birane Mbaye and Mayoro Niang.“We are the last men in Thiaroye,” jokes Birane Mbaye. Although not for long. Three of them plan to leave in the coming weeks. Only Ibrahime Niang intends to stay – he has a child with a disability he doesn’t want to leave.9:00'Europe is not paradise': one man's mission to stop Senegal’s youth dying at sea – videoThe rest are just waiting for the right weather, boat and opportunity. Ass Mbaye let one boat go without him a few nights earlier because he didn’t like the look of the sea conditions but he is a veteran of the migrant trail. He has just returned from Morocco after five failed attempts to get from there into Spain. It’s an alternative route for those who can afford it, a flight to Morocco, where Senegalese need no visa, then a boat – or swim – into Spanish territory.“They catch you then beat you up and dump you in the desert. You need to cross the Sahara to come back here,” says the 37-year-old. “We passed some dead bodies on the way. Some just do not make it in the desert.“My friends said come back to Senegal and try to go by sea. So this is what I will do.” Chewing reflectively on a twig he says: “When we were all younger, there was no question of leaving Senegal. Who would want to? We had our fishing and a good life.”Samba knows her son Thierieno got safely to Spain but every week she sees people without experience of the sea taking more and more risks, as social media channels are full of young Senegalese posting airbrushed depictions of success in Spain.She calls the police or the mayor if she sees young people preparing to leave on an inauspicious or bad weather day.“In this community, all the men, the fathers, the uncles, the children, even four years old. Men who are from here, they all go. It’s normal now,” she says, settling back in her chair. “We are just women left.”Explore more on these topicsSenegalAfricaMigration and developmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Michael Savage reports“I had a career for 17 years and what am I doing now? What’s happened to my life? I had something that I was so proud of and the thing that I love doesn’t love me.”Stef Loughreyis a producer who has worked on some of the UK’s biggest television programmes. But in 2023 the steady stream of work she had relied on suddenly disappeared.The Guardian’s media editor,Michael Savage, tellsHelen Piddthat Loughrey is not alone: about 70% of freelancers within the television industry are believed to be out of work, affecting everything from gameshows to dramas, from the most experienced to those at the start of their careers.Savage puts the shift down to a perfect storm of factors, including the crash that followed the post-Covid boom and more structural issues, such as the rise of streamers and shifting viewing habits. The severe decline in British productions may affect the kind of programming that viewers will see, and create a situation where only those with the deepest pockets can work in the industry.Savage explains that while some are calling for greater governmental support or increased risk-taking on the part of commissioners, others are hoping to make use of their skills in other sectors.Photograph: Keith Morris/AlamyExplore more on these topicsTelevision industryToday in FocusTelevisionWork & careers"

She was last seen in the company of British soldiers in a bar in a hotel in Nanyuki, a town in eastern Kenya where theBritish armyhas a military base, BATUK.Her body was found two months later, stuffed inside a septic tank at the Lion’s Court hotel. Six years ago, an inquest in Kenya found she had been murdered by one or more British soldiers.In 2021, a suspect was named by several soldiers who at the time were attached to the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, with one providing startling testimony in which he claimed that the killer, a fellow soldier, had confessed to him on the night and shown him Wanjiru’s body in the septic tank.In a new statement, prosecutors in Kenya said that after the conclusion of police investigations, a file had been submitted for consideration.“The DPP [director of public prosecutions] has constituted a team of senior prosecutors to conduct a comprehensive review of the file,” the statement said. “The DPP acknowledges the significant time that has elapsed in this matter and remains fully committed to ensuring justice for the family of Agnes Wanjiru.”On a visit to Kenya on Monday,John Healeymet Wanjiru’s family and emphasised his “determination to see a resolution” to the case, promising the UK’s “full support” for the investigation.View image in fullscreenRose Wanyua holds up a picture of her sister, Agnes Wanjiru, in October 2021.Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPAAs shadow defence secretary, Healey had previously called for more to be done to “pursue justice for Agnes and her family”. Kenyan prosecutors have already flown to the UK to interview witnesses and potential suspects, but no charges have been brought.Last year, the British armyannounced an investigation into the wider behaviour of troops stationed at BATUK, after what the Ministry of Defence described as “alarming allegations of unacceptable behaviour by service personnel deployed to Kenya”.Healey said he planned to discuss Wanjiru’s murder later on Monday in a meeting with William Ruto, the president of Kenya, adding: “I will emphasise the need to accelerate progress in this case.“It was deeply humbling to meet the family of Agnes Wanjiru today. In the 13 years since her death, they have shown such strength in their long fight for justice. I reiterated my determination to see a resolution to the still-unresolved case.“Our government will continue to do everything we can to help the family secure the justice they deserve.”After the meeting with Healey, Wanjiru’s family said: “The death of our beloved Agnes has had a profound and devastating impact on our family.“It was not only the shock of losing Agnes at such a young age, but also the horrific circumstances in which her body was found and all the trauma and struggle our family has been put through in trying to seek justice and accountability for her death that has taken a very heavy toll on all of us.“We are grateful to the secretary of state for defence for agreeing to meet with us, but we have waited for too many years and been offered too many empty promises.“We hope that our meeting with the secretary of state marks the beginning of the UK government and Ministry of Defence taking decisive action to ensure that what happened to Agnes is properly investigated in Kenya and in the UK and to make sure that what happened to Agnes never happens again.“We expect the UK and Kenyan governments to act and bring closure to this matter.”Explore more on these topicsBritish armyKenyaMilitaryAfricaDefence policyJohn HealeynewsShareReuse this content"

They are too small to have any negative or distorted impact on your country.”Mottley warnedCaribbeancitizens that the tariffs would mean “higher prices for all of us”.Volatility grips global stock markets as Trump insists on tariff ‘medicine’Read moreThe finance minister forSt Vincent and the Grenadines(SVG), Camillo Gonsalves, who is visiting the UK to promote foreign investment, particularly from the Caribbean diaspora, said the US tariffs – which range from 10% to 38% on Caribbean countries – could have a detrimental impact on his country’s agricultural and fisheries sectors, and drive up the prices of imports, leading to unsustainable inflation and rises in the cost of living.“We import many, many products, fruits, vegetables, manufactured goods, meats … cement, steel, through Miami and other US ports,” Gonsalves told the Guardian. “And not all of those products are of American origin … but it’s a convenient point of transit for the Caribbean.”Going through these US ports, he added, meant they would be subject to the increased US tariffs. “Those tariffs will become a cost; they will become a tax, essentially to Caribbean consumers,” he said.The minister said SVG was working closely with other countries in the region who are part of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) to engage with the US on the matter, and that it was also looking at solutions such as developing partnerships with other countries in the Commonwealth.He said: “I think that if the United States has made a policy decision to withdraw from global trade, it does not mean that global trade is dead. It simply means that one major player has withdrawn from the game … I believe that other countries that continue to see the advantages of global trade and globalisation will adapt … and I think that the Commonwealth connection is advantageous.”Investment from SVG nationals living abroad could drive rapid growth, he said, estimating that their “economic strength” was about five times that of their fellow citizens at home.Here’s one key thing you should know about Trump’s shock to the world economy: it could work | James MeadwayRead moreOn Friday,Mottley, who is also the chair of Caricom, issued a statementstressing that the Caribbean was already reaping the benefits of work to diversify economies and shake off the “legacy of our colonial dependence”, but admitting that the region was still “largely reliant on imports”, as she expressed concern about the impact of the tariffs.“We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but I want every Caribbean man and every Caribbean woman to hear me. This trade war and the possibility of a $1m to $1.5m levy on all Chinese-made ships entering US harbours will mean higher prices for all of us at the corner shop, higher prices at the supermarket, higher prices at the electronic store, higher prices for us at the shop, higher prices for us at the restaurant, higher prices for us at the car dealership and beyond,” she said.In her statement, the Caricom chair proposed a set of actions to respond to the crisis. First, she said, the Caribbean community should “re-engage urgently, directly, and at the highest possible level with our friends in the United States of America”. She also urged countries to unite and avoid fighting “among each other for political gain”.She said it was important to “redouble efforts to invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing” and “build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada”.“We must not rely solely on one or two markets. We need to be able to sell our Caribbean goods to a wider, more stable global market,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsCaribbeanMia MottleyDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS foreign policyBarbadosnewsShareReuse this content"

When police cross-checked the data – and fingerprints – they confirmed it was the same individual.According to what is known so far, Dos Reis began presenting himself as Wickfield in the early 1980s.Police sayhe falsified his birth certificate, entered the University of São Paulo’s law school and began working as a judge in 1995, remaining on the bench until his retirement in 2018.When police uncovered the alleged fraud, he was summoned for questioning. This time identifying himself as Dos Reis, heclaimed that Wickfield was his twin brother, given up for adoption as a child to a noble British couple.He gave no further explanation for the names, though apieceby the Folha de S Paulo newspaper noted that they appear inspired by literature – such as the Round Table’s Lancelot or Mr Wickfield, the lawyer in Charles Dickens’s David Copperfield.A public prosecutor charged Dos Reis with identity fraud and using false documents. Court officers have been unable to locate him, so he has yet to be formally summoned to respond.Last Friday, the São Paulo Court decided to suspend his pension payments as a retired judge – in February alone, he received R$166,413.94 (more than $28,000).Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In response, Beijing announced a34% tariff on US imports.Volatility grips global stock markets as Trump insists on tariff ‘medicine’Read moreIn astatementon Truth Social on Monday morning, the US president said that China enacted the retaliatory tariffs despite his “warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs” would be “immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set”.“IfChinadoes not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote.“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!” he added. “Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.”China’s US embassy said on Monday it would not cave to pressure or threats over the additional 50% tariffs. “We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Liu Pengyu, an embassy spokesman, told Agence France-Presse.A senior White House official toldABC Newsthat the increased tariffs on China would be on top of the 34% reciprocal tariff Trump announced last week and the 20% already in place.Trump’s new ultimatum to China markedthe latest escalation from the White House and came asUS stocks swung in and out of the red on Monday morning as a report circulated that Trump was going to pause the implementation of his sweeping tariffs for 90 days, but then was quickly dismissed by the White House as “fake news”.Not long after Trump threatened China with additional tariffs on Monday morning, he participated in aWhite House visit from the Los Angeles Dodgersto celebrate their World Series title.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationChinaUS foreign policyGlobal economyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their area is expanding by around 90,000 hectares a year and, without proper management, could invade about a quarter of New Zealand’s land within 30 years, the majority of which would be conservation land.The report traverses how New Zealanders will be affected by the climate crisis and the increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather eventssuch as Cyclone Gabrielle in 2023. Around 750,000 people and 500,000 buildings, are near rivers and in coastal areas already exposed to extreme flooding, while low-lying communities are vulnerable to sea-level rise, and rural communities are at risk of wildfires.“We’ll face some tough choices about our priorities as a country, including about where we put our efforts and our scarce dollars,” Palmer said.The report identified some environmental improvements, particularly in air quality. While road transport remains the main source of nitrogen oxide pollution, air pollution from motor vehicles was reducing due to stronger emission standards, more people choosing to use lower-emission vehicles, and improvements to engines and fuel.“We’ve started to turn the corner in meaningful ways on some of our measures – choices about the cars we drive, the heating we use for our homes, for example, are showing up in better air quality, which is likely to flow through into better health,” Palmer said.“That underscores that we can make a difference, and we can build on the momentum that is already underway by doing more.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandBiodiversityAsia PacificClimate crisisWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

This was down more than 6% on last week’s 64c level before Trump’s tariffs were unveiled.While Australians import goods from all over the world, the prominence of the US dollar could make it hard to avoid higher prices, according to Mark Baartse, a retail consultant.“A lot of transactions are pegged to US dollars, regardless of where you buy from,” he said.Shoppers could turn to local Australian businesses or make their purchases sooner before trade-exposed businesses hike their prices, Baartse said.Overseas travel will also be more expensive after the Australian dollar lost value in top destinations includingNew Zealand, Indonesia and India.Nearly a million Australianstravelled to Japanin 2024, helped by a strong exchange rate of over 100 yen to the dollar, but Monday’s sell-off resulted in it falling below 90 yen for the first time since 2023.The Australian dollar’s value is tied to demand for commodities such as iron ore, which would suffer if economic activity slowed around the world, and especially in China, as a result of a global trade war.My Bui, an economist at AMP, said investors bought the Australian dollar when they expected a global boom and sold it when they feared a crash.“When there is concern about a global slowdown, and particularly from the tariff and global trade war, then there is less demand for our commodities,” Bui said.Other global currencies were performing better against the US dollar as markets placed bets on where Trump’s tariff regime would have the heaviest impact.The Euro and Japanese yen rose against the US dollar, while India and South Korea suffered falls.Australian markets have grown increasingly fearful of a global recession, with the share marketshedding $160bn in valueearly on Monday as China and the European union make plans to retaliate against US tariffs.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsEconomicsCurrenciesDonald TrumpTariffsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But sales are fallingAmy Hawkinsin HaikouSun 6 Apr 2025 23.00 EDTShareMany cities across southernChinaare known for the art of relaxing. Chengdu in Sichuan province is the tea house capital. Guangzhou is the birthplace of dim sum, a time to share steamed dumplings and chew the fat with friends. And in Haikou, the capital of Hainan province, people have been chewing the betel nut for centuries.You don’t have to walk far in Haikou to find a vendor. The small, hard, green fruits are sold in little piles alongside fresh coconuts and bottled water at pretty much any convenience store, for about five yuan (£0.52) a piece. Some vendors, mostly women, sit by the side of the road to dish out betel nuts to passing drivers on mopeds, nearly all of them men.Betel nuts, the fruit of the areca palm, are popular across Asia, particularly in India, which produces about half of the world’s crop. Excessive consumption is linked to oral cancer and tooth decay, but they also produce a natural high, thanks to the presence of arecoline, a natural (and carcinogenic) stimulant in the nuts. Like other legal highs, they are enduringly popular. A Chinese folk song written in the 1930s, still sung on state television today, tells the story of a young couple who fall in love on a mountain while picking betel nuts from the tree.Haikou mapAbout 95% of China’s betel nuts are produced in Hainan, a tropical island that is China’s southernmost province. The warm, humid climate is well suited to growing areca palm trees. More than 2.3 million people are involved in the betel nut industry, according to state media, accounting for more than one-fifth of the island’s population. By some estimates, the planting, growing and selling of the fruit accounts for 8% of Hainan’s total GDP. Between 2010 and 2021, the size of the land used for betel nut farming in Hainan more than doubled.Far away from Hainan, there have been efforts to crack down on betel nuts in the name of public health. Since 2020, it has been illegal to sell them as a food product. In 2022, a singer called Fu Song died of oral cancer at the age of 36. Before his death he said on social media that his illness was caused by his betel nut habit, and urged others to stay away. Some cities have urged shops not to sell the nuts to children. In Xiamen, 750 miles away along China’s southern coast, betel nuts are banned. Some media reportscall it“the fruit of the devil”.The message hasn’t got to Haikou. Reports of negative health effects are “just rumours”, says a woman surnamed Fu, who has been selling betel nuts for more than 30 years. “It’s a fruit, there’s nothing harmful to the body,” she says. “It’s actually good for your teeth.”But in the sluggish post-pandemic economy, business is starting to slow, even by sleepy Haikou’s standards.A few shops down from Fu, a woman whose surname is Wang also sells betel nuts. Like Fu, she’s heard nothing of the restrictions elsewhere in China. But she is ambivalent about the industry’s future. “These past two years have been really bad economically. Honestly, it’s been tough,” she says.View image in fullscreenBetel nuts for sale in Haikou, Hainan province. In Xiamen, 750 miles away, betel nuts are banned.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The Guardian“In the past, we might sell 10 to 20 catty [5-10kg] per day, but now we’re lucky if we sell five. The volume went down not because people no longer like betel nuts, it’s more about not having enough money to buy betel nuts and have proper meals at the same time. So consumption has gone down quite a bit compared to a few years ago.”But while business is slow, the number of people trying to get into the trade is increasing, Wang says, in part because there are so few jobs in other industries.Youth unemployment has beenstubbornly highsince the pandemic. In February, the unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds in China’s cities reached 16.9%, a two-year high. The overall urban unemployment rate was 5.4%, also a two-year high.Many young people, including graduates, have responded to the turndown by returning to their home towns and taking on menial work or “lying flat”.That has created competition for middle-aged sellers such as Wang and Fu. “In the past, people who sold betel nuts were mostly older, in their 50s or 60s,” Wang said. “But now, a lot of young people in their 20s or 30s are selling. It’s because there’s not much work.”Nationwide, the betel nut industry is expected to keep growing, in part because improved technology is increasing yields on industrial farms. But a market research report published in March by China Research Network, a corporate intelligence firm, predicts that the price of betel nut will be pushed down by increased competition among sellers, meaning that big, industrialised producers may survive at the expense of street-side vendors. China Research Network also predicts that the health warning about betel nut may finally start to catch on this year.Wang’s shop sells drinks and other snacks, but she thinks the betel nut business may finally decline. “There are almost no customers. No one has money. They need to save money for food first before buying betel nuts.”Additional research byJason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaHealthAsia PacificCancerFarmingFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’re going to have to buy their energy from us, because they need it and they’re going to have to buy it from us. They can buy it, we can knock off $350bn in one week.”Trump tariffs come into effect in ‘seismic’ shift to global tradeRead moreŠefčovič earlier rejected suggestions EU countries would abandon VAT, one of Trump’s grievances.He said the EU had spent “some time and energy” to explain to US counterparts how the sales tax works, citing its use in more than 160 countries.“We are ready to discuss, to look at things, but it has to be a mutually advantageous solution,” he said.The EU trade commissioner was speaking after it emerged that the union was likely to exempt US bourbon whiskey from its retaliation against Donald Trump’s tariffs, in a sign of tensions over how to handle the expanding trade war.EU member states will vote on Wednesday over a first round of possible retaliation, in response to Trump’stariffs on steel and aluminium announced last month.The bloc vowed to target up to €26bn (£22.3bn) worth of emblematic US goods, such as Harley-Davidson motorbikes, orange juice and jeans, with tariffs due to come into force from 15 April.Some countries, notably France and the Republic of Ireland, have been lobbying for bourbon to be dropped from the list, after Trump threatened 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne.On Monday, a European Commission vice-president, Stéphane Séjourné, told French Inter Radio he had “a hope” that bourbon would be removed from the list in the coming hours, saying “the message has been taken that the economic impact could be major”.But Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, warned that handing out exemptions would undermine the EU’s retaliation.“The stock markets are already collapsing and the damage could become even greater. It is therefore important … to act clearly and decisively and prudently, which means realising that we are in a strong position. America is in a position of weakness,” Habeck told reporters.“If every country is counted individually, and we have a problem here with red wine and there with whisky and pistachios, then it will all come to nothing,” he said.LiveEU ready to talk to US about tariffs but prepared to defend interests, says von der Leyen – videoItaly’s deputy prime minister, Antonio Tajani, suggested the EU could postpone enforcing counter-tariffs against the US until 30 April in order to create more time for dialogue, while stressing that Italy had no intention of putting the bloc “in difficulty”.The Italian prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, arranged to hold a meeting to discuss the tariffs and their impact on Italy with senior ministers later on Monday.According to reports in the Italian press, she is planning to go to Washington, possibly on 16 April, and intends to encourage Trump to halve the 20% tariff imposed on the EU.Meloni said last week that “alarmism” over the tariffs may be worse than the actual tariffs, and on Sunday added that while her government did not agree with the measures, it was “ready to deploy all tools” in order to shield Italian businesses.Šefčovič said there could be no delay to the 15 April start date, citing EU procedures, but said the measures would fall short of the €26bn originally outlined.“We are not in the business of tit for tat, or penny for penny. We will do this because we are forced to and we still hope we will come to the fruitful mutual advantageous trading relationship.”At a meeting of EU ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, differences also emerged over how to treat US tech companies, as the EU runs into limits on US goods it can target.In the planned counter-tariffs, the bloc aims to target US products that can be easily replaced, such as soya beans and consumer goods, rather than, for example, liquified natural gas,imported energy that is helping the EU replace Russian gas.France, which has called fora suspension of investment into the US, has said nothing should be off the table when it comes to retaliation.The French delegate for trade, Laurent Saint-Martin, said on Monday that no option on goods or services could be excluded and that the EU could be “extremely, extremely aggressive also in return”, referring to the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument.He said: “Our end goal remains the same, to negotiate this escalation and negotiate back to where things were, and if it’s not possible, of course, [the] European Union must react, must react firmly and must react proportionately.”But Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Harris, rejected calls to target US tech companies, describing such a measure as “an extraordinary escalation at a time when we must be working for a de-escalation”.The first face-to-face contact between the EU and the US administration over the tariffs will happen on Tuesday when Ireland’s agriculture minister meets his counterpart in Washington.The Irish deputy prime minister will then meet the US commerce secretary in the US capital on Wednesday to press home Irish and EU interests in de-escalating the dispute, which affects the Irish dairy and pharma sectors.The EU’s never-used anti-coercion law would allow the bloc to take wide-ranging measures against a country deemed to be using trade as a weapon, such as suspending intellectual property rights, revoking licences to do business in the EU and banning companies from bidding for public contracts.Šefčovič, who was briefing ministers on his recent calls with senior US officials, said “a paradigm shift” in global trade was under way.EU trade and economy ministers began meeting in Luxembourg as Trump’s tariffscontinued to roil global stock markets, deepening last week’s two-day sell-off that analysts calledone of the worst since the second world war.Trump’s tariffs are affecting €382bn of EU exports to the US.Habeck, the outgoing German economy minister, also gave a blunt verdict on Trump’s tariffs, saying the US president’s widely derided models were “ridiculous” and describing recent comments by Elon Musk as “a sign of weakness”.The billionaire adviser to the US president and owner of Tesla said over the weekend that he hoped to see complete freedom of trade between the US and Europe.Habeck said these comments showed Musk was afraid for his own companies: “If [Musk] has something to say he should go to his president and say it before we are talking about zero tariffs, let’s stop the nonsense, the mess you have just made in the last week.”Trump’s 20% tariff on all EU goods has been difficult to handle for his closest allies in Europe, such as Meloni, but also for Hungary’sViktor Orbán. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said he expected the European Commission to negotiate with the US and China and “to put solid suggestions on the table and succeed”.The former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said on Monday that Meloni, who was the only European prime minister to attend Trump’s inauguration in January, should “distance herself” from Trump.“This doesn’t mean declaring war against America, this means defending our businesses,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEuropeTariffsGiorgia MeloniViktor OrbánnewsShareReuse this content"

It also found that wastewater was left to run into the forest.View image in fullscreenGuests at Stedsans, which has now shut, were promised an idyllic rural stay.Photograph: Stedsans/InstagramStaff said multiple animals – including ducks – had died as a result of being left outside through the night by the couple, and others were left abandoned after the owners vanished.Stedsans was declared bankrupt in March and the couple reportedly registered themselves as living abroad before Christmas.According to the investigation, they left the Danish capital, where they owed millions of kroner in debt to Danish tax authorities, in 2016 to move to Sweden. There they set up Stedsans, but started accumulating debt to Swedish tax authorities, which reportedly amounted to 6m SEK (£470,000). They have since started a new hotel business in Guatemala.In a message posted on their website, they said: “We came very far with Stedsans, but we also had to realise on the way that being soul-driven entrepreneurs on a mission in a country where taxes are some of the highest in the world and bureaucracy is relentless, it is an impossible task.”They added: “When you read this we have probably been declared bankrupt by the Swedish tax authorities.

But in a statement on Thursday, the culture ministry said permission had been refused because “the proposed scenes are incompatible with the symbolism … and the values the Acropolis represents”.Bugonia is Lanthimos’s latest collaboration with Emma Stone, who won the best actress Oscar for her role in his 2023 comedy Poor Things. In their new film, whose scheduled November release date suggests a major awards push, Stone stars as the CEO of a major pharmaceutical company kidnapped by a conspiracist bee-keeper, played by her Kinds of Kindness co-star Jesse Plemons.The scenes in question depicted 70 dead bodies placed between two of the Greek citadel’s key sites: the Propylaea, its complex of Doric entrance buildings, and the Parthenon, the temple dedicated to the goddess Athena.View image in fullscreenViggo Mortensen and Kirsten Dunst in The Two Faces of January.Photograph: Jack English/AllstarLanthimos’s request appears to have initially been welcomed by the ministry of culture, who agreed to waive the standard filming fee for the Acropolis – around €1,984 (£1,700) per day – in recognition of the director’s international standing.However, this offer was subject to the approval of theCentral Archaeological Council, which oversees the Acropolis. They rejected Lanthimos’s proposal, citing symbolic inappropriateness and insufficient reverence, and suggested nearby alternatives where he could film.The ministry of culture is said to have delayed its final ruling until producers from the film indicated whether they would pursue another location. On Wednesday, culture minister Lina Mendoni received a letter from Lanthimos’s team, reiterating their previously rejected request, but reportedly not providing sufficient grounds for her to ask the Central Archeological Council to reconsider.Despite being widely regarded as one of the planet’s most important cultural artefacts, the Acropolis in Athens has often been used as a filming location. It featured extensively in Sophia Loren’s 1957 breakthrough, Boy on a Dolphin, as well as in more recent films such as Patricia Highsmith adaptation The Two Faces of January (2014) and Before Midnight (2013).Comparable sites, such as Stonehenge or the Vatican, are usually rebuilt as replicas.Born in Athens, Lanthimos, 51, was among the creative team behind the TV visuals for the 2004 Olympics held in the city. He made his breakthrough film with 2009’s Dogtooth, which won the Un Certain Regard prize at Cannes and was nominated for the best international Oscar.View image in fullscreenYorgos Lanthimos, Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, Mark Ruffalo and Ramy Youssef at the 2024 Golden Globes.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPAAlps (2011), The Lobster (2015) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017) cemented his reputation for challenging absurdist comedies, before he found mainstream acclaim with Queen Anne comedy-drama The Favourite (2018), which was nominated for 10 Oscars, winning best actress for Olivia Colman.Lanthimos’s first photography monograph, titledDear God, the Parthenon Is Still Broken, featured photos shot behind the scenes on Poor Things. A second book, I Shall Sing These Songs Beautifully, collected shots from the production of Kinds of Kindness.An exhibition of some of these photographs – Lanthimos’s first bricks-and-mortar show – has just opened at a gallery in Los Angeles.Explore more on these topicsFilmYorgos LanthimosGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he said.Trump’s comments triggered a mass sell-off on Asian stock markets overnight and prompted the billionaire investor Bill Ackman, one of the US president’s backers in the 2024 race for the White House, to call for a moratorium, saying that sweeping tariffs “on our friends and our enemies alike” had caused an “economic nuclear war”.Markets brace for another volatile week as Trump’s most punitive tariffs kick inRead moreInEurope, stock markets plunged in early trading on Monday. The FTSE 100 fell as much as 6%, before recovering slightly to a fall of 4.38% by the end of the day, while Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC 40 also ended the day down more than 4%.FTSE 100 chartOn the FTSE 100, the industrial groups Babcock, Rolls-Royce and Melrose were among the biggest fallers, as well as investment companies and Barclays Bank, which has large operations in the US, as concerns over a tariff-induced global recession continued to rip through markets.Global markets chartOvernight, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index tumbled 8%, and Hong Kong and Chinese stocks also dived, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index down 12%. Shares in the Chinese tech companies Alibaba and Tencent fell more than 8%. In South Korea,trading on the Kospi index was halted for five minutes at 9.12am as stocks plummeted.Asian markets chartIn Taiwan, the market fell almost 10%, the largest one-day point and percentage loss on record. Falls were driven by the tech companies TSMC and Foxconn, triggering circuit breakers.More than $160bn was wiped off theAustralian stock markets.Oil prices sank, continuing a trend over the last week. Brent crude fell by more than $10 to $63.84, sending shares in oil majors sliding down. BP, which has lost two-fifths of its value over the past year, tumbled another 5% and Shell lost almost 6%.Hang Sen chartAfter falling over the last week, gold rose slightly to $2,362. Gold has proved to be a safe haven asset during the coronavirus pandemic and thewar in Ukraine, doubling its value since 2020.Investors also reacted to the prospect of deeper interest rate cuts on Monday. Tradersincreased their predictionsfor UK rate cuts, pricing in three quarter-point drops in the UK, from 4.5% to 3.75% with a 90% expectation of a cut in May, while the Bank of Japan, which has been increasing interest rates, was expected to pause.Trump said he had spoken over the weekend to leaders from Europe and Asia, who hope to convince him to lower tariffs that are as high as 50% and due to take effect this week. “They are coming to the table. They want to talk but there’s no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis,” Trump said.Trump’s tariff announcement last weekjolted economies around the world, triggeringretaliatory levies from Chinaand sparking fears of a global trade war and recession. On Sunday morning talkshows, Trump’s top economic advisers sought to portray the tariffs as a savvy repositioning of the US in the global trade order. They alsotried to minimise the economic shocksfrom last week’s tumultuous rollout.The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said more than 50 nations had started negotiations with the US since last Wednesday’s announcement.Bessent said there was “no reason” to anticipate a recession, citing stronger-than-anticipated US jobs growth last month, before the tariffs were announced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Higher “reciprocal” tariff rates of 11% to 50% on individual countries are due to take effect on Wednesday at 12.01am eastern daily time.Some governments have already signalled a willingness to engage with the US to avoid the duties.In his first significant intervention since the US ushered in a new economic era last week, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the government wouldstep in to support key British industries.He is to announce plans to give carmakers more flexibility over how they meet a target to stop sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. Other sectors to be hit by Trump’s tariffs are expected to receive support later in the week, with life sciences likely to be among them.Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said uncertainty was another factor dragging down markets after US administration officials gave contradictory statements “causing investors to question the existence of a master plan”.He said: “Investors had assumed Trump’s trade taxes were a bargaining tool, as during the first term. That depends on competent policymaking to balance the benefits of trade negotiations against the damage of tariffs.“If the competence of policymaking is questioned, markets will worry that economic damage will be lasting”A search for safe havens benefited European and other industrialised nations, and the value of their bonds rallyied and the cost of borrowing fell.The two-year gilt yield, which is a proxy for the interest rate, fell to its lowest since September 2024 at 3.814%, down 12 basis points (bps) on the day, while 10-year yields sank to their lowest since December at 4.379%, down 6 bps, before recovering to be 3 bps lower.“With Europe facing both recession and disinflation from global trade disruption, we suspect ECB/BoE terminal rate pricing can shift lower still,” market strategists at the US bank Citi wrote in a note to clients.Goldman Sachsincreased its predictions for a US recessionover the next 12 months, from a 35% chance to 45%.Tariff-stunned markets face another week of potential turmoil after theworst week for US stocks since the onset of the Covid-19 crisisfive years ago.The White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett denied the tariffs were part of a Trump strategy to crash financial markets to pressure the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

It was organised by the Rochdale MP Paul Waugh.In a statement in the Commons, Falconer said both were given clearance for entrance by Israeli before travelling and said the ban “appears to have been taken on the basis of comments made in this chamber”, calling the treatment “unacceptable and deeply concerning”.He said the UK government had made that clear at the “highest level” in Israel and praised Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed for their dignity.Yang and Mohamed both rose in the house to cheers. Mohamed said her treatment was “unprecedented” and the views she had expressed in theHouse of Commonswere “legitimate political opinions which are firmly aligned with international laws”. She said many Israeli people and charities had also called for change in a similar manner.“This was not about security, this was about control and censorship,” Mohamed, the MP for Sheffield Central, said, adding that she “desperately wants to see a two-state solution, desperately wants to see peace”.Yang, the MP for Earley and Woodley, said she had been heartened by the solidarity shown by other MPs from across the Commons. Yang said she had understood the risks of travelling the region but “I did not anticipate the risks of detention and deportation by a British ally”. She said: “If my experience has proved anything, it is that what we say in this chamber matters.”Falconer said the MPs had initially believed they were going to be detained overnight without their phones and were eventually released after intervention by both him and theforeign secretary, David Lammy, who spoke to his Israeli counterpart.“All members should be worried about what this decision means and the precedent it sets. We have warned that actions like this only damage the image of the Israeli government in the eyes of honourable members across the house,” Falconer said.The minister also condemning the killing of 15 paramedics in a convoy of ambulances near Rafah, calling it an “outrage” and demanding a return to ceasefire negotiations. “This conflict cannot be won by bombs and bullets but by diplomacy, he said.At the photocall in support of the MPs, Streeting told the Guardian he had been on a similar visit led by the Council for Arab British-Understanding (Caabu) and Medical Aid for Palestinians – and questioned why the two had been targeted.“The way that two really excellent colleagues were treated was totally unacceptable,” he said.“I think this is really important that this is understood in the context of two highly respectedLabourmembers of parliament held in high regard across the parliamentary party who were going on a delegation just like the one I was on with Caabu and Medical Aid for Palestinians – without the sort of challenges they had.“In the context of what is going on in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the moment, having insight, meeting a range of voices is really important. It’s highly regrettable the Israeli authorities have acted in this way.”MPs joining the show of solidarity included the chair of the foreign affairs select committee Emily Thornberry, the Treasury select committee chair, Meg Hillier, Melanie Ward, the Labour MP who was the former chief executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians, and the former development minister Anneliese Dodds.Caabu has taken a total of 161 MP and peers to the region since 1997, including Streeting, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, the former education secretary Kit Malthouse and the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey.Other high-profile politicians who have visited as part of their delegations include former ministers Nick Herbert and the late Tessa Jowell and the Lib Dem MPs Alistair Carmichael and Christine Jardine.Speaking in the chamber, Falconer condemned thecomments of the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, who said on Sunday that the two MPs were not allowed entry because the Israeli authorities “did not believe they were going to comply with Israeli law”. Falconer said that was not the reason that the Israeli officials gave, adding: “The leader of the opposition should apologise.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsIsrael-Gaza warLabourHouse of CommonsIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It claimed on Sunday that at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, but has provided no evidence. None of those killed were armed.It said on Monday that its initial investigation into the killings had shown that the incident occurred “due to a sense of threat”, and claimed six Hamas militants had been in the vicinity.The Israeli army chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir ordered a more in-depth investigation into the attack after completion of the initial one.The president of the Red Crescent in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Younis al-Khatib, told journalists in Ramallah: “There has been an autopsy of the martyrs from the Red Crescent and civil defence teams. We cannot disclose everything we know, but I will say that all the martyrs were shot in the upper part of their bodies, with the intent to kill.”He called for an international investigation into the killings, which the IDF has separately announced it was looking into.“Why did you hide the bodies?” Khatib asked of the Israeli forces involved in the attack. “We call on the world to form an independent and impartial international commission of inquiry into the circumstances of the deliberate killing of the ambulance crews in the Gaza Strip.“It is no longer sufficient to speak of respecting the international law and Geneva convention. It is now required from the international community and the UN security council to implement the necessary punishment against all who are responsible.”In the past 18 months of war Israeli forces have conducted attacks that have killed hundreds of medical workers and the staff of NGOs and UN organisations, including foreign nationals working in Gaza. Six members of World Central Kitchen, including the Briton James Kirby, died in a sustained Israeli attack on their clearly marked vehicles.Human rights organisations have long accused Israel of a culture of impunity with few soldiers ever facing justice.A Palestinian journalist was killed and several others wounded on Monday, when Israel struck a media tent near Nasser hospital in Khan Younis.According to the Palestinian Civil Defence, an organisation affiliated with Hamas’s interior ministry, two people – Helmi al-Faqawi and a civilian, Yousef al-Khazandar – were killed when the Palestine Today agency’s tent was struck.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

One video showed people screaming as a bystander attempted to move a burning piece of furniture, while a journalist, later identified as Ahmed Mansour of the news outlet Palestine Today, sat upright engulfed by the blaze.His colleague Helmi al-Faqawi was killed in the strike, while at least nine other journalists were among the wounded. Mansour received treatment for severe burns while the photographer Hassan Aslih was reportedly in a stable condition after suffering a head injury and cuts to his right hand.Israel military razed Gaza perimeter land to create ‘kill zone’, soldiers sayRead moreThe Palestinian foreign ministry in Ramallah said 10 people had been killed in the airstrike, with many more wounded. The ministry called al-Faqawi’s death an act of “extrajudicial killing,” labelling it part of growing crimes against journalists and an attempt to prevent the media from covering events on the ground.Dozens of journalists in Gaza joined al-Faqawi’s relatives to bury the slain reporter in the hours after the attack, placing a blue flak jacket on top of the white shroud covering his body on a stretcher. His killing has brought the number of Palestinian journalists killed since October 2023 to 207, according to the Palestinian foreign ministry in the occupied West Bank.“We will continue to deliver the message and convey the truth to the whole world. This is our humanitarian duty,” the journalist Abd Shaat told Reuters. He said that the noise of the airstrike had woken them, only for them to see that a nearby tent sheltering their colleagues was on fire.Since the beginning of Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip hundreds of people have sought shelter in encampments in hospital grounds across the besieged territory, hoping that proximity will provide a measure of safety.The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and the Shin Bet security agency said the airstrike on the hospital grounds was targeting Aslih, whom they accused of being a member of Hamas. In a statement, the IDF accused Aslih of taking part in Hamas’s attack on a string of Israeli towns and kibbutzimon 7 October 2023, when 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.He took part in the attack by uploading “footage of looting, arson and murder to social media”, the IDF said. Aslih has documented the impact of Israeli attacks on Gaza by uploading photos and video to his Instagram page, followed by 571,000 people.His most recent post showed the funeral of the journalist Islam Miqdad, her blue flak jacket also draped across the white shroud over her body, in a burial ritual for journalists. Miqdad was killed inan attack on the buildingwhere she was sheltering with her young son in western Khan Younis.“My daughter is innocent. She had no involvement, she loved journalism and adored it,” Miqdad’s mother Amal Kaskeen told the Associated Press.Last year was the deadliest on record for journalists, with Israel responsible for 70% of the total deaths of media workers, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Israel’s assault on Gaza claimed the lives of 82 Palestinian journalists in 2024, according to CPJ.Israel resumed airstrikes on Gaza after afragile ceasefire collapsed last month. The UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees said another 142,000 people were displaced in just six days in March after the resumption of fighting.Fifty-nine hostages, including 24 understood to be alive, are still held by militants in Gaza. Israel’s assault on the territory has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in 18 months of war, a third of them children,according tothe health ministry in Ramallah.Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesJournalist safetyIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

They were collected byBreaking the Silence, a group founded in 2004 by Israeli veterans who aim to expose the reality of the military’s grip over Palestinians. The Guardian interviewed four of the soldiers who corroborated the accounts.Titled “The Perimeter” andpublished on Monday, the report said the stated purpose of the plan was to create a thick strip of land that provided a clear line of sight for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to identify and kill militants. “This space was to have no crops, structures, or people. Almost every object, infrastructure installation, and structure within the perimeter was demolished,” it said.map of Gaza Strip indicating buffer zone around it and the extension of this zoneSoldiers were “given orders to deliberately, methodically, and systematically annihilate whatever was within the designated perimeter, including entire residential neighbourhoods, public buildings, educational institutions, mosques, and cemeteries, with very few exceptions”, the report added.The ultimate result, however, was the creation of “a death zone of enormous proportions”, the report said. “Places where people had lived, farmed, and established industry were transformed into a vast wasteland, a strip of land eradicated in its entirety.”It stretches along the frontier with Israel, from the Mediterranean coast in the north to the strip’s south-east corner next to Egypt.A sergeant in the combat engineers corps said that once an area in the perimeter “was pretty much empty of any Gazans, we essentially started getting missions that were about basically blowing up houses or what was left of the houses”.This was the routine, they said: “Get up in the morning, each platoon gets five, six, or seven locations, seven houses that they’re supposed to work on. We didn’t know a lot about the places that we were destroying or why we were doing it. I guess those things today, from my perspective now, are not legitimate. What I saw there, as far as I can judge, was beyond what I can justify that was needed.”View image in fullscreenAn Israeli attack on southern Gaza Strip as seen from behind the border fence inside southern Israel last week.Photograph: Jim Hollander/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockSome soldiers testified that commanders viewed the destruction as a way of exacting revenge for the 7 October attacks by Hamas, which sparked the current war when Palestinian militants killed hundreds and kidnapped Israeli and foreign citizens.While Israel says the war is targeted at Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, is fightingallegations of war crimes and crimes against humanityat the international criminal court, including starvation of civilians and “extermination”.The IDF did not respond to a request for comment on the report and combatants’ accounts.One of the soldiers who provided testimony to Breaking the Silence on condition of anonymity said their unit was told to shoot anyone in the perimeter area on sight. The mentality in their unit, they said, was that there was no such thing as a “civilian” and everyone who walked into the perimeter would be considered a “terrorist”.Rules on who can be killed on sight appeared to vary for different units, according to the accounts.A sergeant in the armoured corps said that in 2024 he was given “shoot to kill” orders for any male adult who entered the perimeter. “For women and children, [the order was] ‘shoot to drive away’, and if they come close to the fence, you stop [them]. You don’t kill women, children, or the elderly. ‘Shoot to drive away’ means a tank fire,” he said.View image in fullscreenIsraeli troops and tanks deployed near an agricultural field next to the border with the Gaza Strip.Photograph: Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty ImagesBut a captain in an armoured corps unit who operated in Gaza earlier in the war, in November 2023, described the border area as a “kill zone”, saying: “The borderline is a kill zone. Anyone who crosses a certain line, that we have defined, is considered a threat and is sentenced to death.”Another captain said there were “no clear rules of engagement at any point” and described a “generally massive use of firepower, especially, like with tanks”. They added: “There was a lot of instigating fire for the sake of instigating fire, somewhere between [wanting to produce] a psychological effect and just for no reason.“[We] set out on this war out of insult, out of pain, out of anger, out of the sense that we had to succeed. This distinction [between civilians and terrorist infrastructure], it didn’t matter. Nobody cared. We decided on a line … past which everyone is a suspect.”How Palestinians would know they were crossing an invisible line was not made clear to them, the soldiers said. “How they know is a really good question. Enough people died or got injured crossing that line, so they don’t go near it.”Before the latest war, Israel had previously established a buffer zone inside Gaza that extended to 300 metres, but the new one was intended to range from 800 to 1,500 metres, according to the testimonies.Satellite imagery has previously revealed the IDFdestroyed hundreds of buildingsthat stood within 1km to 1.2km of the perimeter fence, in a systematic demolishing act thatrights groups say may constitute collective punishmentand should be investigated as a war crime. Last week, Israel’s defence ministersaidthe military would seize “large areas” in Gaza in a fresh offensive.The perimeter accounts for just over 15% of the Gaza Strip, which is entirely off-limits to Palestinian residents. It represents 35% of the strip’s entire agricultural land, according to the report.Despite shoot-to-kill orders, a warrant officer stationed in northern Gaza said Palestinians kept going back to the area “again and again after we fired at them”.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli army vehicle moves near the border with the Gaza Strip, as seen last week from a position on the Israeli side in southern Israel.Photograph: Amir Levy/Getty ImagesThe officer said the Palestinians appeared to want to pick edible plants growing in the area. “There was hubeiza [mallow] there because no one went near there. People are hungry, so they come with bags to pick hubeiza, I think.”Some got away with their food and their lives, the officer said. “The thing is that, at that point, the IDF really is fulfilling the public’s wishes, which state: ‘There are no innocents in Gaza’.”In an interview with the Guardian, the same officer said the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 made many Israelis feel the “need to pick up a gun”.“A lot of us went there, I went there, because they killed us and now we’re going to kill them,” they said. “And I found out that we’re not only killing them – we’re killing them, we’re killing their wives, their children, their cats, their dogs. We’re destroying their houses and pissing on their graves.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelHuman rightsWar crimesnewsShareReuse this content"

The military campaign was in response to Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which more than 1,200 people, also mostly civilian, were killed and a further 250 taken hostage.Mansfield, who is known for his work on landmark cases such as the Grenfell Tower fire, Stephen Lawrence and the Birmingham Six, said: “​If one of our nationals is committing ​an offence, we ought to be doing something about it​. Even if we can’t stop the government of foreign countries behaving badly, we can at least stop our nationals from behaving badly.“British nationals are under a legal obligation not to collude with crimes committed in Palestine. No one is above the law.”The report, which has been submitted on behalf of the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) and the British-based Public Interest Law Centre (PILC), covers alleged offences committed in the territory from October 2023 to May 2024 and took six months to compile.Each of the crimes attributed to the 10 suspects, some of whom are dual nationals, amounts to a war crime or crime against humanity, according to the report.One witness, who was at a medical facility, saw corpses “scattered on the ground, especially in the middle of the hospital courtyard, where many dead bodies were buried in a mass grave”. A bulldozer “ran over a dead body in a horrific and heart-wrenching scene desecrating the dead”, the witness said. They also said a bulldozer demolished part of the hospital.Sean Summerfield, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, who helped compile the dossier, said it was based on open-source evidence and witness testimony, which together presented a “compelling” case.“The public will be shocked, I would have thought, to hear that there’s credible evidence that Brits have been directly involved in committing some of those atrocities,” he said, adding that the team wanted to see individuals “appearing at the Old Bailey to answer for atrocity crimes”.The report says Britain has a responsibility under international treaties to investigate and prosecute those who have committed “core international crimes”.Section 51 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 states that it “is an offence against the law of England and Wales for a person to commit genocide, a crime against humanity, or a war crime”, even if it takes place in another country.Raji Sourani, the director of the PCHR, said: “​This is illegal, this is inhuman and​ enough is enough. The government cannot say we didn’t know; we are providing them with all ​the evidence.”Paul Heron, the legal director of the PILC, said: “We’re filing our report to make clear these war crimes are not in our name.”Scores of legal and human rights experts have signed a letter of support urging the war crimes team to investigate the complaints.Explore more on these topicsWar crimesIsrael-Gaza warMetropolitan policeIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “It was just hard to believe she was real. I knew she was ours, but it’s just hard to believe.”View image in fullscreenGrace and Angus Davidson with baby Amy Isabel, and the baby’s aunt and the donor of the womb, Amy Purdie.Photograph: Joe Daniel/PAThe couple always had “a quiet hope” the womb transplant would be a success and enable them to start a family, Davidson said. “But it wasn’t really until she arrived that the reality of it sunk in.”The development will offer new hope to women born without a womb or whose womb fails to function. Three more womb transplants have been carried out in the UK, using deceased donors, with medics hoping the recipients of those wombs will have babies.About 10 more women are going through the process of approval for a £25,000 womb transplant in the UK, but hundreds more have expressed an interest in the programme, which is funded by Womb Transplant UK.The charity has permission for 10 deceased donor transplants and five living donor transplants. It hopes the NHS may provide funding in future.The arrival of Amy Isabel follows 25 years of pioneering research led by Prof Richard Smith, clinical lead at the charity, who was in the operating theatre with Quiroga when the 2.04kg (4.5lb) baby was delivered.View image in fullscreenAmy Isabel.Photograph: Womb Transplant UK/PASmith told PA Media: “I feel great joy actually, unbelievable – 25 years down the line from starting this research, we finally have a baby, little Amy Isabel. Astonishing, really astonishing.”Smith, a consultant gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust, said: “There’s been a lot of tears shed by all of us in this process – really quite emotional, for sure. It is really something.”Quiroga, a consultant surgeon at the Oxford Transplant Centre, part of Oxford University hospitals, said: “For me, it’s total joy, delight. I couldn’t be happier for Angus and Grace, what a wonderful couple. It was overwhelming actually, it remains overwhelming. It’s fantastic.”Davidson, an NHS dietitian from north London, was born with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, a rare condition that affects about one in every 5,000 women, meaning they have an underdeveloped or missing womb. The ovaries remain intact and still function to produce eggs and female hormones, however, making conceiving via fertility treatment a possibility.Before receiving the donated womb, Davidson and her husband had fertility treatment to create seven embryos, which were frozen for IVF in central London.She had surgery in February 2023 to receive the womb from Purdie, 42, who has two girls aged 10 and six. Several months later, one of the stored embryos was transferred via IVF to Davidson.Angus Davidson said the moment his daughter arrived was very emotional. He said: “Having waited such a long time, it’s kind of odd getting your head around that this is the moment where you are going to meet your daughter.“The room was full of people who have helped us on the journey to actually having Amy. We had been kind of suppressing emotion, probably for 10 years, and you don’t know how that’s going to come out – ugly crying, it turns out!“The room was just so full of love and joy and all these people that had a vested interest in Amy for incredible medical and science reasons. But the lines between that and the love for our family and for Amy are very much blurred – it felt like a room full of love.“The moment we saw her was incredible, and both of us just broke down in emotional tears.”Purdie said watching her sister and brother-in-law become parents had been “an absolute joy” and “worth every moment” of what she had been through to donate her womb.Davidson took immunosuppressants during her pregnancy to ensure her body did not reject her sister’s womb. She said she definitely wanted to have another child.More than 100 womb transplants have been carried out worldwide, with at least 50 babies thought to have been born as a result.The first successful birth after a transplanttook place in Sweden in 2014, with the baby – Vincent – born to a 36-year-old woman who described him as “perfect”.Explore more on these topicsFertility problemsPregnancyWomenHealthFamilyParents and parentingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Rishi Sunak useda helicopter owned by Harpinfor campaign stops in the run-up to last year’s general election.A source close to Harpin said that while he had paused his donations, he remained a strong supporter of the Conservatives.Until recently, Harpin, who grew up in Northumberland, made a monthly £33,000 cash donation to the party, which paid for its northern HQ in Leeds. This has now ended and the Leeds HQ is likely to close as a result, two Tory sources said.The Tories announced their plan to establish a northern HQ in October 2020, almost a year after Boris Johnson’s landslide election victory, in which dozens of “red wall” seats in the north of England flipped from Labour to Conservative. The new offices were opened by Oliver Dowden, then party chair, in the spring of 2022 on the outskirts of Leeds city centre.Labour won back most of those red wall constituencies last summer, and there has since been speculation that the northern Tory HQ was slated for closure as the party faced financial difficulties.View image in fullscreenDuring Kemi Badenoch’s leadership, several Tory donors have been successfully wooed by Reform UK.Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesA Conservative party source said Harpin had agreed to fund the Leeds office for an extra year to cover the general election period after an initial two years. The source said that although the party was reviewing its properties, there were no plans to shut down operations in the north.Despite cash woes, the Conservatives outperformed other parties’ fundraising efforts at the end of last year –raising nearly £2m in the last three monthsof 2024, which was twice as much as Labour and seven times more than Reform. A Conservative party source said they were expecting a strong showing in the first quarter of 2025 too.One Tory insider said Harpin took his decision to stop donating after a meeting with party co-chair Dominic Johnson, who has faced some internal criticism, but sources close to the HomeServe founder and the party denied this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is speculation that the party will move out of its headquarters in Westminster to cut costs.Last spring, the Conservatives were fined nearly £11,000 for under-reporting the value of non-cash donations received from Harpin for three years. On top of his cash donations, he funded the secondment of an employee to the party.Harpin, who began his career as a brand manager for Procter & Gamble in Newcastle upon Tyne and stepped down as chair of HomeServe in January. He and his wife secured a reported £500m in 2022 after he sold the company to a Canadian firmfor more than £4bn. The Sunday Times rich list placed him as the Britain’s 242nd richest person last year, with a worth of £670m, up £40m on the year before.During the run-up to the election in July several Conservative donors including the Phones 4u founder, John Caudwell, and the carpet tycoon Philip Harris switched to support Labour.In the past six months, several other Tory donors including the billionaire property developer Nick Candyhave been wooed by Reform.

This will not impact our investigation, which remains ongoing.”The IOPC will decide at the end of the investigation whether Chilton should face disciplinary proceedings, and added that no criminal offences had been identified.Jones, the Conservative PCC for Hampshire, said: “The chief constable has retired after 33 years of service. The IOPC investigation will continue notwithstanding his retirement.” She said she had appointed the deputy chief constable, Sam de Reya, as acting chief constable to continue leading the force.After the first allegation was made known in February, Jones had voiced her support for Chilton. “The chief constable remains in post and has my full support to continue reducing crime, increasing detection rates and making communities safer across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight,” she said at the time.Chilton was alsothe national lead, on behalf of all chief constables, for investigations – which included standards and accreditation, retention and recruitment of detectives, homicide and coronial investigations, as well as being lead for tactics, training and equipment.The allegations against Chilton were first made by the former DCI Roger Wood, who himself was found to have committed gross misconduct after striking up sexual relationships with junior police staff.Asked at his own hearing if having an affair was misconduct, it is understood that Wood – who quit while under investigation – said: “Well the chief constable had an affair.”That led to a mandatory referral to the police watchdog on 27 February, a week after Wood’s hearing concluded with him being banned from serving again.Explore more on these topicsPoliceHampshireIndependent Office for Police ConductnewsShareReuse this content"

About 15,000 people are expected to work on the construction at its peak.Nisbet, a project director, was sacked for gross misconduct by Notus after he gave Daniels a quad bike to get more work out of him, the hearing in Bristol was told.Nisbet told the tribunal that Daniels was a “greedy little toad” and was “hard to say no to”.It was heard Nisbet and other senior staff at Notus had bribed Daniels, who had been appointed as head of lifting and temporary works at Hinkley by EDF. Daniels was bribed to “ensure that work was directed their way”, it was heard.Nisbet was also caught up in allegations he bribed Daniels with tickets to a boxing event in London and with a refill for his Montblanc pen. He argued he had nothing to do with the boxing invitation and said the refill was a spare that he got for himself.He also argued that his “favours” were simply lunches, coffee and biscuits. The tribunal found he could not provide an “innocent” explanation for the quad bike, however.A judge found that Nisbet was involved in the bribery for more than two years before he and another colleague were sacked by Notus at the start of 2023.Daniels was “under investigation” by EDF and HPC, the tribunal heard.Nisbet told the tribunal he “did not accept that the evidence indicated that he was clearly involved”. He said he was “exasperated” by Daniels, adding: “He was known as asking for favours, was self-entitled and greedy, was cheeky and a greedy little toad.”Nisbet won a claim of unfair dismissal as the employment judge Colm O’Rourke found his dismissal had been pre-decided and did not go through a proper process. But Judge O’Rourke said Nisbet did not deserve compensation.He said: “While [Notus] clearly had not followed a proper procedure and presented sham correspondence to [Mr Nisbet], [Notus] witnesses readily admitted that … they felt that they had no option but to proceed as they did.“In contrast, [Mr Nisbet] was on occasions evasive and self-serving in his evidence.“While [he] may have been able to explain away some of the allegations against him, or challenged the level of seriousness of them (the pen refill, for example) … the core allegation against him, in relation to the quad bike, which has been forensically examined in this hearing, still remains incapable of an innocent explanation.“I conclude, therefore that the following of a fair disciplinary procedure would, in any event, have made no difference to the outcome of this case, [Mr Nisbet’s] summary dismissal for gross misconduct and that therefore no compensation is awardable to [him].”“It is clear from the evidence that [Mr Nisbet] was, on the balance of probabilities, complicit in bribery and corruption involving Mr Daniels, over a two-year plus period and thus engaged in culpable behaviour.”Daniels declined to comment.A spokesperson for Hinkley Point C said: “The project sets and enforces high standards for all employees, contractors and suppliers and will rigorously investigate and take action over inappropriate conduct.”Explore more on these topicsHinkley Point CSomersetnewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, the impact on carbon emissions as a result of these changes is negligible.”Under the measures, luxury supercar companies such as Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep producing petrol cars beyond 2030 because they manufacture only a small number of vehicles a year.New hybrids and plug-in hybrid cars will be allowed to be sold until 2035. Petrol and diesel vans will be able to be sold until 2035, as well as all hybrid models.The Green party MP Siân Berry said: “The government is wrong to apply the brakes on the sale of EV cars.“This is just the latest in a series of boosts the Labour government has given fossil fuel industries. We’ve also seen thegreen light being given to airport expansionand anew road tunnel under the Thames.“This suggests Labour is weakening its climate commitments, and its health-related policy goals because all these moves will have a detrimental impact on air quality.“Slowing down the move away from fossil-fuelled transport makes no economic sense either, since green sectors of the economy are growing three times faster than the overall UK economy.”Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “In weakening the mandate elsewhere by extending flexibilities and allowing the sale of standard hybrids between 2030 and 2035, the government risks reducing the competition it has stimulated between manufacturers, meaning prices for families seeking an EV might not fall as fast, and sales could slow.“The growth of the secondhand EV market, where most of us buy our cars, would in turn be stunted, leaving millions of families stuck in petrol and hybrid cars paying a petrol premium of hundreds, and even thousands, of pounds a year.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We want people to be able to benefit from those lower running costs as well.“And so it’s important that, as a government, we do everything that we can – not only to support British businesses and manufacturing to grow the economy, but also to cut those carbon emissions, and I think we’ve struck the right balance in the package that we’re announcing today.”Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if Starmer was prepared to use the relationship he has built with Trump to ask him to change course, she said: “Obviously when the prime minister has discussions internationally with allies he will be honest about what is in the best interests of the British people.”Challenged that the EV measures were planned before the announcement of the tariffs and were a tweak to policy rather than dramatic change, she told Today: “These are significant changes to the car industry. You are right to say we started the consultation on Christmas Eve and that we closed the consultation in the middle of February.”She said Trump’s imposition of tariffs meant the UK government had to look at its EV plans with “renewed urgency”.Explore more on these topicsTransport policyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsLabourTravel and transportEthical and green livingGreenhouse gas emissionsGreen politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Kennedy also said he’s assembling a taskforce to focus on the issue.Also on Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was reviewing “new scientific information” on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. The EPA has primary authority to set the maximum level of fluoridation in public water systems.Kennedy told the Associated Press of his plans after a news conference with Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, in Salt Lake City.Kennedy cannot order communities to stop fluoridation, but he can tell the CDC to stop recommending it and work with the EPA to change the allowed amount.Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.The Republican governor Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by 7 May.Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as “the leader in making America healthy again”. He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state’s fluoride law.“I’m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,” he said.Kennedy oversees the CDC, whose recommendations are widely followed but not mandatory. State and local governments decide whether to add fluoride to water and, if so, how much – as long as it does not exceed a maximum set by the EPA, which is currently 4 milligrams per liter.Zeldin said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.“When this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency’s future steps,” Zeldin said.“Secretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.”Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” and said also it has been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.In November, just days before the presidential election, Kennedy declared that Donald Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day as president. That did not happen, but Trump later picked Kennedy to run the health department, where he has been expected to take some kind of action.Meanwhile, some localities have gone ahead and decisions whether to keep fluoridating water.Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the US population receives fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.About one-third of community water systems – 17,000 out of 51,000 across the US – serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.But over time, studies have documented potential problems.A report last year by the federal government’s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter – more than twice the recommended level in the US – was associated with lower IQs in kids.Utah OralHealthCoalition chair Lorna Koci said she hopes other states push back against the removal of fluoride and that Kennedy’s visit to celebrate her state’s fluoride ban underscores the political motivations of those who support it.She predicted children will have more cavities as a result and said backers of the fluoride legislation in Utah spread false information that raised doubts about its effectiveness.“This seems to be less about fluoride and more about power,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsHealthRobert F Kennedy JrnewsShareReuse this content"

The family has not been named or spoken out publicly.Jaime Cook, principal of the Sackets Harbor school district where the children reportedly attended class, wrotea letterto the community pleading for the students’ safe return.She described the students as having “no ties to criminal activity” and that they are “loved in their classrooms”.“We are in shock,” the letter reads. “And it is that shared shock that has unified our community in the call for our students’ release.”The family was taken into custody in a 27 March raid at a large dairy farm in the remote town that has a population of fewer than 1,500 in Jefferson county in north-western New York state, on Lake Ontario near the Canadian border. The target of the raid was reportedly a South African national charged with trafficking in child sexual abuse material, whom they apprehended, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents said.But authorities separately picked up and detained the family, as well as three other immigrants they said were without documentation. The family was moved to the Karnes county immigration processing center, a privately run detention facility in Texas, by 30 March.Cook’s letter said that the family had declared themselves to immigration judges, were attending court on their assigned dates and had been following the legal process.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the children are aged nine, 15 and 18. The New York branch of the advocacy group called the detentions “outrageous” and their release “a huge relief”.The release of the family was confirmed on Monday by local officials, school administrators, and the New York governor,Kathy Hochul.Hochul said ina statementthat she had direct confirmation from Homan that “this family – a third grader, two teenagers and their mother - are currently on their way back to Jefferson county. I cannot imagine the trauma these kids and their mom are feeling, and I pray they will be able to heal when they return home.”The protests were organized with the help of the Jefferson county committee of the Democratic Party. Corey Decillis, committee chair, toldNBC Newsthese raids “occur right in the last 60 days across the country, but when it happens in your backyard, I think that’s what garners people’s attention.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The family was subsequently transferred thousands of miles away, to a detention facility in Texas. Today, after mounting public pressure and a historic rally in Sackets Harbor on Saturday, Ice released the family, who are now on their way home.”The New York Civil Liberties Union issued its own statement saying the level of “inhumanity and cruelty” in this raid and others like them sends shockwaves through society.“The outrageous events of the past week do make one thing clear, when people in every corner of New York see the real, human impact of Ice’s cruelty and Trump’s mass deportation machine, they mobilize, speak out and fight back,” the NYCLU’s senior education strategist, Margaret Tso said.She added: “At the rally on Saturday in Sackets Harbor, I saw dozens of teachers, families, organizers, and residents from all over marching together, chanting the same thing: ‘Bring this family back home to our community where they belong.’ Families shouldn’t be torn apart, kids shouldn’t be ripped out of class, and people shouldn’t be transported thousands of miles from their home.

We give Israel $4bn a year. That’s a lot.”Trump denied reports that he was considering a 90-day pause on his tariff rollout. “We’re not looking at that,” he told reporters. “We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals.”Trump says US ‘having direct talks’ with Iran over nuclear dealRead moreTrump also announced that the US and Iran were beginning talks on Tehran’s nuclear program. “We’re having direct talks with Iran, and they’ve started. It’ll go on Saturday. We have a very big meeting, and we’ll see what can happen,” he told reporters. He warned Tehran would be “in great danger” if the talks collapse.Netanyahu expressed a cautious support for US-Iran talks but insisted Tehran must not have nuclear weapons. “If it can be done diplomatically … I think that would be a good thing,” he said. “But whatever happens, we must make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons.”The comments came in the Oval Office after Trump and Netanyahu held private talks. The White House canceled a joint press conference that was scheduled to take place afterward, without offering an immediate explanation.Netanyahu, announcing the last-minute meeting on Sunday, said he was visiting at the invitation of Trump to speak about efforts to release Israeli hostages from Gaza, as well as new US tariffs.The meeting came after theTrump administrationannounced his trade war last Wednesday with tariffs on the US’s trading partners, including a 17% tariff on Israeli goods.The US is Israel’s closest ally and largest single trading partner. Israel had hoped to avoid the new tariffs by moving to cancel its remaining tariffs on US imports a day before Trump’s announcement.Before his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu met with the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. He also met with the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the US trade representative Jamieson Greer on Sunday night in Washington. The Israeli government described the latter meeting as “warm, friendly and productive”.During Netanyahu’s last visit in February, Trumpshocked the worldby proposing to take over the Gaza Strip, removing more than 2 million Palestinians and redeveloping the occupied territory asa “Riviera of the Middle East”, in effect endorsing the ethnic cleansing of the people of Gaza.Palestinian American teen shot dead by Israeli settler, officials sayRead moreSince then, Israel has resumed its bombardment in Gaza,collapsing nearly two months of ceasefirewith Hamas that had been brokered by the US, Egypt and Qatar.Nearly 1,400 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed Israeli operations in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, taking the total death toll since the start of the war to more than 50,000. Israel has also halted all supplies of food, fuel and humanitarian aid into Gaza.Netanyahu’s visit to the US comes as he faces pressure at home to return to ceasefire negotiations and secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza.Netanyahu told reporters on Monday that he and Trump had discussed the US leader’s “bold” vision to move Palestinians from Gaza, and that he is working with the US on another deal to secure the release of additional hostages. “We’re working now on another deal, that we hope will succeed,” he said.Netanyahu also claimed that Israel is committed to “enabling the people of Gaza to freely make a choice to go wherever they want”. Last week, he said Israel was“seizing territory”and intended to “divide up” the Gaza Strip by building a new security corridor, inflaming fears that Israel intends to take permanent control of the strip when the war ends.Netanyahu arrived in Washington on Sunday night from Hungary, after a four-day official visit that marked the Israeli leader’s first visit to European soil since the international criminal court (ICC)issued an arrest warrantfor him over allegations of war crimes in Gaza.Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán,made it clearhe would defy the court to host Netanyahu, and announced that he would take Hungary out of the ICC because it had become “political”. The US is not a member of the court.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelIsrael-Gaza warUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’ll go on Saturday. We have a very big meeting, and we’ll see what can happen,” he told reporters.“And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious. And the obvious is not something that I want to be involved with, or, frankly, that Israel wants to be involved with, if they can avoid it.“So we’re going to see if we can avoid it. But it’s getting to be very dangerous territory. And hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran’s best interests if they are successful.”He gave no details of where the talks would take place or which officials would be involved. When questioned by journalists, Trump issued a thinly veiled threat if the talks failed, saying Iran would be in “great danger”.“I think if the talks aren’t successful with Iran … Iran is going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it – because they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” he said.“It’s not a complicated formula. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Right now we have countries that have nuclear power that shouldn’t have it. But I’m sure we’ll be able to negotiate out of that too as part of this later on down the line.“And if the talks aren’t successful I actually think it will be a very bad day for Iran.”During his presidency, Trump pulled out of a deal signed by Barack Obama known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. That deal offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for limitations on its uranium enrichment activities – resorting instead to a policy of “maximum pressure” that tightened economic embargoes.Critics say Iran nevertheless accelerated its nuclear program and is now closer to building a bomb than ever before. Attempts by Joe Biden at reviving the deal negotiated by Obama faltered.Netanyahu, who views Iran as an existential threat to Israel, actively undermined Obama’s agreement and has long railed against any deal that would allow the country’s theocratic rulers to maintain a program that could converted to nuclear weaponry.Iran, for its part, has consistently denied any intent to build a bomb and said its program is meant for purely civilian purposes.Iran and the US have had no direct diplomatic relations since 1980, when ties were severed after revolutionaries stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 53 diplomats hostage for 444 days.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyIranDonald TrumpIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

It was briefly reversed amid hopes of a reprieve, only for Trump to threaten China with more steep tariffs, intensifying pressure on the market.On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 dropped by as much as 4.1% – entering bear market territory after falling more than 20% from its most recent peak, in February – before launching an extraordinary reversal to turn positive.S&PWhile markets were fleetingly boosted after Kevin Hassett, director of the White House national economic council, signaled that Trump was open to considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries but China, the relief did not last long.After hours of turbulent trading, the S&P closed down 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 0.9%.America’s Brexit? Trump’s historic gamble on tariffs has been decades in the makingRead more“We’re not looking at that,” Trump told reporters, when asked about the prospect of a pause. Pressed on whether the tariffs set the stage for negotiations with countries, or were permanent, he replied: “Well, it can both be true. There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations.”The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% in London at 7,702.08 – the lowest close in more than a year - after the Nikkei 225 slumped 7.8% in Tokyo. Other major European also ended the day sharply lower, including Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC which both fell more than 4%.Trump, who has previously used market rallies as a barometer of his success, tried to brush off the sell-off this weekend. “I don’t want anything to go down,”the US president said on Sunday. “But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”1:05Donald Trump shrugs off tariff turmoil as ‘medicine’ – videoHe stood firm on Monday. “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid!”As China prepares to retaliate, Trump threatened to further increase US tariffs on the country – an additional rate of 50% – if it hits back. All talks with Beijing over potential meetings have been “terminated”, he said.Trump tariffs risk higher prices and make US recession more likely, says JP Morgan bossRead moreMajor share indices have fallen dramatically since he unveiled his controversial plan to overhaul the US economy last week. TheTrump administrationimposed a blanket 10% tariff on imported goods this weekend, and is set to follow with higher tariffs on products from specific nations from Wednesday.While senior figures in corporate America have been reluctant to criticize Trump since his inauguration in January, a handful have started to sound the alarm in recent days.Larry Fink, CEO of the investment giant BlackRock, expressed concern on Monday over the threat of a downturn. “The economy is weakening as we speak,” he said at the Economic Club of New York, according to Bloomberg. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now.”The JPMorgan Chase boss,Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, warned that Trump’s tariff plan was “likely” to exacerbate inflation. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.Dimon added: “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.”The billionaire fund managerBill Ackman, who backed Trump’s campaign for the presidency, has also demanded the administration reconsider its plan. “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Markets chartEven Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, currently leading the so-called “department of government efficiency” inside the government, appeared to break with the administration on the issue. Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade adviser, “ain’t built shit”, Musk wrote on X, which he owns, this weekend.Navarro, for his part, insisted in a television interview on Monday morning that the stock market would find a bottom. Less than hour later, when New York opened for trading, the search continued.The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite started the day down 4.3%, before switching in and out of the red. It ended the day broadly flat, up by 0.1%. The VIX “fear index” of volatility rose as high as 60 for the first time since August.Oil prices also came under pressure, with Brent and WTI benchmarks stooping to their lowest levels in four years, as growing economic tensions between Washington and Beijing stoked fears that a global downturn would challenge demand.SirRichard Branson, co-founder of Virgin Group, argued the “predictable and preventable” market chaos would have “catastrophic” implications for people in the US and around the world, and claimed companies were already going bankrupt as a result of the weaker dollar and higher costs.“This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course,” Branson wrote on X. “Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpInternational tradeTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In response, Beijing announced a34% tariff on US imports.Volatility grips global stock markets as Trump insists on tariff ‘medicine’Read moreIn astatementon Truth Social on Monday morning, the US president said that China enacted the retaliatory tariffs despite his “warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs” would be “immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set”.“IfChinadoes not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote.“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!” he added. “Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.”China’s US embassy said on Monday it would not cave to pressure or threats over the additional 50% tariffs. “We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Liu Pengyu, an embassy spokesman, told Agence France-Presse.A senior White House official toldABC Newsthat the increased tariffs on China would be on top of the 34% reciprocal tariff Trump announced last week and the 20% already in place.Trump’s new ultimatum to China markedthe latest escalation from the White House and came asUS stocks swung in and out of the red on Monday morning as a report circulated that Trump was going to pause the implementation of his sweeping tariffs for 90 days, but then was quickly dismissed by the White House as “fake news”.Not long after Trump threatened China with additional tariffs on Monday morning, he participated in aWhite House visit from the Los Angeles Dodgersto celebrate their World Series title.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationChinaUS foreign policyGlobal economyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

As Trump andElon Muskcarry out their anti-union agenda in Washington DC, Utah passed a law that prohibits collective bargaining by public sector workers, and a Michigan company refused to move forward with a union election.“If history is any indicator on this – and I think it is – when you see a president’s administration basically declaring war on unions, that’s going to certainly embolden private sector employers,” said Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University and author of the definitive book about the disastrous 1981 strike by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (Patco).Organizers accuse Trump of trying to silence federal workers with union orderRead moreLabor experts point to several Trump administration actions that show a huge hostility toward unions, including Trump’s order to end collective bargaining by 50,000 airport screeners and thena far-reaching orderto rip up union contracts and prohibit bargaining for over a million federal employees at more than a dozen agencies, including the state department, the treasury and health and human services. Trump and Musk have also fired tens of thousands of federal workers while disregarding protections in their union contracts. Moreover, Trump firedGwynne Wilcox, who was the National Labor Relations Board’s (NLRB) acting chair. Wilcox insists her dismissal was illegal, but on 28 March a federal appeals courtdeclined to reinstate her, at least for now.“What we’re seeing is Patco on steroids,” Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said in an interview. “This is the president saying even the idea of having a union contract and having something in black and white to protect workers and having collective bargaining – he’s saying none of this should exist.”Trump’s anti-union and anti-worker actions have been piling up. Herescinded the $17.75-an-hour minimum wagethat federal contractors must pay their workers. He issued an order tokill the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, which seeks to settle potentially disastrous labor disputes. He nominated a management-side lawyer, Crystal Carey, to be the NLRB’s general counsel; her law firm represents anti-union employers, including Amazon, SpaceX and Tesla. Even the Teamsters’ president, Sean O’Brien, who has sought good relations with Trump,condemned that appointment, saying: “Carey has spent her entire professional career backing Big Business to the detriment of working people … [S]he wants to decimate labor unions.” (O’Briendid praiseTrump’s choice of labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer.)Beyond that, Trump has repeatedly insulted the nation’s 2 million federal workers, saying: “Many of them don’t work at all. Many of them never showed up to work.”Eric Blanc, a labor studies professor at Rutgers University, said these actions have “demonstrated that Trump’s rhetoric about being pro-worker and pro-union was just that: pure rhetoric. This is an administration that is pushing the limits on how far you can go to destroy the labor movement and people’s labor standards.”A bargaining breakdown and strikes: the ongoing union fight at StarbucksRead moreBlanc said Trump’s replacing of the pro-unionJoe Bidenas president, has “certainly emboldened the big corporations that were already stonewalling their unions: Starbucks, Amazon, REI, where we saw the most emblematic union successes of the past few years”.In February, Utah’s governor signed a law thatprohibits unions representingteachers, firefighters, police officers and other government employees from bargaining for better pay and working conditions. In a move directly inspired by Trump’s actions, a Michigan amusement and water parkrefused to move forwardwith a union election, believing that the NLRB was paralyzed after Wilcox was fired, leaving it without a quorum.“Companies could definitely get more anti-union because Trump and Musk are setting the example,” said Thomas Kochan, a longtime professor of industrial relations at MIT. “They’re firing workers who are unionized. They’re ignoring their labor contracts.”Kochan said he fears the consequences for unions if the supreme court upholds the firing of federal workers despite their contract protections or upholds Trump’s dismissal of Wilcox, leaving the NLRB without a quorum. “Then I think we will see companies come out of the woodwork to be more anti-union because there’s so little risk,” Kochan said. “We’ll see companies like SpaceX and Tesla just ignore the law because there will be no consequences. That’s the big risk now.”In his high-profile role, taking a figurative chainsaw to federal agencies and firing tens of thousands of workers, the fiercely anti-union Musk could inspire corporate executives to follow in his anti-union footsteps. SpaceX is even seeking to have the NLRBdeclared unconstitutional. “Musk is sort of the praetorian guard of the anti-union movement,” McCartin said. “He’s the tip of the spear.”But Blanc said corporate executives might hesitate about following Musk. “He is extremely unpopular, and his policies are not popular,” Blanc said. “Corporate America is not blind to that, and they’ll think twice about unleashing a backlash like the one Musk has unleashed.”Labor experts said it could take a few years before many companies become visibly more hostile toward unions. That was the case after the Patco strike. It was not until two or three years after that strike that several prominent employers –International Paper, Greyhound and Phelps Dodge – showed a harder attitude toward unions. They broke their unions’ strikes by hiring large numbers of replacement workers – an unusual move at the time.Trump vowed to champion US workers - the reality has been a relentless assaultRead moreThat tougher behavior under former president Ronald Reagan sped the decline of private sector unions. Today, just 6% of private sector workers are in unions, while32% of public sector workersare. Anti-union ideologues are increasingly targeting public sector unions, which often support Democrats.“Because almost half of the labor movement is now in the public sector, the assault that we’re seeing now is really focused on the public sector,” McCartin said. “That really threatens to break the spine of the labor movement.”The flight attendants’ Nelson said it’s imperative for the labor movement to stand up and stand together to resist Trump’s and Musk’s anti-union actions: “It’s on all of us to use the power we have to stop this before everything is broken and every safety net is stolen by the oligarchs,” including Musk. Nelson said the labor movement has very few options at this point except to mobilize for a general strike.This article was amended on 7 April 2025 to clarify the timing of an order to rip up union contracts and an appeals court declining to reinstate Gwynne Wilcox.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS unionsDonald TrumpUS politicsElon MuskJoe BidenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But sales are fallingAmy Hawkinsin HaikouSun 6 Apr 2025 23.00 EDTShareMany cities across southernChinaare known for the art of relaxing. Chengdu in Sichuan province is the tea house capital. Guangzhou is the birthplace of dim sum, a time to share steamed dumplings and chew the fat with friends. And in Haikou, the capital of Hainan province, people have been chewing the betel nut for centuries.You don’t have to walk far in Haikou to find a vendor. The small, hard, green fruits are sold in little piles alongside fresh coconuts and bottled water at pretty much any convenience store, for about five yuan (£0.52) a piece. Some vendors, mostly women, sit by the side of the road to dish out betel nuts to passing drivers on mopeds, nearly all of them men.Betel nuts, the fruit of the areca palm, are popular across Asia, particularly in India, which produces about half of the world’s crop. Excessive consumption is linked to oral cancer and tooth decay, but they also produce a natural high, thanks to the presence of arecoline, a natural (and carcinogenic) stimulant in the nuts. Like other legal highs, they are enduringly popular. A Chinese folk song written in the 1930s, still sung on state television today, tells the story of a young couple who fall in love on a mountain while picking betel nuts from the tree.Haikou mapAbout 95% of China’s betel nuts are produced in Hainan, a tropical island that is China’s southernmost province. The warm, humid climate is well suited to growing areca palm trees. More than 2.3 million people are involved in the betel nut industry, according to state media, accounting for more than one-fifth of the island’s population. By some estimates, the planting, growing and selling of the fruit accounts for 8% of Hainan’s total GDP. Between 2010 and 2021, the size of the land used for betel nut farming in Hainan more than doubled.Far away from Hainan, there have been efforts to crack down on betel nuts in the name of public health. Since 2020, it has been illegal to sell them as a food product. In 2022, a singer called Fu Song died of oral cancer at the age of 36. Before his death he said on social media that his illness was caused by his betel nut habit, and urged others to stay away. Some cities have urged shops not to sell the nuts to children. In Xiamen, 750 miles away along China’s southern coast, betel nuts are banned. Some media reportscall it“the fruit of the devil”.The message hasn’t got to Haikou. Reports of negative health effects are “just rumours”, says a woman surnamed Fu, who has been selling betel nuts for more than 30 years. “It’s a fruit, there’s nothing harmful to the body,” she says. “It’s actually good for your teeth.”But in the sluggish post-pandemic economy, business is starting to slow, even by sleepy Haikou’s standards.A few shops down from Fu, a woman whose surname is Wang also sells betel nuts. Like Fu, she’s heard nothing of the restrictions elsewhere in China. But she is ambivalent about the industry’s future. “These past two years have been really bad economically. Honestly, it’s been tough,” she says.View image in fullscreenBetel nuts for sale in Haikou, Hainan province. In Xiamen, 750 miles away, betel nuts are banned.Photograph: Amy Hawkins/The Guardian“In the past, we might sell 10 to 20 catty [5-10kg] per day, but now we’re lucky if we sell five. The volume went down not because people no longer like betel nuts, it’s more about not having enough money to buy betel nuts and have proper meals at the same time. So consumption has gone down quite a bit compared to a few years ago.”But while business is slow, the number of people trying to get into the trade is increasing, Wang says, in part because there are so few jobs in other industries.Youth unemployment has beenstubbornly highsince the pandemic. In February, the unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds in China’s cities reached 16.9%, a two-year high. The overall urban unemployment rate was 5.4%, also a two-year high.Many young people, including graduates, have responded to the turndown by returning to their home towns and taking on menial work or “lying flat”.That has created competition for middle-aged sellers such as Wang and Fu. “In the past, people who sold betel nuts were mostly older, in their 50s or 60s,” Wang said. “But now, a lot of young people in their 20s or 30s are selling. It’s because there’s not much work.”Nationwide, the betel nut industry is expected to keep growing, in part because improved technology is increasing yields on industrial farms. But a market research report published in March by China Research Network, a corporate intelligence firm, predicts that the price of betel nut will be pushed down by increased competition among sellers, meaning that big, industrialised producers may survive at the expense of street-side vendors. China Research Network also predicts that the health warning about betel nut may finally start to catch on this year.Wang’s shop sells drinks and other snacks, but she thinks the betel nut business may finally decline. “There are almost no customers. No one has money. They need to save money for food first before buying betel nuts.”Additional research byJason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaHealthAsia PacificCancerFarmingFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Scotland and Wales set different taxes on house purchases.From 1 April, first-time buyers in England and Northern Ireland have topay tax on homes worth more than £300,000, down from £425,000, and the threshold for a reduced rate for first-time buyers will drop from £625,000 to £500,000.The zero-tax stamp duty threshold that applies to all housing in England and Northern Ireland has dropped from £250,000 to £125,000.“Our customers completed more house sales in March than in January and February combined, including the busiest single day on record. Following this burst of activity, house prices, which remain near record highs, unsurprisingly fell back last month,” Bryden said.Economists and industry analystsexpect house prices to continue to riseduring 2025, as supply remains constrained and demand stays relatively stable, despiteconcerns over the UK economy’s momentumfrom the Bank of England.Sales are expected to be helped by falling mortgage rates, and markets have priced in that there could be three more cuts of 0.25 percentage points in the base interest rate.“Hopefully this month on month dip is only temporary,” said Nathan Emerson, the chief executive of Propertymark. “The spring and summer months normally spur on a flurry in housing activity, especially at a time when there are many competitive mortgage deals out there right now as a result of the reduction in interest rates last year.”Mortgage rates have slightly dipped compared with last week, according to the latest market analysis by Moneyfacts.The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.32%, down from 5.33% on Friday. The average five-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.17%, a slight improvement on the 5.18% rate on Friday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But still he said no.“Because,” he reasoned, “anything can happen here.” And that, you couldn’t help wondering, may be precisely the problem. One day,anythingwould not happen, and then what?Valencia end years of misery at Real Madrid to extend Corberán’s revival | Sid LoweRead moreThe pity for Arsenal may be that Madrid found that out three days later, tangible warning arrivingin time for their visit to London. It’s one thing to say it, another to actually experience it, to be faced with your own flaws, your own vulnerabilities when you felt invincible.No one has made the ridiculous as routine as have Madrid, the implausible happening so often it feels inevitable. Destiny, fate, fortune … whatever you call it, whichever theory you favour or conspiracy you subscribe to in explaining the endless comebacks, there was a certain logic there, too: they have the players, the talent. Everyone knows that; so do they, which may not always help, willing them on to take risks, to play the odds, which one day become too great even for them.On Saturday afternoon, Valencia went 1-0 up at the Santiago Bernabéu. Four minutes into the second half Vinícius Júnior equalised and, although it lacked the drama or noise of a European night, Madrid began to tighten the screw. The minutes went by, the final whistle coming closer, which only made the comeback feel more inevitable, until in the 95 minute the winner arrived. Only this timeit came at the other endand may have cost Madrid the title, Hugo Duro’s header leaving them four points behind Barcelona with eight games to go.This was Madrid’s fifth league defeat. Ancelotti was entitled to say that it was not the same as the others. Vinícius missed a penalty, although that is a problem in itself when they have missed five of 16 this season. Giorgi Mamardashvili, the Valencia goalkeeper, made six saves, one from Fede Valverde especially impressive. Kylian Mbappé did everything but score, including hitting a post. The xG was 3.16‑0.46. Valencia had three efforts on target and two went in. “Teams score against us with not very much,” Ancelotti complained. In seven days Madrid had conceded eight at the Bernabéu, against Leganés, Real Sociedad and Valencia.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé, pictured at the Emirates Stadium, did everything but score against Valencia.Photograph: Vince Mignott/EPAThe good news for Madrid is that of the four defenders and goalkeeper who started against Real Sociedad, conceding four, only one will likely be there against Arsenal; the same is true of the five that began against Valencia, although Ferland Mendy’s absence creates doubts at left-back and Aurélien Tchouameni, entrusted with protecting that defence when he doesn’t play in it, is suspended. The bad news is that this goes deeper – in their two games against Barcelona, they have conceded nine – and there was little sympathy.If perhaps they hadn’t deserved defeat on Saturday, they had those other times. Keep tossing a coin, it won’t always come up heads. Madrid had played with fire that often, one day they were going to get burned; eventually they would run out of time. In the cup, they had needed extra time to defeat Celta Vigo and a last-minute goal from a youth-teamer, Gonzalo García, making his debut to knock out Leganés before the comeback against Real Sociedad.In the Champions League, they had defeated Atlético Madrid on penaltiesin surreal circumstances. They finished the league phase 11th: outplayed and deservedly beaten by Liverpool and Milan, they had been 2-0 down at half-time against Dortmund, scored two second-half goals to edge Atalanta and beat Stuttgart despite being second best.At the Bernabéu it had all started to wear a bit thin, too: the epic comebacks that excite everyone, that make matches all the more memorable, also revealed flaws, a lack of care. However fun it is, it shouldn’t always be this way. The fact that it felt almost willing, as if they needed to feel the jeopardy before they started playing, made it worse; even during the comeback against Real Sociedad, there were whistles, a growing irritation that it had to be this way, a kind of: “Oh, sonowyou run?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That night, Ancelotti had pulled Vinícius aside and threatened to take him off. Asked about it he didn’t deny it; instead he said, yes, and then the Brazilian started running. In extra time, Vinícius was extraordinary; for most of the 90 minutes he hadn’t been.Get Real: serial Champions League winners Madrid face fresh threat | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThat Madrid’s problems, despite Ancelotti’s insistence to the contrary, can feel like an attitude thing invites the assumption that they are easily resolved: theChampions Leagueis different. On Saturday, for many supporters, there was almost a weird satisfaction in the players finally getting whattheydeserved, lesson delivered in time.How easily it can be applied is another matter. At what point can you no longer just flick that switch? Beneath that surface analysis, beyond the injuries and the fatigue which are undeniably there, beyond the lack of someone who can run the midfield, there’s also something systemic and even more simple: Madrid really haven’t been very good this season, and still less of late. Try to think of a genuinely impressive performance and onlythe Manchester City tiecomes to mind. But then that’s Manchester City.“Now the season starts for real,” Ancelotti said that night. It hasn’t really, and yet Madrid are still there, time still on their side, the treble still possible, as they set off to London. If they do lose there, well, there’s always the old Bernabéu comeback routine to repeat.Explore more on these topicsReal MadridChampions LeagueArsenalEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I just don’t particularly like them, so I won’t introduce them,” he said to awkward laughter.Article on Jackie Robinson’s military career restored to defense department websiteRead moreTeams who have won a major championship have traditionally been invited to the White House to celebrate their victory with the president. However, during Trump’s first term several teams were not invited or made it clear they would not attend if they were. Those teams included theNBA’s Golden State Warriors, and the United States women’s national teamafter their victoryat the 2019 Women’s World Cup.The Dodgers’ All-Star shortstop, Mookie Betts, chose not to visit the White House when he was a member of the Boston Red Sox’ championship-winning team during Trump’s first term. He was in attendance on Monday but said it was not an easy decision. “Being Black in America in a situation like this, it’s a tough spot to be in,” he said last week.He said he chose to attend this year so as not to disrupt the team. “No matter what I choose, somebody is going to be pissed. This is not about me. This is not about politics,” he said. “This is about the Dodgers and my loyalty to these boys in the clubhouse.”The Dodgers visited Joe Biden’s White House after their World Series victory in 2020. On that occasion, pitcher Blake Treinen sat out the visit. He said he was more excited this time around. “I’m pumped. The greatest president of my lifetime,” Treinen said of meeting Trump. “Excited to meet him, shake his hand, thank him for what he is doing.”The Dodgers’ visit has attracted the ire among some section of the club’s fanbase. In March, an article detailing the military career of the team’s greatest player, Jackie Robinson, was restored to the Department of Defense’s websiteafter initially being deletedamid a purge of material considered to be related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).While Trump’s first term in office led to a number of athletes, such as LeBron James and Megan Rapinoe, criticizing the president,there has been little pushbackfrom the sports world so far in his second term. In February, Trump became the first sitting US president to attend the Super Bowl, andhis presence was welcomed by several players, including the Kansas City Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce.This article was amended on 7 April 2025. An earlier version saidDonald Trumphad directed remarks at Democratic senators Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla.

Caddie shed to 1st tee; he had done it hundreds of times over 14 years as a bag man at the Masters. Jackson’s connection to Augusta National stretched even beyond his major debut of 1961. He was a caddie at the venue from the age of 14, breaching employment law even as existed in 1950s Georgia but savvy enough to make a mark. Jackson was quickly accepted.This time, Jackson had no cause to give advice over a choice of club. He had no competitor anxiety to calm. Thursday 10 April 1975. Fore please, now driving: Lee Elder. Jackson made sure he formed part of the gallery. A Masters colour split – caddies black, players white – was about to end.Jordan Spieth: ‘I feel more comfortable at the Open and the Masters’Read more“I was nervous for Lee Elder,” Jackson recalls. “It was an earth shattering day for golf. Augusta had a lot of members and not all of them approved of this. The caddies knew those who had expressed in some way that they were not into agreeing with this. I was out there, gathered around the tee like a lot of other people, because I wanted to see the expression on some of the members’ faces.“That was a breakthrough for Augusta, for the Masters, for the golf world. He made it there on his own. We put a lot of weight in him and in his talent.” And the reaction? “In my mind and what I read was far more positive than negative,” Jackson says. “Lee had a very pleasant personality. He always seemed to have a smile on his face. Those who caddied for him would only say good things. I never heard anything negative about Lee.”Elder was an extraordinary person in many ways. He had lost both his parents by the age of 10. Competitive golf instinct kicked in during road trips with Titanic Thompson, an infamous Texan hustler. Elder was to become a pioneer, hugged by Tiger Woods at the point of Masters victory in 1997.There is plenty to ponder in Augusta over the coming week. Will Rory McIlroy reach his Holy Grail? Can Scottie Scheffler maintain freakish tournament form? Golf’s civil war – the establishment versus LIV –rumbles on in the background. The extent of damage caused by Hurricane Helene to an iconic venue will inevitably draw comment. Angel Cabrera is back, for the first time since a period in prison for domestic violence. It would be wholly unfortunate, though, if golf does not properly pause to reflect upon Elder. Fifty years, a marquee anniversary; never before had a black golfer teed up in the Masters. It feels storied that the Masters will again get underway on 10 April.Elder missed the cut in 1975 – he did considerably better upon return – but that barely mattered. Augusta could have denied him an invitation, just as they did Pete Brown and Charlie Sifford after the winning ofPGA Tourevents. Yet this venue – openly prejudiced in so much of what it did before and after Elder’s appearance – decided to break its own mould. Five decades on for what benefit? “I have to answer this carefully but I think it [golf] could do more to bring in blacks and encourage blacks,” Jackson says. “And not just blacks. We are all Americans. Somehow we are separated by people who want to see us divided as a country.”View image in fullscreenLee Elder is transported around in a golf cart at Augusta National.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveJackson believes he was the first black man to play Augusta National as the guest of a member, that only transpiring in the 1980s. “It was better than a lot of places in the United States,” Jackson says of Augusta in the 1970s. “We didn’t have to go through as much as many other cities where there was marching and fighting. We didn’t have that so much in Augusta. The city needed improvement – it needs improvement today – but it was OK for the time.”Elder was made an honorary starter for the Masters of 2021. It would be unfair to dismiss this as tokenism but it was undoubtedly belated. He died seven months later. He had reflected on a “great privilege” and it undoubtedly was. It was an honour that should have been bestowed much earlier. Augusta National created scholarships in 2020 at Paine College, a renowned black institute for higher learning, in Elder’s name. Elder received accommodation via Paine in 1975.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We were walking out to the tee, and he said to me, ‘Lee, I know this is going to be a hard day for you but I just want you to know that if I get in your way, just shout at me.’” Tensions eased.The 1975 Masters is regarded as one of the finest majors of all time. Jack Nicklaus nudged aside Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller to claim the Green Jacket. Billy Casper, Tom Watson and Lee Trevino all featured on an all-American closing leaderboard. While the Masters is unquestionably now a more international event, Jackson is correct to question whether golf has sufficiently broadened its horizons. Elder, one of 10 children, had started out as a caddie. That route into the sport is far less common now.Jackson’s own remarkable tale is chronicled in a new documentary, Rise Above. He will be back at Augusta National early this week. He accesses the grounds courtesy of tickets from “Mr Crenshaw.”They have an anniversary of their own this time; 30 years have passed since Crenshaw’s second Augusta triumph. That the Masters did not extend a complimentary ticket to Jackson made news in 2023. For the 2025 staging, nothing has changed. “They don’t want me to have credentials,” Jackson says. “For someone that worked there for 54 Masters and they don’t want you to have credentials … it is mind-boggling.” It is indeed. In this of all years.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersPGA TourGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But she went and got one anywayAlex KirshnerMon 7 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.22 EDTShareThe fact that Paige Bueckers wasn’t already considered the undisputed gold standard of 21st-century women’s college basketball says more about her competition than it does about her.Bueckers’ resume is extraordinary: a No 1 overall recruit who joined Connecticut in 2020, immediately averaged 20 points per game and became National Player of the Year as a true freshman, and went on to earn first-team All-American honors three times. She is a household name and will soon be the No 1 pick in theWNBADraft. She has struck endorsement deals that are estimated to have earned her more than $1m this season alone.A few things encroached on Bueckers’ rise to superstardom, though. For one, Bueckers got hurt – a lot. She missed much of her sophomore season due to injury, then a torn ACL cost her the entire 2022-23 campaign, disrupting what had looked like an inevitable rise. For another,Caitlin Clark came along, scoring more points than any Division I hooper in history and making herself the face of women’s basketball. Clark arrived at Iowa the same year Bueckers got to UConn, but she stayed healthy and became the player who loomed over all others. And for a third, the program that Bueckers joined continued to sputter in the NCAA Tournament. Geno Auriemma’s war machine had last won a national title in 2016. Bueckers’s teams had reached three Final Fours before this year but couldn’t emerge on top.Why hasn’t middle America given Paige Bueckers the Caitlin Clark treatment?Read moreUntil Sunday, when the Huskies returned to the top with a vengeance. Facing a South Carolina program that had supplanted UConn at the top of the sport, the Huskies thrashed the Gamecocks in the national championship game.The final score was 82-59, and the action on the floor was somehow even more lopsided than that 23-point winning margin suggests. South Carolina looked despondent as UConn ran up the score in the second half, nothing like the world-beating juggernaut they have been the past several years.As fate would have it, Bueckers was not even that good on Sunday. This has become her program, but on the day, she was an inefficient 5-of-14 from the field for 17 points, with six rebounds and three assists. The women who carried the Huskies were guard Azzi Fudd and forward Sarah Strong, who scored 24 points each. Strong had 15 rebounds and was a total bully in the paint against a South Carolina program unused to being so physically outmatched around the basket.UConn won the title game because of their depth and a collection of star talent. But conversation about Bueckers and her place in the sport was reaching a fever pitch in the hours before tipoff. Did Bueckersneeda national title to go down as a college great? Who would even make that judgment? What would it mean for her legacy if UConn failed to get the job done? These are not especially useful questions to help someone process Bueckers’ tremendous career, but they are inevitable ones, just as they were when Clark was trying, unsuccessfully, to push a lower-level Iowa program to a title last year.Bueckers has not played ball with the topic, nor has she had much interest in comparing herself to UConn’s all-time greats under Auriemma: Breanna Stewart (who has the best resume of anyone), Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, or anyone else. “Legacy” has not been her concern, at least not in public.“I don’t think that’s up to me,” she said before the title game. “I think that’s up to the people who, I guess, get to decide if people’s legacies are cemented or whatever. But I’m not worried about that at all.”Dawn Staley, as good an authority as any with two titles in the prior three years, made her view clear. “She’s a great player, but just because you’re a great player doesn’t mean you need to win the national championship to legitimize it,” the Gamecocks’ coach told reporters pregame. “Paige is legit. Her career is legendary. She will leave a legacy at UConn whether she wins one or not.”Staley also made the case that by making the title game about Bueckers’ quest for a title, the media were ignoring her own players’ achievements. South Carolina are the sport’s pre-eminent program now but have not had an individual star reach Bueckers’ level of mainstream fame. Even the legendary Aliyah Boston, of Staley’s 2022 team, did not reach that perch.“We can raise Paige up because she deserves that and raise our players up because they deserve that,” Staley said. “And that’s not talked about enough. There’s room for it in our game for all of us to be covered.”Staley is right. It doesn’t serve college basketball to spend so much brainspace on the unknowable legacy implications of one game on one player.But hoping for discussion of Bueckers thatdoesn’tcenter around her long hunt for a title – in a sports media driven by debate shows – feels a bit like asking for fire to stop being hot. Championships are what athletes play for, after all, and to suggest that failing to win one doesn’t affect a legacy is to argue that racking up titles doesn’t, either. Fortunately, Bueckers has now sidestepped that contradiction.Explore more on these topicsNCAA TournamentWNBACollege basketballCollege sportsBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eddie Howe’s side jumped to fifth in the Premier League to intensify their push for the Champions League after dismantling a sorry Leicester City, a club with a decision to make.Newcastle’s business was in effect complete after 34 minutes, courtesy of two goals by Jacob Murphy and one from Harvey Barnes. For Leicester, it is now a record eight home defeats in a row without scoring and 15 losses in their past 16 matches. Such damning statistics do not bode well for Ruud van Nistelrooy.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreAfterwards the noises from Van Nistelrooy were ominous. Asked whether he had the fight to continue, the Dutchman said: “It’s important to analyse this and sleep on it and recover.” Asked if he was committed to the job for the season, he replied: “The most important thing is the club and these players, that’s what I would say for now.” He repeated his previous answer when pushed whether he would carry on.As Newcastle’s supporters sang of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Leicester fans faced up to the reality of trips to Preston and Portsmouth. “Say hello to Sunderland,” came the call. They have known for a while. Judging by the swathes of empty seats, many locals voted with their feet. Others have long since checked out. Leicester could be relegated as early as Easter Sunday. Until the second half fizzled out, it felt plausible that Newcastle could chalk up their biggest win, eclipsing an8-0 victory over Sheffield Unitedat Bramall Lane 18 months ago.It has been a fine few weeks for Howe and Newcastle, backing up their first major trophy in 70 years with successive league victories. “It was a big question mark: how do we react to the big high that we had?” Howe said. “The players have responded magnificently. It is a real tick in the box for our psychology.”The Newcastle manager said another reset is required, with three games in six days from Sunday, the first at home to Manchester United. “We need to keep that fine balance between confidence and needing to improve, because there are areas that haven’t been perfect. We need to look to continue to grow.”Undoubtedly the most enjoyable moment from a Leicester perspective was the arrival of the sought-after 15-year-old Jeremy Monga, who juggles school with first-team training. The youngster, wearing the No 93, entered for his debut in the 74th minute wearing a shirt without a sponsor owing to Leicester’s partnership with BC Game, a betting company. The other highlight was the opportunity to relive better days by singing Barnes’s name after he made it game, set and match.Leicester’s “Foxes never quit” motto was again under the microscope early on. Last Wednesday it wasJack Grealish after 70 secondsand this time Leicester’s defence held out a bit longer, with Murphy scoring his first goal with 115 seconds played. Jamie Vardy had prompted Nick Pope into action inside 11 seconds but from there it was a matter of how many Newcastle would finish up with.View image in fullscreenLeicester’s demoralised players head back to the centre circle.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesNewcastle mauled Leicester in midfield. The visitors profited to score their first; Bruno Guimarães was too strong for Wilfred Ndidi, Joelinton kept Boubakary Soumaré at arm’s length and Barnes spied Tino Livramento on the overlap. Livramento sent the ball towards the back post and Murphy side-footed in. For the 26th time in 31 league matches, Leicester had conceded the first goal.Leicester were so brittle it seemed Newcastle could score with every attack. The second goal, on 11 minutes, stemmed from Fabian Schär cracking the crossbar with a shot from inside his own half. Schär’s effort cannoned towards Murphy, who could afford a rusty first touch. The ball bobbled off his left knee but he soon found the net. “[It] only took me about seven touches to get it under and stick it in,” Murphy said. He could afford to smile.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Leicester? Not so much. “You’re not fit to wear the shirt,” came the chant from the increasingly apathetic home support. Bilal El Khannouss tested Pope from a tight angle after a rare attack but Newcastle responded by adding a third. Barnes started and finished the move, dribbling across the pitch with conviction. Joelinton took over the baton and then chopped inside Wout Faes before forcing Mads Hermansen into a save. Barnes was alive in the box to dispatch the rebound.Leicester adopted damage-limitation mode at the Etihad Stadium but here Van Nistelrooy’s half-time changes at least appeared positive, with Facundo Buonanotte and Stephy Mavididi introduced. Newcastle grew a little lax – as if they had privately declared – but Leicester could not punish them. Faes flashed a header wide in stoppage time but it was another unhappy ending.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeicester CityNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

His life was saved when he tried to shoot himself but the gun did not go off.“I was already hearing it from fans,” Duran says in the series, which premieres in the US on Tuesday. “And what they said to me, [it was like], ‘I’ve told myself 10 times worse in the mirror.’ That was a really tough time for me. I didn’t even want to be here anymore.Blue Jays reportedly sign Vladimir Guerrero Jr to $500m, 14-year contractRead more“... I got to a point where I was sitting in my room, I had my rifle and I had a bullet and I pulled the trigger and the gun clicked, but nothing happened. So, to this day, I think God just didn’t let me take my own life because I seriously don’t know why it didn’t go off. I took it as a sign of, ‘I might have to be here for a reason’, so that’s when I started to look myself in the mirror after the gun didn’t go off. I was like, ‘Do I want to be here or do I not want to be here?’ That happened for a reason and obviously, you’re here for a reason so let’s be the way you want to be and play [the way] you want to play and live the way you want to live.”Red Sox CEO Sam Kennedy praised Duran’s honesty. “Jarren’s decision to share his story is an act of courage that reaches far beyond baseball,” Kennedy said in a statement. “By opening up, he’s showing others who may be struggling that they’re not alone and that asking for help isn’t just OK, it’s essential.”Duran said he now journals to maintain his mental health and writes reminders to help himself focus.“On [the tape on] my left wrist, I write, ‘Fuck ‘em,’ because it’s me telling my demons, ‘You’re not going to faze me’,” Duran says in the docuseries. “And on my right wrist, I write, ‘Still alive’ because I’m still here and I’m still fighting.”Duran had the best season of his career in 2024 and was named an All-Star for the first time, recording career highs in home runs (21), runs (111), RBI (75) and stolen bases (34). He was also suspended two games forshouting a homophobicslur at a fan who heckled him. Duran later apologized for using what he called “a truly horrific word” and issued an apology to the LGBTQ community.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

How I see tomorrow is that we really want to kind of get revenge on ourselves. We want to show that we are better than we were then and we can do a lot better.“The crowd are loud in Belgium.

The case has been adjourned.Evanilson doubles up as Bournemouth rescue draw against West HamRead moreOwing to the lawyers’ other commitments, it is understood the hearing will not resume until June, leaving Paquetá in limbo. The Brazilian withdrew from World Cup qualifiers against Argentina and Colombia last month so he could take part in the hearing but has made himself available for West Ham and played all of their Premier League games againstWolvesandBournemouthlast week.West Ham are backing Paquetá and are unhappy with the FA’s handling of the most high-profile corruption case in English football since Bruce Grobbelaar was acquitted of conspiring to fix five Premier League games in a criminal trial 27 years ago. The club had asked the FA to put back Paquetá’s hearing until the summer to avoid disrupting their season.West Ham sources have expressed frustration that Paquetá has experienced the worst of both worlds, with a hearing that began on 17 March not concluding until the summer. There could be a further delay if Paquetá is found guilty and a separate hearing is required to determine the punishment.The case could overshadow another summer transfer window for West Ham. Manchester City hadagreed to pay £80m for Paquetá in August 2023but pulled out after it emerged the FA was investigating suspicious betting patterns surrounding four bookings he had received in the preceding nine months.Paquetá was charged with four counts of spot-fixing and two of obstructing an FA investigation in May 2024 after allegations that he was deliberately booked in Premier League games to earn money for family and friends in Brazil. He strongly denied wrongdoing.“I am extremely surprised and upset that the FA has decided to charge me,” he said. “For nine months I have cooperated with every step of their investigation and provided all the information I can. I deny the charges in their entirety and will fight with every breath to clear my name”The FA has alleged that Paquetá “directly sought to influence … matches by intentionally seeking to receive a card from the referee, for the improper purpose of affecting the betting market in order for one or more persons to profit from betting”. The charge sheet is understood to include the recommendation of a life ban if he is found guilty.The FA and West Ham declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsFootballThe FAWest Ham UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

As it happened, the players he did pick were in total control until Everton were awarded the kind of weird penalty that will have done little to deter the conspiracy theories of some Arsenal fans who are convinced English officials have an agenda against their club. At least they can go into Tuesday’s match safe in the knowledge that it is being refereed by a more accomplished and less gaffe-prone foreign referee. Specifically, one who prompted outrage by inexplicably ruling out what appeared to be a perfectly good goal scored by RB Leipzigagainst –oh dear!– Real Madrid in last season’s Big Cup.While few people seem to be giving Arsenal a snowball’s chance in hell against reigning champions fabled for having the survival instincts of cockroaches in a nuclear winter when it comes to staying alive in Bigger Cup, Gunners fans have grounds for optimism. Real Madrid lost at home on Saturday and have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their past eight games, a run in which they have conceded 13 goals. And then there’s the bad news: Kylian Mbappé, Vinícius Junior, Dani Ceballos and Antonio Rüdiger have all been cleared to play, despite fervent Arsenal prayers they might have to sit out the game alongside Aurelién Tchouaméni on an overcrowded Naughty Step following their unseemly celebrations after the shootout win over Atlético. Instead, three of the four players were hit with fines, while Viní Jr was acquitted of the heinous offence of “violating basic rules of decent conduct” when it came to goading fans of their city rivals.Having successfully negotiated the Round of Arsenalwith a 9-3 aggregate thrashingof PSV, Arteta’s side are likely to find goals more difficult to come by against Real Madrid. Mind you, they do enjoy a 100% success rate in European knockout ties against the 15-times Big/Bigger Cup winners. In 2006, Arsène Wenger’s side eliminated Madrid courtesy of Thierry Henry’s second-leg strike as Arsenal progressed to a final they would ultimately lose against Barcelona due in no small part to an early rush of blood to Jens Lehmann’s famously hot head. They will almost certainly need to score more than a solitary goal across 180 minutes to maintain their imperious record over Madrid, not least because the prospect of Mbappé, Vinícius Junior and Rodrygo bearing down on a makeshift defence featuring a ring-rusty Jakub Kiwior at full speed is enough to give even the most fearsome giant green furry dinosaur night terrors.Taking on mascot duties of his own, Mikel Arteta implored fans to get to the Emirates sharpish in order to create a special atmosphere – or at the very least, an atmosphere. “I encourage them to come very early to the warm-up and create those nights that we haven’t lived many of at the Emirates,”he roared, as battalions of fans made plans to get to the ground in time to cheer. “We’re going to put in all the ingredients, everything that is in our hands, to play the game we want and take the game in the direction that we want.” Here’s hoping that whatever direction the game ends up going in, those on the journey end up enjoying the big-match experience as much asthe hapless American touristwho got on the wrong boat and spent Saturday attending a Southend game by mistake.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Michael Butler from 8pm (BST) for updates on Leicester City 0-1 Newcastle.QUOTE OF THE DAYSunday 6 April:“If we take the long road to come back here, I am ready” – a defiant Ivan Juric says he is already thinking about plotting a way back to the Premier League for Southampton after their relegation with a record seven games left to play.Monday 7 April:“Ivan came to Southampton at a tough time and was tasked with trying to improve a squad in a difficult situation.

What barometer can we use to measure the significance of this mid-table clash? Close observers of Pep Guardiola will know that during the top, top clashes, such as El Clásico, Der Klassiker and City v Liverpool, absolutely every time he’s on camera, Pep is hocking phlegm on to the touchline. It’s as if the mere possibility of a goal causes his juices to flow. For 90 minutes at Old Trafford he did not produce any spittle. Not even the tiniest dribble. All he offered was a half-hearted, resigned flob in injury time. This is all we need to know that the Guardiola-era has finally run dry and this former hotbed of salivating football is now unable to produce even the slightest bubble of moisture in the spittle glands of the Spaniard” – Jimmy O’Brien.During the United-City snooze-a-thon, the camera panned to a stoic Eric Cantona watching the match from a secluded location. Even with the grey beard, flat cap, and oversized granddad sunglasses, Cantona looked like he still could do a job as a playmaker without too much effort. Same with the grizzled, haggard, and looming presences of Peter Schmeichel, Roy Keane, etc. glaring at the field. I know, I know that the 90s’ version of United wouldn’t last for a full match against the current generation. But are we sure that they couldn’t get to half-time with a 0-0 scoreline if we had a semi-serious friendly between the sides? Are we?” – Mike Wilner.Seeing the weed-addled old Wembley stadium looking like a location from some sort of post-apocalyptic zombie film/TV series (Friday’s Memory Lane, full email edition) was disconcerting.

Unfortunately, we haven’t seen performances progress the way we had hoped, but we would like to thank Ivan and his staff for their honesty and hard work as they fought against the odds to try and keep us up.”Southampton said Simon Rusk, who was in interim charge between Martin’s sacking and Juric’s first game, a Boxing Day defeat by West Ham, would take charge for the rest of the season. Adam Lallana, the 36-year-old who has made five league starts since returning to the club last summer, will assist him.Juric had talked up Johannes Spors, who came in as technical director in February as a replacement for Jason Wilcox, but the pair have swiftly parted ways. Sheffield Wednesday’s Danny Röhl, who knows Spors from RB Leipzig, though they pair did not work together directly, is thought to be a leading candidate to take over as manager and Liam Rosenior is also believed to have support after his impressive work at Strasbourg in Ligue 1.Southampton have picked up only four points in Juric’s 14 Premier League games, giving him the lowest points-per-game average of any manager to take charge of at least 10 games in the competition. The Croat was sacked by Roma in November after 12 games.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I decided to board anyways because I figured if they checked tickets they would just turn me around … But they didn’t check tickets, so I slipped on the boat undetected.”Andy Ward, one of the Southend supporters on board, told the Echo: “Someone on the boat told me a young lad was on the wrong boat and I just wanted to make sure he was OK. When I found him he was drinking and dancing with other Southend fans and even though you could see he was nervous everyone was just trying to make him feel welcome … He said someone gave him a match ticket but was unsure whether to go. I said to him come with us.”View image in fullscreenEvan Johnston with Southend United fans at Sutton.Photograph: Andy WardThe boat docked at Blackfriars Pier and the fans, their number swelled by one, caught a train to Sutton, where Johnston had an authentic taste of a football supporter’s life.

TheMatildashave been without a full-time coach for eight months since Tony Gustavsson’s official departure on August 1 after the Paris Olympics.In their 11th game under caretaker Tom Sermanni, Australia defeated South Korea 2-0 at Newcastle’s McDonald Jones Stadium to claim their first back-to-back wins of the year.Mary Fowler on target as Matildas secure back-to-back wins over South KoreaRead moreThe South Korea friendlies are hoped to be the last under Sermanni, with FA having flagged a coach will be in place by mid-year and their May/June friendlies against Argentina in Melbourne and Canberra.Sermanni himself is unsure whether this will be the case, with pressure mounting on FA given the ever-shortening runway to the looming 2026 Asian Cup to be hosted by Australia.Expressing relief at claiming a clean sweep of their two-match series with South Korea, Catley admitted the rebuild has been difficult without a permanent coach.“We are at very early stages of a rebuild and that happens every cycle when you’re leading into major tournaments and we’ve got a year to build – well, less than a year now, but that’s what it’s about,” Catley said.“It’s hard as a playing group when you’re in limbo a little bit. You haven’t got clear direction in how we’re going to play moving forward. Tommy’s done a great job coming in. He creates an amazing culture for the girls, a real positive energy.“You can’t fault him and how he’s gone about it, but it is difficult when you’re trying to build towards something specific and it’s been a while since we’ve sort of had that. The girls have been doing the absolute best that they can and we’ve been sticking together and galvanising as a group. That’ll be important for us going forward.”Lyon coach Joe Montemurro had emerged as a front runner for the vacant Matildas post.

The Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, said having the23-year-old backfor what he described as the biggest game of his coaching career was a massive boost as his team attempt to overcome the reigning champions.Get Real: serial Champions League winners Madrid face fresh threat | Jonathan WilsonRead moreSaka, having missed only four of 135 Premier League matches since early May 2021 before his injury, admitted the time on the sidelines had benefited him. “I think mentally it was really good for me,” he said.“It was really tough initially to find out the extent of my injury, that I was going to have to have surgery … But once it was done and it was successful, I was just focused on coming back stronger and had a lot of time.“Obviously the past five years I’ve been playing game after game, so it was the first proper break I’ve had and it was really good for me. I got to do a lot of things that I don’t really normally do. I can give you many, many examples, but you will get bored. It’s really nice to be back and I feel fresh mentally for sure.”Arsenal have not faced Madrid sincebeating them in the last 16 in 2006when a patched-up side with Mathieu Flamini deputising at left‑back won 1-0 in the Santiago Bernabéu courtesy of a goal from Thierry Henry. With Gabriel Magalhães out for the season, Jakub Kiwior may continue in central defence unless Arteta prefers the fit-again Ben White or Jurriën Timber.Saka, who insisted he was “pretty relaxed” about signing a new contract with his deal expiring in 2027, revealed he regularly speaks to Henry for advice and is hoping thisArsenalside are capable of following in that one’s footsteps.Asked whether he had let himself dream about emulating Henry, he said: “Yes, of course. His moment was his moment. Obviously, here we want to write our own story, but something like that would be nice. I want to win and I want to win wearing this badge.“So I think it’s pretty clear. The fans know how much I love them. You saw when I came on Tuesday [against Fulham], I think they love me back. So it’s a good relationship and I’m really happy to be here and I’m just focused on winning.”View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka started as a substitute for Arsenal in the 1-1 draw at Everton.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockArteta was also keen to stress that this is an opportunity for his side to make a big statement, having lost at this stage of the competition to Bayern Munich last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Building those experiences is something necessary. That’s why I said that we have to build our own story. Because as you said, there is a massive gap there for so many years when nothing has happened in this football club in relation to European competitions. And we need to change that. And we need to change that quickly.”Arsenal look likely to finish as runners-up in the Premier League for the third year in succession having experienced a number of injuries to key players this season. Arteta is hoping it is about time their luck changed and urged his players to seize their moment on the biggest club stage and get to the final like Arsène Wenger’s side did in 2006.“It’s an inspiration for sure because that generation, what they achieved is what we want to achieve, certainly,” he said. “It’s very different – 20 years is a long time in football, very different context. But the history is there. Unfortunately, it’s too far to be very relative to the situation that we are in. But there are things to take from there and be inspired, for sure.“We’re going to put all the ingredients, everything that is in our hands, to play the game that we want and to take the game in the direction that we want.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalBukayo SakaReal MadridChampions LeagueEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

A poor defensive performance saw Madrid concede their 10th goal from a corner this season, although Carlo Ancelotti will welcome back Courtois and David Alaba from injury against Mikel Arteta’s side.Arsenal have gained a reputation across Europe after scoring 30 times from set pieces since the start of last season and the former Chelsea goalkeeper is aware he must be ready for the challenge.Saka mentally refreshed and ready to write ‘own story’ for Arsenal against MadridRead more“We’ve worked on it,” said Courtois. “We know how we have to try to defend against them. The first thing is not to concede too many corners. It’s a matter of concentration, activation – sometimes the quality of the opponent plays a factor too. If the ball arrives perfectly, it’s difficult to defend. But we are ready to do it, we believe that what we have prepared will work out well for us.”Mikel Merino’s goalagainst Chelsealast month was Arsenal’s 11th of the season from a corner but their first since mid-January. They will also be without Gabriel Magalhães – who has scored 14 of his 16 goals for the club from corners – against Madrid.“In knockout stages, set pieces usually account for 33% of the goals scored,” said Arteta. “It will be crucial for us, of course, but also for them; they scored against Valencia from a set piece.”Despite his long list of honours as a manager over a 30-year career that include a record five Champions Leagues, Ancelotti has never won back-to-back domestic league titles. His contract lasts until the end of next season but the Italian has again been linked with the vacant Brazil men’s team post after thesacking of Dorival Júniorlast month.Responding to criticism after the defeat to Valencia, Ancelotti said the decision over his future would be up to president Florentino Pérez and insisted he is determined to end the season with silverware once more.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Delap previously made two top-flight substitute appearances for the champions.City hold a £40m buy-back option for Delap but do not currently plan to use this. While the fee for the player is set to be £40m or a little more, United may face competition, with Chelsea reportedly also interested. Ipswich are 12 points from safety with seven games left so are likely to be relegated. If so, this will increase Delap’s availability.United’s other potential centre-forward targets are thought to include Napoli’s Victor Osimhen.Meanwhile, André Onana has shrugged off criticism from United fans over his slow distribution by stating he takes that approach to assist his teammates.The goalkeeper has been the subject of supporter discontent for sometimes lingering over the ball rather than executing a quick pass but he said: “It doesn’t affect me because the decision I make is to help the team. Sometimes I will make the right decision, sometimes I will make the wrong decision. When I feel my players need to rest I have to take my time; when I feel we need to speed up the game I will do it.”View image in fullscreenAndré Onana has been criticised for playing too slowly at times and admits there is extra pressure at Old Trafford.Photograph: Nigel French/Allstar Picture Library Ltd/SportsphotoOnana referenced thegoalless derby draw with Cityat Old Trafford on Sunday, pointing to how Pep Guardiola’s team dominated the ball. “Sometimes, [as] in the second half with an opponent that has a lot of control – they have more possession than us – I have to let my guys breathe. They need me to do that.”Amorim has previously stated that United players can feel pressure when playing at Old Trafford.

A game that had zigged and zagged for four days came down to the final over,Middlesexneeding two wickets for victory, three slips, two leg slips and two men in helmets breathing down George Balderson’s collar as Blake Cullen ran in. But Balderson, who had been dropped earlier in the afternoon, kept Cullen at bay. In the morning, Max Holden had held Middlesex’s second innings together with a perky 184. Michael Jones and Keaton Jennings and later Luke Wells and Marcus Harris (the firstLancashireplayer to make a century and a 50 in the Championship on debut) then made the chase of 309 in 67 overs seem easy until Zafar Gohar (three wickets), Cullen, Henry Brookes and an inswinging yorker from Toby Roland-Jones kept the result in doubt until the end.At Taunton, Brett D’Oliveira supervised a phenomenalWorcestershiredefensive display, with 121 from 340 balls. He and Matthew Waite – 87 not out from 319 balls – together with an obdurate tail, kept off theSomersetattack. Starting the day at 280 for five,Worcestershirewalked off at 485 for nine – dazed but delighted.A draw too at Chelmsford, where Dom Sibley’s 66 off 221 balls keptEssexat bay afterSurreywere forced to follow on. A couple of quick wickets mid-morning, Rory Burns and Ollie Pope for one, temporarily raised the alert level, but Ben Foakes settled in at the other end for his second hard-boiled half‑century of the match and they shook hands at 5.36pm.Josh Tongue’s first game in aNottinghamshireshirt finished with a flurry of fireworks, his spell of four wickets in 12 balls with a battered old Dukes destroying theDurhamrearguard. Tongue moved from Worcestershire to Trent Bridge at the end of the 2023 season but his 2024 season was wiped out by injury. Here he showed theNottinghamshirefaithful what they had been missing, changing the complexion of a game which had looked to be trickling to a draw.A placid pitch and two teams determined not to lose meant a high-scoring draw at Edgbaston.

The strategy was introduced by South Africa in awarmup match against New Zealandbefore the 2023 World Cup, and they have used it on a number of occasions since.Stuck paratrooper prevents play before Sale slump to Toulouse defeatRead moreThe Scotland head coach, Gregor Townsend, expressed concerns at a World Rugby “Shape of the Game” conference during the Six Nations and also stated his views afterhis side’s win against Wales. “I don’t think the bench was set up to suddenly have a new forward pack coming on,” he said. “But that’s for World Rugby to decide what you do with the bench, and to make any changes. But just now you can put eight forwards on the bench if you want.“Where do we think the game might end up? Is it going to be more a game where we need forwards in a 6-2 or 7-1? Or is it a game where we need backs because it’s going to be so open that we’ve got to make sure we’re bringing backs off the bench?”Townsend is not blessed with power forwards in the same way France or South Africa are but after Ireland’s Dublin defeat byLes Bleus, the former second-row Donncha O’Callaghan described it as a “defining day for rugby”.The World Rugby chairman, Brett Robinson, acknowledged that 7-1 splits raise questions over the spirit of the game but, having made it a priority to increase fatigue in the sport, the governing body does not see a scientific issue with teams loading their benches with forwards.World Rugby’s chief executive, Alan Gilpin, said: “We looked at it from a science, medicine perspective. Was there a distinctive view that a bunch of fresh players coming on with 20‑30 minutes to go is going to create a more injurious position, and the science said that’s not the case. So there was no reason from that perspective to look at how we might do replacements differently. Ultimately, there are a lot of different ways to win a rugby match.”The World Rugby council, meanwhile, will vote next month on whether to introduce permanently into law 20‑minute red cards. There were four such red cards shown during the Six Nations this year – to Romain Ntamack, Ross Vintcent, Giacomo Nicotera, and Garry Ringrose in the first half ofIreland’s win against Wales. He was replaced early in the second half by Bundee Aki who excelled as his side came from behind to clinch victory in Cardiff.In the final round, France’s Peato Mauvaka was shown a yellow card and allowed to return to the field after appearing to launch himself head-first at Scotland’s Ben White.He was citedand banned for three matches, raising questions as to why he was not shown a straight red card. The incident was sent for review via the bunker referral system, but the only option for upgrade at that point would have been to a 20-minute red, which is not meant to apply to deliberate acts after play has stopped, and which in any case was not applied.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve taken decision-making away from referees.”There was no little irony to the fact that Ireland and France have been the two most vocal opponents of 20‑minute red cards and both appeared to profit during the Six Nations. If the vote passes, 20‑minute red cards will be introduced to the Premiership and theWomen’s World Cupthis year.Gilpin said: “There’s a lot of evidence to support that it’s keeping the contest alive, which is obviously important to us. There are definitely those in the game who are against it and believe that 20-minute red cards mean there will not be any old‑fashioned red cards and therefore they’re against the proposal, and there are a lot of people supportive of it.”Explore more on these topicsWorld RugbyRugby unionSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Robert MacIntyre’s love for Oban, shinty and all associated is endearing. He has also proved that he is perfectly comfortable in the company of golf’s aristocracy.MacIntyre missed the module where sportspeople are advised not to speak about lifetime aspirations. Mention the Masters to the Scot and he lights up. Absence makes the heart grow fonder; after impressing at Augusta National in 2021 and 2022, he failed to qualify for the next two stagings. MacIntyre returns for the 89th edition as the 17th-ranked player in the world.“A Green Jacket,” MacIntyre says. “Imagine taking a Green Jacket back to Glencruitten … boy, it would get ripped off me I think. I am a big dreamer. I see things and believe in them. I just want a chance … I picture the 18th hole, standing on that tee and what I would do. I still don’t know what I would do. It would be nerve‑racking but that is why you build a team around you.Jordan Spieth: ‘I feel more comfortable at the Open and the Masters’Read more“That’s why I have one of the best caddies in the world to help me. I would be shaking like I have never shook before on that tee but it is your job, go and execute it. I just want to have that shot.”MacIntyre has cause to think big. The Scottish Open was a lifetime goal; one he realised bywinning in East Lothian last July. The previous month,he had become the Canadian Open championwith his father on the bag. In his own words, it was the stuff of “absolute fairytale”. Storied, magical moments seem to attach themselves to the 28‑year‑old. He is well within his rights to contemplate Masters glory. The first major of the year, after all, has a tendency to favour left-handed golfers.“It is my favourite place in the world to play in a golf tournament,” MacIntyre says. “It is where I want to be, it is something I want to win. It is not just playing in it, it is trying to win the tournament. I have played well to get there; you have to be in it to win it. I am looking forward to it, I cannot wait to be back out there competing. It is a special place, a kid’s dream.“Every time I pitch up there, it has been a dream and I try to enjoy that. When you are not at something so special, you are disappointed, but that just made me work harder. I watched almost every shot. Even if I am not playing golf I will watch it.”View image in fullscreenA young MacIntyre competing in the Jacques Léglise Trophy in Harlech, Wales, in 2013.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/R&A/Getty ImagesShinty, though, is his first love. MacIntyre played in goals for Oban Celtic during a pre-season fixture – he reckons that is marginally safer than an outfield role – and was on FaceTime with squad members immediately before his third round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He adores the sport and the environment keeps him grounded. “I go in there with a lot of young guys, a lot of my mates, and they just treat me as Bob,” he says. “If I wasn’t playing this game, I would be on the tools with my mates. Simple as that.”Scratch deeper into MacIntyre’s backstory and you will find no silver spoon. Indeed, he was absent from many of the leading amateur events that elite golfers participate in before turning professional.“I didn’t play because I couldn’t afford it,” MacIntyre says. “I played in the odd Lytham Trophy and maybe two British Amateurs but I couldn’t afford to go to others. I remember the year Bradley Neil won the British Amateur [in 2014 at Royal Portrush], I won the Sir Henry Cooper. I could have got into the British Amateur but I was going to the Henry Cooper with ScottishGolfbecause they were paying for it. I had two older sisters, mum and dad were working regular jobs, so I couldn’t fly to Ireland and spend three or four grand on a week when we were just trying to get by. It was just about finances.“I think that makes me fight harder. I am just from a regular background, I have been given an opportunity by my parents and others around me … I am determined to make the most of it. I have fought for everything. Playing shinty was the same, it was about fighting. It doesn’t need to be pretty, it can sometimes be an absolute dogfight and that’s when I do my best.”Against this backdrop, it feels even more impressive that MacIntyre has adapted so well to golf’s prime events. His home base remains Oban, not Florida. “Winning on thePGA Tourmakes you believe. I know Canada didn’t have the strongest of fields but I am still being chased down by Rory McIlroy at the end. The Scottish Open had a strong field. I am a big believer that on my day I can compete with the best of them. When you are in the top 20 in the world, that is how you have to think every week.“It is not so much performing, it is about the standards you set yourself. Since Mike [Burrow] has been on the bag, my standards of practice, preparation, eating have been raised. This is my job, man, I have to give it my absolute best.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Drones on golf courses have caused irritation. But MacIntyre is self‑deprecating. Perhaps that, and a refusal to seek publicity, is why he has not really received the sporting prominence he deserves in the UK.The Ryder Cup is understandably on his radar. He formed part of thewinning team in Romelast time. “That is exactly the same as the Masters. You taste it once and you want it for ever. I know that if I play well, I will be there. That is in my hands.”MacIntyre arrived in Georgia having undertaken a “boot camp” at Isleworth in Florida. He did likewise before the Arnold Palmer Invitational and Players Championship, where he posted high finishes. This time, green speeds and pin positions were set up to mirror what MacIntyre will encounter at Augusta.“It was a massive benefit,” MacIntyre says of the first trip. “That was the first time I have done it, as a team we decided to give it a try and I didn’t know how it was going to work. I had everyone out there with me; a proper, proper camp over four days. I pitched up at Bay Hill on the Monday and was knackered. That is when you taper off because you have prepared as hard as you can.“It worked brilliantly. You know where you are with your short game. Otherwise it would be two weeks off back in Oban, chipping on to greens that are six on the Stimpmeter. I enjoy that, it is part of my life, but to prepare to compete against the best players on the planet, that is not working.”Lofty targets, perfectly happy in his own skin and playing well. MacIntyre’s Masters chance is a live one. “I want to prove to myself and other people that I belong at the top end of golf,” he insists. “OK, where I come from and how I have gone about it might be different but there is more ways than one to skin a cat. You have got to shoot for the stars.” It feels impossible not to root for him.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersPGA TourGolfUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Star attacker Ryan Gauld has missed the last month with a knee injury. They’re still alive in the Concacaf Champions Cup quarter-finals, and Concacaf success and regular season success don’t tend to mix well forMLSteams. And yet, here they are. On top of the West. The Vancouver Whitecaps.Fresh off a dominant 2-0 win over the Colorado Rapids on Saturday, the ‘Caps are playing at an eye-catching 2.3 points per game pace, not least because new manager Jesper Sørensen has overhauled their tactical setup.Gone are the days of Vanni Sartini’s chopped-and-changed attacking setup andrisky defensive approach. Now we have Sørensen’s hyper-controlled system. With a top-five possession share (55.3%) and a balanced 4-3-3 setup, Vancouver’s attack is in the top third of MLS based on FBref’s non-penalty xG per 90 minutes metric.Fifa considering LAFC v Club América playoff to replace León at Club World CupRead moreBut their use of the ball isn’t just an attacking weapon – it’s a defensive one, too. No team in MLS has allowed fewer shots per 90 than the Whitecaps. With strong rest defense and one of the hardest-working spines in MLS, Sørensen’s team are an elite defensive outlet. That makes them miss Gauld (and his countryman Armstrong) less than you’d think.The tactics are solid in part because they’ve been effectively taught, with Vancouver far more than the sum of their parts. Players are confident in knowing where to be and when to rotate, which allows the Whitecaps to execute with ruthless efficiency on the field.“When you have the ball, you can control the game,” Sørensensaidshortly after being named the Whitecaps’ new manager. “When you don’t have the ball, you can affect the game, but you cannot control what’s going to happen. In this league, there’s a guy called Messi. You cannot control him when he has the ball, but you can try to affect him. But if you have the ball, you can … better the outcome of what’s going to happen.”The ‘Caps have bettered their outcomes over and over again in 2025, and don’t look like slowing down any time soon.JLView image in fullscreenTani Oluwaseyi scored again for Minnesota United on Sunday.Photograph: Ira L Black/Getty ImagesMinnesota strikesMinnesota United sit just a couple of points behind the Whitecaps at the top of the Western Conference, having been propelled in that direction by a pair of forwards perfectly suited to the style of head coach Eric Ramsay.It’s counterattacking, it’staking every advantage you can getand making it count, and so far it’s been very productive. Having the lowest average possession in the league doesn’t matter when your gameplan has other strands and your forward line has Kelvin Yeboah and Tani Oluwaseyi. Both strikers are in the top six for total xG this season perAmerican Soccer Analysis, and when filtered per 96 minutes (a per-game equivalent) among players who have played more than 500 minutes, they are second and third behind the Chicago Fire’s Hugo Cuypers.Most teams usually have one xG merchant – a player who regularly gets big chances in front of goal and outperforms their teammates in this regard. In MLS, Christian Benteke of DC United is a prime example (though for a bad team, more on that later); Brian White of Vancouver and Denis Bouanga of LAFC are others.What happens when you have more than one of these players in the same team, as Minnesota do? You could ask LA Galaxy, who won MLS Cup in 2024 with Dejan Joveljic, Gabriel Pec and Joseph Paintsil each benefiting from the buildup play of Riqui Puig.Having the lowest average possession in the league is almost by design in this setup, as chances on the counterattack can be more clearcut than those eked out via lengthy buildup play. Ramsay’s 5-3-2 formation is facilitating this, and the set-piece design is helping too. They have created more Opta-defined “big chances” than any other team in the league perFotMob, with 28, while Joaquin Pereyra leads the league for big chances created with six from the left of the midfield three.It’s a plan falling into place with the stats to back it up, and it so far bodes well for the Loons improving on last season’s sixth-place finish in the Western Conference.JNView image in fullscreenChristian Benteke has been DC’s main attacking outlet for some time.Photograph: Brandon Vallance/Getty ImagesChristian Benteke islandMLS began 30 seasons ago in San Jose, California, with the home side (then known as the San Jose Clash) playing DC United in front of a sold-out Spartan Stadium. Eric Wynalda saved an otherwise sloppy match with a fine goal near the end. Bruce Arena, who was then DC’s fresh-faced coach making his pro debut, once said that it “remains one of the worst games ever played in MLS.”MLS scheduled a rematch for the same day – 6 April – this year as a nod to that inaugural moment. DC United flew out many club legends from that mid-90s day, including John Harkes, Marco Etcheverry and Shawn Medved. Even Arena would still be there, but this time coaching San Jose.“We want to celebrate that by having a great performance,” DC head coach Troy Lesesne said before the game.Yeah … about that. San Jose ran out 6-1 winners, and appropriately for the occasion, Josef Martínez turned back the clock by notching his first hat-trick in six years and 259 days.The performance in front of DC’s stars of the past raises fresh questions about their star of the present, Benteke. The former Liverpool striker has been excellent in his time in MLS, scoring 43 goals in 75 appearances, including last season’s Golden Boot-winning campaign. No other player in MLS has scored more goals since the start of the 2023 season. Somehow, though, he has yet to appear in the playoffs, with DC finishing with the exact same record in both of his two full seasons in the league, and not looking all that much improved in 2025.DC’s front office and ownership share much of the blame. The club has scarcely invested in the first team roster since Benteke’s arrival, mostly seeking to hit home-runs with intra-league deals and under-the radar international signings. The end result is a one-dimensional team that is at times comically reliant on Benteke, who contests more aerial duels himself than entire teams. One of the league’s foundation teams deserves better.AAView image in fullscreenPep Biel’s passing helped Charlotte FC to a win v Nashville SC.Photograph: Steve Limentani/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesBiel ballCharlotte FC midfielder Pep Biel is in such command of his game that he is even taking into account the bounce of the Bank of America Stadium pitch. On the ball in the centre circle with just one runner ahead of him, the Spaniard played a chipped pass behind the Nashville defense that held up just enough for Idan Toklomati to take a touch round Joe Willis and finish, givingCharlotte FCa fourth straight home win.It was a similar pass tothe one Biel played against Inter Miamithat led to a red card for Oscar Ustari on Matchday 3. Andthe one that released Brandt Bronicoin on goal against San Jose on Matchday 5.This is clearly a designed play (as pointed out by Ben Wright). While so much of the preseason focus was on Wilfried Zaha being the wide difference-maker Charlotte wanted, Biel is proving himself as the number 10 they needed.Nobody in MLS is averaging more through balls per 90 minutes (0.6) than Biel, nor has anyone created more big chances (six) through seven games. Zaha is the only Charlotte player averaging more dribbles per 90 minutes while the 28-year-old Biel is leading the league alongside Luis Suárez for assists (five). In these numbers, Charlotte FC’s evolution under Dean Smith can be found.Last season, The Crown’s fifth-place finish in the East was achieved through a conference-best defense and attacking threat that was in quick transition. Charlotte still have those cornerstones, but they are now doing more to break down opponents with the ball. Much of this is due to Biel. In ‘The League of 10s,’ he is standing out.GRView image in fullscreenMessi scored his third goal of the MLS season.Photograph: Brennan Asplen/Getty ImagesNo rest for Lionel MessiStop me if you’ve heard this before – it’s a big week forInter Miami. They had their first loss of the season on Wednesday, in the first leg of the Concacaf Champions Cup quarter-final against LAFC, with the second leg to come this Wednesday. As such, there was hope that, if Messi and Miami’s other older stars were to play on Sunday night v Toronto, they wouldn’t have to do so for long against one of the East’s worst teams.No such luck. Toronto put forth their best performance of the season, and Messi had to play the full 90 along with Jordi Alba in a 1-1 draw.“Unfortunately, we didn’t get the result we wanted, which was to win and be in the best shape possible for Wednesday,” Miami head coach Javier Mascherano said afterward. “But these are players who have been playing every three days all their lives. They’re fine. They’re used to it.”Toronto’s defensive performance frustrated Miami enough that, when Messi finally scored just before half-time, he celebrated with a powerful and seemingly cathartic fist-pump. LAFC will hope he won’t have the energy for more of those in Wednesday’s second leg.AAExplore more on these topicsMLSVancouver WhitecapsInter MiamiLionel MessiCharlotte FCMinnesota UnitedUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Guerrero’s deal does not include any deferred money, the AP source said.Guerrero agreed in January to a $28.5m, one-year contract that avoided arbitration and the four-time All-Star first baseman had said he wouldn’t negotiate after he reported to spring training in mid-February. Still, talks with his agent continued well into the regular season.Torpedo bats: a destroyer of worlds or baseball’s long-awaited savior?Read moreGuerrero’s deal is the third-largest in total dollars behind Juan Soto’s $765m, 15-year contract with the New York Mets that started this season and Shohei Ohtani’s $700m, 10-year agreement with the Los Angeles Dodgers that began last year and is heavily deferred.Guerrero’s $35.71m average annual value under the new deal ranks eighth among current contracts behind the agreements of Ohtani ($70m), Soto ($51m), Philadelphia pitcher Zack Wheeler ($42m), Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge ($40m), Texas pitcher Jacob deGrom ($37m), Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell ($36.4m) and Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole ($36m).A son of Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero, the Blue Jays star turned 26 last month and would have been a free agent this fall at a relatively young age.

They also must knock down perimeter shots early to stretch Houston’s stingy defense, which is the best in the countryby anymetric. Limiting turnovers against the Cougars’ ball pressure and winning the rebounding battle to create second-chance points will be critical, same for composure in late-game possessions against Houston’s relentless physicality.Bryan Armen GrahamGet scoring and playmaking from their perimeter players and hold the Cougars to one shot on each possession.Houston had 18 offensive rebounds in Saturday’s win over Duke leading to 19 points. If Florida can force Houston into tough twos and win the rebound margin they will cut down the nets on Monday night.Nicholas LevineWhat Houston need to do to winOf the 364 teams in Division I, only fourplayed at a slower pacethan the Cougars.Houston must control the tempo, suffocate Florida’s guards with pressure and win the battle on the glass.Limiting second-chance opportunities and forcing turnovers will allow them to grind the Gators into the kind of half-court battle where they thrive. That’s how they managed to limit Duke to one (!) field goal in the final 10 minutesof Saturday night’s semi-finalto spring one of the more famous smash-and-grabs in Final Four history.BAGThey need to play to their identity: defense and toughness.The Cougars are the best defensive team in the nation, holding their opponents to 87.3 points per 100 possessions. They will have the players and a scheme to make life tough on the dynamic Florida backcourt. I expect to see a lot of ball-screen traps on Gators star Walter Clayton Jr, forcing someone else to hit shots.NLView image in fullscreenJ’Wan Roberts and the Houston Cougars sprang a comeback for the ages on Saturday night against Duke and find themselves 40 minutes from the school’s first national championship.Photograph: Jamie Schwaberow/NCAA Photos/Getty ImagesKey player for FloridaWalter Clayton Jr.The 6ft 3in combo guard has become the Gators’ offensive and emotional heartbeat, drawingstraight-faced comparisons to Steph Curryafter consecutive 30-point outbursts against Texas Tech in the Elite Eight and Auburn on Saturday. His shot creation, poise under pressure and fearlessness in the clutch will all be tested against a lengthy Houston backcourt that will be zeroed in on stopping him.BAGWalter Clayton Jrhas been an elite shot-maker, particularly in the last two games. The last player to record back-to-back 30-point games in both the Elite Elite and Final Four was Larry Bird for Indiana State in 1979. The Gators need the former high school football star – heturned down offers from Georgia and Notre Dameto play basketball at tiny Iona University in upstate New York before transferring – to continue his hot streak.NLKey player for HoustonJ’Wan Roberts.The 6ft 8in forward anchors Houston’s elite defense with toughness, versatility and experience. A former redshirt turned vital starter, he brings physicality in the paint, switches effectively on the perimeter and crashes the boards relentlessly. Against Florida, his ability to defend without fouling and chip in offensively will be vital to Houston’s title hopes.BAGLJ Cryerplayed all 40 minutes in Saturday’s win over Duke. The Baylor transfer kept the Cougars within striking distance all night with timely threes, finishing with six of them. Points in the paint against Florida are going to be tough to come by, so the Cougars will need a similar performance from Cryer on the perimeter in order to open the offense up for his teammates.NLView image in fullscreenFlorida’s Walter Clayton Jr, right, who has already broken Joakim Noah’s school record for points in a single NCAA Tournament, has shown an ability to take over games that is drawing comparisons to Stephen Curry.Photograph: Brynn Anderson/APOne bold predictionAlex Condon will be the X-factor.The 6ft 11in freshman from Perth is regularly overshadowed by the Gators’ bigger names, but his size, mobility and sneaky-good instincts could see him be a difference-maker against Houston’s physical frontcourt. Look for him to provide tough rebounding, smart defensive switches and a few timely putbacks or hustle plays that will quietly swing momentum Florida’s way.BAGWhoever wins the battle on the boards will win the game.These two teams are among the top eight in the country for offensive rebounding, each recovering around 36% of their misses. With open looks likely to be scarce, second-chance points will be crucial to the outcome.NLWhich of these teams is most likely to be here next year?Houston.Kelvin Sampson’s program is built for sustained March success behind an established identity of defense and toughness. Even with their looming departures, the Cougars reload better than most and have reached the second weekend in six of the last six tournaments. The collective buy-in to Sampson’s culture has been consistent, their style is built to frustrate and it’s wrought a proven formula from year to year. The Coogs should be penciled into next year’s Final Four conversation before the nets even come down.BAGIn the transfer portal era, where rosters change drastically from year to year, predicting future outcomes can be tough. Florida coach Todd Golden is highly analytical and data-driven, and will focus on building a roster that will win the possession battle (turnover and rebounding margin) and be efficient on both ends. Sampson, on the other hand, has built his culture around toughness and defense, a formula that has led to sustained success. Final answer:Houston.NLView image in fullscreenFlorida’s Alex Condon, a 20-year-old from Australia, could be a difference-maker in Monday night’s NCAA title game against Florida at the Alamodome.Photograph: Alex Slitz/Getty ImagesOne player I would have like to have seen in the finalOlivier Rioux, Florida.The7ft 9in freshmanis taking a redshirt year to improve his conditioning and stamina, so he’s not on the official roster. But theGuinness-certifiedworld’s tallest teenager is here with the Gators in San Antonio to soak up the Final Four experience and has drawn more attention than some of his uniformed teammates at open practices. Rioux’s profile only grew after Florida’s win over Texas Tech in last weekend’s West regional final, when he didn’t require a ladder to cut down a piece of the net.BAGNo ladder necessary for 7’9” Olivier Rioux 🚫🪜He had no problems cutting the net for the@GatorsMBK😭(via@SECNetwork)pic.twitter.com/kaq5MGhRH9— NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB)March 16, 2025Cooper Flagg, Duke.That heartbreaking loss on Saturday will rob us of seeing Flagg, thesurefire No 1 pick in June’s NBA draft, in one last college basketball game. The 18-year-old is so fun to watch not only because of the spectacular plays he makes, but also all of the little ways that he impacts winning. And he comes across as a kid who loved being part of a connected team like the Blue Devils were.NLWhat does this year’s tournament say about the state of the transfer portal?The portal has reshaped college basketball into a year-to-year proposition.Consider that right now a traditional blue-blood like Indiana doesn’thave a single player on their roster! Teams like Florida have ridden key transfers deep into March, showing how impactful experienced newcomers can be. The line between rebuilding and contending has never been more razor-thin. Coaches have been forced adapt fast and rosters are no longer built in four years, but in four months.BAGTwo years ago, when the Final Fourfeatured a No 9 seed, two No 5 seeds and a No 4 seed, the thinking was the transfer portal was creating more parity than ever. Now after four No 1 seeds made it to the final weekend for only the second time ever, the narrative has shifted: the “big boys”, who scoop up proven players looking to move up or get paid more, are supposedly the only ones who can be successful. But Duke showed that you can still win with young players, while Auburn’s roster of (very) old and experienced guys helped them to the best season in school history. Meanwhile Kansas, the preseason No 1, didn’t make it past the first round, prompting Bill Self to reassess his recruiting approach in the portal. Bottom line:the team that finds the right players who complement each other and fit the coach’s vision will ultimately prevail.NLThe final score will be ...Florida 78-74 Houston.In a delicious clash of styles, the Gators’ shot-making wins out. Clayton comes through with another lore-building offensive performance and Florida survive Houston’s late defensive surge with clutch free throws and a huge blocked shot in the final minute. It’s the Southeastern Conference tournament champions’ perimeter skill and tempo that ultimately outlasts Houston’s grit and grind in an Alamadome thriller.BAGFlorida 71-63 Houston.The Gators, who were picked sixth in the SEC’s preseason poll and 21st in the country, have exceeded expectations all season. Florida will force Houston into difficult two-point field goals, an area where the Cougars already struggle with a low shooting percentage. With both teams protecting the ball well and limiting turnovers, the field goal and rebounding percentages will favor the Gators. The hot hand Clayton will draw two defenders, allowing Florida to thrive with advantage basketball. In the end the Gators will cut down the nets for the first time since their back-to-back titles under Billy Donovan in 2006 and 2007.NLExplore more on these topicsNCAA Tournament 2025NCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2018, the Brazilian film-maker chanced upon an old 16mm reel of what looked like a typical homemade travelogue. Nagata’s film begins with the first 19 minutes of this already edited footage, in which there are glimpses of exotic safari animals, traditional African dance ceremonies and lavish banquets. Under the dissonant notes of an added background score, however, the smiling images turn queasy. Soon, Nagata would discover that this visual relic holds the spectre of apartheidSouth Africa.Her excursion into the past plays out almost in real time. Using a split-screen composition, she places scenes from the old reel side by side with her web browser. Like a gleaner, she looks for visual clues – a park sign, a portrait on a wall – which she then feeds into a search engine. In addition to the home movie’s location, the city of Durban, she is also able to identify a couple of faces. Among them is former South African minister Hendrik Verwoerd,infamous as the “architect of apartheid”.What is most compelling about Private Footage is the convergence of old and new technologies, where archival images, vlogs, and even YouTube ads freely intermingle. For anyone already familiar with South African history, however, watching someone basically get a crash course on apartheid grows repetitive and tiresome. Nagata’s preoccupation with identifying minute details from the footage also ends up limiting her own film’s scope. It shows little interest in widening the focus of the central quest to take in non-visual resources or external sociopolitical contexts, resulting in an intriguing experiment in montage that is short on intellectual heft.Private Footage is on True Story from 11 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsSouth AfricaSearch enginesAfricaInternetPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But can we really track our way into happiness?Samantha FloreaniSelf-tracking is regularly promoted as a way toward self-improvement. But life is not a mathematical problem waiting to be solvedSun 6 Apr 2025 20.03 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 02.31 EDTShareInspired by a curiosity to factcheck my own feelings, I’ve been tracking my mood: Far too often a bad day can feel like a permanent state rather than a passing experience. As it turns out, observing the little coloured emojis on my mood chart, one bad day does not, in fact, mean I am doomed to live a blue crying-face life forever. Thank goodness.Otherstrack themselves in different ways: monitoring daily step counts, tracking sleep cycles and bodily functions, counting calories, logging meals and so on. Digital technologies, wearable devices and an array of platforms make this easier than ever. Many people set reading targets and log books read on Goodreads or films watched on Letterboxd. Some track daily outfits online with the goal of perfecting personal style. Self-tracking is regularly promoted as a way toward self-improvement.This kind of data-driven self-surveillance can be interesting, useful, and empowering even, for some. Wired writers who created a project calledthe Quantified Selfsuggest this comes from a desire to know oneself better. But it’s also kind of weird, right? To approach life as thoughit’s a mathematical problem to be solvedwith just a bit more data. It veers too closely to the ideology of a tech bro (yikes). Indeed, the former CEO of Google wrote in his book: “with enough data and the ability to crunch it, virtually any challenge facing humanity today can be solved.” Well, there’s more data around than ever before and challenges are still abound.We live in a society saturated in surveillance and rampant data extraction. It is now well understood that all of us are subject to a process of ‘datafication’, that various parts of life are routinely transformed into data, ready to be guzzled up and commodified by corporations. Are we adopting the business model of big tech by inflicting the same paradigm upon ourselves? We are already monitored in so many ways; by offering up even more intimate data, we play directly into the hands of companies that benefit from it the most.Sleepmaxxing: from red light to mouth taping and nasal dilators, do any of the viral trends work? | AntiviralRead moreThe decision to subject yourself to monitoring for personal benefit is closely aligned with the concept ofluxury surveillance: Some people pay to track themselves while others are forced to endure it. A person on parole may have surveillance imposed upon them by way of an ankle bracelet, while others fork out hundreds to wear the latest smartwatch. Similarly, some may closely monitor their health out of necessity. The difference is in the power and privilege to make the choice for yourself.Then there’s the disciplining nature of the thing. I recall in the midst of the pandemic, I drew up a kind of adult star-chart on a whiteboard. Each day I’d tick off tasks such as: get dressed; exercise; read; and so on. Basic habits to make myself feel like a functioning human in the midst of chaos. There can be some satisfaction in seeing the chart fill up with stars, and I did feel better consistently doing the things I know are good for me. It also felt as if I turned into my own boss attempting to control and performance-manage myself into being a productivity machine.More extreme versions of this are tools designed to break down the day into small, discrete slots of time to be allocated to various jobs: planners that chunk time into as little as 15 minute segments, or software designed to optimise your calendar. This strikes me as reflexive Taylorism – the theory of “scientific management” created by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th century – only instead of a boss doing it to us, we do it to ourselves. The idea is based on the notion that breaking down actions into minutely-timed segments and measuring efficiency can increase productivity. If you want to control something, the logic goes, the first step is to measure it.We may be able to track our way to some form of self-optimisation. But should we even want to? I’m not particularly interested in assisting the process of flattening myself into an array of data points, to serve the interests of tech companies by making myself even more machine-readable. I’m not convinced that the best way to understand oneself is through quantification. Of course tracking parts of your life isn’t necessarily wrong or bad, but it seems worthwhile to question the urge to constantly seek to optimise, and to resist internalising the tech industry maxim that more data is always better. Perhaps this is trite – overly romantic – but a big, messy, joyous life isn’t going to be found in a database.Samantha Floreani is a digital rights activist and writer based in Melbourne/NaarmExplore more on these topicsHealthOpinionWearable technologyFitnesscommentShareReuse this content"

Does 10% capture it? Or 12%, which was roughly the S&P 500 index’s three-day decline by the time the London market closed on Monday? Or 15%? How about 20%? More? A lot more?Duringthree straight days of heavy falls in the share prices everywhere, a striking feature has been the absence of wise old market heads popping up to argue that the panic is perhaps a little overdone and fair value is emerging. Instead, the collective mood is stuck in bewildered mode for understandable reasons.Bill Ackman urges Trump to pause ‘economic nuclear war on every country’Read moreFirst, Donald Trump shows no sign of softening his language, which would be the first step towards softening his policy on tariffs. Rather,his weekend comments– “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something” – were intransigent. Unlike others in the US administration, he didn’t choose to emphasise that the tariffs are the opening shot in a negotiation. He simply said the nasty-tasting stuff must be swallowed.It remains hard to believe he won’t change tone if the damage to American’s 401(k) savings plans becomes substantially more severe, but one cannot be certain. For the time being, and despite the blizzard of research reports being produced by City and Wall Street analysts, the market has zero insight into whether the average US tariff rate on imports will stand at 24%-ish, which is what a full dose of Trump’s medicine would mean, or whether the practical level will be meaningfully lower.Second, corporate America, a constituency even Trump can’t ignore entirely, hasn’t found its voice. Bill Ackman opined that Trump’s action could lead to an “economic nuclear winter”, and he may be correct. But he’s a hedge fund billionaire and one doubts he has cut through outside Wall Street. It would be a different matter if famous bosses of Apple or Nike were warning US consumers in stark terms that they would pay more for their iPhones and trainers, especially if they added that they won’t be reshoring many jobs because it still doesn’t make competitive sense to make the products in the US. But we’ve heard no plain speaking in that style.Jamie Dimon, the chair and chief executive of JP Morgan, has argued that the tariffswill “likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession”, but it was measured stuff. For the most part, US bosses look terrified of being labelled unpatriotic.Third, investors’ usual source of solace during market crises is the thought that the US Federal Reserve will save the day by cutting interest rates. On this occasion, the Fed is constrained if the first effect of tariffs is higher US inflation. Slower economic growth, which could justify cheaper money, only arrives over months. The Fed surely has to wait for evidence.Fourth, share prices were probably too high in the first place. At the start of this year, the US stock market was priced at roughly 23 times expected earnings, a rich valuation by traditional yardsticks thanks to hype around artificial intelligence and a naive faith that Trump’s rhetoric on tariffs was nine-tenths for show. So stock market investors are grappling with two valuation problems: first, the possibility of lower earnings if companies have to absorb some of the inflation by taking a hit in their profit margins; second, the worry that the base position was already too high. Amid the drama, note, the S&P 500 is still only about 4% below its level 12 months ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Quite. The fact the policy has been justified on the basis ofabsurdly simplistic calculationsmakes it even more damaging.Investors are clearly also primed to react to anything that sounds like a softer stance from the White House – witness the brief rally on Monday on rumours (quickly denied) that a 90-day pause was on the cards. But, until something substantive arrives, the market is trading on guesswork. Another week of Trump intransigence could make the sell-off uglier yet.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsNils Pratley on financeTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationJamie DimoncommentShareReuse this content"

If only. More like a quarter-witted, human tsunami. Keir Starmer andRachel Reevesmay still be unwilling to mention He Who Cannot Be Named. But this is no natural disaster. It’s one entirely created by the lunatic in the White House.World stock markets down by another 4% on Monday. A war zone. The chart looks like someone has been shot while holding the tracker. Buckle up for the next Great Depression, where the only winners are the traders betting on markets going still lower and the vultures trying to buy up bankrupt businesses. The one bright side? The UK is no longer top of the charts for the single most stupid decision made by a G7 country in the last 80 years. Drinks all round.Spare a thought for Keir. The man can’t buy a break at the moment. He’d never really had much of a plan other than to get Labour elected, and in the past eight months things have gone from bad to worse. He wants us all to feel good about NHS waiting lists and the minimum wage, but the reality is everyone feels more broke and less secure. Almost all of which – national insurance increases aside – has little to do with him.Right now, Starmer and the rest of the world are being played by The Donald and there is almost nothing he or they can do about it. To make himself feel better – more powerful – he pretends that his strategy of fawning to Trump has paid dividends. But there is no evidence to support this. In all likelihood we would be on a 10% tariff even if we had a trade deal with the US. That’s the way the Sunbed King rolls. Right now,the penguins of Heard Islandhave about as much clout as Keir.But a prime minister can’t be seen to be doing nothing. He has to remain upbeat. He can’t stand before the TV cameras and tell the country: “You know what? We’re in deep shit and I can’t see a way forward unless the tariffs are reversed.” He has to believe in some master plan. That a new industrial strategy can be plucked out of thin air, one that might mitigate Agent Orange. That some new global realignment can stave off a recession. He’s allowed to dream.So Keir and Rachel headed off to the Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands to try to sprinkle a little stardust on the economy. To generate some confidence that they themselves don’t feel. That no one does. That’s the problem. No one thought The Donald would actually do anything quite that dumb. Make his own country and the rest of the world substantially poorer.And Trump only did it because he could. There was no great economic rationale behind it. Just some fag-packet theory dreamed up by someone who didn’t even exist. Imagine. And now the Donald is in too deep. Way over his head. And he can’t back down because that would mean admitting he had made a mistake. So we all get to suffer. Not just mad, but dim. Threatening a further 50% tariff increase on China. Where does he think Americans buy their TVs from?Reeves got to go first. A speech so shouty that it hinted at panic. As if the only way she could get herself to believe it was if she yelled. Not that there was a lot to understand. Jaguar Land Rover was brilliant. People were worried. The global landscape had changed. Still no mention of He Who Cannot Be Named. Yet again, the impression being given that this was just some minor natural correction. Something that had been expected. We must change. She had no idea how.Over to Starmer. I’m not sure who wrote this speech. It can only have been a corrupted beta version of ChatGPT. No human could come up with this level of mindlessness. Keir was meant to be cheering up the JLR workforce. By the time he finished 10 minutes later, most would have been reaching for the Valium to fend off the PTSD. Convinced there was no point in going on.“These are challenging times,” Starmer began. “But we will back you.” How? By rising to the challenge. It was all vague platitudes. Sentences that made sense taken on their own, but collapsed into emptiness once heard consecutively. Semantic entropy. He had everyone’s back and was going to seize the possibilities. Once he had discovered what those possibilities were. He would get back to you on that.The future was in our hands. Just blatantly untrue. Whatever plan we came up with, the EU or the penguins could just as easily be derailed by the next Bonfire of the Insanities from the White House. But don’t mention the trade war. Pretend everything can be fixed. That we’re not in too deep. That the pain is temporary.More words. It takes a lot to make Reeves sound like a convincing orator, but Keir nailed it. Talking of the cars coming off the production line, he said we were watching British brilliance in the flesh. Er … they are metal. Soon we were playing Starmer bingo. Dad was a toolmaker. Then a list of some minor measures on easing minor targets for car emissions that were already being planned before the tariffs. Hooray! These were going to neutralise the 25% levy. Take that, Donald. It was like watching someone sinking beneath the waves.The questions were no more enlightening. Nor did the answers offer up much hope. The BBC pointed out there was no way of shielding the UK from the Trump effect. Keir looked startled. Someone had mentioned He Who Cannot Be Named. We have to step into that space with a driving sense of purpose, he said. Any idea what that means? Me neither. Nor was it entirely clear if he was planning on sticking to the government’s fiscal rules or not. I guess it doesn’t matter much either way any more.ITV went straight for the doomsday scenario. The markets were in freefall. This was Trump’s global crash. Why not at least regain some self-worth by not rewarding the maniac with a second state visit? Otherwise you were only encouraging him to do something even more daft. Not that he needed much encouragement. Starmer’s answer was A-grade waffle. Keep calm and carry on. But carry on doing what?Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerRachel ReevesDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But there is a precedent for the US causing short-term chaos and reaping long-term gainMon 7 Apr 2025 11.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.33 EDTShareIt’s less than a week since Donald Trump’s sensational announcement that he was unilaterally ending the world’s trading system with the imposition of a 10% minimum tariff for trading with the US – and a very much higher rate for those countries unfortunate enough to have the US as a major export partner. Long-term allies suchas JapanandSouth Koreahave been hammered with tariffs of around 25%, while export-dependent poorer countries such as Vietnam, which sells about a third of its exports to the US, have been hit withtariffs in excess of 45%. A further round of global debt crises is possible as heavily indebted countries face the sudden loss of export earnings.Globalstock markets have tumbledas panicked investors dump shares, and political condemnation has been near-universal. China has alreadyretaliated with 34% tariffs, threatening an escalating trade war. Right now, it looks and feels like disastrous overreach by a uniquely erratic administration at the behest of a president with a terrifyingly limited grasp of how the modern economy works.Trump has talked about imposing tariffs on the world since he first rose to prominence in the 1980s, when his target was Japan. In a political career notable for its jack-knifes in policy and direction, tariffs – “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” – have been a constant. But this is about far more than his long-cherished whims. However inconsistent or even confused Trump may sometimes appear to be, those around him have a clear-eyed view of what they want to achieve.Corporate America won’t stop Trump’s tariffs. Here’s why | Alex Bronzini-VenderRead moreHis Treasury secretary, hedgefund billionaire Scott Bessent, has spoken of a “global economic reordering” that he intends to shape to the benefit of the US’s elite. Trump’s new chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, wrote alengthy paper, A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, shortly before his appointment. The latter is particularly ambitious – detailing how the US should use not only tariffs but also the threat of withdrawing its security support to compel its friends and allies to accept cuts in payments due from the Federal Reserve on their US Treasury bills. This would be a potentially massive loss to them, akin, in reality, to a US debt default. But it is tariffs that are the cutting edge of the plan – leveraging the US’s power as the world’s largest consumer and greatest debtor to compel other countries into a negotiation on terms.After decades winning in an international trading game it wrote and refereed the rules for, the US is now facing serious competition – primarily fromChina, but with Europe as an expensive irritant. The response of this administration is to kick over the table, and demand everyone starts again. What it ultimately wants is a cheaper dollar to revive US manufacturing and Chinese competition held off, all the while keeping the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the rest of the world will pay the price.There are precedents. In October 1979, Paul Volcker, newly appointed as chair of the Federal Reserve,drove up interest ratesto a remarkable 13% in a bid to tackle inflation, later raising them to 17%. Soon the US was in recession. Millions lost their jobs over the next two years, notably in manufacturing, where soaring interest rates had driven up the value of the dollar, making US exports less affordable on the world market. After a light easing of interest rate hell by the Fed, Volcker applied a second dose of the medicine, driving interest rates up to 19% and forcing the economy back into a double-dip recession. Unemployment peaked at around 10% in late 1982.View image in fullscreenRonald Reagan and Paul Volcker in the Oval Office at the White House, Washington DC, July 1981.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveBut by mid-1983, inflation had come down to 2.5%. For the rest of the 1980s, the US economy boomed. The “Volcker shock” appeared to have worked. Volcker is today a folk hero among central bankers: Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve during the 2008 crisis, praised Volcker’s “independence” and willingness to brazen out the political storm.More decisive than lower inflation, however, was the reshaping of theUS economyVolcker’s interest-rate shock accelerated: with manufacturing in freefall, investment flooded into finance and property, firing up what became the great credit bubble of the 1990s and 2000s. The world economy was reordered around a US that acted as a giant sink for its output – swallowing exports from the rest of the world on seemingly limitless borrowing. China’s extraordinary boom was the flipside of US debt and deindustrialisation. The Volcker shock, more than any other single action, created the globalised world system that Trump is now bent on destroying.Few would have bet on Volcker’s world-shaping capacity at the time. The stock market response to the shock was immediate and unanimous. US shares plunged by a record 8% in the two days after his announcement.The S&P 500 lost 27% of its value before August 1982 – two years of grinding decline. Manufacturers and unions hated it, understandably: they were on the wrong side of an epochal reconfiguration of US capitalism. But they were not the only losers: rising interest rates in the US meant less developed countries had to spend more onservicing debts, just as recession squeezed their major export markets. The result was the so-called “third world” debt crisis, as heavily indebted countries across the global south plunged into spirals of economic decline and soaring indebtedness.Over the weekend, Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick were doing the media rounds, insisting that therewould be no climbdownon the tariffs. Trump is not for turning on what is clearly for him a personal crusade. Already, countries such as Vietnam are promising to cut all their tariffs on US goods – a clear and brutal demonstration of the US’s continuing economic power. The administration hasclaimed 50 other countrieshave also asked to open negotiations. By the end of the week, expect Trump to be triumphantly announcing more such concessions from economies in the global south. His real target – China – will be a far tougher nut to crack, if it breaks at all.Perhaps the rolling market chaos will become too much. Perhaps the administration will blink first. There is no guarantee this extraordinary gamble will work, not even for those in the clique around Trump. But it would be a mistake to assume it cannot work – and however the pieces now land, they will not return to their old places.James Meadway is the host of the podcast MacrodoseExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionTrump administrationTariffsChinaUS politicsUS economyAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s up to working people to resistMon 7 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 10.41 EDTShareFew historical analogies exist forDonald Trump’snewly announcedtariffs. The investment bank Evercoreestimatesthat the so-called “liberation day” announcement has raised the weighted average US tariff to 29% – its highest ratesince1900. To call it a generational action would be an understatement; my grandmother was born in 1939.These tariffs, if they remain in place, will raise prices, eliminate jobs and shrink retirements. No one will pay for them more dearly than American workers. Yet a shock to capitalism inevitably raises the question of whether, and how,capitalistswill respond. Faced with Trump’s tariffs, what will the US’s business class do?Some commentators havehopedthat, once the effects of Trump’s economic misrule become apparent, executives will finally turn on the Maga movement. But the answer, as during Trump’s previous tariff scares, is likely to disappoint. The Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, and International Dairy Foods Association have each issued strongly wordedstatementsagainst Trump’s trade action. Others are likely forthcoming. But those words are unlikely to become meaningful action, for it is simply not in the business lobby’s nature to fight theRepublicanparty.Are Trump’s tariffs for real or an AI hallucination? I’m afraid the answer is both | Marina HydeRead moreUnlike much of the developed world, the US lacks a single, representative organization for big business. Barring extraordinary initiative by political actors, or moments of deep and protracted crisis, unified and cross-sectoral corporate lobbies rarely appear in American history. The National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce began as initiatives of presidents William McKinley and William Howard Taft, respectively; the Business Roundtable, founded through a merger of twounion-bustingbusiness groups in 1972, stands as a rare business lobby organized by business itself.If these organizations have a difficult time coming together, they have an even harder time sticking together. The roundtable and the chamber experienced their greatest momentum during the economic turbulence of the 1970s: at last, their managers were able to unite the otherwise fractious American business community under the banner of fighting organized labor and its New-Dealer allies within the Democratic party. But by the middle of Ronald Reagan’s presidency, those enemies had been vanquished – and the chamber and roundtablehemorrhaged membershipin turn.Business organizations never regained the command of American capitalism they had won in the late 70s and early 80s. The Chamber of Commerce has maintained stature only by becoming, essentially, an all-purposes lobbying firm. Its primary function is to receive contributions from industries attempting toobscure their handin pushing politically unpopular causes: tobacco seeking to shield itself from liability, the auto industry seeking to relax safety standards, the health insurance sector seeking to stall healthcare reform, etc.Though the chamber and roundtable briefly stepped into more activist roles during the disruptions of the Tea Party, their success was, at best, mixed. At once, they found themselves dueling against the oil, gas and utilities sectors, each of whomfervently backedrightwing insurgents. By 2014, they had largely eliminated the Tea Party’s beachhead in Congress. Even so, they failed to repel the advance of Trump during the 2016 primaries; nor did they manage to sap the influence of the Freedom Caucus, today aking-makinggroup among House Republicans.Though business organizations managed to significantly shape Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, they notably failed to shape his administration’s 2018 trade war. Rather than mount a united front against Trump’s tariff regime, nearly 4,000 firms attempted to individually lobby the office of Robert Lighthizer for individual exemptions for their imports of interest. This, the political scientist Jack Zhangexplains, had the ironic effect of overwhelming the United States trade representative’s office, and crowding out most lobbyists: few ultimately received exemptions, while the rest continued paying the cost of high tariffs.That period’s patterns are telling: American business, given the weakness of its coordinating institutions, is essentially incapable of coordinating significant challenges to the Republican party’s governance. A previous generation of corporate leadership might have met a shock of Wednesday’s magnitude with a coordinated response felt at all levels of American society – whether through lobbying efforts in Washington or advertisements in local newspapers. But American business is too disunited to mount similar campaigns today. “The pursuit of individual self-interests,” as Zhangnotedin 2020, “left none to defend the public goods associated with a free and open market between the US and China.”Trump’s ‘liberation day’ could mean recession in the US and pain worldwideRead moreThat phenomenon is a persistent feature of the Trump era. The chamber’s boycott of campaign contributions to the Republican party after the January 6 insurrectionlastedlittle more than two months. And the agricultural lobby, once a powerful pro-immigration voice on Capitol Hill, has all but abandoned its public advocacy for immigrants: organizing on the issue, where it exists, is done throughquiet lobbyingbehind closed doors. If history is any guide, then, there will be no meaningful corporate break with the Republican party.“We are living through the nightmare edition of ‘Great Men Make History’,”wrotethe leftwing theorist Mike Davis shortly before his death in 2022. “Unlike the high Cold war when politburos, parliaments, presidential cabinets and general staffs to some extent countervailed megalomania at the top, there are few safety switches between today’s maximum leaders and Armageddon.”Our moment, as Davis observed, is the apogee of a long-brewing structural crisis of American liberalism, where even the mechanisms that once aligned state policy with corporate interests have fundamentally broken down. Whether among executives, lobbyists or university trustees, an elite-led backlash to theTrump administration– on trade, immigration, the rule of law or anything else – is not forthcoming. Only an organized working class, then, can resist Trump.Alex Bronzini-Vender is a writer living in New YorkExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionTrump tariffsDonald TrumpRepublicansUS economyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

And yet, one of the starkest realities we now face is that the world is failing to meet its climate goals. Last year marked a historic and deeply troubling threshold: for the first time,global temperatures exceeded 1.5Cabove pre-industrial levels.Without drastic and immediate climate action, this breach will not be temporary. The consequences –rising sea levels,extreme weatherand devastatingloss of biodiversity– are no longer projections for the distant future. They are happening now, affecting millions of lives, and likely to cause trillions in damages in decades to come.But we must think beyond our immediate horizons. When I read The Iliad, I am reminded that it was written 2,800 years ago. I often wonder: in another 2,800 years, what will people – if humanity as we know it still exists – read about our time? Will they see us as the generation that failed to act or one that made the choices necessary to safeguard the planet for the future?I was an independent observer in the Greenpeace trial. What I saw was shocking | Steven DonzigerRead moreWemust act with this longterm perspectivein mind. Scientists agree we need to bring greenhouse gas levels down to below 350 parts per million by the end of this century to ensure a liveable planet for future generations. Achieving this will require afour-pronged approach:reduce, remove,repairand resilience.Reduction – cutting emissions rapidly and deeply – of course remains a critical priority. But we must also pursue the removal of excess carbon, explore repair techniques to stabilise key ecosystems and build resilience against the escalating impacts we are already experiencing.One of the greatest challenges of climate science today is that many of the necessary levers to regain control are uncomfortable, even controversial. Ideas such asthickening sea iceto prevent collapse orbrightening marine clouds to reflect sunlightmay once have seemed extreme. Yet, as we contend with an escalating crisis, we must at least explore these possibilities. We do not have the luxury of rejecting solutions outright before we have thoroughly investigated their risks, trade-offs and feasibility.As scientists, we must never advocate for deploying unproven interventions. Any repair or removal techniques must undergo rigorous research and assessment before we evaluate full-scale suitability. However, we must also be clear: these investigations must happen with urgency. The longer we delay, the fewer options remain on the table and the more likely that deployment will happen without the proper due diligence at a point of desperation.Privately, many scientists acknowledge the need to advance research into these solutions, but there is a widespread reluctance to say so publicly. I understand this trepidation – some fear backlash, while others worry about giving ammunition to those who would use climate repair as anexcuse to delay emissionsreductions. There are also many who object on ethical, political or environmental grounds, often for entirelyunderstandable reasons. We must respect these concerns and ensure that any research is conducted transparently, with input from affected communities and with the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous rights-holders.Yet, my question remains: if not now, then when? The climate crisis is worsening before our eyes. We cannot afford to remain silent on the necessity of responsible research into nature-based climate repair. We must explore these approaches as part of a holistic climate response, not in place of deep emissions reductions, but as a complement to them.I commend the advocacy groups, scientists and policy leaders who have alreadybroken their silence. Groups such asOperaatio Arktis,Ocean Visionsand theAlliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineeringare fostering open and inclusive dialogue about what responsible research should look like. It is time for more of us to speak up.As a young man, I fell in love with the US. The country’s soul is still there, despite Trump’s best efforts to destroy it | John HarrisRead moreThroughout history, scientific breakthroughs have changed the course of humanity when leaders and communities worked together to act on the evidence before them.The Montreal protocol successfully phased out CFCsafter the discovery of the ozone hole. Decades of renewable energy researchhave madesolar and wind the cheapest power sourcesglobally. We have faced existential challenges before and found solutions – because people were willing to pursue bold, responsible action.Today, we face an even greater challenge. We must advance research into climate repair urgently, transparently and with the utmost scientific and ethical rigour. To do so, we must use our voices, collectively and courageously, before the choices are no longer ours to make.Professor Sir David King is the head of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group.

This must never happen again | Jagan ChapagainRead moreGraphic images. Distressing footage. Blurred-out posts that only clicking a consent button will reveal. For a year and a half now, disclaimers have hung over what the world sees from Gaza. Sometimes, the scenes stop me in my tracks as they are suddenly recalled, like a nightmare forgotten but then vividly remembered. Except without the relief that it was all a dream. Last week, I watched footage that showed what appeared to be the shattered, headless corpse of a baby. I have seen shredded body partscollected in plastic bags. Heard the screams of the dying and the silence of the dead, as cameras capture them piled together, some inentire families. Israel’s assault on Gaza defies inurement. As time goes by, even as the threshold for what is seen as intolerable increases, the graphic and varied forms of killing continue to scale the hurdle of numbness.All the while, politics does one of two things. Either it smoothes over this historic calamity, resorting to the bland language of encouragements to return to the negotiating table, as if it were all some regrettable falling-out that could be resolved if only heads cooled a little, or the calamity is reversed. Calling for it to stop, rather than being the most natural of human instincts, is now an impulse that in some countries meets the bar ofarrest or removal. This narrative renders the people of Gaza, so ever-present on our screens and timelines in their daily massacre, distant and remote. Gaza has been deported to another dimension in which no rules apply. Geographically it has been sealed off and wrenched away from the Earth. Foreign journalists and politicians are not allowed in.Local journalists are killed. Foreign aid is blocked. Localrelief workers are murdered. International courts and human rights organisations speak with one voice about the criminality of what is occurring. They are summarily ignored or attacked by Israel’s sponsors.And still, despite efforts to block outsiders and silence those inside, the evidence of the illegality and disproportionality of Israel’s campaign in Gaza continues to mount. Last month, the Israel Defense Forceskilled Red Crescent workersand buried them along with their vehicles.Footage recoveredfrom a mobile phone shows that Israel’s claim that the team’s activities were suspicious was false. The worker who filmed the video was found with a bullet to the head. Before he died, he asked his mother for forgiveness for his death, for the fact that he chose such a dangerous occupation. How many such crimes, committed and buried under cover of Gaza’s darkness, without footage to contradict Israel’s claims, have taken place?It may seem as if Israel has managed to act as judge, jury and executioner and is succeeding, with US and western sponsorship, in carving Palestinians out from the rest of humanity. But it is a task now that requires coercion. The war escalates and frustrates any justification, so it must be normalised by force. And that force might be suppressive in the short term, but it is degrading in the long. It requires resources and confrontations and volatility. Intargeting studentswho speak out against what is taking place in Gaza, the US government has gone to war with its own universities, and triggered conflict within them. By moving to deport students and academics, the Trump administration has become embroiled in a tussle with its own legal system. Germany’s efforts to deport those involved in pro-Gaza protests extendalarming authoritarianism further. The mobilising of the machinery of state is necessary because alarm at the scale of the crisis in Gaza can no longer be shushed with castigation alone.And that mobilisation and associated conflict only serve to highlight further what Israel has dragged the rest of the world into. It only makes high-profile figures of protesters, such as Columbia University graduate and green-card holder Mahmoud Khalil, who through his lawyer has beendictating devastating dispatcheson what his detention reveals about the war and about the US immigration and justice system. It tightens the connections with Palestinians that their opponents would like to sever. And by raising the stakes of protest, it makes clear how much those stakes are indeed everyone’s – the right to free speech and due process, to protection from state overreach, and to practise the very basics of humanity. The demand is that to be safe from persecution, you must pluck out your eyes. Instead of ejecting Gaza from domestic politics, Israel’s allies have brought the war home.Combine that with the death and starvation that continues to intensify in Gaza, and you have a recipe not for a cowing, but an increase in the appetite for moral pressure and witnessing. With political abdication, the sort of urgent condemnation and raising of the alarm that should come from leaders has not been extinguished, but passed on. Last week alone, atrauma surgeon’s video diaryand interview on BBC Newsnight revealed even more killing of innocents, even more children waking up paralysed, or with a bellyful of shrapnel and calling for their mothers. In London,a protest stopped traffic. In Washington DC, at another protest, a banner bearing thenames of the dead was unfurled. At Columbia University in New York, Jewishstudents chained themselvesto the gates in protest against the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention of their fellows. The account of the Red Crescent killings was passed on from corpse, to UN official, to media outlets. A shadow government of accountability, made up of people long divested from trust or hope in political establishments, is being cobbled together. The opposite of fatigue, something to be reasonably expected after a year and a half, has set in.It may seem like life goes on, as does the war on Gaza. It may seem like a defeat has come to pass, withIsraeland its allies staring down the public and the entire global order to force through the war. And Donald Trump’s presidency has flooded the zone with multiple shocks, from the economic to the political. But it is a restive, turbulent status quo, because what is happening to many is simply unbearable, and if protest and testimony and confrontation might save even one life or bring forward the end of the war by even one minute, it will continue.Every corpse, every city pulverised into rubble, every bloodied child exists not in a hopeless land far away, but within people’s human hinterland. Because it is impossible for a world to be shown the daily ravaging of a people and become intimidated or exhausted into habituation. Some may choose to ignore it, or justify it, or even support it, but they can never normalise it.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Certainly they can avoid making things worseMon 7 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 05.13 EDTShareUniversities in the US are under attack. While the Trump administration pretends to punish them for their alleged compliance with or support for “antisemitism” (ie pro-Gaza demonstrations) and “anti-white racism” (ie diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives), the real targets are academic freedom and freedom of speech. Going after the most prominent and privileged universities, such asColumbiaandHarvard, kills two birds with one stone: it garners prime media attention and spreads fear among other, far less privileged universities.The rest of the world has taken note and has started to respond, though mostly without knowing much about the specifics of US academia and without asking US-based academics what they need. Obviously, different academics face different challenges – depending on, for example, their gender and race, legal status, the state they live in and the university they work at – but here are some suggestions from a white, male, tenured green-card holder working at a public university in a GOP-controlled state.It is important to understand exactlyhowthe Trump administration is attacking universities. Unlike in countries such as China or Turkey, academics are (so far) not imprisoned, while most universities or their leaderships have not been taken over by the state, as they have been in countries such asHungaryandTurkey. However, public universities are often overseen by heavily politicised boards and there are some individual cases of university takeovers – most notably, theNew College of Florida. Rather, the attack is financial, but with clear political motivations.Universities that support – or even tolerate – protests, research or speech that go against the preferences of the Trump administration are investigated and their federal funding is frozen or cut. While DEI initiatives and research on climate breakdown or gender and sexuality are not technically banned, they can lead to heavy financial repercussions for the universities that engage in or tolerate them. And inneoliberal academia, money talks. University administrators are beholden to university boards mostly made up of businesspeople, who value financial growth over academic freedom. It was therefore disappointing, if unsurprising, that the presidents ofColumbiaandHarvardyielded to Trump’s demands, even if that did save neitherthemnortheir university.Given that the main threat is financial, and the US spendsalmost twice as muchon research and development as the EU, it is clear that other countries can only do so much. Moreover, given that the Trump administration is largely uninterested in dissenting opinions, let alone those from abroad, and the US is too powerful to coerce politically, we should be realistic about what Europeans can do. But even if they cannot stop the attacks on US academia, different groups can help US-based academics in other ways. I will focus on four groups: academics, journalists, universities and governments.Boycotts and petitions are the favourite forms of political protest of academics. On social media, many European academics have already declared that they will no longer travel to the US, for work or leisure, at least while Trump is in power. While these boycotts make sense as a form of self-protection, given the string of recentdetentions and deportations, they will do little to support US-based academics. They could instead lend their support by offering to host targeted data and research on open websites in Europe.European journalists have covered the attacks on Columbia and Harvard with as much fervour as they did with the alleged “wokeness” of universities. Covering the attacks on US academia is important, particularly if it moves beyond the Ivy League in the north-east and includes public universities in states such as Florida and Texas. However, this will not sway the Trump administration. What journalists can do, however, is be more sensitive to the situation of US-based academics and administrators when they approach them for interviews.I understand that the plight of my colleagues and me makes an interesting story for you, but it can also create more problems for us. Given that at many public universities communication through official email accounts (and sometimes even through university computers) is subject to “open records” legislation, anything your interviewees write could be made public and used politically and professionally. Hence, at the very least, ask whether your interviewees want to communicate through their official work email or through a private one. And be aware of the potential risks your story might have for that academic – is that “provocative question” really worth the risk for your interviewee?Recently,several European universities, such asAix-Marseille Universityin France andFree University Brussels, have set up initiatives to provide a haven to “the biggest victims of this political and ideological interference”. But three-year programmes and one-year postdocs are neither attractive nor structural solutions, particularly if they are meant to attract “outstanding scholars”. In fact, they can seem more driven by self-interest (good PR). If universities want to make a difference, for at least some individual academics, ensure that they can continue their thriving career at your institution. And focus your support primarily on scholars who are individually targeted and who, just like many “top” scholars, are working at public universities rather than Ivy Leagues.Several European countries have also started to discuss plans to bring leading international scientists to Europe. Few have been so blunt as the minister of education, culture and science in the Netherlands,Eppo Bruins, who defended his initiative in classic Dutch mercantile language: “Top scientists are worth their weight in gold for our country and for Europe.” Support for US-based academics should also benefit the supporting countries and institutions, but it should not be at the expense of Dutch and European academics. The Dutch government announced this initiative just days after academics from universities around the country had beenstrikingin protest against the draconic cuts on higher education by that same government.The EU has a phenomenal opportunity to attract some of the best researchers in the world from the US, but these initiatives must be integrated into a much broader strategy for, and investment in, European academia. It might only benefit some individual, high-profile researchers at first, but there will be an economic effect. That might force even theTrump administrationto change course.Cas Mudde is the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, and author ofThe Far Right TodayDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While I am there, crossing busy roads, wearing tidy clothes and carrying out my duty, I think of faraway places where life is getting on without me.Logrunners are turning leaf litter on the rainforest floor, albatross are cruising the wind beyond sight of the coast. Why does thinking about these creatures, who have no idea that I exist, bring me such comfort?Because they are free, because they are beautiful, and because of their utter indifference to me.1:06Last chance: the extinction crisis this election is ignoring (series trailer) – videoI was in a pub in Newcastle a few weeks ago chatting to a stranger with a lot going on. He runs a business selling household appliances, employs dozens of people, is negotiating a divorce and paying a mortgage. He seemed sceptical about what people tell him about climate change. Given how much else he has to think about, that didn’t surprise me. I asked him, if he was free next week to do anything he wanted, what would he do? He said he would bundle his kids into a van and drive to Seal Rocks to go camping.If you’re not familiar with it, Seal Rocks is among the most beautiful places anywhere on theNew South Walescoast. I’d love to be there next week myself.People seek and find freedom in wild places. There is toil in the rest of the natural world and there are dependants to care for, as there are in civilisation, but there is also a sense of boundlessness.This feeling catches me up and I get carried away. I want to cruise in the great ocean currents like a tuna. I want to gather grass and spider silk and nest in the shrubs with the wrens. I suspect the tug of freedom is what takes some people out on hunting trips, and some to earn their living as jackaroos or prawners.Get Guardian Australia environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as an emailThen there is the beauty. Survival is necessary but being gorgeous, creative and excessive has played as important a role in evolution as survival skills. This has filled the world with the resplendent detail of iridescent insects, curly liverworts, currawong song and the synchronised courtship flight-dance of terns.And it is not just living creatures making this beauty. Rays of sunlight bend through a running creek and make bright moving patterns of line and form on its bedrock. All beings have the urge to expression, even including non-living beings: rivers have it, waves have it, the wind. The wind heaps sand in rhythmic curls in the desert.The freedom and beauty of nature guide my sense of right and wrong. If I am to be free, I must care for the freedom of other earthlings.

The marvellous world is turning without me and my own life is as dear, marvellous, fleeting and irrelevant as a rose robin’s. What lightness!People talk about cosmic vertigo but how about the giddiness of knowing that the ancestors of the lyrebird you’re listening to have been living in the forests of this continent for 15m years, since there were still trees in Antarctica?We’re living in a thin film of biosphere that is creating its own atmosphere, recycling its own wastes, cleaning its own water, producing and metabolising in complex self-organising systems that we are too small and silly to understand.When we talk about “protecting nature” it makes sense at a certain scale but it is quaintly hubristic. Nature is not all lovely creatures and majestic landscapes. It is mutating viruses, poleward-creeping cyclones and vengeful orcas. Just who needs looking after from whom?Australia is in an extinction crisis – why isn’t it an issue at this election?Read moreNow that greenhouse pollution and the global environmental cataclysms of the last hundred years have broken long-familiar patterns of living within the biosphere, nature will reclaim its place as a terrifying quasi-divine force that cannot be mastered. This, too, is strangely comforting.I often feel overwhelmed with sadness to be living in a culture that doesn’t seem to value all of this but I know that I am not alone in loving the living world.The Biodiversity Council of Australia takes the trouble to ask people how they feel about nature, why and how it is important to them. The overwhelming majority of people feel as I do: that they are part of nature (69%); that being in nature helps them deal with everyday stress (79%); that it is important to them to know that nature is being looked after (88%). The vast majority want more to be done to protect it (96%). The wayAustralian politicstreats “the environment” – either as a decorative irrelevance or as an insidious threat to our prosperity – doesn’t reflect the way the people feel about it.Love and affinity for nature cuts across political, social and economic divisions. Of course, if you ask someone to choose between their own livelihood and the livelihood of a greater glider or a Maugean skate, they’re likely to choose their own – even more so for the non-specific thing they call “net zero”. But why should anyone be asked to make that kind of awful choice?Nature shows me that we don’t have to choose between beauty and freedom on the one hand, and good living on the other. Australians’ desire to be part of and safeguard the living world is a good start but we’re going to lose so much of it unless we take some responsibility for what we’re doing.Georgina Woods is a poet, environmentalist and head of research and investigations at Lock the GateExplore more on these topicsWildlifeLast chanceConservationAustralian politicsClimate crisisTrees and forestsBirdsPlantscommentShareReuse this content"

While it has been criticised by some as a subsidy for the wealthy, it could drive a change that benefits everyone who uses the power grid, and not just those who can afford to put an energy storage unit in their garage.Labor’s promise is that from July it will cut the cost of a typical household battery by about $4,000, or 30%. The discount will be delivered through a long-running small-scale renewable energy scheme that has helped make rooftop solar panels and hot water systems affordable for more people.This is obviously great for those well-off enough to cover the rest of the cost of installing a battery. The energy department has estimated it could lower annual power bills for those with an average-sized solar system on their roof by about $1,100 a year. This subsidy will significantly reduce the time it takes to pay off the battery through cheaper quarterly bills.Labor targets cost of living and climate with $2.3bn household battery pledgeRead moreIn simple terms, it means less of the rooftop solar energy generated when the sun is at its most potent in the middle of the day will be lost or fed into the grid for little financial benefit. Instead, the energy will be stored and used to power these people’s homes in the evening.If this was all it did it may be hard to justify. But, crucially, the policy should help shift how the electricity system operates. As the number of batteries in the system reaches a critical mass, it should ease the demand on the grid at peak times – late in the day on particularly hot and cold days when people are arriving home from work and school and turning either their air conditioners or heaters on full bore.At the moment, electricity from the grid on these days is incredibly expensive. A lot of it comes from “gas peakers” – fast-start gas-fired generators that are in the system as backup and only used when needed. Gas is the most expensive fuel in the grid, and the owners of gas peakers charge an astronomical price when they are turned on. Other, usually cheaper, generators then match this price, and we all pay through the nose to make sure the lights don’t go out at the grid’s busiest times.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterThe less we have to rely on gas peakers, the better it will be for consumers – and the planet. Well implemented, Labor’s policy could help the transition to a cleaner grid and shrink our dependence on a fossil fuel industry. This perhaps explains some of the teeth-gnashing in response from pro-fossil fuel analysts who believe the answer to every energy question is more gas.Labor says its policy would cost $2.3bn and could lead to a million more households, small businesses and community facilities installing batteries by 2030. About 4 million, or one in three homes, already have solar systems.The federal small-scale renewable scheme – along with some state schemes – has helped trigger a sharp fall in the cost of solar through abundance. Increased demand has meant increased volume of panels and increased competition – and solar has become widely accessible. Batteries are miles behind on this curve, but logic suggests a similar drop should follow.There is one notable difference in how Labor would apply the federal scheme to batteries and how it operates with photovoltaic panels. With solar, the cost of the subsidy is paid for by all electricity consumers through an extra charge on their bills. That charge has been smaller than other imposts, but it hasn’t been nothing.With batteries, the proposal is to pay for the scheme through the federal budget. There is a strong case that this is a fairer way to spread the load of a shift toward zero emissions that both major parties say they support, especially given current cost-of-living challenges.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe policy, of course, does not address all electrification questions. The loudest criticism since it was announced on Sunday is that more should be done for those who cannot directly benefit from it – that is, people in social housing, apartments, private renters and low-income homeowners, who mostly can’t afford or don’t have the option to install solar panels, let alone batteries.Labor has made some steps to address these shortfalls, but could go further. It initially committed $300m to upgrade social housing with better insulation, electric appliances and solar, and last year lifted it to $800m in a deal with the Greens. It is expected to be enough to improve a quarter of Australia’s social housing stock.The rental market is technically a state responsibility, but advocates including the Australian Council of Social Service have argued national leadership is needed to introduce mandatory energy performance standards for existing rented homes. Earlier this year, 120 organisations called on the federal parliament to ease the way by offering conditional support for landlords to undertake upgrades and prevent costs being passed on to tenants who can least afford it.None of this is rocket science. Experts have argued for decades that boosting energy efficiency is a cheap and straightforward way to cut emissions and bills and to improve public health. It’s not the sexiest policy ever proposed, but given the risks faced by people who cannot heat or cool their home, it could literally save lives.These proposals deserve more attention in the public debate. But Labor’s batteries policy should be welcomed. Besides its specific merits, it is the first commitment in the campaign from a major party that could do anything new to address the climate crisis.

If you live in Cymru, this story may have passed you by. If you live outside Wales, it almost certainly will have. But this really matters. It matters to the people of Wales because it is fundamental to their futures. It also matters to the wider UK because it underscores the direction of political travel for the next half-decade. It also has serious ramifications for the future of the union as we know it.So what’s the issue? Well, you could say that it has all come to a head with the UK government’s plans for benefits cuts. While people all over England will feel the pain of the changes to personal independent payment (Pip) and universal credit, Wales will be hit disproportionately hard. In Cymru there are275,000 people receiving Pip. This is 11% of our working-age people, compared with 7% in England. Therefore, this political choice is going to hit the part of the UK that most consistently votes Labour the hardest.This is all the more jarring because Labour’s big selling point to the people ofWalesin the 2024 general election was that to elect a Labour government in Westminster, alongside the one in Cardiff Bay, would create “a partnership in power” that would be “working in lockstep”. So how does Welsh Labour feel about its partner’s actions?First minister Eluned Morgan told a Senedd committee last month that she wants to“reserve [her] position”until an impact assessment on how the changes would impact Wales is carried out. However, the secretary of state for Wales, Jo Stevens, hadtold the BBCthat Morgan had “welcomed” the reforms. This obviously left the FM very angry. In first minister’s questions on Tuesday,she told the Welsh parliament: “I’ve got a lot of people trying to put words into my mouth these days, haven’t I? … I had somebody else last week trying to speak for me. I speak for myself.” Morgan’s camp has confirmed to methat she was talking about Stevens.Reform UK would be a disaster for Wales – but its rivals have left the door wide open | Will HaywardRead moreThese were the first visible examples of tension between the two administrations, but within 24 hours more had bubbled up, when the former first minister Mark Drakefordstood up inside the Senedd and called out chancellor Rachel Reeves for fleecing Wales over the increases in national insurance. Now, this may sound fiddly, but when you break it down it’s pretty outrageous. Essentially,Reeves had promisedthat when the NI rise happens on 6 April the UK Treasury would cover the increased costs for the public sector. However, the Treasury is calculating the amount of money using the Barnett formula. Under this, Wales only gets an increase in funding proportional to England’s, and because England’s public sector is smaller, Wales proportionately gets less money. In simple terms this means that councils and NHS bodies in England will not lose out because of the NI rise, whereas in Walesthere’s a £65m shortfall. Drakeford said: “Treasury ministers had a choice to make … I believe they made the wrong choice.”These surface-level arguments underscore a growing discontent from many within Welsh Labour that their “partners” in London simply do not understand their priorities and concerns. What underpins this is the dog’s dinner of a constitutional settlement we have. As devolution is now set up, even a brave, dynamic and energeticWelsh government(which in my view is something we have never had) would struggle to fix Wales’s myriad problems.I have written previously about howthe great Welsh train robberyis taking from Wales billions it is owed (something Welsh Labour has long protested against). This is all possible because, unlike Scotland, heavy rail isn’t devolved to Wales. Add to this a recent vote in which every single UK Labour MP from Walesvotednot to devolve the crown estate, denying Wales huge amounts of money, and there is a feeling among many in Welsh Labour that they are not being heard.Last week, I spoke to Mick Antoniw, a Labour Senedd member and former Welsh government counsel general and minister for the constitution. He told me that “the devolution settlement remains asymmetric and dysfunctional and sadly, the UK government seems as conservatively centralist as its predecessor … financial reform of Barnett, HS2 funding, devolving the crown estate and youth justice are just a few of the symptoms of constitutional lethargy”. He is far from the only one who thinks so. Labour MS Alun Davies also told me, regarding the lack of consequential funding for HS2: “It is appalling that the UK government treats Wales and Welsh needs in such a cavalier fashion. We deserve the same deal as Scotland and Northern Ireland.”It is obvious that those at the top of UK and Welsh Labour don’t want a visible fight. When I approached UK Labour it pointed to the longest Welsh NHSwaiting lists dropping (slightly)after a cash injection from London, increases to the living wage and minimum wage, money to help people left out of work after theclosures at Port Talbot steelworksand money to keepcoal tips maintained and safe.A spokesperson for UK Labour told me: “Of course we don’t agree about everything. It would be strange if we did. What ultimately matters is delivering our shared priorities: raising living standards, creating new jobs, reducing NHS waiting lists, making our streets safer and [creating] opportunities for people across Wales.”But in refusing to engage in meaningful conversations about Wales’s constitutional future and affording Wales the same powers as Scotland, Labour is condemning Cymru to be forever beholden to the goodwill of whoever happens to sit in Downing Street. The mechanisms to ensure Wales’s long-term prosperity need to be set in stone, not doodled in the margins of a UK government special adviser’s to-do list.The foundations underpinning Labour’s “red wall” are straining. Next year’s election could see the party fail to be the largest in Wales for the first time in a century. If the leaders of UK Labour can’t show that their “partnership in power” is more than just a slogan, they will hammer a nail into their own electoral coffin.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWelsh governmentOpinionLabourWelsh politicsWalesBenefitsDevolutioncommentShareReuse this content"

What’s not to like?Mon 7 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.19 EDTShareAdispatch from the menus of the capital’s fancier pubs, Instagram restaurants and wine bars: there’s a new favourite dish in town. Though maybe “new” is the wrong word. Cropping up in the types of establishments where you’ll easily pay a fiver for olives is the humble but universally beloved cheese toastie.I’d call it a renaissance, but that would ignore the fact that the toastie is and has been for decades a staple of busy lunches, sick days and CBA dinners, when all you’re after is instant satisfaction. Let’s say instead, then, that the cheese toastie has had a bit of a culinary glow-up.I’ve seen them recently on lots of different menus acrossLondon. Bar Levan in Peckham lists a croque monsieur, while the Library, a swish cocktail bar in Maida Vale, promises a straight-up toastie dripping with strong cheese, plus tart chutney served on the side for dipping.Elsewhere, Farringdon’s Quality Wines – whose head chef, Nick Bramham, is something of a trendsetter across the capital when it comes to sharing menus – has also had a croque monsieur on the pass (replete with provolone, Brie de Meaux, Prince de Paris ham and truffles), while the Knave of Clubs in Shoreditch has devoted a whole section of its menu to toasties. Marceline in Canary Wharf recently held a croque monsieur competition, where chefs competed to have their sandwich crowned top of the croques.If you ask me, this is all excellent news, first because who has ever refused hot molten cheese between slices of crisp bread after one to three drinks? Second, the sudden prevalence of the toastie in restaurants signals a sea change among the attitudes of people designing more “upmarket” menus.Where once it felt like these were lists of dishes detailing what chefs thought the rest of usshouldwant to eat – plates of meats with uncommon provenances (sorry to say, these tend to pretty much taste like premium supermarket salami), or patés en croûte that take dozens of steps to create – now it’s more like they’re catering to what the majority of people actuallywant.Cheesetoasties and croque monsieurs represent accessible, widely enjoyed flavours, and while I’d agree with the purists who say the two are not the same, the comfort-food sentiments they convey are inarguably pretty similar.Either way, it’s reasonable to ask: why the change in outlook on small plates menus? As with most things concerning food and lifestyle trends, we can probably look to social media. While quality ingredients are as important as ever, the ability to grab attention now plays a huge part in the success of a dish, particularly in the Instagram economy, where a great photo can cause a viral sensation. TheXXL three-cheese toastieat the Wigmore in central London, for example, has been a staple on the menu for years, foreshadowing the 2025 trend, largely because it looks so impressive.Not all of the toasties I’m thinking of here are extra-extra-large, but they do appeal to people’s sense of novelty and nostalgia – both of which hit hard on social media. Dishes like cheese toasties stand out on a posh menu precisely because they typically feel so ordinary – and in recent times, everything from Viennetta to bread and butter pudding has been given the restaurant treatment.Chefs and potential customers scrolling through the algorithm get excited by new twists on familiar dishes, or the opportunity to make or try an “ultimate” version of a classic: look at Quality Wines’ superlative version of the croque, for example. As such, the cheese toastie boom feels like a symptom of that impulse – a bit like an updated version of the gourmet burger boom of the early 2000s.Ultimately, cheese toasties popping up on the menus of wine bars and posh pubs is a positive thing. This is a hearty, filling dish, which, let’s be honest, feels like better value for money than a plate of fancy charcuterie. Plus, it also seems to signal movement in the small plates world. Of course, where a bougie wine bar is found, a devilled egg won’t be far behind, but these places are now beginning to serve a few more dishes that cater to the appetites that see us craving kebabs and chips after a night of drinking. Life, as they say, is all about balance.Lauren O’Neill is a culture writerExplore more on these topicsFoodOpinionCheeseSandwichesLondonHospitality industrySocial mediaRestaurantscommentShareReuse this content"

But which creature won?Mon 7 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.18 EDTShareIf you didn’t vote in the recent ballot, you missed out. Here was a vote where all 10 candidates were creative and morally upstanding, a vote unsullied by dubious lobbies, dodgy polls or demagogues. And if you’re seeking inspiration from a figure of strength who is also strangely cute then look no further than the winner of2025:Milnesium tardigradum, a microscopic multisegmented animal that resembles a piglet wrapped in an enormous duvet.Thousands of Guardian readers around the world voted in the contest, which we invented to celebrate the overlooked, unsung heroes of our planet.It is easy to remain indifferent to invertebrates. In cities or in the countryside, small, spineless things barely touch our lives. The animals we adore tend to have spines: birds that have adapted to living alongside us or mammals we’ve co-opted as pets or sources of protein.But we backboned beasts are a tiny minority, barely 5% of the planet’s species. Most life on Earth has chosen a spineless path, and they are animals of amazing diversity: beetles, bivalves, bees; corals, crabs, cephalopods; snails, spiders and sponges.Many of these animals perform vital functions for our habitable planet.Invertebratessupply the vast majority of pollination that enables us to grow food, and enjoy flowers. Invertebrates make soil, and keep it fertile. They clean water and tidy land, devouring poo or decomposing animals, repelling everything from bad smells to deadly diseases. Of course, some also spread diseases, and may swarm, pest or plague human life. But were invertebrates to completely disappear – and in human-dominated places, they are irrefutably disappearing – sapiens would swiftly follow.View image in fullscreenThe tongue-biting louse.Composite: Guardian Design/Getty Images/AlamySomehow, however, stressing their importance to human prosperity diminishes these animals. They are not simply dull little butlers dutifully scurrying in the service of their human masters. They are gloriously independent animals. They don’t need us half as much as we need them. They also embody ways of life that look extraordinarily exotic to our eyes.Among the 10 shortlisted animals – all nominated by the global community of Guardian readers – is thetongue-biting louse, a tiny crustacean that burrows into a fish’s gills and clings to its tongue, eating what the fish eats and sharing enough so the fish stays alive – for years. Then there’s thefen raft spider: it runs on land, walks on water and even dives beneath it in search of prey – small fish and dragonflies – larger than itself.The winner, one of the tardigrades, is particularly impressive.Milnesium tardigradumhas endured all five previous planetary extinction events. Given that, it was a doddle for some individuals to survive being chucked into outer space as an experiment. Its victory might show we are drawn to tiny but resilient animals in times of global political turmoil. When we feel small and powerless, the mighty, microscopic tardigrades give us hope.View image in fullscreenThe number of sustainable fen raft spider populations has increased from three to 12 in Britain, but they are still highly vulnerable to extinction.Composite: Guardian Design/Getty Images/Alamy/ShutterstockIn crude journalistic terms, all these invertebrates are great stories. For me and my colleagues, spending most of our days dutifully reporting more examples of how we are degrading and destroying life on Earth, the Invertebrate of the Year contest is light relief – for us and hopefully for you too.But something happens when we start sharing more of these spineless stories. Each animal challenges our anthropocentric worldview. We realise our own lifestyles are just as weird as thewētāpunga, a giant flightless, jumpless grasshopper. Perhaps we reflect on the value of diverse thinking within our own species too.And most of all, we start to notice small things around us. What is that fly rubbing its body with his forearms on my windowsill thinking? Why is that ant in such a hurry? We begin to take an interest in the doings of our neighbours.View image in fullscreenThe wētāpunga’s unconventional beauty is celebrated in its name, which means ‘god of ugly things’.Composite: Guardian Design/Getty Images/iStockPhoto/AlamyThe great American biologist EO Wilson predicted that human life would not long survive the demise of the invertebrates. But he also devised a plangent term for this epoch from ancient Greek: the Eremocene, a new, isolated place. Our era is not just the human-dominated Anthropocene; it is an age of loneliness.When I glanced around me the other day on a bustling London railway platform, I could not see another friend or neighbour. There was no trace of any other animal, plant or fungus. Just us. We are a gregarious species and we are becoming solitary, and we barely realise this is breaking our hearts.Top genome scientists to map DNA sequence of invertebrate winner 2025Read moreSo the Invertebrate of the Year contest helps us seek connection with friendly neighbours, who live so differently from us but who thrive all the same.Compiling the shortlist of 10, I came to see them as global celebrities. Then I popped into my ordinary suburban garden for a break in the sunshine. Idly staring into space, I spotted a little flying narwhal. She was humming like a bee, cute and fluffy like a bee but was actually a dark-edged bee-fly – one of our shortlist. Her long, stiff proboscis was like a narwhal’s tusk. As she flew, she dropped eggs on to the grass – near unseen nests of solitary bees so her babies could eat the bees’ offspring. Gruesome, perhaps, but one small sign of a healthy ecosystem – pollinators, predators and parasites, all fitting together.Now it is us who don’t fit. Noticing invertebrates is one small step in recognising that we are not alone, and we share our planet with a wondrous multitude of life and must do better to live gently alongside them.Patrick Barkham writes for the Guardian on natural historyExplore more on these topicsInvertebratesOpinionAnimalscommentShareReuse this content"

But should we even want to?' writes Sam Floreani.Photograph: Guido Mieth/Getty ImagesOpinionHealthWe have more data on ourselves than ever before. But can we really track our way into happiness?Samantha FloreaniSelf-tracking is regularly promoted as a way toward self-improvement. But life is not a mathematical problem waiting to be solvedSun 6 Apr 2025 20.03 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 02.31 EDTShareInspired by a curiosity to factcheck my own feelings, I’ve been tracking my mood: Far too often a bad day can feel like a permanent state rather than a passing experience. As it turns out, observing the little coloured emojis on my mood chart, one bad day does not, in fact, mean I am doomed to live a blue crying-face life forever. Thank goodness.Otherstrack themselves in different ways: monitoring daily step counts, tracking sleep cycles and bodily functions, counting calories, logging meals and so on. Digital technologies, wearable devices and an array of platforms make this easier than ever. Many people set reading targets and log books read on Goodreads or films watched on Letterboxd. Some track daily outfits online with the goal of perfecting personal style. Self-tracking is regularly promoted as a way toward self-improvement.This kind of data-driven self-surveillance can be interesting, useful, and empowering even, for some. Wired writers who created a project calledthe Quantified Selfsuggest this comes from a desire to know oneself better. But it’s also kind of weird, right? To approach life as thoughit’s a mathematical problem to be solvedwith just a bit more data. It veers too closely to the ideology of a tech bro (yikes). Indeed, the former CEO of Google wrote in his book: “with enough data and the ability to crunch it, virtually any challenge facing humanity today can be solved.” Well, there’s more data around than ever before and challenges are still abound.We live in a society saturated in surveillance and rampant data extraction. It is now well understood that all of us are subject to a process of ‘datafication’, that various parts of life are routinely transformed into data, ready to be guzzled up and commodified by corporations. Are we adopting the business model of big tech by inflicting the same paradigm upon ourselves? We are already monitored in so many ways; by offering up even more intimate data, we play directly into the hands of companies that benefit from it the most.Sleepmaxxing: from red light to mouth taping and nasal dilators, do any of the viral trends work? | AntiviralRead moreThe decision to subject yourself to monitoring for personal benefit is closely aligned with the concept ofluxury surveillance: Some people pay to track themselves while others are forced to endure it. A person on parole may have surveillance imposed upon them by way of an ankle bracelet, while others fork out hundreds to wear the latest smartwatch. Similarly, some may closely monitor their health out of necessity. The difference is in the power and privilege to make the choice for yourself.Then there’s the disciplining nature of the thing. I recall in the midst of the pandemic, I drew up a kind of adult star-chart on a whiteboard. Each day I’d tick off tasks such as: get dressed; exercise; read; and so on. Basic habits to make myself feel like a functioning human in the midst of chaos. There can be some satisfaction in seeing the chart fill up with stars, and I did feel better consistently doing the things I know are good for me. It also felt as if I turned into my own boss attempting to control and performance-manage myself into being a productivity machine.More extreme versions of this are tools designed to break down the day into small, discrete slots of time to be allocated to various jobs: planners that chunk time into as little as 15 minute segments, or software designed to optimise your calendar. This strikes me as reflexive Taylorism – the theory of “scientific management” created by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th century – only instead of a boss doing it to us, we do it to ourselves. The idea is based on the notion that breaking down actions into minutely-timed segments and measuring efficiency can increase productivity. If you want to control something, the logic goes, the first step is to measure it.We may be able to track our way to some form of self-optimisation. But should we even want to? I’m not particularly interested in assisting the process of flattening myself into an array of data points, to serve the interests of tech companies by making myself even more machine-readable. I’m not convinced that the best way to understand oneself is through quantification. Of course tracking parts of your life isn’t necessarily wrong or bad, but it seems worthwhile to question the urge to constantly seek to optimise, and to resist internalising the tech industry maxim that more data is always better. Perhaps this is trite – overly romantic – but a big, messy, joyous life isn’t going to be found in a database.Samantha Floreani is a digital rights activist and writer based in Melbourne/NaarmExplore more on these topicsHealthOpinionWearable technologyFitnesscommentShareReuse this content"

Gary Archer on crafting amazing gnashers for starsMon 7 Apr 2025 10.34 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 21.31 EDTShareAimee Lou Wood has been one of the standout stars of the third series of The White Lotus, stealing almost every scene with her character’s wild one-liners and wide-eyed obsession with astrology. Butthe Bafta winner from Stockporthas in recent weeks been getting as much attention for her teeth as for her winning turn in the hit show about a luxury resort. Vanity Fair and the New York Times have been notable fans of Wood’s natural look but there has also been a backlash, with beauty magazine Alluresaying that“fawning over a rejection of perfection is misplaced”.Gary Archer doesn’t know what the fuss is about. “They look all right to me,” he says of Wood’s teeth. He would know, because after working on 350 films and TV shows, plus 200 adverts, he is called the Godfather of FX Teeth in Hollywood and beyond. It was Archer who fashioned the unforgettable gnashers that Mike Myers sported in the Austin Powers films, a design that he feels actually led to the term “British teeth”.Julia Roberts was saying: ‘This is so disgusting. Can’t we stop?’ I was proud she was so horrified“I’m asked for them all the time,” he says. “Manky, twisted, rotten, stained or with a gap – not what most Americans think of as perfect and blinding white, essentially. But I call them ‘character teeth’, and that’s what I specialise in.”Born in Edgware, London, Archer was 11 when his mother died and his father, a noted dental technician, was intrigued when a cousin living in Los Angeles suggested they try their luck there. “For the first three or four years, I just wanted to go home,” says Archer, 60, who was the only British pupil at his new school. “I said I was mad keen on football, but then I was thrown this ball shaped like an egg. On seeing my reaction, the coach said, ‘Son, you’ve got some learnin’ to do.’”View image in fullscreenLed to the term ‘British teeth’ … Mike Myers in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.Photograph: New Line Cinema/AllstarArcher played soccer instead with kids from Central and South America, using “jumpers and coats for goalposts”. He also suffered the teeth-staining effects of an antibiotic called tetracycline and, when he later lost a tooth playing in goal, it prompted the filing down of part of his front row and their replacement with veneers and crowns.He was thinking about college and a career in IT when his father had a heart attack and asked him to help out at his AA Dental Labs, which did dentures, partials, crowns and other restorations. “When he came back to work, he asked whether I might want to be a dental technician, so I apprenticed.”View image in fullscreenBoxes containing actors’ dental moulds in Archer’s Hollywood workshop.Photograph: Gary ArcherIn the early 1990s, they got a call. “My dad said he was too busy and handed the phone to me.” The caller was a dentist who had the great makeup artist Greg Cannom in his chair. Cannom asked how he might get a set of teeth that would fall out during a restaurant scene in a forthcoming comedy he was working on called Mrs Doubtfire.They were able to oblige – and things snowballed. Archer gestures towards hundreds of small white boxes lining the walls of his workshop in Woodland Hills, north of Hollywood. They’re identical and unremarkable until you notice the names on each one – a who’s who of Hollywood stars: Kevin Bacon, Drew Barrymore, Adam Driver, Kathy Bates, Ralph Fiennes, Helen Mirren.View image in fullscreenGary Archer, right, with actor Glen Powell, creating dental prosthetics for the film Hit Man.Photograph: teeth_by_archer“Each box has the mould I made of their teeth,” says Archer, “plus their measurements and other data. I keep them because so many performers come back when they need character teeth for another role. I encourage them to keep the character teeth, because they’re specially made to fit them. No one else can ever use them.”In the last few years, improvements in special effects and the rise of CGI have changed some practices Archer and his late father used. “We might create a set of teeth, but paint them green with the colouring you’d put on a birthday cake. It then becomes a green screen in the mouth – and characteristics, words, gold and diamonds can be added in post-production.”Other improvements have meant that moulds can now set in the mouth in under a minute, the results lightweight but also rigid and tough. They have to be. “Actors can be very rough on them,” says Archer.Digital dentistry has also become something Archer uses more frequently. “We have a device that’s about the size of a wand, lined with tiny cameras. It can be run slowly along the teeth, creating a picture that we can then produce in a mould, or via a 3D printer. Then we just ship it off to the set or location. Sometimes I never even meet the person I create character teeth for.”We return to the subject of perfect teeth, in particularThe White Lotusand the fact that Aimee Lou Wood and her onscreen partner-in-crime Charlotte Le Bon have been lauded as “inspiring”, “charming” and even regarded as trend trailblazers just for having teeth that look, well, just like millions of other people’s.‘I don’t know whether I’d describe it as fun’: Aimee Lou Wood on the intensity of making The White LotusRead more“Dental care wasn’t great in Britain from the 1930s to the 1960s,” says Archer. “There had been wartime shortages, plus a lack of awareness about vitamins. And the newly formed NHS focused more on purely practical needs, less on how you looked. British people often didn’t seem so bothered about their teeth. It was the luck of the draw. But in booming postwar America, white teeth were a symbol of success, so the use of braces, crowns and bridges was more advanced, more commercialised, and more common.”He goes on: “In fact, to give Aimee Lou Wood a set of ‘perfect teeth’ would be really difficult – though I’d love to take it on, if she ever needed them for a role. From what I can tell, she has a slightly prominent lateral with a twist and rotation. So we would have to create veneers to go over that. Saying that, however, I think she looks lovely. She looks real.”Gary Archer’s top 10 teethCharlie EvansinLeave the World Behind“Archie, Charlie’s character, wakes up one morning and seems to be sick. He puts his fingers in his mouth and pulls out a loose tooth – then another and another. His mother, played by Julia Roberts, begs him to stop. I was on set for the shoot, with three sets of teeth for Charlie, who was being filmed from several angles. Julia was saying, ‘This is so disgusting! Can’t we stop?’ I was so proud that she and the crew were horrified by my work!”Jonah Hill in The Wolf of Wall Street“Jonah loved his teeth and he keeps them in a safe at his home. I’ve seen them in there!”Anthony Hopkins in Nixon“The eyes and teeth are the most distinctive parts of a face. You can really change someone’s appearance by changing them. Nixon’s awkward smile really affected how the public saw him.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Landmark Media/AlamyRobin Williams in Mrs Doubtfire“An upper set of false teeth had to fall out into a glass of water, which is of course the opposite of what they’re usually designed to do. Robin came in for the fitting, the team liked what we did and word got around. Then everything changed.”Mike Myers in Austin Powers“Mike and I both loved talking about British humour. His parents were British and he moved to Canada when he was young, like I did to America. He said, ‘There is no one more English than an English person living abroad,’ and I still feel you can’t beat a McVitie’s chocolate digestive.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Warner Bros./AllstarTom, Brad and Kirstenin Interview with the Vampire“This was a huge deal, a huge movie.

Together the group defined the American new wave sound of the 1970s and 1980s,scoring six UK No 1 hits and four in the US, including Heart of Glass and The Tide Is High.Alongside his work with Blondie, Burke played in supergroups such as the International Swingers, Slinky Vagabond and Magic Christian, and guested with artists as varied as Ramones, Eurythmics, Bob Dylan and Nancy Sinatra.Born and raised in Bayonne, New Jersey, Burke tinkered with local covers groups and a drum corps before moving to New York, auditioning for Blondie in 1975 to replace the band’s original drummer, Billy O’Connor. “My quest was to find my David Bowie, my Jim Morrison or my Mick Jagger to front a band,” he said in 2022. “I was emphatic about that. I needed to work with people that I felt had that sort of charisma and creativity.”He had previously auditioned for Patti Smith, for the band that would end up recording her debut album Horses. “She asked me who my favourite drummer was … I said John Bonham, and I think that might’ve been the wrong answer,” he remembered.Blondie released their debut single, X-Offender, in 1976 but success took a little time to arrive, with Stein and Harry later crediting Burke as the motivating force in the band, convincing Harry not to quit. “He really wanted to get out of New Jersey,” she said.Their first chart success came overseas, in Australia then the UK, with songs such as Denis and Hanging on the Telephone, but the group swept to global fame in 1979, including in their native US, with Heart of Glass. It was powered by a drum machine but Burke was sanguine about this development: “It was threatening, I suppose, at first, but I’ve never really found myself in the situation where a drum machine was going to take over,” he later said.View image in fullscreenBlondie in 1977, with Clem Burke in a polka dot shirt.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesLike the whole band, Burke drew on the cosmopolitanism of late-70s New York, playing high-tempo punkish rhythms or sensual, swaggering disco with equal charisma. “We all had a common aesthetic, whether it be the New York Dolls, or the Velvet Underground, or the Shangri-Las,” he said. Hits continued with Call Me – introduced by a tumbling yet precise Burke drum fill – as well as Atomic, a masterclass in cymbal impact, and The Tide is High, the band’s foray into reggae. The three singles were back-to-back No 1s in the UK.The group’s success tailed off with their 1982 album, The Hunter, and they split later that year. Burke took high-profile sessions with the likes of Bob Dylan, Pete Townshend (“a real gentleman … a dream come true”, Burke said) and Joan Jett. He also worked with the former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones in the supergroup Chequered Past and later joined another Pistols-related supergroup, the International Swingers, with Glen Matlock.He played live with Ramones – “not a happy place to be” – and formed various other supergroups and rock’n’roll outfits including the Empty Hearts. His connection with Iggy Pop began when Blondie toured with him in the late 1970s – Burke later toured in his backing band, and in recent years Burke performed Pop’s Lust For Life album on tour with Matlock and Katie Puckrik. He even appeared with a Blondie tribute act, Bootleg Blondie, while his career with the band itself continued.Blondie reformed for gigs in 1997, and triumphantly returned to the studio: the 1999 album No Exit reached No 3 in the UK and contained another No 1 single, Maria. They continued touring and released four more studio albums.Among those paying tribute to Burke was another of his creative partners, Nancy Sinatra, who wrote: “My heart is shattered. Clem became an icon as a member of Blondie, but he was also a important part of my band, the KAB. I was blessed to call him my friend. If I ever needed him, he was there.”Gerald Casale of Devo said: “His unmatched style and New York City ‘cool’ set the performance standard for decades.”Explore more on these topicsBlondiePop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

We use it with our family, partners, friends; my cat probably thinks it’s her middle name by now. So it felt huge when Ed Sheeran announced that the lead single from his new album would be called just that:Azizam.The track, inspired by the Iranian heritage of Stockholm-based producer Ilya Salmanzadeh, has divided critics, with a Telegraph review calling it “a slice of pure pop froth that couldn’t be any more generic and upbeat if it was written by an AI programme”. But these reproaches are missing a whole other dimension: that the song has triggered a huge emotional response from millions of Iranians around the world. “Hearing a beloved artist embrace our language with such care? We feel it. And we’re here for it,” said one popular comment on Sheeran’s Instagram.For so long, Iranians have become used to being ostracised or misrepresented in western popular culture. Take the movie 300, a fictional retelling of the Greco-Persian wars, in which the Persians were essentially depicted as barbarians; or Ben Affleck’s Argo, about the Iran hostage crisis, which stereotyped Iranians as fanatical and ignorant.“If you’re an Iranian and you live in the diaspora, you understand what it’s like to be misunderstood, especially if you grew up in the post 9/11 era,”a TikTok user said. “Non-Iranians or people who aren’t from the Middle East don’t understand how beautiful our culture is, our language, our history and our struggle, what we’ve been through.” So having one of the world’s best-selling artists celebrate that beauty has got to mean something. “Now you’re going to have a lot of non-Iranians be like … ‘what a beautiful word’.”Persians are incredibly proud of our culture and history. Iranians will be quick to tell you that Persia is the world’s oldest continuous civilisation, that poets like Rumi and Hafez and Ferdowsi influenced literary traditions for centuries. Many still love to claim Freddie Mercury – or “Farrokh joon” (dear Farrokh) – as one of our own (his parents were Parsi, an ethnic group descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to India in the eighth century). And Ed Sheeran will heretofore surely be known as Ed Shirini (“sweets” in Farsi), or as the comedian Shaparak Khorsandijokedin the manner of a typical Persian mum, Sheeran derives from Eee-ran anyway. Yes, I tell my friends, Brian Cox is a fantastic actor, but more importantlydid you knowhe and his Persian wife’s cat is called Pishi (Persian for kitty)? Yes, Animal was a massive Bollywood hit, butdid you knowthe song that enthralled Indian audiences from the film is a 50s Iranian tune?Critics have called Azizam inauthentic and derivative, but I disagree – it has a real Iranian flavour. This includes its hook, the use of instruments like the daf and santur, and backing vocals from huge Iranian pop stars Arash and Andy, the latter of whomdelighted fans by playing it at a recent concertand saying he felt “deeply connected” to the song. There’s also a full Farsi version coming, featuring a singer “who’s as big as it gets in the Persian community” according to Sheeran. Then there’s the fact that it was released during Nowruz, the Persian new year marking the spring equinox, which is a time of celebration and coming together to eat (including a lot of shirini of course), give gifts and dance. This song will have been played in Iranian households around the world. The video alone amassed more than 8m views in two days, Tik Tok isfull of Iranians “gher”-ing to it– that irresistible feeling that makes you want to shake your hips on the dancefloor – and the song will undoubtedly be played at Iranian weddings for years to come.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

Sheeran has played to this before, collaborating with west African pop stars such as Burna Boy and Fireboy DML, and he learned Spanish for a record with Colombian singer J Balvin. Cynics have suggested this is canny, even craven: a way of courting a series of global audiences to expand Sheeran’s brand. More generally, exploitative sampling or insensitive imitation of global-majority artists has of course resulted in plenty of cultural appropriation over the years. But there’s evident joy in the way Sheeran sings over these fusions, and splicings of MENA music and British pop are often creative as well as commercial successes, as proved by the Chemical Brothers’ Galvanize, Blur’s Out of Time, or Coldplay’s recent We Pray, featuring Palestinian-Chilean singer Elyanna.Sheeran said the similarity of the Middle Eastern instruments on Azizam to the Irish traditional music he grew up with brought home how much “music connects us all and really is a universal language”. There’s no better representation of that than online videos of an American crowd in a pub in Ipswich, Massachusetts last week,blaring out “azizam” in unison. Jimmy Fallon evensang it on the Tonight Show. So for that, and all the above, I’ll simply say: Ed, you are our azizam.Explore more on these topicsEd SheeranIranPop and rockMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

But there was reason to celebrate in the Netherlands, too. The bold West End productions Oedipus and The Years, which picked up four awards between them, have their origins atInternationaal Theater Amsterdam (ITA).View image in fullscreen‘We are an international house’ … ITA’s Eline Arbo with her Olivier award.Photograph: Ian West/PAThe theatre’s artistic director is Eline Arbo, who adapted and staged a version of Nobel prize-winner Annie Ernaux’s The Years for an all-female cast. After its success in the Netherlands, Arbo was invited to London’s Almeida theatre to direct the show with British actors. Among them was Romola Garai, who won the Olivier award for best actress in a supporting role, while Arbo was named best director. The production received rapturous reviews and has transferred to the West End where its run (which ends on 19 April) has been accompanied by regular reports of audiences fainting during its abortion scene.Garai calls Arbo a “genius” and said that the production’s power is a result of fusing several elements of theatre-making from around Europe. “Eline is Norwegian so she comes from that tradition of Ibsen. Amsterdam has ITA’s incredible tradition of physical and quite conceptual work. And England has this usually narrative-based, text tradition. I think The Years is a perfect example of how when you marry those elements together you can make really great, exciting work that feels very challenging in the best way to an audience.”Arbo, who became the sixth woman to win the best director Olivier award, said she was delighted by how British audiences had responded to The Years. “There are talks [for ITA] to come more to England,” she said. “For us to be able to show these productions to a British audience, and have that collaboration, is so important. It’s one of our biggest missions: how to share different perspectives from different cultures. We are an international house.” Arbo said that increasingly “politicians want to close borders” but it is vital “to have that exchange of perspective to develop culture”. Brexit, she said, had not been a significant obstacle for her to work in the UK.When Rufus Wainwright’s version of the film Opening Nightflopped in the West End, the composer suggested British audiences lack “curiosity” after Brexit and that the British press had turned on the project for being “too European”. Opening Night was directed by the Belgian Ivo van Hove, Arbo’s predecessor at ITA, who combined a 20-year tenure leading the Dutch ensemble with high-profile, often star-powered freelance productions in London. It was Van Hove who invited Britain’s Robert Icke to Amsterdam to adapt and direct a new version of Sophocles’ Oedipus in 2018. “I’d written an English script that was translated – they acted and talked to each other in Dutch and to me in English,”Icke told the Guardian. “It had the potential to be profoundly alienating but I loved it.View image in fullscreen‘It had the potential to be profoundly alienating’ … Hans Kesting as Oedipus and Marieke Heebink as Jocasta in Oedipus at the Edinburgh international festival in 2019.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIcke won best revival for Oedipus at the Oliviers and said in his acceptance speech that the chance to stage a new version of his adaptation at the Wyndham’s theatre had been “amazing”. After an ensemble of ITA actors performed itat the Edinburgh international festival in 2019, the London production paired Mark Strong, in the title role, with Lesley Manville as Jocasta. Manville, who won the Olivier award for best actress, said that Icke’s time at ITA had “shaped a lot” for him. “After that production he did some reworking of Oedipus. He was very happy and comfortable working in Amsterdam … He obviously saw that it could have another life here.” Its success has left Manville “almost wanting to text Sophocles!” she joked.‘How many litres of blood do we need?’: Ivo van Hove’s ITA on 20 years of shocking theatregoersRead moreThree years ago, Rebecca Frecknall was the toast of the Olivier awards as her version of Cabaret picked up seven prizes. ITA took note of the rising star director. She was invited to Amsterdam to directa version of Strindberg’s Miss Juliewith the ensemble in 2024, designed by another Brit, Chloe Lamford. Earlier this month, Frecknall was announced as ITA’s Ibsen Artist in Residence, a position previously held by Icke. Frecknall said that Arbo had been “a great support in delivering my first ITA production last year” and added: “It’s going to be wonderful to have a home at this incredible theatre for the next three years and to keep working with their talented ensemble of actors.” You wouldn’t be surprised if she and Arbo are back celebrating at the Oliviers before too long.Explore more on these topicsOlivier awardsTheatreAwards and prizesRomola GaraiWest EndNetherlandsIvo van HovenewsShareReuse this content"

When I played it to the band, the look on their faces said, “We’re in trouble, boys”’Interviews byHenry YatesMon 7 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Apr 2025 11.44 EDTShareChristopher Neil, producer/writerI was a pop producer working with the likes of Sheena Easton and Dollar. Mike Rutherford was a prog rock musician withGenesis. But the band’s publishing company thought the two of us – the yin and yang – would do well together. And they were right. We hit it off immediately.Mike likes to have a cassette rolling all the time and put everything down there: not fully formed ideas, just little sketches, odds and sods. He gave me a tape that was full on both sides and said: “Pick out anything you like.” Ordinarily, I’m not sure I’d have had the patience. But I’d just done nine months in the studio with another artist and I was knackered and my management had sent me away to a health farm in rural Sussex to rest up. I was bored by the third day, so I forensically went through the cassette.Mike already had the “All I need is a miracle / All I need is you” section. I loved that. While I was meticulously going through the second side, I found what became the verse instrumentation and pre-chorus. I pretty much wrote the verses in the health farm, then came back to Mike and we welded it all together.In the lyric, the guy has been a twat to this girl and she’s said: “I’m off.” The minute she’s gone, he thinks: “What the fuck have I done?” He knows it’ll be a miracle if he gets her back. If you just read the song on paper, it’s incredibly sad. But you can write your own ending into it depending on your mood. If you’re driving along an open road on a sunny day, then it’s a happy song.In the Mechanics, we wrote the songs and chose the keys first, then auditioned singers based on what we had – which is a really weird way of doing it. We had both Paul Young [of Sad Café] and Paul Carrack singing on the first Mechanics album, and the songs chose them. Paul just sounded better on Miracle: he had a rockier voice. It was a big shock to us all when hedied suddenly of a heart attack [in 2000].The only time I’ve ever stood up in the control room and said to everybody, “This is a massive hit, trust me” was when we finished the mix on The Living Years, but we knew Miracle was a contender. Honestly, though, these things are in the lap of the gods. American radio got it straight away and it went Top 5. I remember getting into a taxi in New York just as it was coming on the radio. It sounded fantastic.Mike Rutherford, guitarist/writerMost musicians make solo albums because they’re frustrated in their main band. I think Genesis were uniquely different: we all loved being in the band but ran solo projects. There were loads of bits on the cassette I gave Chris – and they were pretty crap. But Chris has great ears. He can hear a few chords and go: “That’s worth looking at.”I’ve never written a song like Miracle since. I can’t think of any other song quite like it – it’s uplifting without being sugary, hopeful rather than smug. There’s a bit of sadness in there. But there are some clever key changes and it really lifts the audience.Phil Collins is an amazing drummer, but I wanted to try something different with the Mechanics. Drum machines were coming in, and I always liked programming stuff, so it felt natural to write the drum part on Simmons drum pads. Miracle has a great beat, an energy that carries it along.Chris rang me on a cold, wet November day, saying: “What about we record in Montserrat?” In those days, there were no mobile phones, so you went away for three weeks and there were no distractions, although later on the boys did start saying: “Will we be done by 4pm? Because the sunset catamaran is going out.”I’d sung on my previous solo album [1982’s Acting Very Strange] and I thought: “I’m never going to do that again.” When I played the band the demos on the first day with me singing, you could see their faces, like: “We’re in trouble here, boys.” I wanted the best voices to sing my songs – and that’s not me.It seemed so unlikely that another member of Genesis would have solo success: you already hadPeter Gabrieland Phil Collins. At the time, our manager wasn’t sure we’d even get a deal. But Miracle came out in America and just took off. There was a weird moment when, in the US Top 20, there was a Gabriel song, a Collins song, a Genesis song and a Mechanics song.I haven’t actually been in the situation described in All I Need Is a Miracle. But I remember, when my wife and I were just friends, she was about to get engaged to someone else. Genesis were going on tour in the US and I said: “Just come with us and let’s hang out.” We’re still together 48 years later.Mike and the Mechanicsare touring the UK until 14 April.

But now air travel is one big grumble: it’s degrading, everyone is ill-mannered and you used to get free peanuts in this country, but now the peanuts are not free. Air travel, like everything else, is about the politics of resentment. The skies are feeling a lot less friendly, and that’s before you get to a year in which Americans haveexperienced profound tragedy in the air, as well as significant cuts to an already strained Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).In this turbulent time for flying lands Sky Daddy,the unusual debut novel by Kate Folk, a San Francisco author and screenwriter whose short story collection Out Therewas released in 2022. Sky Daddy is narrated by a woman called Linda who, like many of us, lives her life in dogged pursuit of love. She just wants that love to come from a commercial airplane in freefall. “I believed this was my destiny,” Linda tells us, “for a plane to recognize me as his soulmate mid-flight and, overcome with passion, relinquish his grip on the sky, hurtling us to earth in a carnage that would meld our souls for eternity.”Yes, Linda is kind of the female protagonist for whom the descriptor “quirky” is not quite strong enough. She gets off on simulations of aviation accidents. She calls airport terminals her own “personal red-light districts”. Her style of objectifying airplanes is impressive: she admires their “testicular engines” and ogles at a “naughty landing gear shot”. The Boeing 737 is the “sky’s narrow-bodied workhorse”, the Airbus A320 has the “handsomest face of any commercial airliner”.And then there is the retired McDonnell Douglas DC-9, an airplane that she says “flaunts a ‘bad-boy’ image” given itshistorically spotty safety record. Linda spends as much time as her paltry salary affords her up in the sky. “Like dating,” she tells us, “death by plane crash is a numbers game.”Sky Daddy is a very strange and very funny book. But it does not exist as mere provocative gag, or mean-spirited attempt to belittle one woman’s absurd romantic delusions. Linda defies diagnosis: her aims are more spiritual than they are symptomatic. “She’s a singular character,” says Folk. “I kind of imagine her as a real person, it’s hard for me to accept that [she’s] just something I’ve made up.”When Folk was a child growing up in landlocked Iowa, she read a version of Moby-Dick that was modified for children. What stood out to her most was the description of Ishmael’s experience of waking up as a child and feeling a ghostly presence hold his hand. “A supernatural hand seemed placed in mine,” writes Melville, “and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery.” It had a lasting effect on Folk. “I still never sleep with my hand outside the covers,” says Folk. “Because I’m afraid of that happening and I don’t want to invite it.”View image in fullscreenKate Folk.Photograph: Andria LoLater, when she was drafting a novel about a woman sexually obsessed with airplanes, she returned to Melville’s classic. “I saw Linda as a mixture of Ishmael and Ahab,” says Folk, adding that she felt both her work and Melville’s were about humans trying to dominate the natural world. “Both planes and whales involve oil.” She loved the many different registers of Melville’s novel, its playfulness and its enthusiastic anthropomorphizing of whales. “It’s very silly a lot of the time,” says Folk. “Calling them gentlemen and fellows.”Linda too has a strict understanding of how things in her fantasy world are sexed and gendered: “I allowed people to assume I was heterosexual,” she explains, “and I suppose I was, as all planes are male in spirit, just as all boats are female, and helicopters possess the souls of mischievous children.”Unlike Ishmael and Ahab however, Linda is a creature of the internet. “That’s how she’s fueled her obsession,” Folk says. “It’s how she researches her plane lovers and keeps tabs on them, and looks at past plane incidents.” Linda’s life revolves around planes, but her passion is sustained by her work as a content moderator in the Hate & Harassment sector of a tech company, where she and her colleagues make near minimum wage scrubbing the internet of its various maladies: violent images, crude and predatory pornography, onslaughts of verbal threats and assaults. Their office amenities are a yoga ball in a so-called wellness room and monthly pallets of Rockstar lemonade. Sky Daddyis a workplace novel as much as it is an epic romp. “It’s this unseen pool of workers who are doing this like terrible labor that supports our use of the internet,” explains Folk. “They’re absorbing the trauma for our sakes.”The fact that Kate Folk dreamt up and drafted this book years before the recent spate of high-profile plane crashes filled the news, and before the new administration firedseveral hundred workers at the FAA, is a coincidence. But it’s also not. Governments have a special way of corrupting and polluting those things that literally keep us afloat: social services, environmental protections, any semblance of a humane healthcare system. There is no premium on the dignity of human life in the US. To be an American is to believe fundamentally in the power of one’s destiny.But Sky Daddyreminds us that air travel in a way is the opposite of the agentic American dream. To get on a plane is to submit to a fate you have no control over. “Even in better times when there weren’t these incidents … it is such an act of surrender,” explains Folk. “When I get on a plane, I really am not in control of what happens. I have to just put my faith in the machine and also in the pilots and air traffic control and everyone working to make sure the flight gets to where it’s going safely.”View image in fullscreen‘Even in better times when there weren’t these incidents … it is such an act of surrender.’Photograph: Jeffrey Milstein/Gatwick Airport/PAThen there is the existential question of the climate crisis, and how it threatens to upend any notion of the future we might have previously conceived. Theday the sky in San Francisco turned a shocking orange due to wildfiresmoke haunts Folk’s fiction. The distinction between literary fiction and sci-fi or genre fiction became less meaningful to her. “Basically my entire life is just this sense of hurtling toward a catastrophe,” she says, referring to the climate crisis.Linda’s obsession with flying is part of that. Her death drive, her lust for this carbon-intensive mode of travel, is inevitable ending; it’s not hard to feel like to some degree we are all Linda, hurtling towards a fiery conclusion. “There is no greater intimacy than to be fellow passengers on a doomed flight,” Linda tells us. She is an accelerationist. She dreams of self-annihilation, sure. But she also dreams of being chosen. She hopes her life amounts to something more than eating work-grade string cheese and deleting lewd comments on a video of a busty kindergarten teacher reading The Very Hungry Caterpillar.During our conversation, I got the sense that Folk had a fond appreciation for her fictional character Linda, which I shared. Linda is a little freak for sure, but she’s endearing to me, and somewhat pure (I like how she calls joints “cannabis cigars”.)Maybe I could learn something from her. It just so happened that the week Folk and I were talking, both of us were taking flights. I asked her if she wanted to text me when she was taking off, to see what she noticed about the miracle of flight to which I had maybe been deadened and desensitized. I told her I would do the same.She texted me in the middle of the day that she was boarding aninfamous Boeing 737 Max, the model that made headlines for its previous history of nosedives.Linda would love that, I thought.“We’re turning left,” Folk wrote. “A plane is like a bird,” she added, “clumsy and slow on the ground.” Then she told me the engines were firing up and changing tenor. What was the inadvertent rhythm of our conversation reminding me of? I thought. And then with a little pang of shame, I realized it had the faint whiff of sexting.Two days later I was crawling through that yonic jet bridge, feeling dispirited. Historically I have been afraid of flying or at least dreaded it. I was on Linda’s beloved 737-800/900 (“a long boy”, Kate texted me when I told her), and it looked dingy, worn-in and world weary.But then we began to move, the wings wobbling as we inched forwards on the tarmac, a polite row of seemingly animate planes lining up behind us. And then we lifted off into the sky. I could see all of Manhattan and Brooklyn before me: the wide sandy beaches of the Rockaways where I swim every summer, the dark patch of cemetery by my apartment, the skyscrapers in the distance. I held their gaze until suddenly everything was vaporous and white, occluded by cloud. I had no romantic attachments to the plane, but I could feel the eternal romance of it, Like maybe Linda was holding my hand as we flew closer to the sun and left the whole world behind.Sky Daddy by Kate Folk (Hodder & Stoughton, £18.99).

Lithgow, speaking after his best actor victory at the Olivier awards in London on Sunday, singled out Trump’stakeover of the Kennedy Center, Washington DC’s national institution for the performing arts. “Our administration has done some shocking, destructive things,” he said, “but the one that grieves me most is taking over the Kennedy Center.”The US president is now chair of the prestigious cultural complex (which was founded as a government-funded, bipartisan venue) and has installed new board members and a new interim leader, loyalist Ric Grenell. The board had been in the process of selecting a successor to outgoing leader Deborah Rutter, who in Januaryannouncedher intention to step down after 11 years.“Deborah Rutter wasfiredfrom her position as president – even though she’d already resigned and had [several] months to go,” said Lithgow. “She’s a very good friend of mine. We co-chaired a commission on the arts [launched by the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2018] and spent three years finding out the state of the arts in America [was] in crisis. Well, it’s really in crisis now. First there was coronavirus, now there’s this.”‘To my wife for managing my vast collection of neuroses!’ – the Olivier awards’ best quotesRead moreLithgow was named best actor at the Oliviers for his performance as Roald Dahl in Mark Rosenblatt’s play Giant, which ran at the Royal Court last year and transfers to the West Endlater this month. In hisacceptance speech, the actor – best known for the TV comedy 3rd Rock from the Sun – said that this moment was “more complicated than usual” for relations between the US and the UK but that he personally felt the special relationship was “intact”.Lithgow described himself as “a curious kind of hybrid Englishman”, reflecting on the films and TV series he has made in the UK and his stage appearances, which have included Twelfth Night with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2007 and The Magistrate at the NationalTheatrein 2012.“I grew up with Shakespeare,” he said. “My father was a producer of Shakespeare festivals in Ohio. He was a regional theatre artistic director. I was in 20 Shakespeare plays by the time I was 20 years old … I came over and went to Lamda [the London drama school] after my college years. When I returned, everyone thought I was English … My sister said to me: ‘I’m not going to talk to you until you stop talking in that pretentious English accent!’”While assessing the current climate for the arts in the US as “a pure disaster – really disheartening”, Lithgow said that “it gives us all something to fight for and I think the arts are animated by that. Right now, everybody is in shock.” Once that shock has passed, he acknowledged that “bad times create good art”.Explore more on these topicsTheatreDonald TrumpUS politicsJohn LithgowOlivier awardsAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

His surviving bandmates, vocalist Jon King and drummer Hugo Burnham, said that Allen had been suffering from early-onset mixed dementia.Burnham said in a statement: “It is with broken yet full hearts that we share the news that Dave Allen, our old music partner, friend, and brilliant musician, died on Saturday morning. He was at home with his family.”Burnham recalled a recent afternoon with Allen and family in which they “talked and laughed for hours, sharing rich and vivid memories of good times together. Adventures, careers in music, raising families, our interwoven lives spanning half a century. We’ve been so very lucky to have had the Ace of Bass in our lives.”Allen was born in Kendal on 23 December 1955. He joined Gang of Four shortly after their formation in 1976, following the departure of short-lived bassist Dave Wolfson. Their acclaimed debut album, Entertainment!, was released in 1979. Allen departed the band in 1981 and co-founded the band Shriekback.He subsequently performed with the Elastic Purejoy, Low Pop Suicide, King Swamp and Faux Hoax, and later went on to work in music technology, including at Beats Music and Apple Music.Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill died of multiple organ failure and pneumonia in 2020; his widow Catherine Mayer believed he was an early victim of the Covid-19 pandemic after he had toured China in late 2019.The band continued to perform after Gill’s death, with a farewell tour scheduled for North America later this month. “We know that Dave would have wanted nothing more than to step onstage with us again in Portland on our farewell US tour,” Burnham said. “But it’s now a bridge too far.”Explore more on these topicsGang of FourPunknewsShareReuse this content"

You could even unearth a long-buried conspiracy, and find your discoveries adorning the pages of the next Dan Brown novel.For the first time in its history, the National Gallery inLondonis offering an overnight stay to the lucky person who wins its new prize draw, which has been launched before its public reopening next month.Marking the gallery’s 200th anniversary, the competition will select the first member of the public to enter the gallery’s Sainsbury Wing after its two-year closure and experience the biggest rehang of the entire collection, entitled CC Land: The Wonder ofArt.Anyone over 18 who subscribes to the National Gallery’s newsletter will be entered into the draw to sleep in the bed, which will be on the “bridge” that connects the Sainsbury Wing with the rest of the gallery. The competition is open until 6pm on 28 April, and the winner will be randomly selected.According to the gallery, the evening will start with a dinner for two at its soon-to-be-opened restaurant, Locatelli; then, once the gallery’s doors are closed to the public, the winner will receive their own private tour of the exhibition with Christine Riding, National Gallery director of collections and research.As they make their way through the gallery, they will see more than 1,000 works of art, which trace the development of painting in the western European tradition between the 13th and 20th centuries, from familiar masterpieces to paintings that have never been seen in the National Gallery.“This is the first time that we have had such an exciting opportunity to rethink, and refresh, how we present one of the greatest art collections in the world, under one roof,” Riding said. “Our visitors will discover anew some of the most famous and iconic works of art ever created, alongside personal favourites and recent discoveries and acquisitions.”The next morning, the winner will also receive a breakfast hamper before having the gallery to themselves to explore before the first public opening of the Sainsbury Wing at 10am on 10 May.The National Gallery’s rehang is its most extensive in years. The gallery’s 200th anniversary celebrations this year also include the opening of a supporters’ house, for members and other supporters, and a learning centre.The National Gallery is no stranger to overnight events. In January, itopened its doors for 24 hours for the final weekendof its sellout Van Gogh exhibition, which was visited by more than 200,000 people. It was the second time in its history the gallery stayed open overnight (the first being for Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan in 2012).Sir Gabriele Finaldi, the director of the National Gallery, said: “Our bicentenary provides the perfect opportunity to consider a new way to tell the story of the incredible paintings in our collection, and include some exciting surprises.“So we feel it is fitting that through this prize draw one of our visitors should receive a first look at the newly transformed National Gallery and Sainsbury Wing and have these wonderful pictures to themselves for one special night.”Explore more on these topicsNational GalleryArtLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

With its sisyphean vibe and implacable mood, it also owes a fair bit to the Dark Souls video games; though it’s not a masterpiece on that level, it nevertheless has a grim self-conviction that grips despite its low-budget limitations.Paladin Bhodie (Jeremy Ninaber) – who apparently asked the barber for the Gondor bob and beard trim – agrees to enter a cursed realm to rescue red-haired maiden Avalon (Kristen Kaster), who is central to a humanity-saving prophecy. Needing to collect three magic stones to open up an exit portal, he makes a pact with the Keeper demon (Shane Nicely) for a magic talisman that can resurrect him enough times to beat the stones’ guardians. It turns out Avalon – no slouch with the steel herself – has made the same arrangement, only to die multiple deaths at the hands of the first adversaries: a pair of bloodthirsty witches.So this is Groundhog Day by way of Gary Gygax. Though writer-director Matthew Ninaber does produce a few sparks of drollness as the pair fathom how to vanquish the harpies, he mostly dungeon-masters this quest with unwavering seriousness. Everyone cleaves to fervent line-readings from the Drax the Destroyer irony-free acting school, and there is much smiting, flaying, lopping of limbs, and even a demonic waterboarding. Ninaber goes all-in on this Larp love-in, conjuring up ye olde vaporous dungeons and root-wracked towers on presumably little means.Though undeniably atmospheric, it does wade into the Swamp of Turgidity as Bhodie and Avalon slog through the trials – as well as some undisciplined acting riper than an orc’s codpiece. But Avalon’s misandry and nihilism come increasingly to the fore; offering emotional themes that rise above generic fantasy antics and which benefit from Ninaber’s straight-faced treatment. The man knows his way around the fantasy genre and, given a bigger budget, could unearth bigger treasures.A Knight’s War is on digital platforms, DVD and Blu-ray from 14 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsCanadaAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Can he get his boys to where they need to be to deliver a memorable upset? It’s a fairly classic sporting comedy premise, though probably the first time it plays out in an Irish setting. That setting is one of the better things about an otherwise somewhat lacklustre film: the location footage feels authentic and lived-in, in a way the plot doesn’t, though said plot might matter less if the characters were given a bit more room to charm and entertain.Perhaps this is one of those films where you have to be in on the original joke to enjoy it.Based on the football mockumentary series Fran, which ran for a couple of years from 2009 in Ireland, this expanded version doesn’t feel like essential viewing, but presumably diehard fans of the series will be keen to see more of the character. It doesn’t seem all that likely to cross over to a broader crowd, however, with wildly variable and sometimes rather flat acting doing little to welcome newer audiences to the fold. There is also a fairly ropey plot about Interpol investigating match fixing against the backdrop of preparations for a David v Goliath football match which does not exactly prove suspenseful.The mockumentary format is a mixed blessing: it offers a useful storytelling shortcut whereby characters can explain their motivations to camera in talking heads sequences, potentially offering a fun contrast with their candid actions or reactions, but unlike classics of the genre such as Parks and Recreation or The Office, there’s not enough comic tension between how characters present when they’re trying to craft their own narrative and when they are less conscious of the camera. There are also moments that strain credibility such as the camera crew’s continued permission to film, but then that is something that almost always happens in mock docs. A willing suspension of disbelief never really kicks in here – perhaps due to a shortage of good gags, leaving the actors at sea. One for Fran’s fans only.Fran the Man is in Irish and Northern Irish cinemas from 11 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsIrelandTelevisionComedyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Much of that was the legacy of Kathleen Ferrier’s inimitable recording of Das Leid’s final song, Der Abschied (The Farewell) under Bruno Walter before her early death in 1953. But then came the Mahler renaissance of the 1960s and performances of The Song of the Earth – in effect a six-movement song symphony for tenor and alto – became part of the new and much more varied Mahlerian picture.Renewed interest in chamber reductions of Mahler has been part of this change. Iain Farrington’s version of Das Lied for theAurora Orchestrais the latest example, and formed the centrepiece of this spring-themed concert under Nicholas Collon. As with Arnold Schoenberg’s 20th-century version, completed by Rainer Riehn, the reduction is abrupt, with just a handful of solo strings and winds in place of a full orchestra. But most of the detail is still there, allowing the winds to be heard with particular clarity, and, under Collon’s fluent and vigorous direction, it still packs a true Mahlerian punch.Sometimes indeed, in the confined spaces of the Kings Place hall, the pummelling felt too fierce. Few tenors can expect much mercy from the conductor in Mahler’s explosive first song, and Andrew Staples duly did his best to be heard, but the words were close to being lost in the mezzo’s fourth song, Von der Schönheit (Of Beauty) too. Fleur Barron is a rich voiced mezzo, projecting the darker music of Der Abschied with noble effect, but it was a good idea to know the texts already in order to distinguish important passages.Before the interval, Collon offered two characteristically interesting springtime contrasts. Lili Boulanger’s 1917 miniature, D’un Matin de Printemps, pulsed gently and delicately, while Jean-Féry Rebel’s Les Élémens of 1737 struck sparks. The Rebel was an opportunity to celebrate one of the French baroque’s most daring pieces of harmonic experimentation, with its grinding lower strings, its daring Berlioz-level orchestral harmonies and its joyful birdsong, energetically delivered by the Aurora’s percussionists.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicGustav MahlerAurora OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

In 1980, or thereabouts,Paul Austertwice answered the phone, only to hear a voice ask: “Is this the Pinkerton Agency?” (Pinkerton is a legendary American detective bureau.) He told the caller they had a wrong number, yet he was soon filled with regret. Here, surely, was a story: why hadn’t he asked any questions? But never mind. While a third call never arrived, in its place came inspiration. Out of the disappointing silence, Auster spun the first volume of his trilogy,City of Glass, a literary hall of mirrors that made him famous.City of Glasswas published in 1985. Nine years later, under the brilliant eye of Art Spiegelman, the author ofMaus, Paul Karasik and David Mazzucchelli created agraphic adaptionof the book, produced with Auster’s approval, and it was widely acclaimed as a work of art in its right. Only now, however, is the cartoon form of the trilogy at last complete.Ghosts, the second volume, has been drawn byLorenzo Mattotti, an Eisner award-winning Italian comics artist whose work has appeared in theNew YorkerandLe Monde, whileThe Locked Roomis again the work ofKarasik, a celebrated figure in comics (he began his career atRaw, the magazine run by Spiegelman and his wife, Françoise Mouly). Both were overseen by Auster before his death in April last year, at the age of 77.The New York Trilogyfamously upends the traditional mechanisms of the detective story – its many influences include Raymond Chandler – with all manner of postmodern tricks. In the first of these adaptations, Quinn, a writer of detective fiction, is drawn into a real-life mystery. In the second, a private eye called Blue descends into madness, fatally flummoxed by the case on which he’s working. In the third, another writer – he may or may not be Auster – is creatively blocked, a situation he’ll perhaps fix by solving the disappearance of his childhood friend, Fanshawe. Their creators, in other words, have stuck pretty close to the source material.View image in fullscreenPages from Paul Auster’s The New York Trilogy.But crikey, something alchemical has happened here too. I don’t know if it’s acceptable to admit that I would rather read this version of the trilogy than the original novels, but there it is: in my eyes, this is a stone-cold masterpiece, an instant classic that will be read for decades to come. Sketched in black and white, these books have a concise, noirish, cinematic feel, even as they’re hugely inventive, playing their own games when it comes to pace and scale: Quinn, who loves to walk, appears as a giant on a map of Manhattan; the unnamed narrator of the third book appears in miniature, sitting inside a suitcase that contains a Fanshawe archive.Their depictions of writing, whether by typewriter or pen, are intensely satisfying (inThe Locked Room, a drop of ink seems to contain a warped human face). Somehow, they go further than words, metaphorical labyrinths transformed into human brains, internal monologues wittily depicted as other activities (thinking is represented as digging a hole). Above all, the frames of a comic lend themselves so perfectly to Auster’s city setting and his stories’ themes of chance and loneliness. They bring irresistibly to mind doors and windows; a sense of what lurks unseen beyond apartment landings. Push against them, dear reader, and who knows what you’ll find.Paul Auster’s The New York Trilogy, illustrated by Paul Karasik, Lorenzo Mattotti and David Mazzucchelli, is published by Faber (£20).

Narrated with the twists and turns of a detective story,Children of Radiumis a family memoir that records the mazy path by which the prize-winning Welsh novelist discovered just how little he knew of his German Jewish heritage. His journey begins with “a foot-high block of A4”: a 2,000-page unpublished memoir by his great-grandfather, Siegfried, a Jewish scientist who worked at a secret chemical weapons laboratory near Berlin before he and his family left for Turkey – not the panicky flit Dunthorne imagined, but a relocation bankrolled by employers with plans for what he could yet do.Hunches, tip-offs, false trails and dead ends abound in Dunthorne’s quest to determine how much Siegfried knew – and when – about his work’s murderous potential after he was reassigned in 1928 from toothpaste manufacture by his firm, a specialist in radioactive products. Siegfried’s memoir is circumspect, and the hunt for answers isn’t straightforward: not only was the site of Siegfried’s lab heavily bombed, but Dunthorne’s mum also chucked his papers into the recycling while clearing out her late mother’s flat.An eye for that kind of comedy, honed in Dunthorne’s novels – the best known isSubmarine(2008),filmed by Richard Ayoade– brightens a quixotic voyage into the heart of 20th-century darkness. The trail leads through libraries, museums and medical records, but also less obviously writer-friendly locales: in Germany, he wriggles belly-first into a fenced-off radioactive site in a clandestine hunt for soil to test for gas traces; and in Turkey, Dunthorne blags his way through military checkpoints in the company of a formerly jailed member of the Kurdistan Workers’ party, having learned that one of the letters he has from Siegfried might hold evidence of culpability for a massacre in an eastern mountain town prior to the second world war.His mother wonders if Dunthorne should be writing instead about her great aunt – Siegfried’s sister – who bravely oversaw a Munich children’s home, caring for Jewish refugees amid rising persecutionDunthorne’s voice – affable, warm, wry – casts a spell right from the book’s dedication (“This book is for – and, arguably, by – my mother”), making light work of tricky ground as he weaves fact and guesswork, reading and testimony. Despite everything, humour is never far away. When, in Germany, he suddenly feels the need to apologise to an elderly interviewee for Siegfried’s work with chemical weapons, the man demurs and instead apologises on behalf of all Germans to Dunthorne, a descendant of expatriated Jews; at which point the author apologises for putting him in the position where he felt he needed to apologise. It takes a special writer to generate embarrassment comedy from this material, but you come to feel that Dunthorne is probably the kind of author who is witty in his sleep: the Nazis didn’t deploy poison gas on the battlefield, he says, because Hitler personally vetoed its use, “creat[ing] the uneasy situation in which my great-grandfather’s work might have been far more lethal without an intervention from Hitler”, a line that manages to be heartfelt as well as undeniably comic.As discoveries and ambiguities mount, the book plays out as a tangled investigation of complicity, courage and cowardice, ceaselessly yo-yoing between potential indictment and mitigation. Dunthorne’s instinctively jokey tone doesn’t minimise the ever-present horror, yet he recognises, too, that the darkest aspects of his story are tricky to separate from the frisson of proximity, the fundamental thrill of the chase (one chapter ends: “The real revelation came, several weeks later, via email...”). We catch his perverse sense of disappointment when his hard-won soil sample contains traces of everythingbutgas from Siegfried’s lab. There’s steady intrigue, also, in the unmistakable resonance of Dunthorne’s decision to embark on an all-consuming pan-continental research quest while slap-bang in the middle of early fatherhood. It’s also a kind of stealth post-Brexit narrative, as Dunthorne obtains German citizenship – an ambivalent reintegration by which the convenience of an EU passport is weighed alongside “formal reconciliation with the country which had tried to systematically eliminate [his mother’s] forebears”.Dunthorne recently told theGuardianhow much he admired Laurent Binet’s tricksy 2010 novelHHhH, a book that conspicuously shows its own working as it unreliably imagines its way into the Nazi era, and you can feel its imprint here.Children of Radiumput me in mind, too, of Richard Flanagan’sQuestion 7, another genealogical retracing that turns into a meditation on guilt, atrocity and unforeseen consequence. Dunthorne’s tome is a humbler enterprise, keenly aware that the writerly ego can be led astray by an impulse to join the dots: witness the belated recognition that his focus might after all be entirely in the wrong place, thanks to a splendidly deflating comment from his mother, who wonders if Dunthorne should be writing instead about her great aunt – Siegfried’s sister – who bravely oversaw a Munich children’s home, caring for Jewish refugees amid rising persecution.By necessity,Children of Radiumis piecemeal, inconclusive, full of pregnant silences, maybes and what ifs. Near the end, Dunthorne and his mother soak up memories in north London, where Siegfried spent his last days in a care home, regularly greeting his granddaughter and her boyfriend – the author’s dad – with a meal of ox tongue. “It speaks to a paucity of other research materials that I thought it worthwhile to cook an ox tongue,” Dunthorne tells us. He didn’t know what to expect, and was alarmed when the length of flesh seemed to revive in the pan, “writhing and flexing”, refusing to stay put when prodded with a spoon, “lifting the lid off the pot”. A metaphor, you can’t help think, but it befits the procedures and conclusions of this slippery marvel that we can’t quite say for what.Children of Radium: A Buried Inheritanceby Joe Dunthorne is published by Hamish Hamilton (£16.99).

It’s speaks to me in a way very few songs do. The pleasure of playing with them is hard to describe.The song I do at karaokeThe last song I did at karaoke was Zero bySmashing Pumpkins. I thought it would be funny to sing my own song, but the longer it went, the more I performed it like I was on stage in front of 50,000 people, and the less people thought it was funny.The song I can no longer listen toMy father was a musician, so I was steeped in music and had very strong musical opinions as a child. Baby I’m-A Want You by Bread reminds me of being stuck in the backseat of a car in the 70s, hating yacht rock and wanting to murder everyone, because I wanted to listen to Queen and Elton John instead.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toI’m not a lyric person. My wife freaks me out because she knows every lyric. I sit there with mystification while she sings along to Stay With Me by the Faces and Tiny Dancer by Elton John. Now my daughter has the same gift: she’ll sing along to every song too.The best song to play at a partyI don’t really go to parties. If I do, I’m usually horrified by what they play. My father played in dance bands in the 80s, so he’d play things like Celebration by Kool & the Gang and ended up hating them. I must have inherited the same hatred.The song I secretly likeWhen I hear Roar by Katy Perry at the grocery store, I think: “That’s a good song.” We were at a party and Katy and her husband mistook my wife for a nanny, because she was watching after all the children, and they were fishing around for a nanny.The best song to have sex toWe don’t have sex in the goth world.

As we approached the end of our walk in the Maiella national park, we stopped beside the remains of a second world war prison camp, deep in the park’s corn-coloured hills, and Lisa, our guide, told us a story as dramatic as the simmering sky. In 1943, a band of prisoners, including New Zealand corporal John Broad, fled the camp and spent seven bitter winter months hiding out in caves before eventually making it across British lines. That they survived was thanks to the kindness and bravery of local families, who risked their own safety, and hunger, to help them stay alive and avoid German patrols.Lisa told us that Broad later described the impoverished Abruzzesi as the country’s true gold, and the sun suddenly sliced through the cloud as though in divine agreement, painting the mountains opposite a shimmering bronze. Digesting both the story and the scenery, our small group of 12 were quietly contemplative as we picked our way back down the hillside toDimore Montane, the campground we were staying at. The advancing evening turned the sky from lemon to peach to vivid negroni as we skittered down cobbled paths between pines, crossed sun-baked meadows rippled with lilac thistles, and strode past ancienttholoi, the sculptural stone shelters built by local shepherds.View image in fullscreenAt the campground, the deckchairs in the shady woodland relaxation area were all taken, so we climbed up to the reception’s roof terrace and sat sipping bittersweetchinottosas we watched the sun make its final descent over the hills we’d just hiked.In a secluded forest setting, Dimore Montane was built by the Italian state in the 1990s, but never opened beyond a fleeting attempt in 2006. During the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the current managers, Simone, came across the camp by chance and discovered that bids to run the site were being invited; a community of Tibetan monks had previously shown interest, but it was felt this public facility shouldn’t be turned into a private space. Simone and his partner Lisa, our walking guide, had previously run a tour company, but they knew it was too big a project to manage themselves, so they invited their friends Fabio and Manuela, who had backgrounds in procurement and communications, to join them. Together, they won the bid and started what would become a vast lockdown project and a giant feat of upcycling.View image in fullscreenThe town of Caramanico Terme – the starting point for walks and mountain bike routes.Photograph: Adwo/AlamyOpening Dimore Montane in 2021, after a year of renovation, the two couples combined their various skills to impressive effect. Today, when not carrying out their respective management tasks, they serve in the restaurant, lead guests on guided walks, and even create the mixed-media artwork that decorates the main building’s restful white walls.They cleverly cater to a far wider clientele than most campgrounds. Surrounded by beech and chestnut trees, there are simple tent and campervan pitches, and bell tents for those who want to camp in a bit more style or don’t have their own kit. For those looking for more privacy and comfort, there are simple dorm rooms with shared bathrooms and a handful of en suite, hotel-style rooms. And dogs are welcome.A restaurant provides food and wines sophisticated enough to draw non-guests out for dinner in the woodsUnlike most campsites, the kitchen also serves a wide clientele. Campers can cook on outdoor grills and buy basic coffee-and-pastry breakfasts from a little van, while hotel-style guests get access to a wider breakfast buffet, and a restaurant provides food and wines sophisticated enough to draw non-guests out for dinner in the woods.Much to our camping-mad sons’ initial disappointment, we had booked two connecting bedrooms in the main building and, to our own delight, found them decorated like a designer hostel, with plump mattresses, white bed linen, bright cushions, funky wooden artwork and lights suspended from twigs. A winning mix of restful simplicity and indulgent comfort, it made an ideal base camp for a few days’ adventuring in the Maiella.View image in fullscreenDimore Montane offers accommodation from canvas to en suite roomsThe easy access to nature was what had drawn us. A wild massif, the Maiella sits right in the centre of Italy, about an hour’s drive south of Pescara. Not as well known, or as busy, as Abruzzo’s other national parks – Abruzzo and Gran Sasso – the Maiella is speckled with caves, gorges and grottos. Once, these were hideouts for bandits, but today they are largely home to the wolves, chamois, otters and other creatures that thrive in its peaks and plains. Stippled with wildflowers in May and June, and laced with terracotta-roofed villages and remote hermitages, the Maiella is also home to a network of well-marked hiking paths and mountain bike trails.Starting on the doorstep, we had joined Lisa for the guided walk before dinner on our first evening. Heading up into the national park along paths hemmed by blackberries and wild mint, we’d listened as she brought the rugged, semi-arid landscape around us to life. As we sniffed wild oregano and verbena, at Lisa’s suggestion, and kept our eyes peeled, unsuccessfully, for the 50 or so Marsican brown bears that live within the park, our boys were gripped by descriptions of the area being like the Bahamas 140m years ago (and the proof, on Lisa’s phone: a picture of a fossilised shark’s tooth she’d found along the same path the previous week).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We sat beside Lycra-clad road bikers to eat post-hike paninis at Rifugio Bruno Pomilio, below walls decorated with vintage skis. AtAi Quattro Sentieritrattoria outside Roccamorice, we ate bowls of ragu-swirledchitarra, Abruzzo’s famous square-cut pasta, andpesche dolcicakes – confections of sugar, custard and cake masquerading as peaches. We walked out, past a symphony of goat‑bell glockenspiels, to find the tiny chapel of San Bartolomeo teetering on the ledge of a remote cave, before sheltering deeper in the forest in the cool stone cloisters of the grander Santo Spirito hermitage.View image in fullscreenThe author’s family in the Maiella national park.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenThe highlight of our stay, however, was a hike along the Orfento valley gorge, starting in Caramanico Terme. This area is now a state nature reserve within the national park, its biodiversity so treasured there is even a dedicated forest police force who patrol its paths. We chose a five-mile loop from among the various trails that lead into the valley from the town’s visitor centre. After an hour or so of steep climbing up a scrubby hillside in sticky mid-afternoon heat, we followed the trail down into the forest and came out at a series of river pools, cascades of water tumbling into lagoons of pale turquoise. Stopping to rest, we needed all our willpower not to jump in, nor even dip a hot toe in that cool luminous blue. Instead, we sat on a rock by the water, watching an adonis blue butterfly flit through shafts of leaf-dappled sunshine.Back at Dimore Montane that evening, we booked a table at the campground’s restaurant and sat out on the terrace, beneath strings of lights. Surrounded by a gentle crescendo of giggling children, unwinding parents and clattering cutlery, we feasted onarrosticini, salty little nuggets of mutton threaded on to skewers and grilled over charcoal until they’re all crisply burnished on the outside and mallowy tender inside. As Fabio brought us desserts of saffron semifreddo and slices of watermelon, I told him how impressed we were with the food. And that, like the accommodation, the menu seems to tread an adept line between offering a sense of holiday indulgence and keeping pricing accessible.“This is still camping, and the food has to be appropriate to that audience, but we want to make it as good as it can be, and as reflective of Abruzzo,” he said. The stakes may not be as high these days, but John Broad would surely be pleased to know that the spirit of hospitality lives on here, and that there’s still human gold in the Maiella hills.Dimore Montane openson17 April(dimoremontane.com).

The beetroot will still have a little bite after 30 minutes in the oven, so if you prefer it completely soft, cut it into smaller chunks or use precooked instead.Spiced roast sweet potato and beetroot with chickpeas and fetaThis easy weeknight dish is even nicer the next day, so it’s worth making the full amount even if you’re cooking for fewer people.Prep15 minCook40 minServes2-32tbsp olive oil3 generoustsp baharat1tsp sea salt flakes3garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated600g sweet potato, cut into 1½cm-thick half-moons (and quartered if the potatoes are very large)450g fresh beetroot, peeled and cut into 1½cm wedges400g tin chickpeas, drained and rinsed1 red onion, peeled and very finely sliced1 lemon, juiced½tsp sea salt200g feta, roughly crumbled25g fresh coriander, roughly choppedGreek yoghurt, to serveHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Tip the olive oil, baharat, salt, garlic, sweet potato, beetroot and chickpeas into a roasting tin large enough comfortably to hold all the vegetables in one layer. Mix well to coat – the chickpeas will fall under the veg, which is fine – then roast for 30 minutes.Blanch the red onion in a bowl of boiling water for a minute, then drain well. Mix in the lemon juice and sea salt, then leave to pickle for 20 minutes.Once the vegetables are out of the oven, dress them with the pickled onion/lemon mix, then taste and adjust the salt as needed. Scatter the feta and coriander over the top, and serve with some yoghurt alongside.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyVegetablesCheeseVegetarian food and drinkMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Well, a week or so ago, I lived this joke when I reached for a dishcloth that was, rather oddly, sitting on a plate, and for a nanosecond I thought that things really had reached a low for the cloth to be not just grubby, but slimy. That was before I realised I was about to pick up an aubergine and future baba ganoush.Other things occurred that evening, too, and in the end the aubergine was put in Tupperware with some peeled cloves of garlic and a squeeze of lemon (which I hoped might preserve it), and the box put in the fridge. It should not be a confession for a food writer whose job is to be resourceful, but I am going to admit it anyway: every time I put sealed Tupperware in the fridge, I wonder if it will get out in time. Quite often, it doesn’t, which also confirms a friend’s observation that putting Tupperware in the fridge is the equivalent of telling someone you will call them back, then forgetting. Happily, this box did come out in time (the very next day, in fact), and the contents – which still looked like a dishcloth, but a welcome one – had almost become baba ganoush.It was lunchtime, and we had a packet of gnocchi to eat up. That was the reason I heated everything up, mashed the fillets of aubergine with a fork, took out the peeled garlic, minced it and mixed it in with red chilli flakes and a bit more lemon juice, then tossed the lot through cooked gnocchi. We enjoyed the almost velvet-like dishcloth cream so much that I made something similar a few days later, only this time cooking cubed aubergine in a frying pan. I have also roasted it, and I am hoping someone will give me notes about air-frying some, too. However you cook the aubergine, though, remember that the aim is a soft, beige cream, and to add chilli, garlic and lemon to taste, while keeping in mind that it will be mixed with gnocchi (shop-bought or homemade) or pasta (fusilli,mafalde, ridged tubes).I suggest topping this with grated salted ricotta because it goes so well with aubergine – plus I’m thinking of pasta alla Norma and other Sicilian dishes. That said, parmesan, pecorino, grana padano or a spoonful of ordinary ricotta (in which case, add a bit of lemon zest, too) will work just as well, along with more chilli flakes or a few turns of black pepper.Gnocchi or pasta with aubergine, red chilli, lemon and salted ricottaServes41 large or 2 medium aubergines4-6 tbspextra-virgin olive oilSaltDried red chilli flakes1-2garlic cloves, peeled and mincedA squeeze of lemon juiceSalted ricotta, or parmesan or pecorino, grated, to serve400-500ggnocchi or pasta(fusilli, mafalde, ridged tubes)Use a potato peeler to pare strips off the aubergine, so it looks like a zebra crossing. Cut the aubergine into 2cm chunks, put them in a bowl and toss with olive oil and a good pinch of salt.You now have two choices. The first is to fry the aubergine cubes in a large frying pan over a medium-low heat, moving them around regularly, until they start softening. Then add a dash of water and cover so they half-fry/half-braise, until very soft. Add a generous pinch of chilli flakes, the garlic, a squeeze of lemon juice and a bit more oil and salt, if you think it needs it. Cook for a minute more, so it is creamy not watery.The other way is to spread the aubergine cubes on a baking tray and bake at 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½ for 20-30 minutes, turning halfway, until soft and just a little golden (you don’t want them to be crisp). Tip the cubes into a frying pan, mash gently and, as before, add a generous pinch of chilli flakes, the garlic, a squeeze of lemon and a bit more olive oil and salt if you think it needs it. Cook for a minute more, so the mix is creamy and not watery.Meanwhile, cook the gnocchi or pasta in plenty of fast-boiling salted water untilal dente, then drain or lift directly into the aubergine pan. Toss well, then divide between plates and serve topped with grated cheese and more chilli flakes or black pepper.Explore more on these topicsPastaA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkFoodMain courseVegetablesCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"
