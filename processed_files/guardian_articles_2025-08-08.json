Jones and Julie Delpy tell allZoe WilliamsFri 8 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareHostage is a political thriller, and observes the conventions in many ways. The pace is absolutely flawless, it’s twisty, it has emotional heft. The British prime minister, Abigail Dalton, played bySuranne Jones, faces her husband, Alex Anderson (Ashley Thomas), being kidnapped. Their marriage is well drawn – “it’s happy, it’s assured, they’re supportive of each other,” Jones says. As we chat in Netflix’s central London offices, she’s always saying five things at once, only one of them out loud. Here, the subtext (I’ve decided) is: it’s actually pretty skilled work, creating a not-schmaltzy, passionate but familiar love match in which all the audience’s hopes and prayers are with the abducted spouse. That’s why normally when fictional politicians are the victims of a family kidnapping, it’s one of their kids.Meanwhile, the French president, Julie Delpy’s Vivienne Toussaint, is also in Britain, is also being blackmailed, and has her own dilemmas: principally, does she go over to the dark side, by echoing the far right on anti-immigrant narratives, or stick to her principles, whatever those may still be.Delpyis hilarious on this, and actually most things. “That’s something I found interesting in the show. Sometimes I wonder, I truly wonder, is there any politician who really has a conscience? I look at Macron – I cannot believe someone with a conscience wouldn’t be questioning themselves, questioning who they have picked [as a cabinet], questioning what’s going on with French politics.” “Youreallywonder whetheranypolitician has a conscience?” I ask, just to be clear. “Well, yes.”View image in fullscreenJulie Delpy as Vivienne Toussaint, the French president in Hostage.Photograph: Kevin Baker/NetflixHostage came about through a lot of to-and-fro betweenMatt Charman, the writer and creator, andSuranne Jones– the pair shared an agent 10 years ago and always got on. He’s most famous forBridge of Spies, which Steven Spielberg directed and the Coen brothers co-wrote, in 2015. “Every time I watch Suranne,” he says, “I’m aware of how relatable and human she is. I thought: ‘OK, if she were prime minister, maybe I would feel differently about political drama. What if we bought ourselves goodwill with someone like Suranne, that would allow an audience just for a second to say: ‘Hang on a minute. Let me hear her out’?”As much as Charman is a storyteller, enamoured of the thriller form, he also has this surprising sense of civic purpose, of using the show to suggest that maybe if we thought of politicians as fully human, they might turn out to be, well, at least human-adjacent. “Someone used the phrase ‘sophisticated protein’, and it’s one of those American phrases that makes you wince, but truthfully it’s quite an interesting formulation. People might enjoy the propulsiveness of the thriller, but they want the values of the lead character to be about something and their backstory to be meaningful.”The result is quite unusual, in so far as – unlike all political thrillers – it doesn’t remind you of any other. It’s a little biting but it’s not House of Cards cynical, it has a breakneck pace but it’s not 24, the dialogue is sharp but never played for laughs. Jones is relatable, patriotic, trying her best, absolutely in love with her kidnapped husband, an almost nostalgic portrait of an idealised prime minister from more innocent times. Delpy is far more worldly, far more compromised, both a better fit for the turbulence of modernity and more likely to be capsized by it. The whole dynamic marches in an interesting syncopation with the real-life politics that unfolded as they shot it, in which the far-right pressures on the European political landscape have become much more pronounced, and through that lens you could squint at it and see it almost as documentary drama. Then there’ll be a giant explosion outside Downing Street or a kidnapper in an eerie mask, and you’re back in the world of the blockbuster summer thriller.“The hardest thing about writing something that’s in dialogue with where we are now,” Charman says, “is that every time something happens in real politics,mainlyyou’re thinking: ‘What does this mean for my kids, is the world OK?’ But on a low level, you’re thinking: ‘Does this mean my drama is going to be out of date when it comes out?’”“I thought it was very clear as a story,” Delpy says. “To me it seemed very accessible, and actually quite entertaining.” She’s a breath of fresh air, talking about her work, never breathy, always surprisingly impartial, like a mother saying about her children: “Yes, the middle one’s quite intelligent, but the youngest, not so much.” She’ll never buy into the idea that politicians are inherently interesting – “at least in France, I’ve never really been amazed by any of them” – and thinks, in some ways, drama is miles from the reality of politics, by definition, because real life has lost the plot.“The way politics works now, is that they bombard you with outrageous things, so that you forget what happened yesterday,” she says. “It’s almost impossible to stand against anything. It’s a very difficult time.” Yet one central theme, the demonisation of migrants for political capital, dominates her character’s arc. “She starts off as someone who isn’t flirting with the extreme right, and she slowly starts to go there – which is something you see happening a little bit to everyone in the centre; they’re not necessarily ideologically far right, but they’re feeling they have to flirt with it, to comply with the perceived demands of the electorate. They think it’s better if we slide to the right to stay in power, rather than having the far right in power. I think they really do believe that, you know.”View image in fullscreenTough at the top …  Deply and Jones in HostagePhotograph: Des Willie/NetflixDrama is making its own, more subtle compromises with the new right, which is to avoid “not just leftwing projects but anything that has any views on social issues at all. Unless it’s pure entertainment with no political consciousness whatsoever, unless it’s The Troll 5, it’s hard to get it made,” Delpy says. “I made a film recently called Meet the Barbarians, it’s about refugees. And it was really hard to find funding for it. And it’s a comedy, it’s really entertaining. Hostage also was not the easiest thing on the planet. Of course they had Netflix, and once you have that all is well, but every project has its hurdle.”Suranne Jones is also an executive producer on Hostage. “I was born with a clipboard,” she says, “literally, came out of my mum’s womb, ticking things off on my to-do list. I have no interest in directing, no interest in telling other actors what to do or my vision. But finding new talent, putting teams together, the writers’ room process, the imagining of what a show could look like, the aftermath – I love all that.” It made her very unprecious about the edit. “I really felt I needed to put the human into the prime minister, constantly. And, actually, we probably edited a lot of that out.”Hostage is plainly female-led, in the sense that the leads are women, as are the two directors – Isabelle Sieb and Amy Neil – but that doesn’t feel like a laboured or radical act. You don’t get the sense that these fictional female leaders have brought an emotional range that men couldn’t possibly have, nor that you’re in an idealised near-future where electorates have finally woken up to the fact that women can be in charge. “In the US, they have this very negative view of women in politics, but it’s not like that in Europe,” Delpy says simply.View image in fullscreenCaptive audience … Ashley Thomas (right) in Hostage.Photograph: Ollie Upton/NetflixIf anything, Hostage makes a subtler gender point, that the differences within the sexes are greater than any between them. “Suranne and Julie present such a different view of what a powerful female leader is,” Charman says. “Julie’s got this incredible directing career, an amazing track record in French and American cinema. And there are not many people who burn as brightly on screen as Suranne. I thought: ‘what would it look like for them to go toe to toe?’”A lot of people have called Hostage the newBodyguard, partly because it’s so satisfying as drama – the way it races, the way it pays off, the way you don’t feel as if you’re being played, even though someone’s always in charge of your emotions and it’s definitely not you. Yet you wouldn’t call it escapist, when so many moments and gestures in it clarify rather than distract from the chaos and impossible choices of the world we’re in. Or, at least, the world we’re in today. Julie Delpy says: “One friend of mine, who survived the second world war, said: ‘Things can always get worse. You think you’re in the worst situation but, unfortunately, there’s always worse than what you think is the worst.’” Against her sardonic pessimism, Charman can sometimes sound almost innocent. “If you can pull the humanity through the thriller all the way to the end, then hopefully you’ve got the journey that you always wanted to go on,” he says, winningly. After all, thrillers needsomeinnocence.Hostage is on Netflix on21 August.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSuranne JonesJulie DelpyDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I suggest a swim in one of its riversMarina HydeThe VP of a thousand holidays has done Disneyland and skiing in Vermont. Now it’s time to skive off among the worst people Britain has to offerFri 8 Aug 2025 08.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 13.07 EDTShareIdon’t have access to the employment contract, but find myself increasingly intrigued by a question: how many days annual leave does a vice-president of the United States get? In the past five months alone, JD Vance has been on a skiing holiday, then a family trip to Disneyland, then a kayaking jaunt in Ohio – and now, he’s about to pitch up for an extendedsummer stay in the Cotswolds. More on all those in a bit. But let’s face it: if Vance were a politician in this country, he’d have been fitted with an unflattering holiday-related nickname months ago, and no one would take him remotely seriously.Still, time for another well-earned rest for Vacay Vance/the right honourable member for the Sun Lounger. And something of a break in tradition with recent times, in which he has preferred to holiday in national parks where the Trump administration has cut half the jobs, perhaps reasoning that if his security can successfully upend the infrastructure to assist his recreation during his stay, then those jobs were never really essential anyway. Only last weekend, the VP and family were holidaying near Caesar Creek Lake in Ohio, where his Secret Service team had the army corps of engineerschange the outflow of a lake. Depending on who you believe, this was either to “support safe navigation” of his huge, heavy-boated security detail, or to create “ideal kayaking conditions” for Vance, who was certainly pictured in a canoe over the period. Listen, sometimes JD just wants a lazy river, other times he wants rushing rapids. It’s called public service: look it up.Anyway, he’s just about to kick off a holiday in some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years – namely, Britain. Thanks for being in us, sir! As a point of order, though, over here we wouldn’t dream of allowing a politician to reroute one of our rivers. Instead, we allow the water companies to reroute sewage into them. Feel free to take a kayak out as often as possible during your stay. In fact, we insist on it.As for why Vance has picked the Cotswolds, it’s possibly a smart move to holiday somewhere filled with so many of the absolute worst people in the country. In the modern-era Cotswolds, JD is unlikely to even be the ghastliest person in the village. And he has, unfortunately, been the target of heckling and protest on recent trips. March found him skiing en famille at Sugarbush ski resort in Vermont, forced to run a gauntlet of placard-wielding objectors before reportedly opting to move location. Again: should have gone to Courchevel, where he wouldn’t even make the top 100 of the Most Hideous People on the Chairlift at Any Given Moment poll.View image in fullscreenResidents in Waitsfield, Vermont, protest against JD Vance during the vice-president’s skiing holiday in March 2025.Photograph: Jeff Knight/APThen last month it was Disneyland, against the backdrop of widespread Ice raids on undocumented immigrants across California, where his presence drew a sarcastic welcome from its governor, Gavin Newsom. “Hope you enjoy your family time, @JDVance,” this ran. “The families you’re tearing apart certainly won’t.” Vance responded by posting: “Had a great time, thanks.” A review not wholly borne out from fellow park users’ video footage, which showed the boos and protests continuing even as he trotted towards the Autopia ride and lunched furtively at the Pirates of the Caribbean restaurant.But look, the Vance family’s Cotswolds accommodation promises to be far more agreeable, and is not even made of fibreglass. In fact, according to the Daily Mail, it’s an 18th-century manor house in six sprawling acres of grounds that include a tennis court. Whether they also contain a swimming pool is unclear – as is whether Vance swims in a T-shirt when he’s alone with his family, like he famously does at hotels. Either way, the property has reportedly been crawling with Secret Service agents all week. Amenity-wise, it’s supposedly extremely close to Jeremy Clarkson’s Diddly Squat empire, setting up a potentially compelling episode for the next season of Clarkson’s Farm, should Vance care to call in on a temporary neighbour who recentlydescribed himas a “bearded God-botherer” and “twat” with “no clue about history”.The Vances won’t be tied to that one property, we learn, with a visit to hang out with David Lammy and his family at the foreign secretary’s country residence, Chevening, also planned for this coming weekend. Lammy has made so much of the two men’s shared Christian bond that you’d imagine he might squire the whole gang along to church on Sunday morning. Parts of the local St Botolph’s church date back to the 11th century – not quite as old as the Sleeping Beauty Castle in Anaheim, to be sure, but certainly able to hold its own with the Autopia ride. Also on the agenda, finally, is a trip to London, which Vance recently described as “not English any more”. Well, nor is the US, but that doesn’t seem to put him off.For the lucky British people, meanwhile, the Vance holiday serves as a mere amuse bouche to the main meal – the unprecedented second state visit next month of Donald Trump, who will make landfall on 17 September for a run of dates that convenientlyoccurs during parliamentary recess, thus avoiding the controversial spectacle of the president addressing the house. But if Trump’slast state visitwas anything to go by, it’ll be three days of remorseless rolling news wank about the “pageantry”, intense grandstanding by embarrassing politicians keen to suck up to him/define themselves against him, and 958 talking heads droning cluelessly on about how both sides have “got what they want out of it”. We’ll be positively begging to go back to these low-key days of the Vance vacance, so let’s enjoy them while we can.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJD VanceOpinionUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

The broadcaster and author saw the views ticking up on YouTube; his phone was pinging incessantly. But the realisation that things had become, well, really quite surreal came when an older gentleman approached him at an event in Washington and, in Urdu, said: “I watched you with the 20 crazies.”The man was referring to the British-American commentator’s appearance onSurrounded, a gladiatorial one-v-many debate web series, hosted on YouTube by Jubilee Media. During the debate – billed as “1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives” – Hasan was asked about his “ethnic background”, by a man who the Guardian unmaskedas the organiser of two violent far-right protests. Another debater laughed maniacally to applause while agreeing he was a fascist. He was later sacked and condemned – and then raised $30,000 (£22,300) from supporters on a Christian crowdfunding site. The video has now been viewed more than 10m times.“I saw the massive audience it gets with young people. I thought, well, that’s a good place to be,” says Hasan, who launched Zeteo, his own alternative news platform, last year. “But it’s really cut through in a way even I didn’t imagine – it’s been phenomenal for both good reasons and bad.”Mehdi Hasan: ‘Most people ask the question and move on. I don’t’Read moreHasan’s near two-hour debate – diced, sliced and repackaged for infinite resharing – has propelled Jubilee Media into the mainstream consciousness, sparking conversations about the political and societal impact of new media formats, and plenty of existential angst.Launched in 2017, the rapidly expanding entertainment company has attracted swathes of younger viewers by transforming polarised debate – never in short supply in Trump’s US – into eminently clippable content. The company also produces dating and game shows, but Surrounded – which pits one expert against a greater number of adversaries, who race to a single chair to make their point on a hot political topic – is its most notorious.In recent months Surrounded has gone where few traditional broadcasters would care to tread, with titles including “Flat Earthers vs Scientists: Can We Trust Science?” (31m views), or “Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative? (Feat. Charlie Kirk)” (30m views). Its 2024video with Ben Shapiro– in which a trans man tore into the rightwing pundit in afour-minute rant– was the fifth most-watched election-related content on YouTube.Jubilee’ s 1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives (ft. Mehdi Hasan)Its founder and chief executive, Jason Y Lee, who started Jubilee as a non-profit in 2010 after a video of himbusking for charity went viral, toldVarietythat the company wants “to show what discourse can and should look like”. It could become, he argued, the “Disney for empathy”. But how does its performative pugilism sit with its stated aim to “provoke understanding and create human connection”?Spencer Kornhaber, who writes about popular culture for the Atlantic, believes the idealism is genuine, if shot through with ambition. “Empathy, in the Jubilee context, is standing for voyeurism and curiosity about other human beings,” says Kornhaber. “Lee didn’t say he wants to be the new UN. He wants to be Disney – a for-profit entertainment company that is culturally ubiquitous, will merchandise anything and is known for its ability to spin out franchises.”Jubilee has benefited from the proliferation of free-speech absolutism, as well as the internet’s shift to social and video, says Julia Alexander, a media correspondent for Puck News. But while it may have started with the aim of transforming negative conversations, it has, she claims, “succumbed to the hateful vitriol that defines a lot of social media”. It never stood a chance against the “unspoken but understood currency of the internet”, she adds: namely, that rage-fuelled and fearful content provokes more engagement than empathy or actually listening.“I hope that they choose to focus on creating positive content for the internet, God knows we can use it,” she says. “But I worry, because they are a company that is incentivised to continuously scale and perform better each quarter. They’ll have no choice but to continue doing more of these types of videos and just get more extreme.”Mehdi Hasan on how to beat Donald Trump in a debate - podcastRead moreHasan, who is alsoa Guardian contributor, says he understands viewers’ attraction to the more extreme videos Jubilee has produced. He is the author of Win Every Argument, a book about the art of debating, and argues that traditional media deserted the battlefield, allowing platforms such as YouTube – nowthe No 1 source of televised entertainment in the US– to commandeer the space.“Mainstream media did such a shit job of facilitating debate and discussion and [giving a platform to] people with unorthodox views,” he says. “But I do think it’s a balancing act between the two extremes. Between censorship and narrowing of opinion and no standards at all, no guardrails, just put out anything you like on YouTube as long as it gets clicks.”He also understands – even agrees with – some of the criticism he has faced for going on Surrounded. The writer and disability rights advocate Imani Barbarin argued that while clips of Hasan’s takedown of far-right extremists had been shared by progressives trumpeting his “win”, an equal number had been shared as proof he lost. “We live in a meme-ified culture of politics,” said Barbarin,in a post on X. “Those moments are quite literally being plucked out of space and time […] the surrounding context of that moment no longer matters.”Hasan says if he has regrets, it was that he did not find out more about the people he was facing, arguing that he was not aware such extremists would be among them. But whether he regrets taking part overall? The jury is out.“I stand by what I said. I think I did a fair enough job as a debater,” he says. “The bigger meta question is whether the format itself is a problem. Is there value in doing these debates? And I don’t know the answer to that: maybe ask me in five years.”Explore more on these topicsYouTubeTelevision industryInternetThe far rightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her outburst and appearance – she lost her hair during chemotherapy for breast cancer – boosted apetitionagainst the “Duplomb law” to well over 2m signatures.On Thursday, France’s constitutional courtstruck downthe government’s attempt to reintroduce the pesticide acetamiprid – a neonicotinoid banned in France in 2018 but still used as an insecticide in other EU countries as well as the UK – in a judgment that took everyone by surprise. The ruling said the legislature had undermined “the right to live in a balanced and healthy environment” enshrined in France’s environmental charter.For Breteau, 50, a battle is won but the struggle goes on. “The law is a symptom of a sick system that poisons us. The Duplomb law isn’t the real problem. It’s aggravating an already catastrophic system,” she said.“We are living in a toxic world and need a revolution to break the chain of contamination in everything … If people don’t react we’ll find ourselves in a world where we cannot drink water or eat food that is uncontaminated, where a slice of buttered bread or a cup of tea poisons us. It will be a silent world, without animals, without insects, without birds.“We are accused of politicising cancer, of weaponising the disease. Yes, that is exactly what we’re doing because that is what’s necessary.”View image in fullscreenBreteau on her way to the Gustave Roussy hospital in Villejuif for radiotherapy.Photograph: Julien Daniel/MYOPIn an interview with the Guardian between radiotherapy treatments hours before the court’s decision, Breteau explained the “injustice and anger” she felt on learning that the government planned to reintroduce the pesticide, and how it prompted her to create theCancerColère (Cancer Anger) collective.She was in hospital for treatment for the second bout of cancer in three years when the bill was approved by the national assembly’s upper house, the Sénat.“I was having chemotherapy and it was really hard. I thought this law would never pass, that it would be impossible. When I learned senators had voted for it, I was filled with an intense anger,” Breteau said. “And the more I looked at the figures for cancer cases, the angrier I became.”In March, the national health bodySanté publique Francepublished the latest cancer figures that showed cases had doubled since 1990, while use of tobacco and alcohol, often blamed for the disease, had declined by 25% in the same period. It noted an alarming rise in cancers in children and those aged 15-39. Doctors and researchers responded with an open letter toLe Mondereporting that there was a cancer epidemic.Breteau said: “All the arguments they’ve given us – blaming individuals for habits like smoking and drinking or that the population is ageing – don’t hold water.“We know where there are lots of pesticides used, there are clusters of child cancers, so we can no longer doubt there is a link. Scientists have known this for years, but like the tobacco manufacturers, the agriculture lobbies know how to create doubt. They want us to prove the cancer of this or that person is directly linked to this or that pesticide.”View image in fullscreenBreteau created the Cancer Colère (Cancer Anger) to build opposition to the bill.Photograph: Julien Daniel/MYOPAcetamiprid wipes out “sucking” insects on vegetable, citrus fruit and grape crops. First introduced in the early 1990s, its use is permitted in the UK where it is labelled “highly hazardous”.The potential effect of the neonicotinoid on humans is a source of concern, though the risks remains unclear in the absence of large-scale studies. Research on bees is inconclusive and controversial: it has been argued that acetamiprid is less toxic to the environment and insects than other insecticides. Others claim it is responsible for the collapse of bee colonies.Philippe Grandcolas, a deputy director at the CNRS, France’s national scientific research body, said: “What the studies have shown is that acetamiprid is the ‘least toxic, least harmful’ of the neonicotinoids, but it’s like choosing between the plague and cholera.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Neuder said studies of its potential endocrine-disrupting or neurotoxic properties were ongoing.One of its manufacturers, the Chinese agrochemical firm Shijiazhuang Pomais Technology, has said acetamiprid has “low toxicity to humans and animals … it has low toxicity to fish, has little impact on bees and is highly safe”.Breteau has told French journalists she felt as if she was 90 years old, but she looked surprisingly healthy when the Guardian met her in a community park before she had to head across town to the Gustave Roussy hospital for her last radiotherapy session. The oncology hospital is said to be Europe’s top cancer treatment centre and is ranked as one of the world’s best.View image in fullscreenOn first arrival at the cancer ward, Breteau was shocked to see children and pregnant women needing treatment.Photograph: Julien Daniel/MYOPWearing a crossbody bag high over her chest, Breteau moved it aside to tap where her right breast was.“The first cancer was in the left. This one was in the right. The tumour was abnormal and developing far too quickly, but that was not the problem,” she said. “In August last year I lost one of my best friends to brain cancer that spread and it’s several years now that members of my family and friends have had cancers.”Breteau said that while in hospital she was shocked to come across toddlers, teenagers and pregnant mothers in the cancer wards.“I thought I’d be the youngest. I spoke to my parents, and those of their generation and they told me we didn’t have that at your age. When we were 40, we didn’t have friends who died of brain cancer.”Breteau said Cancer Colère had gone from a handful of activists – mostly those who have or had the disease – to about 600 supporters in a matter of weeks. The collective has rejected affiliation to any political party and has learned from the gilets jaunes movement that demonstrating does not work. In September, Cancer Colère will begin a leafleting campaign outside hospitals that points out the dangers of pesticides.“There are solutions, farmers who use healthy agricultural methods, who respect animals and nature. We must listen to them and scientists, but we have to confront politicians and industrialists,” Breteau said. “Ordinary people are deeply angry and becoming more so. We’re thinking how we become a force.”Explore more on these topicsFrancePesticidesCancerEuropeFarmingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It would solve absolutely nothing. It will merely pile fresh military, humanitarian and political problems on to the mounds of those already created in the conflict. It will make every human agony worse, not better. Governments around the world must do whatever they can – the US above all – to stop it.There is still time. The plan announced on Friday is for an operation to take military control ofGazaCity, home to a million displaced Palestinians. They will be forcibly evacuated, yet again, to the southern Gaza Strip over the coming weeks. Aid distribution is certain to be a secondary consideration, logistically challenging and woefully inadequate for a population where malnutrition is already severe. The threat to life in Gaza, including to the remaining Israeli hostages captured on 7 October 2023, will get much worse.Friday’s announcement leaves open the question of whether the operation will be extended later to the entire Gaza Strip. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said this is his wish. The current decision to limit the takeover seems to reflect objections from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chiefs. But there is no guarantee that an even larger takeover will not then follow. Mr Netanyahu always ratchets up. The sum of his choices amounts toperpetual war.This is a strategy that ensures, for the moment, that Mr Netanyahu remains in power. But it does not ensure a military victory. It escalates the fight with Hamas without any way of ending it. Twenty months of attacks may have devastated Hamas, but the capacity to mount a limited insurgency remains. Such insurgencies are hard to defeat, as the US found in Vietnam and Iraq, and Britain learned in its former empire and in Northern Ireland. “Everybody is going to be in this meat grinder,” a senior Israeli former soldier graphicallytold the BBCthis week.The misery will be felt in Israel too. The plan could be adeath sentencefor the 20 or so living hostages. It could also guarantee that the bodies of about 30 believed dead will disappear for ever. Mr Netanyahu’s decision, in effect, to put punishing Hamas above the freeing of Israeli hostages will agonise their families and deepen domestic political divisions. The strain on Israeli society is already intense, withIDF chiefsopposing the Gaza takeover and arguing unsuccessfully for more targeted operations. Now more Israeli soldiers will die too.The takeover shows how cavalierly Mr Netanyahu is willing to deepen Israel’s political isolation as long as he has Washington’s support. Other foreign governments have condemned the plan.Britainsaid it was simply “wrong” and “will only bring more bloodshed”.Germany, Israel’s second largest military supplier, put a ban on weapons for use in Gaza, a significant move. In realpolitik terms, however, everything comes down to the US. President Trump should condemn the takeover plan and match the German stance. US allies should insist that he does so. Hamas’s allies must be pressured too.Mr Netanyahu’s approach is not merely wrong. It will make things worse, much worse for people in Gaza in the short term most of all, but worse for Israelis in the long term too. His policy is exactly the kind of historic folly so well described by the historianBarbara Tuchmanas “a perverse persistence in a policy demonstrably unworkable or counter-productive”. Mr Netanyahu is sowing dragon’s teeth for years to come, and the sooner he is stopped the better.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The reality is often less glamorous. As we endure a season of hot and humid weather, here and abroad, contending with sweat, frizz and clogged pores can be a daily battle.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.From UV rays to air-con, many factors take a toll on hair, skin and nails when the mercury shoots up. To know which products to reach for, it’s important to understand how each part of our body is affected.Finding anSPFyour skin loves is also non-negotiable. Get in the habit of reapplying it rigorously and regularly (every two hours, or after swimming) while you’re exposed to the sun. Check the UV index on your phone’s weather app as a guide: if it’s above two, be even more vigilant.Ready for your SOS? From all-star SPFs to hydrating hair care, these are the trusted hot-weather beauty buys to know, all tried and tested by me.The best hair products for hot and humid weather‘Sun and heat dehydrate hair and break down the bonds that hold it together, which can leave it frizzy and dull or rough in texture,” says hairdresser Hadley Yates. Dyed hair is worst hit by warm weather, he adds, as “UV rays break down colour pigments and oxidise dye molecules, causing fading”. Covering hair as much as possible with a sun hat or scarf – especially the fragile ends – is important, as is the use of heat-protection products, including those that add moisture back into the hair.View image in fullscreenPhilip Kingsley Swimcap water-resistant mask£24 for 100ml at Cult Beauty£25 for 100ml at Look FantasticYour hair is like a sponge, so if you’re heading to the beach or lido, make sure you at least saturate your locks with clean water before a swim. If dry, it will absorb the salty or chlorinated water. Even better, apply a mask, such as Philip Kinglsey’s Swimcap, to shield it. It doesn’t feel sticky or heavy when applied and will moisturise locks while protecting them.View image in fullscreenAmika Frizz-me-not hydrating anti-frizz treatment£28 for 200ml at Sephora£28 for 200ml at Cult BeautyBlow-drying in 30C+ heat? No, thank you. To get a glossy finish from air drying, pick a product that tackles frizz while protecting your locks from the heat.

This Ouai formula is effective without drying out locks.View image in fullscreenDavines SU hair mask£31 for 150ml at CosmetifyUsing a moisturising mask once a week can help relieve dehydrated or damaged hair. Formulated specifically to mitigate the effects of sun, sea and sand, Davines’ cruelty-free SU version can be used in place of conditioner (leave in for up to 15 minutes) or applied as sun protection as a longer treatment during your session at the beach or pool.View image in fullscreenBouclème curl cream£22 for 300ml at Look Fantastic£22 for 300ml at BootsIf you’re a curly girl, then air drying hair with a curl cream will keep it in good shape. I like Bouclème’s hydrating formula with coconut fruit extract, castor oil and kukui nut oil; it’s lightweight and leaves no tell-tale crispiness once hair is dry. Apply it to wet lengths and scrunch upwards in sections to encourage natural texture.The best skincare for hot weatherFor skin, consultant dermatologist Dr Anjali Mahto says you should “prioritise lightweight hydration and gentle cleansing to remove sweat and sunscreen buildup without stripping the skin”. Fellow skin clinician Pamela Marshall notes that moisturisers with ceramides and PHAs help skin stay hydrated, particularly if it’s being parched by an air-conditioned office.View image in fullscreenDrunk Elephant D-Bronzi anti-pollution sunshine drops£34 for 30ml at Cult Beauty£34 for 30ml at Look FantasticIf you’re extra scrupulous with your face and neck SPF, you might notice they tan less quickly than your body.

He announced the location in a brief post on his Truth Social site.Russian state media agency Tass confirmed the date and location of the meeting, citing Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov.Earlier in the day, Trump told reporters in the White House the meeting “would have been sooner, but I guess there’s security arrangements that unfortunately people have to make”.The US president also said “there’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both”Ukraineand Russia and that the issue would be discussed soon but he gave no further details.Bloomberg reported on Friday that the deal could cement some of Putin’s territorial gains in Ukraine, in effect freezing the battle lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Putin has claimed four Ukrainian regions in their entirety, although much of their territory remains under Ukrainian control.‘Freeze’ in Ukraine war may be close, says Tusk, as US and Russia plan talksRead moreUS and Russian officials were working on a deal under which Russia would halt its offensive in exchange for the territorial concessions – making it a politically fraught proposal in Ukraine, Bloomberg said.Trump’s comments came after Poland’s prime minister said a “freeze” in the conflict could be close, after speaking with the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has communicated with Trump and European leaders in recent days.“There are certain signals, and we also have an intuition, that perhaps a freeze in the conflict – I don’t want to say the end, but a freeze in the conflict – is closer than it is further away,” Donald Tusk said during a news conference. “There are hopes for this.”Tusk said Zelenskyy was “very cautious but optimistic” about the ceasefire, Reuters reported. Ukraine was keen that Poland and other European countries play a role in planning for a ceasefire and an eventual peace settlement, Tusk said.Trump has previously expressed his readinessto meet Putinone on one without preconditions, including direct negotiations between Putin and Zelenskyy, stoking fears that Ukraine may be left out of negotiations for the framework of a potential ceasefire.If the summit happens, it would be the first US-Russia summit since 2021, when former president Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva.Zelenskyy has responded by speaking with European leaders including the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who are key conduits to Trump.The US envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed a three-way meeting with Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy but the Kremlin had ignored that suggestion, said the Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, and was “focusing on preparations for a bilateral meeting with Trump in the first place”.Putin has said he is not ready to meet Zelenskyy, even as the Kremlin claimed preparations were under way for a bilateral summit with Trump next week.“I have nothing against it in general, it is possible, but certain conditions must be created for this,” Putin said of a meeting with Zelenskyy. “But unfortunately, we are still far from creating such conditions.”Last month,Trump issued an ultimatum for Putinto agree to a ceasefire or face secondary sanctions with the deadline set for this Friday. That deadline appeared in place despite plans for the summit, although the White House has not said what secondary measures it could enforce.Trump did target India with a 25% tariff hike for purchasing Russian oil this week, singling out one of Moscow’s economic enablers in a move thatNew Delhi complained was unfair and selective.Trump had grown frustrated with Putin in public in recent months as the war dragged through its third year and Putin continued to launch nightly missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities despite Trump’s insistence that he could strike a deal within 24 hours of becoming president.“Putin … talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said last month. “So there’s a little bit of a problem there.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpVladimir PutinRussiaUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Hers is one of 31 properties listed by MPs where at least some portion of the rent was paid to another person.The Guardian’s analysis found one in eight Westminster MPs – including 10 with government posts – declared a rental income from property in the last year.This includes almost a quarter of the Conservative parliamentary party (27 MPs), just 11% of Labour MPs (43 MPs) and 10% of Liberal Democrats (7 MPs).The two MPs with the largest declared property incomes are both from Labour. Jas Athwal, MP for Ilford South, rents out 15 residential and three commercial properties in London. Last year, he was criticised by Keir Starmer after he was accused ofrenting out flats with black mouldand ant infestations.Tory MPs owning rental properties - graphAthwal was followed by the former chancellorJeremy Hunt, who rents out seven flats in Southampton, and has half a share in a holiday home in Italy and an office building in London.Most of the 169 properties rented out by MPs were residential, but some MPs also let out business and commercial premises. More than two in five (43%) of the properties rented out by MPs were in London.The figures have intensified scrutiny of Ali’s case, which has cast new light on the debate over landlord interests in parliament. Ali resigned on Thursday night after it was revealed she had ended her tenants’ fixed-term contract in order to sell the property, but re-listed it for rent at a higher price within six months.The practice is one the Labour government is seeking to ban under its flagship renters’ rights bill. The bill will end “no fault” evictions under section 21, which allows landlords to throw out tenants without reason.Since the policy was first proposed in April 2019 under Theresa May, 123,889 section 21 claims have progressed to court, and 124,360 households in England have been threatened with homelessness as a result of being served a notice.Originally, the legislation would have banned landlords who evict tenants in order to sell from re-letting the property for 12 months However, theHouse of Lordsamended the bill to reduce this period to six months. The bill was one of several pieces of legislation that became delayed until after the parliamentary summer recess.MPs must only declare a rental property on the register of interests if it, either by itself or as part of a portfolio, provides rental income of more than £10,000 in a calendar year – meaning more MPs could be landlords without declaring it. The Guardian analysis excluded agricultural land holdings.Right to buy in England ‘fuelled housing crisis and cost taxpayers £200bn’Read moreThe disclosure has drawn sharp criticism from housing campaigners. Jae Vail, a spokesperson for the London Renters Union, said: “The sheer number of landlords in parliament is shocking. During an unprecedented housing crisis, it’s a blatant conflict of interest that MPs are making millions from struggling renters – while some even use taxpayer money to cover their own personal rents. Tenants need a government that works for us, not one that profits from our hardship.”Ben Twomey, the chief executive of Generation Rent, said MPs were “around three times more likely to be landlords than the rest of us”, adding: “Landlord power within parliament has left renters with few legal protections when it comes to arbitrary evictions or unreasonable rent hikes. The government must use this moment to double down on its manifesto promise to renters to fix our broken renting system.”One senior figure on the left of the party went further: “We can’t claim to fight for renters while half the PLP are landlords collecting rent from people struggling through the housing crisis. Rushanara’s case is only the tip of the iceberg. Voters see the hypocrisy and it’s killing our credibility on housing.”A spokesperson for Ministry of Housing,Communities& Local Government said:“There are already clear transparency rules around this.“We’re focused on improving standards and security for tenants, and our renters’ rights bill will level the playing field between landlords and tenants. We’re determined to deliver this landmark legislation swiftly, so tenants can have greater security in their homes.”Explore more on these topicsHousingRachel ReevesDavid LammyCommunitiesJeremy HuntKeir StarmerHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

That wasn’t food you dropped. If you had been PM then UK would be speaking German!”The bombing of Dresden by the RAF and US air force in February 1945 is believed to have killed tens of thousands of civilians. It remains one of the most controversial allied acts of the second world war, amid questions marks over its strategic necessity and the widespread destruction in civilian areas.Huckabee, who became the first evangelical Christian to be Washington’s envoy toIsraelafter Donald Trump nominated him following last November’s presidential election, did not leave it at that.In afollow-up post, he wrote: “How much food has Starmer and the UK sent to Gaza?”He claimed Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, had sent 2m tons of food toGaza, “none of it even getting to hostages”, making an apparent reference to unsupported claims that Hamas is intercepting deliveries and hoarding aid.“Maybe UK PM ought to sit this one out & follow Arab League who said Hamas should disarm & release ALL hostages immediately.”The ambassador’s blunt comments went well beyond the public remarks of Trump when he met Starmer at Turnberry in Scotland last month. The US presidentdeclined to criticise Starmer in his presenceafter it emerged that Britain was preparing to recognize Palestinian statehood in the absence of a ceasefire in Gaza.US ambassador to Israel says US no longer pursuing goal of independent Palestinian stateRead moreHuckabee, a former Republican presidential candidate, hasa history of making intemperate comments in Israel’s favour. In 2008, he said, “There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.” He has also declined to use the term “West Bank”, claimed by Palestinians a territory for part of a future state – instead referring to the territory by the biblical name of Judea and Samaria, which is used by Israel.He has also declined to call Israeli settlements in the territory by that name, insisting on calling them “communities”.In June, he told the BBC that Muslim countries should provide the land for a Palestinian state.“At what point does it have to be in the same piece of real estate that Israel occupies?” he said. “Muslim countries have 644 times the amount of land that are controlled by Israel. So maybe if there is such a desire for the Palestinian state, there would be someone who would say we'd like to host it.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyMike HuckabeeIsraelKeir StarmerGazaWest BankPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

His case is continuing.Nicola Sturgeon announces divorce from Peter MurrellRead moreSturgeon faced police questioning but was never charged and has since been exonerated of all wrongdoing. In March this year, she was told she faced no further action in Police Scotland’s fraud inquiry.In her book, excerpts of which were published in the Times on Friday, she describes her shock over the police raid in April 2023, the “utter disbelief that … police were in my home, that they had a warrant to arrest my husband and search the house”.She felt creeping anxiety and dread in the weeks after Murrell’s arrest, waiting for police to question her, and when they did arrest her, she was “horrified and devastated, though also relieved in a strange sort of way.Nicola Sturgeon to stand down as MSP next yearRead more“At least the ordeal of waiting was over.”Sturgeon had stepped down from her post just months earlier in February 2023, citing burnout. After her police interview in June, she was released pending investigation and sought refuge at a friend’s home in the north-east of Scotland.The arrests had made her feel as if she “had fallen into the plot of a dystopian novel”. Investigations into her actions as party chief continued for more than a year, and she says she felt frightened despite knowing she had done nothing wrong.“I retain both faith in and respect for our country’s criminal justice system. However, none of that changes this fact: being the subject of a high-profile criminal investigation for almost two years, especially having committed no crime, was like a form of mental torture.”She writes that she felt “overwhelming” relief when authorities informed her this year she was no longer a suspect.The excerpts also offer a window into the veteran politician’s thoughts on parenthood and the deep grief she felt upon having a miscarriage in 2010, at the age of 40. She had never had any great desire to be a parent, and that when she did fall pregnant she was “deeply conflicted” due to her work.“In my stupid, work-obsessed mind the timing couldn’t have been worse. By the Scottish election, I would be six months pregnant. It may seem hard to believe now, but even in 2010 it wasn’t obvious how voters would react to a heavily pregnant candidate,” she wrote.But she knew her husband, Peter, would be overjoyed to be a father and he was “ecstatic” to learn the news, she wrote. However, upon telling doctor about noticing “spots of blood”, she had an urgent appointment at Glasgow Royal Infirmary the following day.“I think I’d known in my heart what the outcome would be, but I was still hoping for the best,” she wrote. After four days of “constant agony, the most excruciating pain I have ever experienced”, the pregnancy “passed”.“I had the presence of mind to call Peter into the bathroom and, together, we flushed our ‘baby’ down the toilet,” Sturgeon said. “We later resolved to try again, but I knew then that we had lost our one chance.“Later, what I would feel most guilty about were the days I had wished I wasn’t pregnant,” she wrote. “There’s still a part of me that sees what happened as my punishment for that.”She writes that she had been expecting a baby girl whom she would have named Isla. “I do deeply regret not getting the chance to be Isla’s mum.”Sturgeon announced in March this year she would stand down as an MSP at the next Scottish parliament election, expected in 2026.Frankly will be published on Thursday 14 August.Explore more on these topicsNicola SturgeonScottish National party (SNP)ScotlandScottish politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the first time since last summer’s riots that there has been a mass and national standing up of specialist public order officers.Some of the extra riot officers will be deployed on the streets, kitted out in helmets and shields to act as a deterrent. Others will be held in reserve and all will be on standby to be rushed across England and Wales to hotspots of violence and rising tension, a police source with knowledge of the planning for this weekend said.The same source stressed there was no specific intelligence of violence, but 800 extra riot officers were ordered to be made ready on Friday, on top of the 2,200 planned already.At least 20 protests targeting hotels used by the government to house asylum seekers are thought possible this weekend, with each one in turn potentially attracting a counter-protest.Police in England brace for disorder as far right promote anti-migrant protestsRead moreAs of 8pm on Friday, 10 protests against asylum seekers had attracted numbers ranging from the dozens to about 100, according to Hope Not Hate, which monitors extremist groups.Stand Up to Racism said about 130 of its supporters had faced about 80 protesters in Leeds. In Chestnut, about 100 protesters against asylum seekers faced 10 anti-racism activists with handmade signs. The group said it had a major mobilisation in Islington, facing about 10 on the other side.One senior officer in an area expecting a protest said: “It is impossible to tell what you are going to get. Within crowds you can get different factions, concerned locals, bystanders, extremists.”Officers will need to keep both sides apart as well as ensure disruption is kept to a minimum.The 3,000 riot officers have been requested from local forces and will be directed by the National Police Coordination Centre.Local commanders will make decisions about specific deployments. In some areas public order officers may deploy in full riot gear from the start to act as a deterrent. Other forces will prefer to have officers in regular uniforms, so called “soft hats”, to start with, with fully kitted riot officers in reserve and close by if trouble erupts.The far right is involved in some, if not most, of the protests but those attending are expected to include local people concerned by claims linking asylum seeker hotels to serious crime.Police public order resources this weekend face a pincer movement from right and left.TheMetropolitan policeis calling in support from other forces as it faces three days of substantial public order challenges, including an anti-migrant protest in Islington, north London, on Friday night, with more are expected at another in Canary Wharf on Sunday.On Saturday in centralLondonthere will be a pro-Palestine march, along with a protest encouraging supporters of Palestine Action – and opponents of its ban under terrorism laws – to dare police to arrest them.Organisers and police sources agree privately hundreds are likely to turn up, the range likely to be 200 to just under 1,000, encouraged to hold placards containing the words “I support Palestine Action”, which police say will lead to arrest.How will police respond to rally against Palestine Action ban?Read moreOrganisers hope to stretch to breaking point the police and criminal justice system’s ability to deal with a mass defiance. Police believe they will manage unless the numbers exceed expectations.0:33Anti-migrant and anti-racist protests take place outside the Britannia hotel in east London – videoIn London, small groups of protesters started to gather from about 5pm on Friday across the road from the Britannia International hotel in Canary Wharf. Riot police scrambled to keep groups of masked men who broke away from the anti-asylum seeker protest from reaching a separate group of anti-racism activists who had attempted to walk down to the hotel.About 200 anti-migrant protesters – including men waving St George’s flags and an Israeli flag – had gathered across the road from the hotel, with some hurling abuse at a Stand Up to Racism protest of about 100 activists, trade unionists and others.Police kept a distance but vans with public order officers were also stationed in streets nearby. Two people were arrested.On Sunday in London, there will be a march in support of the release of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas in the 7 October 2023 attack, as well as football’s Community Shield match. The start of football’s lower divisions this weekend will also require police resources.Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan, who will lead the policing operation, warned people who want to protest against the banning of Palestine Action that they should expect a terrorism charge.She said: “Anyone showing support for Palestine Action can expect to be arrested. An arrest under the Terrorism Act can have very real long-term implications – from travel, to employment, to finances.”There was some unease in Nuneaton on Friday afternoon, before what is expected to be a big turnout at a protest outside the council building on Saturday.The Warwickshire town has become a target for far-right activists in recent days, after two Afghan men were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and raping a 12-year-old girl. They have now been charged in relation to the alleged incident.The Reform UK council leader, 19-year-old George Finch, accused the police of covering up the claim that the men, Ahmad Mulakhil and Mohammad Kabir, are asylum seekers.A group of retired women sitting outside a cafe said they supported the protest. “I think it’s good … They’re only protecting the children. That’s all they’re doing,” said one woman, who would not give her name because “you can’t have an opinion because you’ll get locked up”.Warwickshire’s police chief constable, Alex Franklin-Smith, took the unusual step of publishing a letter to Finch on Wednesday, writing that the police had asked the Home Office to confirm the immigration status of the two men accused in connection with the alleged rape, and “did not and will not cover up such criminality”.Care workers Chijioke “CJ” Ani and Musa Samson, both originally from Nigeria, had also heard about the protest. Ani said he would go to work and go home, and not stay in the town on Saturday.He said he had seen a lot of anti-immigration sentiment on social media. “Some of them are misinformed or acting out of impulse,” he said. “It makes me feel like someone will attack me someday. It’s definitely getting worse because the far right are getting stronger.”While the men, originally from Nigeria, had found Nuneaton to be a friendly town, Samson said he had experienced some racism with men making noises at him as he approached a local bar.Most people the Guardian spoke to in Nuneaton said they would be avoiding the town centre.Lawrence McIntyre was serving teas and coffees from The Kiosk in the town centre. He said: “I do feel sorry if it does put people off coming down shopping. The market traders and the small businesses, they rely on [customers].”He said there had been plenty of diversity in the town for a long time and it had not been a problem until now.View image in fullscreenAnti-migration demonstrators outside the Cresta Court hotel in Altrincham on Friday.Photograph: Jon Super/The GuardianView image in fullscreenAnti-migration demonstrators at the Cresta Court hotel in Altrincham on Friday.Photograph: Jon SuperIn Altrincham, Greater Manchester, protesters and counter-protesters were separated by a busy road outside the Cresta Court hotel. Far-right agitators were met locals who shouted about apparent crimes that they said asylum seekers had committed.“Go back to where you’ve come from, we don’t want you,” shouted one woman towards the hotel. On the other side of the road, counter-protesters chanted that refugees were welcome. In a rare moment of unity, the far right began singing “fuck Keir Starmer” to the tune of Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes and the anti-fascists joined in.Explore more on these topicsPoliceMetropolitan policeProtestImmigration and asylumLondonPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

When asked directly whether she supported any proscribed organisations, she replied: “I do not.”Her solicitors have now issued a letter of claim on her behalf to the chief constable of Kent police in what was also said to be a move to remind other police forces of their responsibilities when it comes to peaceful protests by pro-Palestine demonstrators this weekend.Murton will be seeking damages and intends to donate any compensation to Palestinian causes, as well as an apology and details of what has happened to any information that the police recorded about her.Shamik Dutta from Bhatt Murphy, who is representing Murton, said: “The legal challenge is being brought because as matters stand our client has neither received any apology nor any acknowledgment that Kent police conduct has been unlawful.“She has had no indication that no further action will be taken against her in relation to her protest on 14 July 2025 or that no further action will be taken against her if she wishes to engage in a materially similar protest in the future.”4:13Protester holding Palestine flag threatened with arrest by Kent police – videoIn the encounter last month, which Murton filmed, one officer told her: “Mentioning freedom ofGaza, Israel, genocide, all of that all come under proscribed groups, which are terror groups that have been dictated by the government.”He went on to say that the phrase “free Gaza” was “supportive of Palestine Action”, adding that it was an offence “to express an opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed organisation, namely Palestine Action is an offence undersection 12(1A) of the Terrorism Act”. The officer told her she had committed that offence.The officers said they would arrest Murton unless she provided her name and address, which she reluctantly agreed to do.Kent police were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsProtestKentPolicePalestinian territoriesGazaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

He had attacked his former partner at the hotel after Mickleburgh conceded to attending a birthday meetup as a gesture of kindness, prosecutors said. They said he then launched a “vicious and murderous attack” and tried to cover up the killing, telling police Mickleburgh had died after falling out of bed.Cartwright had maintained his innocence throughout the trial and pleaded not guilty to all charges. He was found not guilty of the charge of controlling or coercive behaviour and will serve a minimum 28-year sentence.During the month-long trial, the Guildford crown court heard how Mickleburgh, from Axminster in Devon, had been an “incredible mother” and successful businesswoman.View image in fullscreenSamantha Mickleburgh had agreed to attend the birthday dinner with Cartwright because she thought he had no one else to celebrate with.Photograph: Surrey Police/PAShe had agreed to attend the birthday dinner with Cartwright because she thought he had no one else to celebrate with. Honouring her prior commitment, she had organised a room with separate twin beds, and a six-course dinner at the five-star Pennyhill Park hotel in Bagshot.But the court heard that after the second course, Mickleburgh became unwell, with restaurant staff saying she struggled to stand when Cartwright walked her out. Upon return to their room, Cartwright raped and strangled her, causing a skull fracture. He called an ambulance the following morning, claiming he had found her dead in bed next to him.The court heard he had also placed an engagement ring on Mickleburgh’s finger to make it appear as if they had rekindled their romance, and that he had staged the room to make it appear as if they had engaged in consensual sex.Justice Murray in handing down his sentence on Friday said Mickleburgh’s family had described her as “caring, thoughtful, fun, well-organised, generous to a fault and devoted to her family”. They had suffered grief that lay “beyond words to fully describe”.The court had earlier heard from her family who described him as an “evil, controlling, manipulative predator” who thought he would get away with the murder.One of her sisters, Tracey Carter, spoke of an “indescribable amount of pain and suffering” after recalling how the family had welcomed Cartwright into their “homes and hearts”.“I wish she had never met you. Did you feel proud of yourself when you lied to my father, saying that Sam had died in her sleep, knowing full well the horror that you had put her through?” Carter said in her victim impact statement.The jury handed down a unanimous verdict of guilt on charges of murder and rape.Prosecutors had argued that his behaviour towards Mickleburgh had been “cruel, repressive and overbearing” and that he had a history of such behaviour in his previous relationships.Moses Koroma, prosecuting, said the jury had seen “straight through Cartwright’s claims that this had all resulted from her falling out of bed”.Explore more on these topicsSurreyCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

He supported reduced taxes, electoral reform, cuts and an increased focus on environmental issues.Hestepped down as leader of the partyafter it was nearly wiped out in 2015 election, with some blaming the defeat on his decision to get into bed with the Conservatives in the first place, breaking a key election promise over university fees in the process.Clegg quit politics in the UK and took up a new role in 2018 in California as the head of global affairs and communications at Facebook.At the same time González Durántez pursued a number of interests including a mentoring project, Inspiring Girls International, and Altius Advisory, a consultancy she founded aimed at bettering business in Africa.Miriam González Durántez: ‘I don’t want my boys to think there are things girls can’t do’Read moreBefore that she spent years in Brussels and London advising on diversity, liberal reform, and international trade policy.They returned to the UK from California after Clegg left Meta in January and she nowspends weekdays in Spain and weekends when she can in London, according to a recent interview.Her lengthy career included three stints as a member of cabinet in the EU’s external relations commission, including one as a senior trade adviser to Chris Patten, the former British commissioner for external relations. She also spent two years working as a negotiator at the World Trade Organization.Her father,José Antonio González Caviedes, was mayor of Olmedo and served as a senator for the conservative People’s party (PP) from 1989 until he died in 1996.González Durántez was not available for comment, but when asked if she was considering setting up her own party, a spokesperson for Better Spain said the lawyer had been working for the past two years to mobilise civil society and on effort to “clean up Spanish politics” and “end the pendulum of corruption and counteract polarisation”.The spokesperson added: “She has publicly stated on numerous occasions that if Spanish political parties continue to ignore civil society, she would consider other options including political ones. For the time being she continues working on those objectives within España Mejor.“As part of her work as the founder of España Mejor, she has held meetings with all sorts of organisations, public institutions, businesses and citizens across Spain, as well as multiple political parties, within Spain and Europe.”Founding a new party and bringing it to a position of political heft is laden with risk in Spain, as it is in any country. Spanish politics remains doggedly bipartisan, with the socialist and conservative parties rarely achieving an overall majority.While the two-party system has been loosened from both left (Podemos) and right (Vox) the attempt by Ciudadanos, led by Albert Rivera, a young lawyer, to break the deadlock fizzled out to the point that the party didn’t even contest the 2023 general election.Pablo Simón, a political scientist at the Carlos III university in Madrid, predicted an uphill struggle for González if she throws her hat into the ring. “This proposal for a new centrist party seems to come from above, not from the grassroots,” he said.“I think it’s a bad moment to launch such a party. For one thing, voters who are fed up with the government are moving the right and the far right and prefer pre-existing parties to new ones. It would make more sense to wait for the European elections when there is a better chance of gaining representation.“Miriam González is largely unknown in Spain. When you launch a party it’s best to have a someone well-known to front it. Perhaps González would make a better deputy than leader.”He added that liberal parties had had little success in newer democracies such as Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. “This is because, being new democracies, the politics are polarised between left and right.”Political power couplesView image in fullscreenHillary and Bill Clinton after voting in 2016.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APIt may be some time before Miriam González Durántez decides whether to follow her husband’s footsteps into formal politics, but if she does she will join an illustrious list of power couples who have graced the world stage.1. Bill Clinton and Hillary ClintonAlthough she was unsuccessful in her attempt to follow Bill into the White House, Hillary Clinton and her husband were at one time the most powerful couple in modern American politics. A lawyer, politician and diplomat, Hillary achieved high office in her own right as two-time senator for New York and US secretary of state. The pair continue to wield influence with the Clinton Foundation.2. Nelson Mandela and Winnie MandelaBefore their divorce and her marginalisation after his release from prison in 1990, the couple were considered the mother and father of the nation of South Africa. Winnie Mandela became an MP and a minister and during the fight against apartheid she wasa potent symbol of the struggle, but her reputation was seriously damaged several times by allegations of murder and corruption. She was convicted of kidnapping, assault, theft and fraud. As one of the most visible faces of the resistance, she was regularly detained and harassed by the police and considered so powerful she was even prohibited from speaking to the media.3.Cristina Fernández de Kirchnerand Néstor KirchnerCristina Fernández de Kirchner became the first woman to be elected president of Argentina in 2007, a role she held until 2015. Succeeding her husband Néstor, thecharismatic but divisive figurewas permanently banned from public office in June over a corruption conviction.Explore more on these topicsSpainMiriam González DurántezNick CleggEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Forced to live in tent camps or amid the ruins of their homes. Stricken by hunger and deprived of medical supplies.Now, 22 months into the war, around 1 million Palestinians are bracing for another catastrophe after the Israeli security cabinet’s decision to take control ofGazaCity. Such an offensive would force them toward the south of the territory, and an uncertain future.Starmer calls Gaza City takeover plan wrong and urges Israel to reconsiderRead more“Since this morning, after hearing the news of evacuation of Gaza City, I have been feeling anxious and afraid,” said Umm Ibrahim Banat, a 55-year-old mother originally from northern Gaza, who has already been displaced four times. “Where will we go with the children and the elderly? I swear we are exhausted from displacement, starvation, and being driven from one place to another.”“Now,” she said, “We are the walking dead.”After a 10-hour overnight meeting, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced on Friday that his security cabinet hadapproved a plan to take over Gaza City, marking another escalation of Israel’s offensive that has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians.According to Israel’s Channel 12 the plan, which would mean sending ground troops into the territory, could displace tens of thousands of people and further disrupt efforts to deliver food to the territory and force approximately 1 million Palestinians in Gaza City and other areas into evacuation areas in the southern part of the strip.View image in fullscreenPalestinians have been returning to the ruins of Gaza City since its initial bombardment at the start of the war.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/Reuters“Gaza has been completely destroyed– what more can they do?”, said Banat, whose daughter Maryam was killed with her husband and children. “We have lost the best of our youth; our territory is a huge prison besieged by land, sea and air; the destruction has become unbearable; diseases are spreading, tents stretch as far as the eye can see, water is contaminated, prices are insane, hospitals are in ruins, our lives are utterly tragic! What more do they want?”A wasteland of rubble, dust and graves: how Gaza looks from the skyRead moreThe timing of another Israeli major ground operation is unclear since it is likely to require mobilising thousands of troops. However, according to sources familiar with the details of the meeting, the evacuation of Gaza City is scheduled to be completed by 7 October.It is unclear how many people still reside in the city, which was Gaza’s largest centre of population before the war. In the opening weeks of the conflict in 2023, hundreds of thousands fled under evacuation orders in the opening weeks of the conflict, but many returnedduring a ceasefire at the start of this year.Although residents of Gaza City say they have not yet received an evacuation order, many are already preparing to leave once again, hoping to find a safe place to live in the south.“If we are ordered to evacuate, I will leave everything and go, fearing for my family and children,” says Abu Nasser Mushtaha, 35, a father of four and a resident of Gaza’s Rimal neighbourhood. “The cost of staying would be too high. I have already lost enough; my mother was killed at the beginning of the war when the Israeli occupation bombed a neighbouring house.”“I have already started making a financial plan to reduce expenses and planning to move only the essential items, said Mushtaha, before concluding: “This will, without a doubt, be the end of Gaza’s people.”1:20'Nothing left to occupy': Palestinians react to Netanyahu's Gaza plan – videoPalestinians, at least90% of whom have already been displaced at least onceby the war and of whom nearlyone in 10 have been injured in Israeli attacks, are braced for further misery. There is little remaining of the healthcare system, and aid agencies such as the UN have been largely shut out by Israel.Germany halts arms exports to Israel that could be used in Gaza as global outcry growsRead moreThe war has already forced thousands to find refuge in cities such as Khan Younis and Rafah. Now, with both reduced to little more than rubble, it is unclear where civilians escaping the new offensive can hope to live. For this reason, while thousands are already planning yet another flight, just as many are determined to remain in Gaza City – even if it means risking their lives.“How can all these people be emptied into the south, which is already overcrowded?” asked Hossam al-Saqa, 46, a father of two from Gaza City. “We are staying in our homes and on our land, holding on to them. I will not leave, even if all the weapons are pointed at my head.”“I see Netanyahu’s and Israel’s propaganda as nothing more than media fireworks meant to intimidate and spread fear among the people,” he said. “This will not scare us, for God is with us, and He is stronger than everyone.”Al-Saqa, like others in Gaza City, said he saw the occupation plan as an attempt to pressure Hamas into accepting surrender after talks mediated by the US, Egypt and Qatarappeared to have broken downlast month.“This is our land where we grew up since childhood, and we will not give it up easily,” said Ibrahim Abu al-Husni, 47, who lost his eldest son, who was 23, during the war. “I will not leave this city.”“I will live here,” he said, And I will die here.”Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Run by Deutsche Bahn (DB) and France’s SNCF, it has been hailed as a milestone in European train travel.It is not the only new service linking Europe’s cities. From next May, the ČD ComfortJet, operated by the Czech, German and Danish railways, will carry you all the way fromPrague to Copenhagen, calling at Dresden, Berlin and Hamburg, in just over 11 hours.Major new routes are being built: a high-speed Alpine tunnel linking Lyon and Turin; the Fehmarn Belt connecting Germany and Denmark; Rail Baltica, which will join Tallinn in Estonia to Warsaw via Riga in Latvia and Kaunas in Lithuania.View image in fullscreenA Deutsche Bahn high-speed train at the Gare de l’Est in Paris.Photograph: AlamyOn the face of it, then, high-speed, long-distance rail travel in Europe seems to be finally taking off. But in fact, fast, efficient cross-border rail services between the continent’s major urban centres remain, for all the media fanfare, very much a rarity.For a whole raft of reasons – inadequate infrastructure, unwilling operators, incompatible systems, incomprehensible timetabling and (last but not least) impossibly complicated ticketing – long rail journeys across Europe are all too often a pastime rather than a practical travel alternative.Imagine, for the sake of illustration (few except slow-travel aficionados would ever actually attempt it), a four-country trip from Spain’s second-biggest city, Barcelona, to Marseille in France, then on to Italy’s largest port, Genoa, ending in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia.Map showing route from Ljubljana to BarcelonaFor starters,says Jon Worth, an independent writer and campaigner on European cross-border rail travel, while there is a high-speed line across the Spanish-French border, for most of the year it carries only four trains a day, and five in summer.“Why?” Worth says. “Because the new trains run by the Spanish operator, Renfe, haven’t been approved to run in France, and SNCF has cut the size of its fleet capable of running in Spain. So the trains that do run are invariably packed, and prices are sky-high.”Next, only one of those four or five daily trains will run direct from Barcelona to Marseille, and it arrives in France’s biggest port so late that you miss the last service to Nice, which is where you need to be in order to catch a train to Italy.So, you must then board a slow regional train the next morning for the hour-long ride to Ventimiglia, followed, with luck and good timing, by a relatively fast intercity connection along the Ligurian coast to Genoa.From there, things only get worse. Trains crossing the Italy-Slovenia border at Gorizia-Nova Gorica run at weekends only. Those doing so at Villa Opicina, near Trieste, are daily but very irregular. So the 370 miles (600km) to Ljubljana via Milan and Venice will take up to 13 hours and probably involve travelling via Villach in Austria.“It’s one of the worst borders to cross anywhere in the EU,” says Worth. “Very few, very slow trains.” Moreover, althoughEuropean night trainsare making a much-hyped but in reality slow and difficult comeback, there isn’t one on this route.(Actually, that’s not strictly true. The Espresso Riviera, operated by Treni Turistici Italiani, is a delightful upmarket sleeper service from Rome to Marseille and back. Unfortunately, it runs only in July and August, and then just once a week.)View image in fullscreenA train crosses the Salcano (Solkan) bridge, Slovenia.Photograph: Simon Kovacic/AlamyLeaving aside the nonexistent connectivity, the obstacles facing the long-distance European rail traveller will have become apparent long before they actually get on a train. Planning a trip and buying tickets (as well resolving problems if things go wrong) are daunting challenges in themselves.Seasoned travellers recommendDeutsche Bahn’s websiteas the best and most comprehensive planning tool for navigating the seemingly infinite complexities of Europe’s train schedules, but few novices would describe even that as user-friendly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unlike plane travel, through train tickets are rare – and if they exist, they are often more expensive than a combination.Moreover, although services such asTrainline– which anyway only offers only a small selection of possible routes – can sell you a through journey from, say, Barcelona to Nice, it will be two tickets with two different operators, sold in one transaction.“That means,” says Worth, “if anything goes wrong – say, a train is late and you miss your connection – you have no passenger rights at all. Worse, few stations will be able to help. Unlike in an airport, you’ll have to sort it out yourself.”Across the continent, similar issues recur, vastly complicating journeys that could, in principle, be smooth, practical, sustainable travel alternatives – and pushing even those willing to accept a longer and more expensive trip on to Europe’s ferociously competitive airlines.View image in fullscreenThe Lyon-Turin train tunnel, which is not scheduled to be completed until 2033.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesSometimes, infrastructure is the main obstacle. French TGVs and Italian Frecciarossas link Paris to Milan in seven hours, for example, but must crawl through the Alps until the new Lyon-Turin high-speed line and tunnel is completed, theoretically in 2033. Meanwhile, the current route is heavily susceptible to damage from increasingly frequent landslides: after reopening in April following a 20-month closure for mudslides, it had to shut down again for several days in July for the same reason.At other times, the issue is a lack of cooperation between rail operators. Astonishingly, there has been no direct train connection between Madrid and Lisbon – two neighbouring European capitals – since a Spanish sleeper service was discontinued in 2020.The 450-mile journey now requires two changes and multiple tickets and takes more than eight hours. Lines are being electrified but there is no guarantee that Renfe and Portugal’s CP, which have very different strategies, will combine forces and deliver a through service.“Operators still mostly think and work nationally,” says Worth. “CP is old-style, regular, but has only just started work on its first high-speed line. Renfe is modern, high-speed connections between Spain’s major cities. They’re just not a good fit.”Different technologies and operating systems are a major block. In principle, that can be overcome with modern, multi-system rolling stock, but it is significantly more expensive. A pan-European signalling system, ECTS, is on its way but not there yet.Other obvious European rail connections badly in need of upgrading, Worth argues, could include Berlin-Warsaw, which still runs on slow tracks for much of its six-hour journey (though that may change, givenPoland’s ambitious high-speed rail plans).And in Scandinavia, a high-speed service linking Oslo to Stockholm or Copenhagen remains a pipe dream. A project that would slash travel times between the Norwegian capital and Gothenburg in Sweden to an hour has, so far, made zero progress.Explore more on these topicsRail transportEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Shakespeare’sKing Lear, for example, remains open to interpretation. Its story of a retiring king bequeathing his lands to his daughters before descending into madness can, in the right hands, engage with many themes in the modern day including dementia.It was not really necessary for writer-director Dan Colley to construct a whole new play about it, but that is what the Irish theatre-maker has done in Lost Lear. Venetia Bowe plays a retired actor, now resident in a care home, whose memory has faded in every respect apart from a word-perfect recall of Shakespeare’s play. To keep her relaxed, the staff take on the parts of Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and the Fool as she loops repeatedly through her favourite scenes of parental regret.The idea recalls Enda Walsh’sThe Walworth Farce, in which a family protect themselves from the outside world by endlessly performing a shaky comedy, and it has a similar interest in mental decline.The difficulty with plays on this theme is that dementia is a mental state, not a dramatic question. You can evoke the dislocation it creates, as well as the sense of loss and frustration it leaves for loved ones, but you cannot resolve it.In a classy production, Lost Lear evokes it well. Joined by Peter Daly, Manus Halligan, Em Ormonde and Clodagh O’Farrell on Andrew Clancy’s institutional set, Bowe is the youthful woman trapped in an elderly body that we see only as the show progresses. First, we know her for her exacting standards, her brusque disregard for anyone but herself and her facility with language. Only later do we see her as a fragile old woman. Nothing can change, but the play has a sentimental appeal.At theTraverse, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalKing LearTraverse theatreDementiaMental healthreviewsShareReuse this content"

You’re probably familiar with the sins: the first is employing it as a filler word, to give you time to think: “I was, like, trying to speak in a socially acceptable way.” The second is using it to mean “said”, as in: “My English teacher was like, ‘Don’t talk like that.’” And the third is using it to denote approximation: “People who police the word are all, like, a million years old.”Yet, we all made it to adulthood despite the verbal carnage; many of us even have jobs that require communication. Now that millennials are, like, becoming the establishment, will the stigma against the word disappear?Megan C Reynolds, a millennial and author of Like: A History of the World’s Most Hated (And Misunderstood) Word, says part of what older generations rejected about “like” – as with so much language – was its relative newness during our childhoods, which “probably made them feel old”. The controversial use of the word came to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, though it has beenevolving since the year 1200, according to the linguist Alexandra D’Arcy. Today it is a firm part of the English lexicon, stretching from its inescapability onLove Island, to its role as the title of an Ice Spice EP (Like..?), to its regular employment by NPR’s “erudite, measured” interviewer Terry Gross, whohas been praisedfor using “like” as “stepping stones within sentences, on which she presses her weight, pivots, and tucks into her point”.The way we tell stories now is fundamentally different because we make space for feeling as well as factsMegan C Reynolds, author of LikeReynolds argues that, as millennials begin to dominate the workforce, “the usage of ‘like’ will soon be the status quo.”Languageevolves, generally for the better, she writes. Contrary to what our grade school teachers might have suggested, there are no real linguistic laws. The only language police are self-appointed.Still, using the word carries some embarrassment. As Reynolds and others point out, much of the vitriol directed at “like” is tied to its association with young women, beginning with the 1980s stereotype of the valley girl – a teen in the Los Angeles suburbs who, God forbid, enjoyed shopping. It’s true, researchers have found, thatyoung women in particularplay a leading role in shaping our language. But at the same time, as Reynolds writes: “The policing of the way women speak – which, in turn, makes women feel as if they need to police themselves, often subconsciously – is a sport that will never get old.”Why do people, like, say, ‘like’ so much?Read moreThat internalization, along with the history of finger-wagging, can make things difficult. “I have a friend who works for the FBI – she works with a lot of men – and has said that her father used to tell her to not say ‘like’ a lot, and it’s been sort of drilled in her head,” Reynolds says.It all leaves the word in a sort of purgatory – no longer condemned outright yet not fully embraced. That makes this an opportune moment for Reynolds’s book, which, despite the “history” in its title, might better be described as a series of meditations on the word. Reynolds reflects, of course, on Love Island and Terry Gross, as well as influencer culture, films ranging from My Fair Lady to Clueless (a movie exposing the misguidedness of the valley girl stereotype), and the different ways we use language, from texting with friends to emailing across the office (where we shift into what she calls “corporate drag”, with all its reaching out, circling back and touching base).But what’s most memorable about the book is Reynolds’s celebration of the word’s unique ability to grease the wheels of communication. “Like”, she argues, actually improves our ability to relate our experiences.For one thing, it allows us to combine words and feelings in a story. As D’Arcy tells Reynolds in the book: “The simple story that has been told about ‘like’ is that it came in and replaced ‘say’.” In fact, things are more complex: with “like”, “people started quoting way more than speech. And, in particular, they started quoting those internal states” – what they felt rather than what they actually said. So you might tell a friend: “My boss was like, ‘What the hell is wrong with you?’” when in fact the boss’s language was far more polite. But this more colorful version perhaps relates both the boss’s tone and how it made you feel, with the word “like” signaling to the listener that they shouldn’t take us literally.As Reynolds writes: “The way we tell stories now is fundamentally different because we make space for feeling as well as facts.”a book coverMeanwhile, when we discuss thorny topics, the word offers a chance to pause, and perhaps pivot or soften our language. “Not every situation requires a hammer,” Reynolds writes. “‘Like’ smooths the edges from strong, sharp, uncomfortable emotions, lowering the intensity until it feels more manageable.” Or, as she puts it in conversation: “It is just really hard to say complicated emotional things directly.” The word “gives you a minute to get your shit together mentally and also lets the other person know that you are getting your shit together”.Most of all, Reynolds doesn’t want people to beat themselves up. “I would argue that saying ‘like’ a lot is not the thing you should be upset at yourself for,” she says. “So if I could disabuse anyone of that notion, then my job is done.”In any case, there’s plenty of newgen Z slangto be frightened by instead.Explore more on these topicsBooksLanguageWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s extremely hard to care about any of itJack SealeFri 8 Aug 2025 11.19 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 11.35 EDTShareWelcome to Wrexhamis one of those TV shows that has moved its genre up a level. After years of glossy “behind-the-scenes” documentaries that were just another part of million-dollar sports franchises’ marketing portfolios, the story of unlikely celebrity investors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney taking the extremely unlikely decision to buy AFC Wrexham was an unexpected tonic and a worldwide hit.Inevitably, imitations are now spawning, with Amazon last month debuting the underwhelming Built in Birmingham, about NFL superstar Tom Brady’s half-hearted involvement in Birmingham City. Necaxa should have better prospects, since it’s on Disney+, the same platform as Welcome to Wrexham, and Reynolds and McElhenney are in it. But all the peculiar magic of the parent show is painfully absent.Club Necaxa was the biggest team in Mexico City until the turn of the millennium, when it fell into decline, outspent and outplayed by its city rivals Club América, Cruz Azul and Pumas. So in 2003, Necaxa relocated an hour and a half’s drive north to Aguascalientes. The Mexican first division abandoned promotion and relegation in 2020, so Necaxa’s elite status is secure, but in its new home it has found it hard to make the playoffs, let alone challenge for the league title.Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria, who has diversified from acting and directing into commercial ventures, was part of the consortium that invested in Necaxa in 2021. The documentary begins in April 2024 and proceeds as if Longoria were the sole financial saviour of the club, nicknaming her La Patrona (“the boss”) and largely relying on her to fill us in on Necaxa’s history and desired future. As for Longoria herself: she grew up in Texas with a father of Mexican descent who had longed for a son but found joy in sharing his love of the Dallas Cowboys with his youngest daughter, Eva, who later married a Mexican businessman and moved to Mexico City. Having spent her early career as an English-speaking American whose Latina looks limited the roles she was offered, Longoria is now ensconced in Mexican life without feeling as if she fully belongs there or in the US.In her conversations with the camera, the problem with the series becomes clear: the stakes are too low. Longoria would like to recapture the excitement of the Cowboys winning the Super Bowl, and she’d like to win the respect of the club’s players and staff, despite her Spanish being “horrible”. But these are just things that would be quite nice for her. They’re not enough for us to invest. Longoria’s interactions with people from the club tend to involve her laughing uproariously at nothing while everyone else politely sits there.Similarly, the players’ backstories are workaday recollections of training hard as youngsters, with jumpers for goalposts (or in the case of midfielder Diego “Chili” Gómez, piles of dirt) and great odds to overcome. The predicament of the club isn’t laden with jeopardy, either: Necaxa may not have won the top division for a while, but at least they’re in it. It’s as if Reynolds and McElhenney had bought Aston Villa or Everton instead of a non-league club on the verge of oblivion.The people of Aguascalientes, meanwhile, are indifferent towards Necaxa, which is a relatively new addition to the area and is just a bit frustratingly rubbish. If it keeps losing, they’ll shrug and go back to supporting Club América, or Guadalajara giants Chivas. In Wrexham, it felt as if the futures of the club and the town were existentially intertwined, but stories of fans whose devotion to football is a key part of their identity aren’t in evidence here, because nobody feels that way about Necaxa. This is more about Eva Longoria than any ordinary folk.It’s difficult, then, to care about whether Necaxa bounce back, but here come extensive match highlights anyway, with all the familiar grammar of the modern football doc. The action is filmed at ground level, more cinematically than standard live coverage, with plenty of reaction shots from the crowd and (more often) the directors’ box, accompanied by conveniently informative commentary that may or may not be authentic recordings made at the time. A switch to slow motion and a dip in the music signal that someone’s about to score.When Necaxa get slapped about by Monterrey in the final game of the 2024 season, it’s time to call on “Los Gringos”: Reynolds and McElhenney, minority investors in the club and executive producers of the series, pop up to lend their trademark unequal-buddy comedy to the show – they’ve worked up a gag about the less successful and busy Rob making Ryan look bad by spending more time learning Spanish – and to give Longoria tips via FaceTime.“We’re scared of La Patrona!” says Reynolds, with his usual nervous self-deprecation. Longoria laughs, heartily, and on her own.Necaxa is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewRyan ReynoldsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Is there a market for Superman: Border Patrol?Ben ChildFri 8 Aug 2025 11.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 19.47 EDTShareIt’s almost impossible to divide superheroes along political lines. Captain America might seem like a patriotic, commie-bashing lunatic, as he was in the 1950s comics during the McCarthy era, until you remember that he has also spent much of his fictional career telling corrupt government agencies to shove it. And, in the Marvel Comic Universe, at least, he went on the run rather than sign up for an authoritarian superhero registry.Supermanwas once the square-jawed poster boy for US exceptionalism, cheerfully posing on propaganda comic covers urging readers to buy war bonds, but he’s also been written as a Kansas farm boy so suspicious of concentrated power that in one storyline he renounced his citizenship to avoid being used as a pawn of US foreign policy.Bar a few outliers – Iron Man cheerleading the military-industrial complex in his earliest comics springs to mind – trying to pin a superhero to one side of the political spectrum is like trying to staple fog: most of DC and Marvel’s big beasts will drift wherever the story, or the writer’s mortgage payments, takes them. Which is why it’s been so bizarre watching the right’s disgust as a vaguely woke man of steel drives all before him at the summer box office.James Gunn’s Supermanpassed the half-billion-dollar mark globally this week, which hardly means we’re looking at a film to mirror the success of the early comic book movie era – Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice somehow made $874m, for chrissakes – but does at least indicate that audiences quite like this new, down-to-earth, kindly and human take on Kal-El. Gunn is now producing next Wonder Woman.View image in fullscreenDown to earth … David Corenswet in this year’s Superman.Photograph: Jessica Miglio/APMeanwhile, on the dystopian side of the news cycle,Dean Cain has declared himself primed and ready to join Donald Trump’s Ice agency. Cain (Kal-El in 90s TV series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman)only recently declared his horror at how “woke”the new David Corenswet Supes has turned out to be. Are these two things connected? Is Cain trying to make the point that a real “superman” would be standing at America’s borders, demanding paperwork from asylum seekers and Frisbeeing their lunch into the nearest bin, rather than attempting to stop evil invaders from terrorising a rival nation (as Corenswet does in Superman)?Is there an alternative reality where filmgoers queue around the block to watch Captain Constitution?It’s almost as if, in the absence of the kind of superhero movies Cain would like to see muscle their way into multiplexes, the actor sees it as his patriotic duty to bring hard-border fiction into reality. If the 74 million who voted for Trump don’t want these woke Marvel and DC superhero movies, and would really rather see films in which caped crusaders defend gated communities against suspiciously accented delivery drivers, isn’t Hollywood missing a trick? Isn’t there – somewhere – a gap in the market, or perhaps an alternative reality –Earth 45?Earth-Fox News? – where filmgoers queue around the block to watch Captain Constitution and the Stand Your Ground Squad, and the Hollywood trades wax lyrical about a new blockbuster era of paranoia and punitive zoning laws?The right has tried this already, of course. Cain was also pretty upset about Disney’s recent “woke” Snow White remake, perhaps because the princess didn’t spend the runtime pining for a man or whistling while she ironed. And so was conservative media outfit the Daily Wire, which at the height of the backlash against Rachel Zegler’s castingmade a trailer for a then-forthcoming rival film titled Snow White and the Evil Queen.Plot details were thin on the ground, but presumably involved the heroine abandoning woodland animals for a concealed-carry permit and learning the value of hard work by running her own small business into the ground without government subsidies. We’ll never really know because the filmappears to have been quietly cancelled, leaving a potential audience of millions bereft of the chance to see what happens when you trade magic mirrors for voter ID checkpoints.View image in fullscreenCaptain America crossed with a Trump rally … Antony Starr as Homelander in The Boys.Photograph: Prime Video/Amazon StudiosPerhaps the lesson here is that it’s just really difficult to make dreamy-eyed fantasy flicks that double as Breitbart comment threads. And it’s not just superhero movies that would creak under the strain. Imagine Star Wars if rebellions were built not on hope but on stricter border controls and mandatory midichlorian checks. Would The Lord of the Rings have really been quite the same if all those ’orrible orcs and trolls had been replaced on the battlefield by desperate migrants trying to reach the Shire, being enthusiastically biffed by an over-xcited Aragorn and Gimli counting down the number of “illegals” they just tonked?Sorry, Dean Cain – of course Superman is woke, he fights injusticeRead moreSooner or later, someone’s going to make a superhero film or TV series that gives the Maga crowd everything: a caped crusader who fights windfarms, sues the Daily Planet for libel and pays for everything in gold bullion or crypto. (The Boys got close at times: Homelander is basically what happens when you cross Captain America with a Trump rally and a gallon of unpasteurised milk, but he was hardly a hero – and perhaps that’s the point.)Until then, the culture warriors will have to settle for grumbling aboutwoke elvesandlady Thorwhile the rest of us watch Superman save the world from the nastiest supervillains in the universe without checking anyone’s passport.This article was amended on 8 August 2025.

The most integral, in fact. Yet tucked away in iFly facilities around the globe, hurtling through imperiously large wind tunnels, indoor skydivers might just disagree on a technicality.The tunnels offer a prolonged simulation of skydiving’s freefall in 200km/h wind. The results, a spectacle to behold, with acrobatic flips and dizzying turns that seem to laugh in the face of gravity. They haven’t removed the sky, exactly. They’ve simply bottled it.Need for speed: how sport’s risk takers recognise deadly danger and do it anyway | Emma JohnRead moreKyra Poh, a competitor in this weekend’s Australian indoor skydiving championships, knows this equation all too well. “Indoors is like: unlimited time, limited space,” Poh says. “In the sky, we have unlimited space, but limited time.”The 23-year-old from Singapore is a Red Bull athlete and current indoor skydiving world champion, but her background – perhaps surprisingly – is in competitive swimming. Her first taste of “flying” came 15 years ago, when her mother’s advertising agency was engaged by iFly Singapore to showcase younger flyers in a commercial. Eight-year-old Poh was the perfect choice.“I loved rollercoasters, anything that has adrenaline and speed, so when my mum asked me to become a flyer, it was a no-brainer,” Poh says. “Swimming was doing the same four strokes over and over every single day, so this was really refreshing. The possibilities were basically endless.”View image in fullscreenFlyer Kyra Poh has a rigorous strength and conditioning regime that allows her to perform complex routines in the tunnel.Photograph: iFly SingaporeThese possibilities are explored in the competitive side of the sport – a bustling combination of national contests and world championships, stretching across multiple disciplines and divided by skill level and number of flyers. The disciplines can be split into two main categories: dynamic and speed, and freestyle.Freestyle is where indoor skydiving’s artistry really comes to life. It boasts meticulously choreographed and synchronised routines, all imbued with breathtaking creativity and set to music.“We take inspiration from many sports,” Poh says. “Street dancing or breakdancing, ballet, gymnastics … but with the element of wind, so we can do it all when we’re floating. It’s kind of like ice-skating but three-dimensional.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

For Poh, flight training looks like 90-second reps in 15-minute bursts, with 30-minute recovery periods, for up to seven hours a day. When she trains for world championship meets, she is at the facility six or seven days a week for four months.Conditioning reflects this accordingly. “We have to do a lot of strengthening and stretching outside of the tunnel,” Poh says. “For a freestyle routine, we’re putting our bodies through one minute and 30 seconds of extreme spins, so we do a lot of warmups. And because we don’t have any impact with the ground, we’re using a bunch of our muscles that we would never use if we weren’t flying.”View image in fullscreenThere will be several family teams competing at the Australian indoor skydiving championships.Photograph: iFly DownunderFor Canberra-based skydiver Jakob Kapelj it’s all about shoulder training. “I do a lot of head-down positions in the tunnel.

Pursuing the indoor side began much more recently.“I was travelling a lot for work and we had a long layover down in Melbourne,” he says. “I thought that rather than sitting in the airport, eating crappy food and drinking beers, I’d go find something more productive to do.”A Google search and a quick taxi ride took Kapelj to the nearby iFly, where he “did a few sessions, had so much fun, and basically became obsessed”. Undeterred by the closest tunnel being in Penrith, he began making frequent trips north and progressing through skills development at an eye-watering pace. A mere two-and-a-half years later, and Kapelj will compete in these championships as his first official competition.View image in fullscreenThe Australian indoor skydiving championships run from 8-10 August at iFly in Western Sydney.Photograph: iFly DownunderHe won’t be alone when he does – his daughter Alia, 7, will also be making her debut in the junior contest. “The kids have so much fun,” Kapelj says. “They get creative, and they’re just playing in this really fun environment.”The sport itself can be quite an expensive pursuit, especially with the tunnel time required to compete at a high level. But with how quickly you can begin to master tricks, Kapelj believes it’s well worth the investment.“Have a go, and you’ll be surprised by how quickly you can be let off the grip with your instructor.

So it is no surprise that Kieran McKenna’s Ipswich are back in theChampionshipat the first opportunity.Should Birmingham emulate Friday night’s opponents, they have no intentions of following the same path. Every bold statement to emerge from the club over the summer makes it abundantly clear that this period in the second tier is expected to be brief. Sights have been set high and, on the basis of this performance against opposition that took points off clubs such as Chelsea, Tottenham and Aston Villa last season, it is easy to see why.Birmingham City v Ipswich Town: Championship opener – liveRead moreThere is, if not a swagger, then a visible belief in the way Birmingham’s players go about their business. That they were denied victory by a cruel added-time penalty decision should do little to detract from the dominance they showed for the majority of a fiery encounter.When Jay Stansfield smashed home from close range 10 minutes into the second half it was just rewards for the home side’s assured display, which looked set to earn them all three points. Alas, five minutes into the eight added on, an Ipswich corner was headed on to the arm of the substitute Lyndon Dykes, who knew nothing about it. George Hirst did not waste the opportunity to equalise from the penalty spot with the visitors’ only shot on target all night.“I thought it was really, really harsh,” said Birmingham head coach, Chris Davies, of the penalty decision. “He’s gone up, his arms are raised – you have to raise your arms to jump. It’s really harsh. That’s happened now and we have to take it. It had a huge impact on the game but it’s football. It can happen.”Nonetheless, Davies was delighted with his side’s performance: “I thought we were the better team, we dominated the match and deserved to win the match, but for the misfortune of a decision.“There was a lot to like. The players, it should give them confidence. We have retained the spirit, fight and determination we showed last season.”A fiercely contested match frequently boiled over into numerous melees involving multiple players from both teams. Footage from one of those immediately after Hirst’s converted penalty seemed to show a Birmingham fan attempt to strike the Ipswich midfielder Jack Taylor.“Jack’s alright,” said McKenna. “Somebody just showed me it. It’s obviously not ideal. The authorities will deal with it.”It is an intoxicating time to be a Birmingham supporter after watching their team set a Football League record for points (111) and wins (34) when romping to the League One title last season. There have been signings aplenty, bullish proclamations and a documentary that their American chair, Tom Wagner, boasted is one of “Amazon Prime’s top performing shows”.View image in fullscreenJay Stansfield rifles home after Kyogo Furuhashi’s chip left Ipswich goalkeeper Alex Palmer stranded to put Birmingham in front.Photograph: Nick Potts/PANo surprise, then, that St Andrew’s was bouncing long before kick-off. If the only trade-off local fans must make for such delirium is the slightly odd sight of a United States flag flying above their home stadium then it is one they will likely stomach happily.It took 55 minutes for the deadlock to be broken, but it seemed inevitable that it would be the hosts to do so, such was their casual dominance of the ball. Kyogo Furuhashi’s chip over the onrushing Alex Palmer rebounded off the far post and straight into the path of Stansfield, who had all the time in the world to rifle the follow-up past the defender Dara O’Shea on the line.Birmingham did not lose a single home league game last season and only one side who fell behind at St Andrew’s departed with a point.It looked for a long time as if Ipswich would not add to that tally, until the Dykes handball. Hirst struck his penalty low and firm down the middle.It was not the only decision that went against Birmingham. The hosts were unlucky not to take the lead after seven minutes, when the former Celtic forward Furuhashi – one of four summer signings in Birmingham’s starting XI – produced a wonderful lob over Palmer, only for the referee, Andrew Kitchen, to rule that he had fouled Jacob Greaves to win the ball. It was a soft decision, to say the least, prompting the home fans to voice their disdain.They would do so again when denied all three points at the death, but there was plenty elsewhere to hearten them.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipBirmingham CityIpswich Townmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

For me it’s Ashton Hall, an inspiring and cheerful man on YouTube whose fame has been brief, beautiful and as fragile as a butterfly lifespan. But who was for a period earlier this year the greatest influencer on the planet, propelled to that status by a video showing his “extreme morning routine”.The routine is amazing. It starts at 3.52am. The standard kick-off time for The Grind used to be 5am. Sod that. Ashton Hall gets up at 3.52. Ashton Hall gets up the day before to prepare for his getting up.In the video, fast-cut and excitingly soundtracked, he showcases a rigidly structured roster of wellness acts. He journals. He press-ups. He sprints. He prays. He moisturises with banana peel. Sombrely, tenderly, he dunks his face in iced mineral water. He leaps into a pool and lurks for ages, being well. We don’t get to see him vaping and having a shit. But if we did it would be slick, snappy, moving, cinematic and soundtracked by clunk, fizz, snap fzzt, pft, shtm.The Hundred can be a ‘multibillion-dollar product’ like the IPL, says Tech Titans chiefRead moreThe effect is visceral. Ashton Hall in his morning routine is like some super substance, like perfect human metal. His body is a clean space, his mind pristine. He looks as though he smells of musk, lemon, honey and breast milk. He looks like the wordReadinessand alsoLove, HopeandMoney, packed into a single preternaturally muscular torso, eyes like Roman candles, an avatar of American can-do, a place that is all frontier, where it’s always a sunrise, and where Ashton Hall is always out there at 3.52am like a sandpiper running ahead of the surf line.The routine ends with the start of his work day at 9.26am, signalled by an unseen hand presenting him with avocado on toast as he settles gravely at his desk. By this stage Ashton Hall has been up for almost six hours, brooding, banana-peeling, communing with his inner energy. And by now some alarm bells have begun to ring.The thing with Ashton Hall, the great unspoken question is … what does he actually do? What is all this preparation for? There is a vague hint of some kind of business being done. We hear him say: “We’ve got to get at least 10,000”, but he could be talking about playing Minecraft or making a Lego petrol station. Is anyone else on that phone line? Is it plugged in? Is the receiver actually a frankfurter?The fact is, and we can say this now because it has become a huge self-fulfilling success, the morning routineisthe thing. It is the content. Ashton Hall is a man who is always getting ready, whose business is being ready for business, like watching the same glittering marble endlessly shifted about between the cups of a street magician.This is the real brilliance of Ashton Hall. The routine is like a deeply caustic one-man art installation, a real-time satire on the decline of industry, on the fact all life is simply staging and show now, getting ready to be ready, because looking like a human engaged in human activity is the last remaining pillar of reality.Once you’ve accepted this it becomes deeply addictive. There is another video where you can watch Ashton Hall running for an hour, not actually going anywhere, just running, with a kind of Palladian symmetry to his lines and angles, arms pumping, all balance and perfect levers, a Leonardo set to the music of the spheres, or at least to the music of a high-energy techno montage.View image in fullscreenDavid Warner of London Spirit walks out to bat against Oval Invincibles.Photograph: Alex Davidson/ECB/Getty ImagesAnd this is fine because we are post activity now, post making or doing. Wealth is just numbers moving around. People are shapes and sounds. The world is a stage-set made of pixels. Ashton Hall knows this. He’s up at 4am preparing for it because preparing is content, because we will simply slide down the surface of things, beautifully.OK. Fine. A trick of the light. The thing that isn’t really a thing. A sales pitch that is, it turns out, the only product. What, you might ask, does this have to do with the Hundred? Well, there you make an interesting point.Because four years on, at the start of the final season before the new ownership kicks in, we can say this now. What the England and WalesCricketBoard has created is basically Ashton Hall cricket, a stage pretending to be a thing. And as things go, this isn’t even a very good one, to the extent that pound for pound, product versus hype, there is a fair argument the Hundred is the worst cricket thing ever invented.I’ve tried hard with it. I’ve watched the games and enjoyed the family vibe. There will always be good bits, because cricket is good. I know there are also commentators who like to say that the Hundred is good because it is disruptive and new, it freaks out the squares, and that’s all fine.Plus there is of course a more managed gush around the product. Everyone here is hyped up. Everyone is Ashton Halling it. More cynically the Hundred has done a good job of selling itself on the back of manipulative waffle about diversity and openness, notably the lie that this is the only way, the only way you hear, that women’s cricket can be properly funded.Kids like it, we are told. Do they? One key thing having kids tells you is that kids really shouldn’t be allowed to decide the best thing to do. Kids also like drinking four litres of Dr Pepper for dinner. As for that parroted line that young people only like short things and brain-frazzling clips on social media, this has long since been discredited. Try watching a Marvel film. It’s like sitting through six hours of medieval church music.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Hundred is just a bad product, bad sport, a force-grown entity that struggles to justify its bizarre state of prominence. The gear change froma brilliant Test seriesis the obvious point of contrast. But you don’t need to go that far. The Hundred has terrible staging. The cramming of a complex activity into such a small space means the basic nuts and bolts are weird and fiddly, with no room for narrative or for players to properly excel.The Hundred has generated very few moments. It has developed no male players. It has helped by giving female cricketers more games to play and an income stream, but has the England team got better or worse in its lifespan? Base, low-skill, tediously repetitive acts are met with head-slapping disbelief, booming victory music. This is just colour, noise, content without features. There are 32 Hundred games. Why? Why not screen the same one 32 times and rest the players?More widely, we know the Hundred has been a loss leader. As of this week we also know there is no evidence the Hundred has actually attracted any new people to the sport. Chuck in the confusion of the summer, an age of talented but pathway-less players, the Jacob Bethell effect.Does it really matter? This thing is clearly a stepping stone, a sellable warm-up routine, prep for the actual business of the future. In a final monetising of the family furniture theECBhas managed to sell this empty box for a lot of money.Chris Woakes may risk rehab over shoulder surgery in bid to be fit for AshesRead moreThere are two things worth saying about this. For all the backslapping over headline figures, this is basically severance money. It will keep some jobs running. It will also disappear into debt and losses like water down an open drain. Selling off the English summer. Is this really the most logical way of trying to save the English summer?And from this perspective there is also cause to be hopeful now. Change must be good. Basically, bring on the new owners as quickly as possible. I used to think the problem with English cricket was that it was run by marketing people. In fact the problem is being run by really bad marketing people.A common refrain is that the new owners won’t have English cricket’s interests at heart. Well, who has down the years? How could they be any worse than the previous administrators, a stream of semi-competent business people called things like Lord Cakebread and Sir Gordon Cardboard-Box?Making an English IPL, for example, sounds like an excellent idea. The IPL is for people who actually like cricket. It makes players. It works. At the very least it seems highly likely the new owners will move on from the silliest format and make it into a T20, a big step in the right direction.When that comes, who will remember this interlude, our Ashton Hall phase, noise and energy for the sake of noise and energy? English cricket’s admin arm has long since lost faith in making its best parts work and in the intelligence of its own customers. So bring on the future. Put down the hotdog phone. Remove the banana skin. Silence the generically shrieking voices. Can we just get on to the actual thing now?Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketECBfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Liverpool, who face the FA Cup winners, Crystal Palace, in theCommunity Shieldon Sunday, have since invested almost £300m on new talent and want to add the Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.Misses, fall-outs and late goals: Darwin Núñez’s Liverpool ride was eventful one | Andy HunterRead moreNo Premier League club has spent more than Liverpool but the champions will have recouped almost £200m should Darwin Núñezcomplete his move to Al-Hilal. The portrayal of Liverpool as lavish spenders, insists Slot, is misleading.“The net spend of us compared to the other teams is not in our favour if you look at the last two seasons,” he said. “It’s completely normal that we are one of the favourites, because we won it last season. And we brought in good players. Like all the other teams did, by the way. This is what makes this league so nice. I think there’s only been one exception [a team winning the league after a frugal summer] in the last two, three, four, five, six years, and that’sLiverpoollast season.“Every team in the Premier League is spending money. So if we are only favourites because we’ve spent a bit, I would see that as weird because we’ve lost a lot as well. But that we are favourites because we won it last season and we played so well, that’s clear. And the ambitions haven’t changed, because the ambition of this club is always to compete for every trophy.”View image in fullscreenHugo Ekitiké is one of Liverpool’s summer recruits.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersSlot believes it is premature to say Liverpool’s squad represents an upgrade on last season and says the departures of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Luis Díaz – as well as the tragic loss of Diogo Jota – cannot be ignored. “The players we’ve brought in have done really well already, as expected,” he said. “But I cannot tell you now if these players are able to perform at the same level every three days; we first have to start the season. And I did know Luis Díaz was able to do that, and all the other ones were able to do that. So that is another challenge in the Premier League, because we play so many games.“For Milos Kerkez, it’s going to be his first time at this level probably that he might have to play every three days. Florian Wirtz comes from the Bundesliga, where he was used to playing every three or four days, but we have to ask him in two months if the intensity levels of the Premier League are comparable with the Bundesliga.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not that his absence prevented the night’s subtext being all about the man who was not there.Liverpool should be title favourites but not because of spending, insists SlotRead moreAfterwards Howe admitted he “does not know what the future holds” for Isak after revealing he will continue to train in isolation next week. “We’ve had discussions and it’s clear we can’t involve him in the group at the moment,” said Newcastle’s manager. “I don’t know how long that will last. He is training later than the rest of the squad.“From our perspective we’d like to see him back with the team but the situation has to be right for the team. He’s contracted to us so, of course, there’s a chance he could play for Newcastle again. But I don’t know what the future holds.”Given Newcastle’s continuing struggles to sign a replacement, Howe was asked if he could simply insist that a player who swerved the club’s pre-season tour of Singapore and South Korea should honour his deal but the manager, who said he did not think the board had yet disciplined the 25-year-old, demurred. “It’s not that straightforward,” he said. “We’d have done that if we could but we’re not currently in a position to do that.“The team has, of course, been disrupted by this. But that doesn’t mean we can’t overcome this and come back even stronger.”View image in fullscreenMatt Targett heads Newcastle level against Espanyol in Friday’s friendly at St James’ Park.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAThe sight of more than 20,000 empty seats on Friday night at a customarily full arena will alarm Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian ownership but the sparse crowd was arguably more about Howe saving most of his first XI for Saturday afternoon’s second La Liga friendly against Atlético Madrid than an outright mutiny at an admittedly dismal transfer window before a Champions League campaign.In Isak’s absence, and with his fellow striker Callum Wilson having moved to West Ham, the endearingly enthusiastic but hugely inexperienced Will Osula led the attacking line as Newcastle, with the outstanding Lewis Miley looking like an England central midfielder in the making, were left without a victory in this troubled pre-season.With a decent striker on the pitch they would arguably have won. The only problem is that the entire No 9 species seem to have developed an allergy to Tyneside. Bryan Mbeumo, João Pedro, Liam Delap and Benjamin Sesko rank among those forwards who have turned Newcastle down and the St James’ Park board will not countenance selling Isak to Anfield for a sum well in excess of £110m until two new attacking faces are secured.With the transfer window’s closure fast approaching it is all turning into a race against the clock, not to mention a game of who blinks first. Despiteexcluding Isak from a training ground barbecuelast week in the wake of the striker’s unsanctioned trip to train alone at his old club Real Sociedad, Howe still does not know where the striker who scored 27 goals for him last season will be playing when Liverpool visit on this month’s bank holiday Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would surely be much better to reinvest Liverpool’s fee on some decent new players – the Coventry midfielder Jack Rudoni anyone? – and create a new hero or two.Although a good-humoured, family-dominated crowd of just over 30,000 was not exactly typical of the more vehemently partisan Premier League crew, there is a sense that many Newcastle fans have already loosened the emotional ties that until very recently bound them tightly to Isak. Granted they feel more than a little let down but there is a mood of almost shrugging acceptance that Liverpool have turned his head and they will never again sing their former Abba-pastiche anthem, Gimme, Gimme a Striker from Sweden.Should Yoane Wissa, Ollie Watkins, Nicolas Jackson – (not that Newcastle fans seem overly keen on him) – Jørgen Strand Larsen, Samu Aghehowa, Gonçalo Ramos or any other potential attacking recruits start scoring regularly it will surely be a case of “the king is dead, long live the king”.In any case, Howe already has a Targett on his side. Matt, a veteran full-back, operating on the left of a midfield three, discovered his latent Isak streak as he met Miley’s cross to head Newcastle level after Edu Expósito has expertly half-volleyed Espanyol into the lead. After that Newcastle’s impressive debutant in goal, the Southampton loanee Aaron Ramsdale, saved Javi Puado’s penalty before Murphy’s goal preceded Kike García’s deserved leveller.There is evidently much work to be done on Tyneside before next weekend’s Premier League opener at Aston Villa. “The balance of our squad isn’t quite right,” said Howe. “But I’m hopeful we can adjust that in the next couple of weeks.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweTransfer windowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The start of competition in Mason, Ohio also marked her first day of training withher new coach Francisco Roig. She was determined to make the most of it.Having already trained in the afternoon, Raducanu and Roig spent the evening working quietly through each shot in her game. Alongside ample technical conversations about her groundstrokes and second serve, there was also plenty of laughter as the pair began the task of learning more about each other and how their personalities match. Only a furious evening downpour forced them off the court.Emma Raducanu: ‘I hope Francisco Roig can help me beat the top players’Read moreWhile many ofRaducanu’s numerous coaching changeshave come during difficult moments in her career, this is rather a hopeful occasion. This tournament is something of a milestone for Raducanu, who has earned a seeding of No 30 in a reflection of the consistent training and match wins that have allowed her to rebuild her ranking over the past few months. Now No 27 in the WTA Race with few points to defend until the end of the year, she has a great opportunity to finish even higher and make an impression at the US Open later this month.As she has built confidence in her game, Raducanu has performed well against mid-ranked players, but it is also clear the current iteration of her game has a ceiling. She has consistently looked underpowered against the biggest shotmakers and she is not quite quick enough to frustrate them with her defensive capabilities. After following up hersemi-final run in Washingtonwith two wins in Montreal, this was further reinforced by her 6-2, 6-1defeat against the recent Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimovain the third round last week. The challenge for Raducanu and Roig over the coming months will be to see how she can use her abilities to test the best players in the world.Her tournament will begin on Saturday afternoon with a tough match against Olga Danilovic of Serbia, who scuppered a potential all-British second-round match by defeating a struggling Katie Boulter 6-0, 7-5 on Thursday. Should Raducanu win, she could face the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, in the third round on Monday.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu and her new coach Francisco Roig appear to have been practising well together but will have to establish their working relationship.Photograph: Frey/TPN/Getty ImagesWith so many top players opting out of the first weeks of the US hard-court swing, Cincinnati marks a significant moment in the buildup to the US Open as many of the main contenders attempt to build their form for the final grand slam tournament of the year.

Leaks have become not only common but expected, by clubs, journalists and agents. So whenPortounveiled Luuk de Jong, it stunned the football world. Not even employees and teammates knew until moments before his presentation at a friendly against Atlético Madrid. So how did they pull it off?What unfolded was a story with the intrigue of a spy thriller. The striker was the last to board the plane he took from the Netherlands to Porto last Sunday and timed his arrival on matchday to avoid crossing paths with anyone. Upon landing, he was the first off the plane and ushered into a van with tinted windows that drove him to the stadium. His entourage – anonymous to fans – collected his luggage.Darwin Núñez expected to join Al-Hilal after Liverpool agree £46.3m feeRead moreIn the van the club’s social media team were secretly gathering footage. “It’s quite strange,” De Jong told them. “In these times, with so much social media, to keep something like this a secret … It’s going to be a big surprise. Let’s hope we can keep it quiet until the presentation.”The real challenge was yet to come: the medical. To avoid raising suspicion, Porto had registered De Jong in the clinic’s system as a handball player. The doctors and nurses had no idea they were assessing a high-profile football transfer.Once the examinations were done, De Jong took a service lift from the clinic’s garage to the Estádio do Dragão’s first floor. There, he had a meal and waited. From a window, he watched his soon-to-be teammates arrive and saw them greeted by cheering fans, high fives exchanged and autographs signed. For three to four hours regular checks for leaks were made on social media among those in the know.As kick-off approached, it was finally time to introduce De Jong to the team. The head coach, Francesco Farioli, gathered the squad in the dressing room and shocked them by walking in with the former Barcelona and Netherlands striker. After a short speech from Farioli, De Jong said hello to each player in turn. He will compete with Samu Aghehowa and Deniz Gül to lead the attack.It was with shock and disbelief that the 49,000 fans in attendance greeted De Jong, who scored 18 goals and provided 13 assists for PSV last season before his contract expired. The stadium announcer had been calling the players out one by one and before introducing the captain, the last to be summoned, he teased a surprise signing, listing his previous clubs.Then came the reveal: “And now, our new No 26, Luuk de Jong” – the cue for the 6ft 2in centre-forward to walk on to the pitch. Club journalists broadcasting the presentation had to look up his name to check his stats, caught out like everyone else. The plan was a success.View image in fullscreenLuuk de Jong celebrates scoring for PSV Eindhoven in May 2025, in one of his last games for the club.Photograph: Robin van Lonkhuijsen/EPA“I have to give credit to what Porto did with Luuk de Jong because there are always a lot of people involved,” says Pedro Mendes, the former Porto, Spurs and Portugal midfielder turned agent for MNM Sports Management. “When negotiations are being done for a player, you have the agents, the buying club, [often] a selling club, even the player’s family. The footballer can ask for friends’ or relatives’ opinions. Even inside the club, you have the scouting department, the financial director. It’s extremely difficult.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIf a leak happens in the early stages, the deal can be irreversibly damaged, Mendes says. He strives to keep deals under wraps but, in the age of social media, that has become nearly impossible. “At the airport, there is a system in place to see who goes in or out,” he says. “When I was a player, that didn’t exist. From our end, we try to keep everything private.”In the 80s and 90s, Porto had a tradition of unveiling a surprise signing at what they term their presentation friendly. Back then keeping a secret was relatively easy — you just had to keep the newspapers at bay. The president, André Villas-Boas, wanted to revive that tradition, rekindling a childhood memory and offering fans an unforgettable moment.“The president told me he remembered that, when he was a kid, the presentation day always came with a surprise,” De Jong said. “A player they didn’t know just walking out of the tunnel. He told me it would be amazing if we were able to achieve this today, especially with social media, travelling and airports. I told him we could give it a try.”Farioli, who coached Ajax last season, led the negotiations with De Jong. The 34-year-old was convinced by the project and signed a one-year deal with an option to extend for another season. The process between the initial talks and the signing took about a week. Only Villas-Boas and a handful of Porto’s top directors knew and, for a fleeting moment, football returned to a bygone era.Explore more on these topicsPortoTransfer windowPSV EindhovenEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Coll still saved efforts from Beth Mead – after a retake – and Leah Williamson during the shootout, which England won 3-1.“The Spanish keeper had it on her bottle,” Hampton told TalkSport. “So I thought when she was going in goal I’ll just pick it up and throw it into the English fans so she can’t have it.”The Chelsea player added: “I never put it on a bottle because anyone can do that, so that is why I put it on my arm, and the TV caught that. It wasn’t hard – when she has gone in the goal it [the bottle] is on its own, isn’t it? It is in a towel, you just pick it up.“Mine is blank, but it has the same sponsors and stuff so I just put mine in there, chucked her one into the fans and she had an empty bottle. She was looking for where it is. She was walking back and I was walking the other way. She was so confused. I was trying so hard not to burst out laughing [because] I was like: ‘Oh, I don’t know where it has gone’ … but you have got to do something haven’t you?”England also came through adramatic penalty shootout win over Swedenen route to Euros glory, in which both sides failed to convert spot-kicks at crucial moments. Hampton described that shootout as “traumatic” and “horrendous”.She said: “Before the games we as a keeper group have meetings and we analyse every penalty that each individual from the opposing team has had. I think Alexia [Putellas] had 46 penalties we had to sit there and watch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s the logical endpoint of a culture fluent in irony, addicted to attention and hollowed out by meaninglessnessFri 8 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 10.12 EDTShareThe first dildo dropped from the sky like a glitch in the matrix. For anyone tuned in to the 29 July game between the Atlanta Dream and Golden State Valkyries, the initial reaction was disbelief. In a world where feeds are increasingly AI-generated and algorithmically tuned for confusion, the boundaries between real and unreal have softened into clay. Our senses, once reliable, now compete with simulation. What does it mean when dildos become airborne at WNBA games?Not once,not twice,but repeatedly? Protest? Performance art? Or just another malformed blip in the automated dreamscape we scroll through daily?Another WNBA game disrupted by sex toy thrown on court in ChicagoRead moreTwo men have been arrested thus far in these grotesque affronts.One was 18,the other 23, part of Gen Z, the prime consumer of debased meme culture. Authorities have not identified suspects in the most recent two dildo-throwing incidents. However, Delbert Carver, a 23-year-old man, was arrested in connection with the first incident during a WNBA game in Atlanta. According to ESPN, Carver may face charges of disorderly conduct, public indecency or indecent exposure and criminal trespass. In an affidavit, he allegedly admitted that the act was “supposed to be a joke” and intended “to go viral”.When dildos become airborne atWNBAgames more than once, the meaning shifts. It reveals the collapse of coherence under TikTok’s attention economy. These aren’t protests or insults that make a point. They’re spectacles. The goal is to provoke. In a memetic landscape poisoned by irony, absurdity is the point. The dildo isn’t symbolic. Its function is noise.Philosopher Guy Debord would be shocked at how on the nose we have become. His work argued we live in a “society of the spectacle,” where life is mediated through image, and authenticity is replaced by performance. Today, women’s sports are doubly mediated, first through the lens of athletic competition, then through the social gaze that still questions their legitimacy. Laura Mulvey’s theory of the “male gaze” further sharpens this: Women, particularly in visual media, are often positioned not as agents but as objects. In this context, female athletes are not merely participants in a game. They’re props in someone else’s viral moment. The dildo becomes mise-en-scène.The memeification of rebellionBut this isn’t just theoretical. It’s real. So is the disrespect. The dildo is a weaponized farce. It’s thrown not just to interrupt but to dominate the narrative, to remind players that their gender, their careers and their stage remain vulnerable to mockery. It stops the game. Hijacks it, even. And reasserts the notion, violent and comical, that women’s achievements exist on borrowed time within a culture still conditioned to belittle them.So far, the suspects in these cases are part of Gen Z, a generation raised in and by the internet. Their actions cannot be dismissed as isolated provocations. They must be contextualized within TikTok’s cultural logic, or worse, the absurdist ethos of “Skibidi Toilet”. If you are a normally functioning adult with a job, you might ask, “What is Skibidi Toilet?”Skibidi Toiletis a viral animated web series featuring surreal, low-resolution battles between human heads protruding from toilets and humanoid characters with surveillance equipment for heads. Glitchy visuals, overstimulating pacing, and meme loops create a vibe without meaning.But to understand these trolls’ intentions, and see the direction society is headed, we must contextualize them within TikTok’s cultural logic. The garish green dildo mirrors the surreal, low-fi, uncanny aesthetic of Skibidi Toilet or any number of algorithm-fueled meme cycles. The dildo is an anti-symbol. Its meaning is its absurdity. Skibidi brainrot encapsulates a generation fluent in irony but starved for meaning. The dildo is funny not because it says something, but because it says nothing. It’s the irrational object breaking into a space of rationality.View image in fullscreenTwo of the WNBA sex toy-throwing incidents have taken place during games involving Sophie Cunningham and the Indiana Fever.Photograph: Ron Jenkins/Getty ImagesThis kind of hyper-chaotic media serves as both entertainment and an ambient worldview for young men raised online. Their minds normalize prank-as-expression. In this context, throwing a dildo on to the court during a WNBA game isn’t just an act of crude rebellion. It sadly mirrors the Skibidi Toilet ethos: low-effort disruption cloaked in irony, where the gesture is meant to be meaningless and provocative at once. As traditional signifiers of rebellion (punk, political protest, counterculture) fade or fragment in the digital noise, young men are absorbing frameworks of meaninglessness, where “funny = power” and shock is its own reward.Furthering the chronically online element of all this, in the last two days,a crypto memecoin group has claimed creditfor the recent dildo-throwing incidents at WNBA games, reframing what seemed like rogue trolling as a deliberate guerrilla marketing stunt. The group, which openly mocks the league and brags about not watching women’s sports, celebrated the act online as a victory. If true, this spectacle is engineered by people who understand that visibility matters more than meaning in an algorithm-driven culture.This is how meme culture is rotting America: not from the inside, but from online. The internet’s lack of regulation is its greatest strength and its most dangerous flaw. It allows once-fringe ideologies and juvenile impulses to scale without resistance. Ideas that would have died in solitude or been challenged in a public square now find shelter in forums and meme loops, rewarded by engagement. In this new economy of attention, even humiliation has utility. We’re left with a culture where trolling becomes its own form of marketing.From trolls to Trump: the end of shameHow did we arrive at this level of collective debasement? Despite living in an era of unprecedented digital access,over half of American adults (54%) read below a sixth-grade level, and 21% are considered illiterate as of 2022. This foundational deficit in literacy undermines a person’s ability to evaluate online messages critically. Thus, a generation raised on irony struggles to decode satire, or even manipulation. Back in 2013, 66% of fourth graders couldn’t read proficiently. It was a warning sign that today’s adults would fail to distinguish viral provocation from genuine meaning. Online, many young people now build identity from meme fragments, unconsciously mimicking behavior they don’t fully understand. Lacking media literacy, they become perfect vessels for cultural incoherence.All of this really boils down to the death of shame within society. And it starts at the top. Donald Trump’s most enduring legacy isn’t a policy but a persona as the shameless troll who made humiliation a political strategy. His constant provocation and gleeful disdain for norms created a playbook both parties use now. Liberals respond with faux-moral outrage, conservatives with Nietzschean bravado, but the end result is the same: a culture addicted to performance, where shame is no longer a deterrent.This logic has trickled down into every corner of public life through race, class, gender and especially online culture, where symbolic acts of ressentiment become viral currency. The dildo thrown at a women’s basketball game isn’t just a crude joke but a memeified act of humiliation. It doesn’t challenge power on any level, it just wants attention. And in a culture without shame, the humiliation sticks to the target, not the perpetrator. In this case, the WNBA players themselves.The fact that these incidents have popped up simultaneously across the country, from New York to Atlanta to Chicago, shows that the lack of shame is collective, bipartisan and here to stay. This is where we are: everything is bait. We’ve collapsed the distinction between trolling and activism, and so we land – like the dildo itself – on the bottom of the floor, laughing, recording, retweeting, but never asking what it says about who we’ve become.Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Just glimpsing or half-hearing the headlines can be enough to plunge you into a sinkhole of gloom.If it’s not the Trump administrationending $500m worth of fundingfor the very vaccine programmes that helped rescue billions from the menace of Covid – as part of Robert F Kennedy Jr’s determined effort to rollback mass immunisation, one of the greatest gifts science has given humankind – it’s the ongoing agony of Gaza, only set to increase after Benjamin Netanyahu responded to a global outcry over his use of starvation as a weapon not by moving to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the strip, as so desperately needed, but rather to escalate the war yet further, his security cabinet agreeing early Friday morning totake over Gaza City.If it’s not a climate crisis that seesheat records brokensummer after summer, it’s themassacre in Sudan of more than 1,500 civilianssheltering in a camp for displaced people, the attack conducted over 72 bloody hours by paramilitaries backed by the United Arab Emirates, a western ally.Or it’s the steady breakdown of tolerance that had held, imperfectly, for decades – witness those with loud megaphones who have beenall but urging their followersto stage a repeat of last August’s violence in England and Northern Ireland directed at asylum seekers or the Spanish town that hasbanned the celebration of Muslim religious festivalsin public spaces.The supply of bad news is voluminous and apparently without end. You lament what is happening now, with the proliferation of social media pumping out falsehood, whether AI-generated or human-made, and hate – and then you are reminded of our recent past. Wednesday marked 80 years to the day since an atomic bomb, surely one of the darkest bequests science has given humankind, took the lives ofas many as 140,000 peoplein Hiroshima.All this could lead even a sane person to despair of their fellow human beings and what they are capable of. The urge is strong to run away, to turn off the news and escape.And yet that presents a new problem: guilt. When wars rage and innocents are slaughtered, it can feel selfish, even frivolous, to think about or pay attention to anything else. “Don’t look away,” urge those posting graphic horror on social media. Yet the need to look away, and to get away, is compelling, precisely because of the turmoil all around.Tentatively, I want to make a moral case for escapism, for allowing oneself a break from world events. Not on the therapeutic grounds of personal wellbeing and mental health – though those are surely obvious – but as an essential means of retaining our ability to see the world, and the people, around us.My own somewhat guilty pleasure this summer has been to follow the contest between the England and India cricket teams, which came to a thrilling climax on Monday. I appreciate that there will be some Guardian readers – and not only in the US – who will be poised to swipe, or turn, the page at the mere mention of the word cricket. But stay with me, because this is not a point about sport, but about life.Across five separate matches, each one played from morning till dusk for five straight days, these two sides of 11 men did battle with everything they had. It was a physically gruelling competition. The England captain, Ben Stokes, who looks as if he could have commanded a platoon of men in the trenches at the Somme, has a body that has been battered through years of relentless exertion. He is an all-rounder, both batter and bowler, which , combined with his leadership duties, means he scarcely rests. After one of the five matches, he wasconfined to bed for four days.The third Test match was won at the death thanks to a ball delivered by England’s Shoaib Bashir. He managed to spin it in such a way that it confounded the opponent who faced it, and he did that despite nursing a broken finger. In the closing moments of the final match on Monday, England’s Chris Woakes walked out to the middle, apparently ready to face a hard, heavy cricket ball hurtling at him at a terrifying 90mph, with one arm in a sling, his shoulder dislocated. When he ran, his face was a rictus of pain. In the end, England fell just short.It was an enthralling 25 days, sometimes played out in searing summer sun, sometimes interrupted by July rain. What we witnessed from both teams was a display of determination so extreme, it is rarely glimpsed outside the realms of violent fanaticism. There were moments of folly and failure, dropped catches and bad decisions, but these were athletes aiming for, and often reaching, the heights of true excellence. You didn’t have to be a fan of cricket to find the sight exhilarating. In the end the series was drawn, and perhaps that was oddly fitting. The teams had matched each other in their resolve not to be beaten.You could say the same of the Lionesses, the England women who got so close to defeat at the European football championships they all but found a seat for it on the team bus, but who never succumbed. Their commitment to succeeding, to being better, was riveting to see.But it’s not confined to sport. Watch the performances of Florence Hunt and Rory Walton-Smith, the two young leads in theBBC drama Mix Tape, and you see a perfect evocation of first love. Or you could read this week a touching account of what is surely avaledictory tour by the great Paul Simon. The author noted how Simon’s voice is no longer what it was, how “It’s lost its highs & lows, stuck in a breathy mid-range.” The band on stage adjust accordingly, but “Simon is such an artist, so instinctively musical, he makes the most of the voice he’s got, wringing every little bit of feeling & nuance out of it. You can see him working at it, just as obsessively committed to quality as ever.”That obsessive pursuit of excellence is the thread that runs throughJohn & Paul, Ian Leslie’s quite brilliant study of Lennon and McCartney and the enduring music each spurred the other to produce. It’s a reminder of what humans can do, the heights they can reach, the joy they can bring.None of it makes any of the other stuff go away. Trump is still there when the Test match ends; death still stalks Gaza when you close Leslie’s book. But it is a useful antidote all the same. No, not useful – essential. For it’s when we feel ourselves plunged into the abyss, when our despair at our fellow human beings pulls strongest, that we most need to look upward – and glimpse the stars.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCricketOpinionWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s the thing, Bret. It almost certainly is.Let’s start with the official figure from Gaza’s ministry of health, the one all media outlets cite, which is around 60,000 direct deaths – 18,500 of whom are children. These numbers, according to theEconomist, are derived from two lists. One is based on information from hospitals. The other is based on an online survey in which people report their relatives’ deaths. While there are numerous pro-Israel voices keen to discredit the death toll, the Economist notes that “[i]ndependent investigators have confirmed that those on the ministry’s two lists have almost certainly died”.Humanitarian agencieshave also said that, historically, statistics from the ministry of health are reliable.While Stephens may not think 60,000 dead Palestinians is much to worry about, it’s a huge number: the equivalent of a 9/11 happening every day for 20 days. But, due to limitations in capturing data, that number is also almost certainly a massive underestimate. It is far more likely that the real death toll is in the hundreds of thousands. And by “real death toll” I mean direct deaths from military campaignsandindirect deaths due to the famine created by Israel’s siege on Gaza, as well as deaths from preventable illnesses or medical conditions that couldn’t be treated due to Israel’s blockade on medical supplies and destruction of hospitals. It also means bodies that are rotting under the rubble and may never be formally identified. In January of this year, it was estimated there were atleast 10,000 bodiesburied under the wreckage of Gaza.As I sit here in Australia watching Israel starve Palestinians to death, I can’t help but think it could have been me | Plestia AlaqadRead moreTrying to figure out the real death toll is difficult – by design. Infrastructure in Gaza has been almost completely obliterated: the UN estimates up to92%of all residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict. Many of the hospitals, which played a key part in counting the dead, have been destroyed or are barely functioning. Israeli strikes have repeatedly causedinternetand phone blackouts. Gaza, more generally, has become what Israel’s leaders and influencers promised to make itfrom the very beginning: a place where no human being can live.Meanwhile, Israel has refused to allow foreign reporters free access into Gaza (although it takes some on heavily curated propaganda trips),systematically murderedPalestinian journalists on the ground andhampered effortsfor independent third-party investigations into mass graves and suspected war crimes. These are not exactly the actions of a party that has nothing to hide.Despite the difficulty of counting fatalities, there have been several attempts to calculate a more accurate death toll. In July 2024, for example, theLancet medical journal published a letterfrom respected scientists which tried to calculate indirect deaths, noting that in “recent conflicts, such indirect deaths range from three to 15 times the number of direct deaths”. The authors suggested that by this measure, “it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza”. Writing in the Guardian in September 2024, Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, noted that the Lancet estimates were “very conservative” and extrapolated the methodology to estimate about335,500 deaths in totalby the end of 2024. We are now, of course, inching towards the end of 2025.Then, in January 2025,research published in the Lancetestimated that the death toll in the first nine months of war was about 40% higher than numbers recorded by the Palestinian territory’s health ministry. The peer-reviewed statistical analysis was conducted by academics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Yale University and other institutions. This used death toll data from the health ministry, and social media obituaries to estimate that there were between 55,298 and 78,525 deaths from traumatic injuries in Gaza up to 30 June 2024. Again: that’s just direct deaths from traumatic injuries and those numbers are from more than a year ago now.In June 2025, anew studyled by Michael Spagat, a researcher of war and armed conflict at the University of London, estimated that more than 80,000 Palestinians had been killed in Israel’s military campaign in Gaza between 7 October 2023 and 5 January 2025. This study, which has not been peer-reviewed yet, wasconducted independentof Gaza’s ministry of health records and is the first actual empirical study: researchers on the ground surveyed a sample of 2,000 households, representative of Gaza’s population before 7 October 2023. Of those deaths, 75,200 were classified as violent deaths and 8,540 were “indirect” deaths.All of which to say: we have absolutely no idea how many people have been killed in Gaza. And, now that Gaza hasslid into man-made famine, documenting the dead will only become harder. Throughout 2025,Iraq Body Count(IBC) has been publishing, with permission, English versions of the victim names lists irregularly produced by the information unit within Gaza’s ministry of health. Spokespeople from IBC have said the team of 15 people at the ministry of health, who have been documenting the dead in Gaza, are now starving and at serious risk of becoming unable to continue their work.While numbers don’t matter for the purpose of proving a genocide, I would bet my own life that the number is much higher than the 60,000 figure media outlets report. Go look at therare picturesthat have come out of Gaza, which is a wasteland, and tell me you don’t agree. At this stage it feels like journalistic malpractice to talk about 60,000 people being dead, without explaining that the number is likely far higher.I would love to be proved wrong on all this. I would love to find out that Israel has “only” killed 60,000 people. I would love to find out that all the children who arebeing shot in the headjust carelessly walked into bullets and weren’t beingdeliberately targeted. I would be ecstatic to discover that the IVF center in Gaza that was destroyed by Israel wasn’t targeted, as a UN report says, aspart of an effort to destroy“in part the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group”.And it would be very easy for Israel’s government, which keeps screaming “blood libel” as accusations of genocide mount, to correct the record if it wanted to. It could let foreign journalists have unfettered access to Gaza. It could allow independent agencies to conduct investigations. But it will not do any of these things. So, to echo Bret Stephens, the first question the pro-Israel “there’s no genocide chorus” needs to answer is: Why won’t Israel let independent parties verify the death count? I think we all know the answer to that.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnistThis article was amended on 8 August 2025.

But it can also facilitate exploitation of very human needsFri 8 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 04.48 EDTShareJoaquin Oliver was 17 years old when he was shot in the hallway of his high school. An older teenager, expelled some months previously, had opened fire with a high-powered rifle on Valentine’s Day in what becameAmerica’s deadliest high school shooting. Seven years on, Joaquin says he thinks it’s important to talk about what happened on that day in Parkland, Florida, “so that we can create a safer future for everyone”.But sadly, what happened to Joaquin that day is that he died. The oddly metallic voice speaking to the ex-CNN journalist Jim Acostain an interviewon Substack this week was actually that of a digital ghost: an AI, trained on the teenager’s old social media posts at the request of his parents, who are using it tobolster their campaignfor tougher gun controls. Like many bereaved families, they have told their child’s story over and over again to heartbreakingly little avail. No wonder they’re pulling desperately at every possible lever now, wondering what it takes to get dead children heard in Washington.But they also wanted, his father, Manuel, admits, simply to hear their son’s voice again. His wife, Patricia,spends hoursasking the AI questions, listening to him saying: “I love you, Mommy.”No parent in their right mind would ever judge a bereaved one. If it’s a comfort to keep the lost child’s bedroom as a shrine, talk to their gravestone, sleep with a T-shirt that still faintly smells like them, then that’s no business of anyone else’s. People hold on to what they can. After 9/11, families listened until the tapes physically ran out to answerphone messages left by loved ones, calling home to say goodbye from burning towers and hijacked planes. I have a friend who still regularly re-reads old WhatsApp exchanges with her late sister, and another who occasionally texts her late father’s number with snippets of family news: she knows he isn’t there, of course, but isn’t quite ready to end the conversation yet. Some people even pay psychics to commune, in suspiciously vague platitudes, with the dead. But it’s precisely because it’s so hard to let go that grief is vulnerable to exploitation. And there may soon be big business in digitally bringing back the dead.As with the mawkishAI-generated videoRod Stewartplayed on stage this week, featuring the late Ozzy Osbourne greeting various dead music legends, that might mean little more than glorified memes. Or it might be for a temporary purpose, such as the AI avatarrecently createdby the family of a shooting victim in Arizona to address the judge at the gunman’s sentencing. But in time, it may be something more profoundly challenging to ideas of selfhood and mortality. What if it were possible to create a permanent AI replica of someone who had died, perhaps in robot form, and carry on the conversation with them for ever?View image in fullscreenAn AI image of Ozzy Osbourne and Tina Turner shown at a Rod Stewart concert in the US, August 2025.Photograph: Iamsloanesteel InstagramResurrection is a godlike power, not for surrendering lightly to some tech bro with a messiah complex. But while the legal rights of the living not to have their identities stolen for use in AI deepfakes arebecoming more established, the rights of the dead are muddled.Reputation dies with us – the dead can’t be libelled – while DNA isposthumously protected. (The 1996birth of Dolly the sheep, a genetic clone copied from a single cell, triggered globalbans on human cloning.) The law governs the respectful disposal of human tissue, but it’s not bodies that AI will be trained on: it’s the private voicenotes and messages and pictures of what mattered to a person. When my father died, personally I never felt he was really in the coffin. He was so much more obviously to be found in the boxes of his old letters, the garden he planted, the recordings of his voice. But everyone grieves differently. What happens if half of a family wants Mum digitally resurrected, and the other half doesn’t want to live with ghosts?That the Joaquin Oliver AI can never grow up – that he will be for ever 17, trapped in the amber of his teenage social media persona – is ultimately his killer’s fault, not his family’s. Manuel Oliver says he knows full well the avatar isn’t really his son, and he isn’t trying to bring him back. To him, it seems more a natural extension of the way the family’s campaign already evokes Joaquin’s life story. Yet there’s something unsettling about the plan to give his AI access to a social media account, to upload videos and gain followers. What if it begins hallucinating, or veering on to topics where it can’t possibly know what the real Joaquin would have thought?While for now there’s a telltale glitchiness about AI avatars, as technology improves it may become increasingly hard to distinguish them from real humans online. Perhaps it won’t be long before companies or even government agencies already using chatbots to deal with customer inquiries start wondering if they could deploy PR avatars to answer journalists’ questions. Acosta, aformer White House correspondent, should arguably have known better than to muddy the already filthy waters in a post-truth world by agreeing to interview someone who doesn’t technically exist. But for now, perhaps the most obvious risk is of conspiracy theorists citing this interview as “proof” that any story challenging to their beliefs could be a hoax, the same deranged liefamously peddledby Infowars host Alex Jones about the Sandy Hook school shootings.The professional challenges involved here, however, are not just for journalists. As AI evolves, we will all increasingly be living with synthetic versions of ourselves. It won’t just be the relatively primitive Alexa in your kitchen or chatbot in your laptop – though already there are stories of peopleanthropomorphisingAI or evenfalling in lovewith ChatGPT – but something much more finely attuned to human emotions. When one in 10 British adults tell researchers they haveno close friends, of course there will be a market for AI companions, just as there is today for getting a cat or scrolling through strangers’ lives on TikTok.Perhaps, as a society, we will ultimately decide we’re comfortable with technology meeting people’s needs when other humans sadly have not. But there’s a big difference between conjuring up a generic comforting presence for the lonely and waking the dead to order, one lost loved one at a time. There is a time to be born and a time to die, according to the verse so often read at funerals. How will it change us as a species, when we are no longer sure which is which?Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Itsproposed adjustmentto council tax in England is crude and possibly cruel, and does nothing to help with Rachel Reeves’s “missing £40bn”. It is designed merely to shift money from rich regions to poor ones, and thus correct an imbalance in Britain’s regional wealth. As such it is overdue and welcome.British budgetary policy used to be classy. It was top hats and secrets and standing room only in parliament. Now it comprises a scruffy marathon of leaks, squeaks and denials. Lobbies form, rebels threaten and ministers pledge and unpledge.The local government secretary,Angela Rayner, has sought advice on a scheme to adjust the regional burden of council tax, unreformed since it replaced poll tax in 1993. The change is aimed at correcting its most severe defect: that poor people pay more in tax than in fairness they should, and rich people pay less. Government grants do not compensate councils accordingly.Thus at its crudest, the system means that a band H property in Hartlepool, County Durham, pays£3,000 a year morein council tax than a multimillion-pound townhouse in Westminster. On my own two-bedroom house in Wales, the basic council tax is £3,862. On my London house, many times its value, the tax going to the local borough is half that, just £1,850. Ever since this tax was introduced 30 years ago no government minister has dared order a national revaluation of properties, despite wild leaps in house prices. Nor has there been any widening of tax bands. A revaluation due in 2005was ditchedby the then local government secretary, David Miliband, who admitted it was done out of sheer fear.Keir Starmer has no excuse for letting this continue. He has a big majority. Local government finance is in chaos. Many councils face bankruptcy. Services are closing everywhere, especially discretionary ones such as youth clubs, childcare and museums. He is clearly minded to do something, but he appears terrified of radicalism. He simply wants to tilt central grants more towards poorer councils at the expense of rich ones, and leave the system the same.Astudy of the planby the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests some bizarre consequences. The central government grant to local councils is to be reallocated through a morass of algorithms assessing local needs. Central grants would be slashed for 186 councils and increased for 161. Thirty councils would see their grants cut by more than 10% in the next three years, and some inner London boroughs by as much as 25%.The maths is beyond comprehension. The south-east does badly, which is to be expected. Yorkshire, Manchester and, for some reason, the East Midlands do well. Norwich, Crawley and indeed Enfield and Hillingdon also fare well. Suffolk and Leicestershire are losers, while Slough and Harlow are winners. Indeed, the more you look down the list, the more you wonder how officials worked it out, beavering away in their Whitehall attic. It seems suspiciously tilted to areas gained by Reform UK.The change would go some way to meeting Boris Johnson’s bid to “level up” regional Britain, though he did little levelling himself beyond inventing the phrase. He rightly drew attention to the fact that the UK’s disparity in disposable income between rich and poor, south and north, is nowstatistically widerthan that of any country in the EU. Regional poverty impedes productivity, investment and national growth.As for council tax, even when he was mayor of London, Johnsonprotested at the gapbetween what “a Russian oligarch is paying on his stuccoed schloss in Kensington” and “what such a gentleman might be asked to pay in Paris or New York”. At least if the oligarch had a second home in Cornwall or Wales, he might now be hit with a council tax surcharge that could reachup to £10,000 a year.In other words, Starmer and Rayner may be hoping to reverse some of the disparity between councils in rich and poor parts of the country. They will hardly be reversing it between rich and poor individuals. Taxpayers in rich areas may see their bills rise steeply, perhaps even by more than the normal limit of 5%. But that is the nearest this reform gets to a mansion tax.What Rayner appears to lack the guts to do is tackle the central unfairness built into the council tax. The time is surely overdue to revise the wildly out-of-date valuations of taxable properties, and the wildly limited range of bands by which the tax is assessed. It is absurd for the richest houses to be charged just three times the poorest. A two-bedroom flat should not be paying only a third of what a sumptuous palace pays. A clearbasis for revaluationis outlined by the IFS. It should be adopted.The government is tinkering with a broken wheel. It is gesturing in the direction of levelling up, but merely by reforming a centralist device – a grant. It should dare to be leftwing and go for the jugular. Houses should be taxed for their proper value. If you cannot call it a mansion tax, call it what it is: a property tax. But make sure it’s a proper one.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCouncil taxOpinionLabourAngela RaynerEnglandNorth-south dividecommentShareReuse this content"

May his memory be a revolutionA Palestinian activist, he helped his community resist Israel’s attempts to erase it. On Thursday, they buried him.Emily GlickFri 8 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTShareView image in fullscreenAwdah and his eldest son, Watan, in Umm Al-Khair in November 2021.Photograph: Emily GlickI got the news last Monday afternoon: a text from Ali, a fellow activist, that simply read: “Awdah </3, Allah y’rahmo” – an Arabic blessing for the dead. I pulled over on the highway, jaw clenched, feeling the world blur in front of me. An hour earlier, I’d seen reports that settlers had invaded Umm al-Khair, Awdah’s village in the southern West Bank. He’d been shot, lost his pulse and was in an ambulance being rushed to the hospital.I knew all of that. But I hadn’t contended with the real possibility that Awdah, my sweet friend with a quick wit and an oversized heart, could die. Awdah, I thought, was simply too alive to die.I first met Awdah in 2019, when we were both 25. I had come toMasafer Yatta, a cluster of West Bank communities under perpetual threat of expulsion, through a network of Jewish solidarity activists, trying to find my footing as a photojournalist in a land steeped in both love and violence. He was already a leader, an English teacher and a prolific storyteller, guiding his community’s resistance to Israel’s attempts to erase it.View image in fullscreenAwdah Hathaleen and his son in front of a mural in Umm al-Khair that was painted to memorialize Haj Suleiman, Awdah’s uncle, who was killed by the Israeli police, March 2022.Photograph: Emily GlickI learned quickly that Awdah was known across the region for the unique way he built relationships. He was adamant that truly everyone was welcome in Umm al-Khair: diplomats, activists, journalists and friends. He spent uncountable days with them, giving tours and telling heartbreaking stories about his life under Israeli occupation and his unrelenting commitment to fighting for a better world for his three small children.He took these connections seriously. If you came to Umm al-Khair as a guest, Awdah expected you to stay – for tea, then dinner, then the night. And when you finally left, he’d ask with a sly smile: “But my friend, when are you coming back?”I knew these relationships were also strategic – Awdah wanted people around the world to join him in fighting for Umm al-Khair. The village, with only a few hundred residents, is surrounded on three sides by the illegal settlement of Carmel, and every built structure in it is under threat of demolition. With so few resources and limited means to resist the constant pressures of military control, settler violence and threats of displacement, Awdah believed that international attention could help fortify the villagers’ struggle to remain on the land. “Oftentimes, we want to just leave and let the pain go,”he once wrote. “But we know we have to stand in the trauma in the hopes that the story we share will change the minds of those who support the Israeli occupation.”View image in fullscreenAwdah at his 27th birthday party in April 2021.Photograph: Emily GlickIn the winter of 2023, I ran a series of photography workshops for Awdah and his three co-editors of theHumans of Masafer Yattablog, a project documenting the struggle against the looming expulsion of Palestinians in the region. (Two of them would go on to direct the Oscar-winningNo Other Land, which Awdah helped produce.) On the day of our first session, the army had set up a temporary checkpoint at the entrance of the village, blocking people from exiting and delaying our start time by hours. We all felt defeated; I was ready to call it a day – darkness is far from ideal for a photography lesson. Awdah, however, was insistent we carry on. “Friends,” he said (as he always addressed us): “This is what lights are for. We will continue with the lesson.”This past week, I have returned many times to the photos from that first photography lesson, and the memory of Awdah’s persistence that kept us there. Awdah was determined, that day and every day, not to let the army dictate his life. But more than that, this story reminds me of Awdah’s tireless commitment to storytelling. For him, the photography lessons were also part of his stubborn insistence on documenting his reality and sharing it in every way he could. It was an act of faith – not out of naive optimism, but dedication to keep fighting no matter the odds. Andhe believed, like me, that cameras could “perhaps shed a little bit of light on what actually happens in the darkness of Israel’s military occupation”.View image in fullscreenAwdah with his friends Basel Adra and Hamdan Ballal in the village of Susya during a photography workshop in January 2023.Photograph: Emily GlickIt is gut-wrenching that Awdah’s story is reaching the world in the wake of his death. In the days since he was killed, thousands ofactivists, journalists andelected officialshave publicly demanded justice for him and his family. Meanwhile, Yinon Levy, the settler who shot and killed Awdah, remains free. He has sincereturned to Umm al-Khairwith his bulldozer to continue digging into privately owned Palestinian land. After holding Awdah’s body for 10 days, Israeli authorities finally permitted hisfuneralon Thursday – yet military checkpoints blocked many mourners from attending, and Israel’s high court declined to intervene.View image in fullscreenAwdah and Emily in Umm al-Khair, October 2021.Photograph: Awdah Hathaleen/Emily GlickOn Monday, I stood in the streets of Manhattan, taking pictures as thousands protested against Israel’s violence against the Palestinians, manyholding signs that read“Justice for Awdah”. I can only hope the horror of his murder strengthens a collective demand for justice – not only for Awdah, but for all Palestinians living under apartheid, occupation and forced dispossession. May we carry his legacy forward not only by fighting for the destination – freedom, safety, dignity – but by insisting on the path he modeled: one built through relationships, solidarity and love.Awdah, the most determined fighter for Palestinian dignity and the fullness of life – we mourn for you. You will be missed for lifetimes. May your memory be a revolution.Emily Glick is a freelance documentary photographer based in Boston"

Someone is doing something about the scourge of – *checks notes* – allotments. Wait, what? Oh. Angela Raynerhas been criticisedfor rules allowing councils to sell off allotments to raise money to meet day-to-day expenditures.This – if you will forgive the lapse into technical jargon for a moment – is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. I feel quite strongly about this because there were (and still at the time of writing are) allotments at the end of my parents’ road and they were how my dad first introduced me, in his customarily gentle way, to politics at the age of four or five. Who owned all the little gardens, I asked. The council did, he said, but it let people – often those who didn’t have gardens of their own – rent them pretty cheaply and they could grow whatever they wanted. Then when they got bored or moved away, another person had a turn. This seemed to me exemplary sharing, of exactly the kind preached at this new thing I was trying out called primary school. I approved.I still approve.Allotmentsare basically libraries for outdoor people. And, like libraries, if you sell them off, they won’t come back. Do you know how far away we exist now from a time and culture that would re-establish such grace notes to national life? Further than we’ve ever been. So if I were the deputy leader of a party supposedly (I think I read this somewhere) on the side of ordinary people – people without gardens, you might loosely say – do you know what I would do? Almost anything but sell their land from under them.TuesdayYou know the trolley problem? Not the supermarket one, the philosophical one; a runaway train is heading for five people tied to a railway track, if you pull a lever you divert it to a track on which only one person will be killed – do you pull the lever? You do? OK. What if the single person was a brilliant surgeon and the five were murderers? Or, there are five people’s lives who could be saved by killing another and distributing his organs among them. Do you do that? Why not? And so on.Now it’s a video game. How?How? Ever since I first heard it, the trolley problem has been one of the things that can keep me up at night. It’s horrible. It’s genius. It’s appalling. It gets under your brain skin and never leaves. How people can want to see it in 3D and play through it in near-infinite varieties I simply cannot imagine. Do they have nerves of steel? Were people right to condemn video games – are they cauterising emotions with every frame? And above all – should I play? Should I find out the answer to the question that has haunted me these 40 years and more – who would I choose to kill? One way or another, it’s decision time.WednesdayI really am beginning to warm to the young, you know. They have invented lots of useful words – “ghosting”, “flex”, “simp” are just some of those I particularly enjoy, in the privacy of my own mind – they hardly go clubbing or drinking any more and they operate silent book clubs (you go and read together, don’t discuss the book, then leave. Perfect).And now, it turns out, they go to bed at, on average, 9pm. The ideal time. Especially, I suppose, if you’re no longer clubbing or drinking because the world is full of simps busy ghosting you or mindlessly flexing. You can get home from book club, have a small, doubtless well-balanced meal and be tucked up for nine hours – depending on how quickly you can dispense with the trolley problem – of the dreamless shortly thereafter. Where were you all when I needed you, 1994 to 2004ish? Not yet born? Ah, OK. OK.ThursdayVictoria Wood once said of the proliferation of diet fads, and assertions that things like dark chocolate can be good for you, that she hoped that if she stuck around long enough someone would put in a good word for wine gums.Alas, she is no longer with us and we still wait in vain to hear about newly discovered antioxidants in Maynards’ finest. But I can offer my own small equivalent: I have stuck around long enough to hear potatoes definitively declared healthy. Researchers from Harvard and Cambridge universities studied the development, or not, of diabetes in 205,000 people over four decades and have determined that spud ingestion does not cause it.Unless it’s chips. They’re still bad. You, literally, can’t have everything. They are the wine gums of potatoes, apparently. But stick around long enough (by eating mash! Hurrah!) and who knows what might be around the corner.FridayWe are halfway through the school summer holidays. Are we? Aren’t we? Tell me we are. I’ve lost all track of time, like a soldier lost in the jungle. This is, after all, parents’ annual ’Nam.I thought it would get easier once the child no longer needed constant supervision and entertainment. Instead, it’s worse. I know he’s upstairs on his computer and phone any time I am not actively engaging with him, being exposed to all sorts. I’m told the trolley problem game is very much the least of it out there on the internetz. Leaving a child to his own devices is now a literal and very bad thing.I do my best. When I’m not working I drag him out on walks, I make him bake things, help with chores, all of that. I even offer to play board games with him. Board games! Occasionally he will agree to a round of poker or to give me his thoughts on what phone I should buy next, if I were ever to contemplate buying a phone again (he can sell this one at an antiques market when I die).But I can’t do it all the time and the guilt is pervasive and stultifying. I can’t bribe him to see friends because he has half my DNA and won’t. I can’t bribe him to read, because he has the wrong half of my DNA and won’t. So on we go, me alternating working and begging, him serene in his fetid demimonde of online horrors.

Time to be brave – and take a new tackFri 8 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTShareBritain is in danger of going bankrupt. It may happen slowly or quickly, but sinceLabourtook office this possibility has increasingly been promoted and discussed in the press, by opposition parties and in the City of London.What exact form will this bankruptcy take? The prophets of doom tend to be vague about the timescale, but more certain about the cause of the coming meltdown: the state spending too much, generally on people who have little.“Rip up the benefits system and start again,” was theheadline of a columnby the usually measured Matthew Parris in the Times this week. The welfare state, he wrote, is “in danger of toppling the whole economy”. Unsustainable numbers of claimants are “joining the bandwagon as it careers towards the abyss”.Such warnings appear to be given credibility by worried bulletins from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), a Conservative-Lib Dem creation intended to build confidence in Britain’s fiscal position but in practice more often doing the opposite. “The UK’s public finances have emerged from a series of major global economic shocks in a relatively vulnerable position,”said the OBR last month. “Underlying public debt is now at its highest level since the early 1960s and is projected to rise further … An ageing population and rising costs of healthcare and other age-related expenditures are … projected to push … debt above 270% of GDP by the early 2070s.”Already, a sustained rise in thecost of government borrowing, disappointing economic growth and tax revenues, and a little-questionedpush to increase defence spendingare all worsening the situation. This autumn, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will probably have to produce a budget in an atmosphere of acute financial anxiety, and possibly outright panic.Labour chancellors have been here depressingly often before: in 1931, during the Great Depression that helped destroy Ramsay MacDonald’s government; in 1976, when confidence collapsed in the finances of Jim Callaghan’s administration and the UK had to get a loan from the International Monetary Fund; and in 2008, when Gordon Brown’s chancellor, Alistair Darling,warned that economic circumstanceswere “arguably the worst they’ve been in 60 years”.On each occasion, the financial thunderclouds built up during late summer. With parliament not sitting, leaving a void for speculative news to fill, and many voters approaching the end of holidays and beginning to think about autumn belt-tightening, in August Britain may be particularly receptive to bleak forecasts about government borrowing.Yet far less attention is paid to the doom-mongers’ political assumptions. When journalists, economists and politicians say sternly that Britain “can’t afford” certain things, they rarely mean nuclear weapons that will probably never be used, or bailouts for reckless banks, or therapidly growing grantfor a royal family that already hashighly profitable estates. When sweeping austerity is called for, the most entrenched establishment interests are usually exempt.Nor do these supposed tellers of hard financial truths often consider whether the UK can afford low taxes on the rich, by international and historic standards, or the deterioration in public services already caused by cuts, with all its damaging consequences for productivity, social relations and public health. The surprise at the angry, run-down state of the country still expressed by many commentators – from the Financial Times to the Daily Telegraph – suggests a determination not to see austerity, social divisions and political upheaval as in any way connected. It’s a sign of the enduring influence of Thatcherism that so many people can look at our ever harsher society and economy and still conclude that the solution is not more government support for citizens, but less.Thus, a panic about the size of the state is created yet again. What can the government do to stop it – assuming it actually wants to? In 1931, 1976 and 2010, Labour responded to fiscal crises in what is revealingly regarded, across mainstream politics, as the conventional way: by proposing cuts. There remains a puritanical side to the party – perhaps partly a legacy of its origins in tightly run cooperative societies – that enjoys trying to prove that Labour governments are more frugal than Tory ones.When Labour has an expansive, confident leader, such as Tony Blair in the 1990s, spending restraint can make the party look measured and responsible: being careful now in order to spend more later. But under less persuasive leadership, cuts can become a trap. Some voters will always believe that Labour is profligate in office – and others that it is never generous enough. The party lost all three general elections after MacDonald, Callaghan and Brown’s governments chose cuts.Tentative Labour governments can be too influenced by pro-austerity interests. After the 1976 crisis had subsided, and the Callaghan administration had enacted sharp spending reductions, his chancellor, Denis Healey, discovered that the government debt forecasts he had been given by Treasury officials had been far too pessimistic. “The figures were billions out,” he told me decades later. “The big problem they have in the Treasury is getting governments to control spending. So any excuse they can find for getting spending cut, they will take.”Rachel Reeves is hoping deregulation will save the economy. We know how that ends | Larry ElliottRead moreNow, the scale of the government’s problems seems less open to interpretation. This week, the respected National Institute of Social and Economic Research warned that “the chancellor cannot simultaneously meet her fiscal rules, fulfil spending commitments and uphold manifesto promises to avoid tax rises for working people. At least one of these will need to be dropped.” Global financial markets, which have become even more interconnected and powerful since Labour’s last fiscal crisis in office, and which are operated by people who won’t bear the brunt of British public spending cuts, will scrutinise the budget with their customary coldness.Yet somehow Labour needs to break free of the argument, almost a century old now, that its more progressive policies and poorer people’s living standards are the first things that should be sacrificed in hard times. Perhaps one way is to highlight austerity advocates, past and present, such as George Osborne and Kemi Badenoch. Can the country really afford more of that kind of haughty, socially disastrous politics, Labour could ask.But then it would have to set out an alternative: a centre-left politics that can survive financial crises – or avoid them altogether. After so many fearful retreats, that work has barely begun.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionLabourAusterityEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Dismissive of the style’s dreamy aesthetic and flowery taste for designs inspired by the natural world, hedescribedit as “the last sortie of an art besieged in its tower by technology”.An artistic movement embodying a reaction against the mass production of the industrial age deserved a more sympathetic reception. Nevertheless, the 20th century appeared to agree with Benjamin’s analysis. By the end of the first world war, art nouveau’s decorative curlicues and flowing forms had fallen out of fashion as a more machine-inspired modernist aesthetic came into vogue. But that was then. More than a century on, as artificial intelligence offers a fresh tech challenge to humanity, a timely spot of revisionism appears to be taking place. Last month, in Paris, itemergedthat a museum is finally to be dedicated to one of art nouveau’s most deserving and neglected exponents.During the early 1900s, the architect Hector Guimard designed 167 entrances to the city’s new Métro, one of which was later to bedonated tothe Museum of Modern Art in New York. The stylised lettering and sinuous green ironwork, resembling insects’ wings or orchid stalks, quickly became synonymous both with art nouveau and with Paris itself. But despite their much-loved and emblematic status, almost half were bulldozed in an ill-advised wave of modernisation. Much of the rest of Guimard’s work in the city has been treated with equal disdain.With good reason, the art enthusiasts who havelobbiedfor the new museum for years see it as the historic “righting of a wrong”. Meanwhile, 200 miles away in the birthplace of art nouveau, more rehabilitation work has been taking place. As part of a spectacular new exhibition, Brussels’ Art and History Museum this summer unveiled a restored version of Victor Horta’s famousWinter Garden, an immersive stained-glass marvel that helped make the artist’s name when it was designed in 1900.This too became a victim of postwar architectural aesthetics, unceremoniously dismantled as part of a wider urban development programme. A six-year process of reconstruction has salvaged much of the original and replicated the rest. And completing what might be viewed as an upliftingly revivalist year, the work of Alphonse Mucha – best known for his posterportraitsof the Parisian actor Sarah Bernhardt – is now being showcased at anew Mucha museumin Prague. In the US, a recentexhibitionhas also highlighted his influence on the psychedelic art of the 1960s counterculture.Benjamin might have raised a sceptical eyebrow. But art nouveau’s emphasis on the importance of craftsmanship, and the conviction that artistic originality can introduce beauty as well as utility into the objects of daily life, are principles with a strong echo ofWilliam Morris’s work. They are energising doctrines to recall in a new age of existential anxiety.Year by year, concerns grow over the extent to which artificial intelligence will colonise creative processes that once defined the meaning of being human. Guimard’s stunningly innovative Métro entrances remain atourist attractionin their own right, and a tribute to the power of the free imagination. The Guimard and Mucha museums, and Horta’s rebuilt Winter Garden, can serve as reminders of what must be protected, as we enter our own equivalent of a new industrial age.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The highly figurative bronze statue is such a relic of a colonial patriarchy, and yet it is still often the go-to kind of representation in the public square. Replacing figurative statues of colonists and enslavers with more figurative statues is timid, and so reductive. We can do so much better than erecting supersized dolls on plinths outside post offices and shopping malls.New work such as Khaleb Brooks’s shell sculpture The Wake, mentioned in your editorial (The Guardian view on statues: new monuments reflect changing values and reinvigorate the public realm, 1 August), don’t just commemorate a past, they declare a now agreed truth that was once obscured by the powerful.Here in Australia, public art is an especially potent working surface for First Nations Australian women. Let’s embrace the symbolic change that comes with replacing redundant or harmful public commemorations with new (or not so new) art approaches – not just objects, but digital, environmental or sound sculptures. Public art can elevate and enchant, and be a wonderful placemaking device. And contemporary art forms can provoke, inspire wonder and keep this dialogue alive.Dr Wendy OsmondSydney, AustraliaWe are very grateful for your editorial about statues, highlighting our campaign for a statue in Brighton for Mary Clarke, the first suffragette to die, on Christmas Day 1910, for women’s right to vote. You say that Clarke died “after being force-fed in prison”. While there is little doubt that her hunger strike and the brutality of prison conditions will have hastened her death by brain haemorrhage, it seems clear – and leading suffragettes at the time believed – that the initial damage was done before she was imprisoned, at the notorious “Black Friday” events of 18 November 1910.On that occasion, 300 suffragettes attempting to lobby parliament were savagely beaten and in many cases sexually assaulted by east London police. Three women died as a result, of whom Mary Clarke was the first. Henria Williams died a week later on 1 January 1911, while Cecilia Haig died on 31 November 1911, of injuries sustained that day.Jean CalderChair of trustees,Mary Clarke Statue AppealRegarding statues of women, I am pleased to say that a woman who was a political activist and a community leader but who was, unfortunately, all but forgotten has been honoured in Glasgow. A memorial to Mary Barbour, created by Andrew Brown and depicting her leading her fellow rent strikers in 1915, stands at Govan Cross.Mary was an ordinary working-class woman, but the importance of her campaign, which helped lead to the Rent Restriction Act, deserves to be memorialised in bronze. Perhaps a wee girl looking at it today might just think: “Maybe I can do what Mary did.”Mary FitzpatrickGlasgowYes all statues have meaning and, yes, too many are of rich, powerful, white men whose legacy is often tainted. But please let me draw your attention to the Grade II-listed artworkPlatforms Piece at Brixton railway station.It was created by the artist Kevin Atherton and installed in 1986 (enhanced in 2023). This work comprises four lifesize images representing the diverse community that Brixton station serves: three of these figures are of local black residents standing as if waiting for a train. The other is of a young local white woman who moved to Brixton from Germany.So, yes, the nurse Mary Seacole fully deserved to be honoured by her 2016 statue – but let’s also recognise the importance of this much earlier work in celebrating the contribution made by people such as these far-from-ordinary Brixton folk to the richness and diversity of our society.Peter CorkillElham, KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I was only vaguely aware of her until this week when, recovering from surgery, I decided to binge-watch Bake Off: The Professionals – something light and fluffy.Yet each time I open the Channel 4 app, I am confronted by Bonnie Blue’s picture and the promotion of her extreme sexual behaviour. There is no attempt from the broadcaster to be subtle with the adult content. I complained, and received the following reply: “Many thanks for your feedback. The image and programme title are suitable for all audiences and have been complied in accordance with the Ofcom broadcasting code.”It is very concerning if the Ofcom code approves the promotion of this story of a woman selling her body for sex orgies to barely legal young men as “suitable for all audiences”, with no concern for the ability of the audience to process this highly complex and disturbing subject matter. I am also very concerned for the younger generations and their expectations of relationships.Louise RichesLondonTheuproar over the documentary 1000 Men and Me: The Bonnie Blue Storyreveals a deeper cultural paradox. Bonnie Blue is not what feminism wants, but is she what a certain strand of feminism has produced? A kind of Frankenstein’s monster born not of misogyny, but of a hyper-individualistic, sex-positive ethos untethered from collective ethical critique.We are witnessing the culmination of a pseudo-feminist narrative that valorises personal sexual agency above almost all else, while bracketing the social meanings and consequences of that expression. In this logic, any questioning of “empowerment” becomes suspect, even as the spectacle becomes indistinguishable from the patriarchal pornographies it once sought to subvert.If we are to protect future generations from degrading and dehumanising content, we must reckon honestly with the ideologies and cultural mores that have allowed such extremes to flourish.Rev Simon JonesBarrow-in-Furness, CumbriaGaby Hinsliff discusses the battle to control “barely legal” porn.

With Rachel Reeves’s personal backing, Heathrow airport has brought forward its ludicrous plans for a third runway (Heathrow submits ‘shovel-ready’ plans for third runway, 1 August).As a result, we are about to shred the party’s green credentials and mobilise not just the mass environmental movement against us but also a vast swathe of 2 million Londoners hit by increased noise and air pollution.All Ed Miliband’s good work on meeting climate change targets will be undermined by the carbon generated by this single development. At a cost of £50bn, and withHeathrow airportnearly £20bn in debt, nobody realistically believes that taxpayers won’t eventually be called upon to subsidise the scheme, and travellers forced to pay for it with massively increased landing charges.With its increased costings, theHeathrow third runwayhas already gained the reputation of being aviation’s equivalent of HS2.Approximately 15,000 of my constituents in west London will lose their homes, their schools and their whole communities – but there has not been a single expression of concern from any government minister.To top it all, some strategic genius has timetabled this nightmare decision to fall just before the next election.Here’s the tragic irony. The suffering of my constituents, the immense damage to Labour’s environmental strategy and the dire electoral consequences for the party will result from a scheme that very, very few, even in government, have any confidence will even go ahead.John McDonnell MPIndependent, Hayes and HarlingtonFiona Harvey makes some very good points in her article (What will expanding Heathrow do to UK’s net zero plans? 1 August).There is simply no realistic prospect of scaling up fossil-fuel-substitute fuels to the levels required to cut the aviation industry’s climate pollution to net zero for decades. The only credible policy option now, if the government is serious about its climate commitments, is not to allow airports to expand.

She refused to take no for an answer and insisted she had to see the situation in occupied territory for herself. Editors, reluctant to accept the risks of her self-commissioned assignments, also knew that her work was shining a unique light on one of the darkest and hardest-to-access aspects of Russia’s war.“She is the bravest person, the bravest journalist, I have ever met in my life. That’s not an exaggeration, it’s a fact,” said Sevgil Musayeva, the editor in chief of Ukrainska Pravda, one of the outlets for which Roshchyna worked for, in a speech on Maidan.‘Numerous signs of torture’: a Ukrainian journalist’s detention and death in Russian prisonRead more“Once she started something, she never quit,” said the Ukrainian journalist Angelina Kariakina, who worked with Roshchyna at the Hromadske news website. “If she started a case, a story, we editors never had to remind her that something was happening further in the story. She simply never abandoned her characters or her stories.”View image in fullscreenMourners inside the cathedral.Photograph: Jedrzej Nowicki/The GuardianRoshchyna was taken captive briefly in Russian-controlled territory in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion in spring 2022, but was subsequently released. However, she continued to travel to occupied areas to bring back stories of life under Russian control, and was taken captive again in August 2023.“Viktoriia was a person who didn’t know the word ‘no’. Everyone explained that she shouldn’t go to occupied territory. No editors were ready to take responsibility for this, but she still understood that this was her mission, and did it,” said Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, an MP and the head of the Ukrainian parliament’s committee on freedom of speech.View image in fullscreenRoshchyna’s coffin in Maidan, where crowds gathered to pay their respects.Photograph: Jedrzej Nowicki/The Guardian“She was genuine, and genuine people often burn with intensity, and with that fire they ignite everyone around them, but very often this passion costs them the most precious thing – their health and their life,” he added.Roshchyna’s death in captivity was investigated by theViktoriia Project, a consortium including the Guardian, Ukrainska Pravda and other reporting partners, earlier this year. For months after her disappearance, there was no news of Roshchyna, who was held, like many Ukrainian detainees, without contact with the outside world. It was only in May 2024 that Russian authorities admitted, in a letter to her father, that she was being held in captivity.Roshchyna was last seen alive on 8 September 2024, and there were rumours she was due to be included in a prisoner exchange.

The body was also returned with the brain, eyes and larynx removed.Roshchyna was posthumously awarded the Order of Freedom by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, earlier this month. She received it “for her unwavering belief that freedom will overcome everything,” Zelenskyywroteon X.Roshchyna spent nearly nine months imprisoned at pre-trial detention centre number 2 in the city of Taganrog, which was repurposed as a holding centre for Ukrainian detainees and has been identified asone of the worst places for tortureand mistreatment.View image in fullscreenMourners walk towards Independence Square.Photograph: Jedrzej Nowicki/The GuardianEarlier this week, Ukraine’s national police service and its chief war crimes prosecutor announced that Aleksandr Shtoda, the head of the facility,had been formally placed under investigation.At the funeral, Roshchyna’s editors vowed to continue investigating the circumstances of her death and the specific people who were responsible.“Our task is not to leave the theme of the occupied territories, however hard it is,” said Kariakina. “The best way to remember her is not just with words and memories of the work she already did, but to continue this work.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaKyivPress freedomJournalist safetyEuropeNewspapers & magazinesShareReuse this content"

Brown lived next door to the bar, according to public records.Brown served in the army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005. He deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, according to Lt Col Ruth Castro, an army spokesperson. Brown was in the Montana national guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said, and left military service at the rank of sergeant.“I am proud of the unrelenting law enforcement effort this week to find and arrest Michael Paul Brown,” the Montana attorney general, Austin Knudsen, said in a statement. “The support we’ve seen for the community of Anaconda from across the state and the nation has also been remarkable.

It reached the Netherlands in 2015 and was recorded near Calais four years later.“This is really exciting,” said Dr Dan Hoare, the director of nature recovery at Butterfly Conservation. “It’s always interesting when a new species turns up in the UK, but the southern small white has been gradually moving northwards through Europe for over a decade and we were just waiting for it to be seen inEnglandfor the first time. Top marks to the eagle-eyed snappers who not only got photos, but also realised the significance of what they’d seen.”Tiny differences distinguish the southern small white from its native British cousins.Photograph: William Brame/Butterfly ConservationThe southern small white is distinguished from the native whites by tiny differences in the black markings on its forewing tips. On a southern small white these are square in shape, with the black reaching down the outside of the wing to a point level with a black spot further in from the border. Free apps such asObsIdentify, created by a Dutch non-profit foundation, are making identification easier – if people can obtain photos.The first sighting was made by the birdwatcher Martyn Sidwell in Hartlepool on 1 July, and a second by William Brame at Landguard nature reserve in Suffolk on 2 August. The latter sighting was verified byChris van Swaay, the chair ofButterfly Conservation Europe, who has been tracking the species’ progress for years.Lepidopterists hope the species will now become established in Britain, assisted by gardeners. Unlike the large white, which is infamous for its caterpillars devouring brassicas, the caterpillars of the southern small white feed oncandytuft, an evergreen shrub which is widely planted in gardens.The sightings follow the sunniest ever spring on record, and a large influx of small whites migrating over the sea to Britain.In the charity’sBig Butterfly Count this year, reports of the spectacular Jersey Tiger moth – a species which just a decade ago was restricted to the Channel Islands and the south coast of England – have risen 78% on last year, with sightings as far north as Birmingham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

By 3pm on Friday afternoon, the blaze was 25% contained but covered nearly 5,400 acres (21.9 sq km) , according to authorities.But fire conditions remain precarious,with temperatures up to 100F and low humidity. Moisture-levels on the brush-covered hillsides are at a record low in the region, and the parched vegetation has fueled the fire’s spread.“The fire has now crossed into LA county and continues to spread east toward the community of Val Verde,”, according toa 1pm updateon Friday from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).Firefighters battled through the night to protect homes and other buildings, and to take advantage of lower temperatures. By Friday morning, they were seeing subdued fire behavior according to Andrew Dowd, spokesperson for the Ventura county fire department.“They were putting it all on the line to bring this fire under control,” he said. One firefighter reported a minor injury, but no civilian injuries were reported. No single-family or multi-family residences were destroyed, but two minor structures were destroyed.“Air attack and ground crews aggressively attacked the fire to limit its spread and protect residents and structures in the fire’s path,” Los Angeles county officials wrote in an incident update issued on Friday, adding that hard work and operational efficiency stopped widespread damage “even as the high heat and dry conditions pushed the fire’s growth”.Firefighters are hoping to corral some of the perimeter on Friday, even with scorching daytime temperates that could contribute to extreme fire behavior. The blaze remains a “very dynamic situation”, Dowd said.California wildfire scorches 83,000 acres and threatens hundreds of structuresRead more“Extreme heat and low humidity in our north county have created dangerous conditions where flames can spread with alarming speed,” the LA county supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents the district, said in a statement. “If first responders tell you to leave, go – without hesitation.”The new blaze comes as a hugewildfirein central California became the state’s largest blaze of the year, threatening hundreds of homes and burning out of control in the Los Padres national forest.TheGifford firehad spread to more than 99,200 acres (400 sq km) by Friday morning and was at 15% containment. It grew out of at least four smaller fires that erupted last Friday along State Route 166, forcing closures in both directions east of Santa Maria, a city of about 110,000 people. It has injured at least four people. The causes of the fires are under investigation.Wildfire risk will be elevated through the weekend across much of inland California as a heatwave gripping the area intensifies.But fire activity across California and parts of the American west is also expected to spike in the weeks to come as high temperatures collide with the strong winds that are more prevalent in the autumn months.“In southern California, the threat is driven by persistent drought, high grass loads, and weakening coastal moisture,” according to a wildfire forecast by the state’s fire department.Vegetation is already dangerously dry in the state, especially in southern California where thick brush and desiccated shrubs can quickly turn ignitions into infernos, and the coming heat will bake more moisture out of the landscapes.Fires will be more challenging to control and are expected to exhibit extreme behavior, according to an advisory issued from federal fire analysts this week, which said the mountains and deserts of southern California were seeing “record dry levels”.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaWest CoastExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

There were 57 sightings in 2023, more than double the previous seven years combined, and 2024 broke that record with 71 confirmed sightings.This year, that number has already been surpassed; theNational Bee Unitis reporting 73 Asian hornet sightings and 28 nests in 2025 to date – more than double the 28 recorded sightings in the same period last year. The large wasps overwintered in the UKfor the first timein 2023-24, which means they could be in the country for good.Scientists, beekeepers and the government have battled hard to keep hornet numbers down, running a national hornet-spotting campaign so their nests can be identified and destroyed. But despite this, their numbers continue to increase, putting native pollinators at risk.Now, scientists at the University of Southampton have made a breakthrough, establishing for the first time the frequency and volume of the sound from their nests. This means detection and removal of the creatures could become faster and easier.They have established the fundamental frequency of Asian hornet nests to be 125 hertz and the loudness in the region of 51 decibels, which is comparable to a normal conversation.The voracious Asian hornet – the invertebrate symbol of our dark timesRead moreThe new research means the sound can be used to distinguish them from the nests and hives of other wasps and bees. This will be particularly useful in September and October, when the nests peak.Acoustic engineering graduate Sophie Gray, who undertook the research, said: “We observed and measured two Asian hornet nests and a European hornet nest in Jersey before they were destroyed. We found that the fundamental frequency is 125 hertz and that the nest can be detected from about 20 metres away with a directional microphone.“We also recorded European hornets and honeybees to determine if we can differentiate the frequency. The fundamental frequency of the European hornet is about 110 hertz and honeybees about 210 hertz. It was great news to discover that the frequency is unique for each species, so they are distinguishable.”The species first came to Europe in 2004, when the hornets were spotted in France, and it is thought they were accidentally transported in cargo from Asia. They have since spread rapidly across western Europe.Explore more on these topicsInvasive speciesInsectsBeesWildlifeAnimalsConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

The Coral Sea lay flat as glass beneath a heavy, windless sky. The heat was stifling, the water a little too warm. “It was beautiful,” he says. “But I remember thinking, ‘I feel sorry for the reef.’”That moment stayed with him. A Yirrganydji traditional owner and land and sea manager in the Cairns-Port Douglas region, Singleton has spent more than 12 years working to protect the reef – as warming seas, sediment runoff, pollution and overfishing steadily erode its resilience. Just this week a report founda record drop in live coralin two out of three sections of the reef, prompting warnings that a tipping point for the ecosystem’s future is approaching.“My biggest fear is that we’ll lose everything,” says Singleton, whose father, Gavin Singleton Sr, was also a sea ranger. “It’s a big part of our identity. We don’t just think of the Great Barrier Reef as coral, we think of it as an entire system. A living thing.”View image in fullscreenVictor Bulma, a Mandingalbay Yidinji man, supports the idea of personhood for the reef, but says it would “be a big hill to climb”.Photograph: Brian Cassey/The GuardianAs traditional owners like Singleton witness the reef’s decline first-hand, some are beginning to ask a deeper question: what if the reef had the same legal rights as a person?Around the world, rivers, forests and mountains have been recognised as legal entities under a growing legal movement known as the “rights of nature”. In the case of the Great Barrier Reef, the rights of nature model could recognise the world’s largest coral systemas a legal person: an entity capable of holding rights and having those rights defended in court.“I’ve been quite interested in the concept of recognising the reef as its own living entity,” Singleton says. “Like New Zealand, with some of the rivers and mountains being given[legal personhood] status.“It’s about separating the politics and all that outside noise and really giving the reef the respect it deserves as its own entity, its own being.”A living legal entityAccording to Dr Michelle Maloney, a lawyer and co-founder of the Australian Earth Laws Alliance, rights of nature laws could profoundly improve Australia’s environmental governance system.“Australian law, like most western legal systems, treats nature as human property: a collection of objects to be used, exploited or protected,” she says. “In contrast, Aboriginal legal systems, some of the oldest continuous legal systems in the world, have always seen nature as alive. We have a lot to learn from Aboriginal law.”1:00Great Barrier Reef coral bleaching event in 2024 most widespread and severe on record - videoSign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsRights of nature encompasses different approaches to trying to extend new rights or protections to nature, through granting ecosystems or natural objects status as legal persons or living entities. Legal personhood is a legal construct that grants legal rights to entities. Living entity is a term that recognises something is in fact alive, not just an object, but being granted this status doesn’t create a legal right.Maloney believes that granting the reef legal personhood could be relatively straightforward, if the political will were there. “In theory, the government could pass a law that says the Great Barrier Reef is a legal entity and has rights to exist, thrive, evolve and continue its vital cycles,” she says “And there are a number of different ways such a law could be implemented.”Under one model, guardians – including traditional owners and other stakeholders – would be appointed to act on the reef’s behalf. “It would mean a process that made sure all of the different First Nations people up and down the reef system could be guardians for their land and sea country.” she says.Maloney says this systemic change isn’t just a tool for symbolism but for action: “Let’s say a container ship leaked oil. The reef’s guardians could sue the company for damages on behalf of the reef. Guardians could also have a stronger voice in future planning to reduce activities that damage the reef.”The legal personhood model appeals to Victor Bulma, a Mandingalbay Yidinji man and marine park inspector who lives in Yarrabah, just south of Cairns. “I would definitely support it,” he says. “It is a great idea to give us some sort of rights and stuff. But yeah, that’d be a big hill to climb.”View image in fullscreenThis underwater photo taken on April 5, 2024, shows bleached and dead coral around Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef, located 270 kilometres (167 miles) north of the city of Cairns.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesHe has witnessed significant changes to the reef over his lifetime. But it’s the changes to the coral he finds most alarming. “Back when I was younger the reef was very, very colourful,” he says. “It was paradise. Global warming plays a big part in the damage of it. Some parts of the reef are just grey.”Maloney believes legal personhood could give guardians like Bulma greater power to defend the reef from climate change. “It’s not just the elephant in the room, it’s the elephant starting to crush us all,” she says. “And we have a government that refuses to take it seriously and denies any duty of care.”She points to thefederal court ruling in the Pabai case, which found the government has no duty of care to Torres Strait Islanders on climate change, as evidence of the system’s failure. “I’d like to think legal personhood would change things for the better. Because if the law says its guardians have a right to do all they can to protect the reef, then they should be able to force real change.”Internationally, the rights of nature movement is gaining momentum. Ecuador became the first country to enshrine the rights of nature in its constitution in 2008; since then, dozens of successful court cases have been brought on behalf of ecosystems. In Australia, Victoria passed legislation in 2017 recognising the Yarra River as a living entity, acknowledging its ecological value and cultural significance to the Wurundjeri people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

But how does the reef benefit?”Gavin Singleton, land and sea managerWhile New Zealand’s Whanganui River was granted legal personhood as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement, the path is more complex in Australia. “There are no treaties between First Nations people and the British or Australian governments, and Aboriginal people have fewer triggers in the law to insist on their rights,” Maloney says. “That makes it a little harder. Not impossible, but harder.”I weep for the corals, but what I saw on the Great Barrier Reef gives me hope |  Kerrie Foxwell-NortonRead moreA song in need of protectionFor Singleton, who spends his days restoring coral and seagrass, monitoring marine life and planting trees along the coastline, the need to protect the reef is undeniable. “The thing is, the reef’s threats are cumulative … you can’t single out one thing,” he says. “The entire ecosystem needs protecting. Our elders have always seen the reef holistically.”He hopes the concept of legal personhood can help reframe public thinking, not just about damage, but about responsibility. “As people, we are benefiting from the reef – socially, economically and culturally,” he says. “But how does the reef benefit?”This year Singleton and Bulma joined a campaign to nominate the Great Barrier Reef for a UN lifetime achievement award; the first time a non-human entity has been put forward. The honour has previously recognised individuals such as Sir David Attenborough.View image in fullscreenMarine park inspector Victor Bulma: ‘It’s for our kids and grandkids.’Photograph: Brian Cassey/The GuardianIn July the reef received a less celebratory distinction: the UN warned it could soon be added to the world heritage “in danger” list, citing mounting threats from climate change and pollution. The Australian government has until early 2026 to show progress – or risk the reef’s heritage status being downgraded.Singleton admits he initially questioned the intent behind the UN nomination. “I did hear a comment somewhere about whether this was a media stunt,” he says. “But I do think there is some genuine respect in there. It would be good to have more people speaking across the whole reef, to strengthen that voice.”That voice, he says, has always existed, if only we would listen. “In our language, we call the reef Yurrbinji, which means ‘song’. I’ve always thought, if the reef had a voice, it would sing.”Bulma shares that hope, especially for future generations. “It’s for our kids and grandkids. We’ve got to protect the reef, so they can see what we saw and feel that same connection.”“We need to put this more on a global level,” he adds. “I’ll cross my fingers for that.”Explore more on these topicsGreat Barrier ReefLaw (Australia)Australian politicsMarine lifeClimate crisisCoralIndigenous AustraliansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Three former police officers have been arrested and a fourth former officer who was accused has died.The IOPC said it was responding to “concerns about SYP’s involvement and a perception of a conflict of interest”. It said it was a joint decision with South Yorkshire police (SYP) to ask the NCA to take over.Alexis Jay, who chaired the independent inquiry into grooming gangs, had expressed shock that SYP were leading the investigation. She told the BBC there were “many, many legitimate causes for victims and survivors at the time to feel a total lack of trust in SYP”.The law firm Switalskis, which represents survivors of abuse inRotherham, had said victims had “no faith that SYP will do a thorough job of investigating alleged abuse by their own officers”.In 2022, Operation Linden concluded that SYP fundamentally failed in its duty to protect vulnerable children and young people during the period under investigation.After the U-turn, Switalskis said in a fresh statement: “We are pleased that South Yorkshire police have decided to hand the investigation into allegations of child sexual abuse, corruption, and the facilitation of abuse by former SYP officers to the National Crime Agency.“However, we remain concerned that the investigation is still being directed by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, given the concerns raised by whistleblowers in relation to Operation Linden earlier this year. Nevertheless, we view this as a step in the right direction and hope that more survivors will now feel able to come forward to the NCA.”Five women told the BBC how they were exploited by grooming gangs in Rotherham when they were children and also allegedly sexually abused by officers.According to aspecial report by the BBC, one of the women said she was raped from the age of 12 in a marked police car and that the officer threatened to hand her back to the groomers if she did not do as he said.The investigation shake-up was also welcomed by the South Yorkshire mayor, Oliver Coppard. He said: “I’m pleased that SYP, the IOPC and the NCA have listened to the concerns of those young women who have come forward to talk about their experiences.”Explore more on these topicsRotherhamPoliceYorkshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Some ran to a nearby storage cupboard, which they locked and barricaded.The defendant, who cannot be named because of his age, admitted manslaughter but denied murder, saying he had “snapped” after a long period of bullying and did not remember what happened.However, during a month-long trial at Sheffield crown court, the prosecution said the boy “wanted to show he was hard” and “knew exactly what he was doing”.On Friday a jury found him guilty of murder by a majority of 11 to one after deliberating for more than 14 hours.The court heard the stabbing was probably an “act of retribution”, to “get back at Harvey for something”.Harvey’s mother, Caroline Willgoose, burst into tears after the verdict was delivered. She held her husband Mark’s hand and said “yes”, but there was no reaction from the defendant.In a statement read outside court Harvey’s sister, Sophie Willgoose, said her brother had been “full of life” and “had a unique ability to bring people together”.View image in fullscreenCCTV image issued by South Yorkshire police of the defendant pushing Harvey earlier in the day.Photograph: South Yorkshire police/PAThe trial heard the two boys had fallen out several days before Harvey’s death after taking opposite sides in a dispute between two other boys.Prosecutors said the defendant had an “unhealthy” interest in weapons and had photos on his phone of him posing with other hunting-style knives and a machete.Richard Thyne KC, prosecuting, told jurors the defendant “had a significant history of becoming angry and using violence at school”. He said records from a previous school “show a pattern of behaviour ranging from defiance, through to the use of physical violence towards other pupils and property”.Thyne said the defendant had researched rage rooms and, just over a week before the fatal stabbing, searched “waiting for someone to swing so I can let out my anger”.He told jurors that on the day of the stabbing, CCTV footage showed him trying to provoke Harvey, who remained “peaceful”.The court heard Harvey had told his friends that the defendant had been “acting like he had a knife” under his jumper in their science lesson that morning, but had thought he was bluffing.View image in fullscreenCCTV image showing Harvey arriving at school on the day of the attack.Photograph: South Yorkshire police/PAJurors were told Harvey was happily talking to his friends as the lunch break started, when the defendant approached him. One teenage witness said there was an altercation and the defendant punched and pushed Harvey, causing him to stumble backwards, before pulling out a knife and stabbing him.The defendant told the trial that he was the victim of racist bullying and taunts about a medical condition. It meant he got angry quickly and “couldn’t control it”, he said.The boy told the jury his mother had mental health problems and his father, who hit him, was often not there. He told the court he took the knife to school because he thought he was going to get hurt that day.Gul Nawaz Hussain KC, defending, told jurors: “Tragically, Harvey was a combination of being the final straw that broke [the defendant] and the unintended face of a series of threats of violence and bullying he had suffered in recent months.“We say he suffered a loss of control which resulted in horrific and tragic consequences.”View image in fullscreenFloral tributes left outside All Saints Catholic high school after the stabbing in February.Photograph: Richard McCarthy/PASouth Yorkshire’s metro mayor, Oliver Coppard, said the guilty verdict brought some justice for Harvey, “though it cannot undo the pain his family has suffered”.Coppard added: “He was a young boy with a bright future, and his death, especially in a school, has deeply affected our region.“Harvey was a young man full of potential, whose life has been lost to violence, while another young man now faces a future behind bars. It’s a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of knife crime and of the urgent need to invest in prevention, education and early support to protect young lives.”Louise Haigh, the MP for Sheffield Heeley, said: “All of Sheffield will be thinking of Harvey’s family and all those who loved him today.“An independent review will now take place into the circumstances that led to Harvey’s death, and it is absolutely essential that all questions are answered and that any and all lessons must be learned.”DI Joe Hackworthy, the deputy senior investigating officer for South Yorkshire police, said: “This trial has been a heartbreaking reminder of the devastation knife crime causes in our communities.“It tears lives and families apart, and that has never been more evident than in this tragic case.”After the verdict the judge, Mrs Justice Ellenbogen, told the defendant he would probably be sentenced in October. She will also consider an application to lift the defendant’s anonymity.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It will be in place from midday on Monday until 6pm on Wednesday.Significant impacts across health and social care services may occur as a result of the high temperatures, the agency said. This includes the potential for an increase in the number of deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions.Grahame Madge, a spokesperson for the Met Office, said: “The general pattern is that we’ll see temperatures start to increase from Sunday and the duration of the heat is likely to last until Tuesday, possibly Wednesday.“We’re likely to see temperatures get to high 20s across quite a lot of the UK, and in the south we’re likely to see the possibility of temperatures reaching mid-30s degrees centigrade across parts of central, southern and eastern England, with the likelihood that the heat will probably last longest in places like East Anglia, up through Lincolnshire and into Yorkshire.”The hottest day of the year so far was 1 July, when 34.7C was recorded at St James’s Park in central London.The heatwave threshold is met when a location records at least three consecutive days with maximum temperatures exceeding a designated value, according to the Met Office.This is 25C for most of the UK, but rises to 28C in London and its surrounding area, where temperatures are typically higher.“I think we we could be seeing parts of the UK have another heatwave by the middle of next week,” Madge said.“I’d be surprised if areas didn’t make it on the duration and temperature value, but some places might reach those thresholds for a day or two before the temperatures come back down.” The forecast was less clear beyond the middle of the week, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The news of her engagement to another man brought “bitter disappointment” – as he puts it in the letter.In what may be allusions to both lost love and opium, he says in the letter: “My delirious imagination had early concentrated all hopes of happiness in one point – an unattainable point! This circumstance has produced a dreaminess of mind, which too often makes me forgetful of others’ feelings.”He thanks Dyer for “a very flattering review of a very indifferent composition of mine”, The Fall of Robespierre, a three-act play that Coleridge and Robert Southey wrote with the intention of raising funds for “pantisocracy”. This was a scheme to found a commune in rural Pennsylvania with 12 men and 12 women who would marry and bring up their children in an equal society without private property.Coleridge is deprecating about some of his first poems, published in the newspaper the Morning Chronicle, though writes that two are “not so bad as the rest”.Soon after writing the letter,he headed to south-west England and met Wordsworth. In 1798, the pair published a joint volume of poetry, Lyrical Ballads, considered to be a starting point for the English romantic age.A standout in the collection was Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. In 1797, Coleridge put his quill pen down on the wondrous Kubla Khan, which he apparently wrote after experiencing an opium-influenced dream.Rees said it was possible Coleridge was being a little dramatic in the letter. “There is clearly an element of performance – Coleridge is writing to an older and more experienced man whose opinion he very much respected.“I think we see two sides of Coleridge here. He is both fishing for compliments and yet also self-critical and not satisfied with what he has written so far.“Luckily Dyer does seem to have risen to the occasion and provided Coleridge with enough encouragement that he didn’t retire into obscurity. His was a candle destined to burn bright and hard, not to fade and gutter.”The Coleridge letter, which has a price tag of £10,000, is one of 80 items in Bernard Quaritch’s new catalogue of English books and manuscripts from 1500 to 1840.Explore more on these topicsSamuel Taylor ColeridgePoetrynewsShareReuse this content"

He was 97.Lovell died on Thursday in Lake Forest, Illinois,Nasasaid in a statement.“Jim’s character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount,” Nasa said. “We mourn his passing even as we celebrate his achievements.”One of Nasa’s most traveled astronauts in the agency’s first decade, Lovell flew four times – Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13 – with the two Apollo flights riveting the folks back on Earth.In 1968, the Apollo 8 crew of Lovell, Frank Borman and William Anders was the first to leave Earth’s orbit and the first to fly to and circle the moon. They could not land, but they put the US ahead of the Soviets in the space race. Letter writers told the crew that their stunning pale blue dot photo of Earth from the moon, a world first, and the crew’s Christmas Eve reading from Genesis saved America from a tumultuous 1968.But the big rescue mission was still to come. That was during the harrowing Apollo 13 flight in April 1970. Lovell was supposed to be the fifth man to walk on the moon. But Apollo 13’s service module, carrying Lovell and two others, experienced a sudden oxygen tank explosion on its way to the moon. The astronauts barely survived, spending four cold and clammy days in the cramped lunar module as a lifeboat.”The thing that I want most people to remember is [that] in some sense it was very much of a success,” Lovell said during a 1994 interview. ”Not that we accomplished anything, but a success in that we demonstrated the capability of [Nasa] personnel.”A retired navy captain known for his calm demeanor, Lovell told a Nasa historian that his brush with death did affect him.“I don’t worry about crises any longer,” he said in 1999. Whenever he has a problem, “I say, ‘I could have been gone back in 1970. I’m still here. I’m still breathing.’ So I don’t worry about crises.”View image in fullscreenThe lunar space helmet and gloves Jim Lovell’s Apollo 13 mission on display in Chicago in 2006.Photograph: M. Spencer Green/APAnd the mission’s retelling in the popular 1995 movie Apollo 13 brought Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert renewed fame – thanks in part to Lovell’s movie persona reporting “Houston, we have a problem”, a phrase he didn’t exactly utter.In all, Lovell flew four space missions – and until the Skylab flights of the mid-1970s, he held the world record for the longest time in space with 715 hours, 4 minutes and 57 seconds.Aboard Apollo 8, Lovell described the oceans and land masses of Earth. “What I keep imagining, is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet, what I would think about the Earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not,” he said.That mission may be as important as the historic Apollo 11 moon landing, a flight made possible by Apollo 8, Launius said.But if historians consider Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 the most significant of the Apollo missions, it was during Lovell’s last mission – immortalized by the popular film starring Tom Hanks as Lovell – that he came to embody for the public the image of the cool, decisive astronaut.The Apollo 13 crew of Lovell, Haise and Swigert were on the way to the moon in April 1970 when an oxygen tank from the spaceship exploded 200,000 miles from Earth.That, Lovell recalled, was “the most frightening moment in this whole thing”. Then oxygen began escaping and “we didn’t have solutions to get home”.“We knew we were in deep, deep trouble,” he told Nasa’s historian.Four-fifths of the way to the moon, Nasa scrapped the mission. Suddenly, their only goal was to survive.Lovell’s “Houston, we’ve had a problem” – a variation of a comment Swigert had radioed moments before – became famous. In Hanks’s version, it became: “Houston, we have a problem.”What unfolded over the next four days captured the imagination of the nation and the world, which until then had largely been indifferent about what seemed a routine mission.With Lovell commanding the spacecraft, the flight director, Gene Kranz, led hundreds of flight controllers and engineers in a furious rescue plan.The plan involved the astronauts moving from the service module, which was hemorrhaging oxygen, into the cramped, dark and frigid lunar lander while they rationed their dwindling oxygen, water and electricity. Using the lunar module as a lifeboat, they swung around the moon, aimed for Earth and raced home.By coolly solving the problems under the most intense pressure imaginable, the astronauts and the crew on the ground became heroes. In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life-and-death struggle, the entire flight team had created one of Nasa’s finest moments that ranks with Neil Armstrong’s and Buzz Aldrin’s walks on the moon nine months earlier.“They demonstrated to the world they could handle truly horrific problems and bring them back alive,” said Launius.The loss of the opportunity to walk on the moon “is my one regret”, Lovell said in a 1995 interview with the Associated Press for a story on the 25th anniversary of the mission.View image in fullscreenPortrait of the crew of Apollo 8 in December 1968.Photograph: NASA/Interim Archives via Getty ImagesBill Clinton agreed when he awarded Lovell the CongressionalSpaceMedal of Honor in 1995. “While you may have lost the moon … you gained something that is far more important perhaps: the abiding respect and gratitude of the American people,” he said.Lovell once said that while he was disappointed he never walked on the moon, “the mission itself and the fact that we triumphed over certain catastrophe does give me a deep sense of satisfaction.”And Lovell clearly understood why this failed mission afforded him far more fame than had Apollo 13 accomplished its goal.“Going to the moon, if everything works right, it’s like following a cookbook. It’s not that big a deal,” he told the AP in 2004. “If something goes wrong, that’s what separates the men from the boys.”James A Lovell was born on 25 March 1928, in Cleveland. He attended the University of Wisconsin before transferring to the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. On the day he graduated in 1952, he and his wife, Marilyn, were married.Marilyn died in 2023. Survivors include four children.Explore more on these topicsNasaSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

The highest levels are in the western US, including in states such as Alaska, California, Colorado, Nevada and Utah, all of which are marked as “high”.“Wastewater monitoring can detect viruses spreading from one person to another within a community earlier than clinical testing and before people who are sick go to their doctor or hospital,” the CDC notes. “If you see increased wastewater viral activity levels, it might indicate that there is a higher risk of infection.”Wastewater tracking is often used as an early detection tool for monitoring potential future upticks. According tothe California department of public health’s own wastewater tracking, statewide infection numbers have now surpassed winter highs.Other metrics are also showing increases in the illness. As of Tuesday, the CDC estimates Covid-19 infections aregrowing or probably growing in 45 states, which is up from 40 last week.A new Covid-19 variant,XFG, or “Stratus”, is on the rise in the US, becoming the third-most common strain of the summer. The variant was first detected in south-east Asia in January but was barely detected in the US until May. By late June, it was estimated to account for up to 14%, according to theCDC.During aCBS interviewin July, physician Jon LaPook said that this type of rise was typical for the summer.“We now know that there’s a winter spike and then there’s a summer spike,” the outlet’s chief medical correspondent said in the interview. “And every year, the number of deaths, the number of hospitalizations, is gradually going down each season. So that’s the good news.”Still, experts caution it istoo soon to know how big the developing late-summer wavecould get. While cases are rising more slowly than at the start of previous surges, varied immune responses from prior infections and vaccinations make it difficult to predict how severe illnesses could be. The risks are further compounded by new vaccine restrictions from the Trump administration.The rise in Covid-19 cases comes as the US Department of Health and Human Services announced on Tuesday it willterminate 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines, raising questions about the safety of a technology credited with helping end the pandemic and saving millions of lives.The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS newsCoronavirusWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

That doesn’t mean that you have to swear allegiance to the head of a state of another foreign country.”This only happened, he pointed out, because Grenada was a former British colony and not because it was voted on by Grenadians.The governor-general, Dame Cécile La Grenade, the Crown’s representative in Grenada, assented to the two pieces of legislation to amend the oath, after they were approved in both the lower and upper Houses of Parliament.Grenada’s tourism and culture minister, Adrian Thomas, said the move was a response to decades of calls from Grenadians to change the oath, setting it amid a broader trend to decolonise society, assert the country’s independence and reform the constitution.He said: “Although we still have many institutions, like the royal prison, the Royal Grenada Police Force, we are on the road to decolonising our society and apart from the oath of allegiance we will be doing much more in years to come.”On the streets of St George’s, communications consultant Sherene Thomas-Isaac, said the change was “long overdue”.“We’re independent. I think that’s a mark of our sovereignty … We have to follow the true course of what independence means for our region,” she said.The change to the oath comes as theGrenadaReparations Commissionvowed to step up the pursuit of an apologyand reparations from the monarch and intensify calls for the removal of King Charles as the country’s head of state, after new research revealed that George IV personally profited from slavery on theCaribbeanisland.Arley Gill, the head of the commission, thanked Francis Alexis, a former attorney general and government minister, for lobbying for the change, which he described as “one small step in the further deconstruction of a new colonialism process”.Gill said: “We need to strengthen the lobby in Grenada to get rid of the king as head of state. The royal family is not fit and proper to be the head of state of a country where they have directly profited from slavery. We need to move to republicanism immediately.”Explore more on these topicsGrenadaKing Charles IIISlaveryMonarchyCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

However, recorded fatigue levels had a very slight association with the smartwatch data, while sleep had a stronger correlation.Eiko Fried, an author of the study, said the correlation between the smartwatch and self-reported stress scores was “basically zero”.He added: “This is no surprise to us given that the watch measures heart rate and heart rate doesn’t have that much to do with the emotion you’re experiencing – it also goes up for sexual arousal or joyful experiences.”He noted that his Garmin had previously told him he was stressed when he was working out in the gym and when excitedly talking to a friend he had not seen for a while at a wedding.“The findings raise important questions about what wearable data can or can’t tell us about mental states,” said Fried. “Be careful and don’t live by your smartwatch – these are consumer devices, not medical devices.”Fried said although there was a lot of academic work looking for physiological signals that can act as proxies for emotional states, most were not precise enough. This is because there is an overlap between positive and negative feelings – for example, hair standing on end can signal anxiety as well as excitement.Fried, an associate professor in the department of clinical psychology at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and his team tracked stress, fatigue and sleep for three months on 800 young adults wearing Garmin vivosmart 4 watches. They asked them to report four times a day on how stressed, fatigued or sleepy users were feeling before cross-referencing the data.And the results,publishedin the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, found that none of the participants saw the stress scores on their watches meet the baseline for significant change when they recorded feeling stressed. And for a quarter of participants, their smartwatch told them they were stressed or unstressed when they self-reported feeling the opposite.The relationship with physical fatigue, described by Garmin as “body battery”, was “quite a bit stronger than for stress but overall quite weak” said Fried. Garmin does not disclose the calculations it uses to work out the body battery score, though he suspected it was a combination of a pulse measurement and activity levels.The relationship with sleep was stronger again, though Fried noted it measured sleep duration and told us little about how well rested someone was, other than the fact there tended to be a relationship between how long you slept and how well rested you felt.There was a significant association between the Garmin and self-reported data for two-thirds of the sample for sleep. The researchers noted that in nearly all cases, if participants went from one day of self-reporting bad sleep quality, to another day with a good score, they could predict an increase in sleep duration on the Garmin of around two hours. “This is a really noticeable effect,” they said.AI chatbots are becoming popular alternatives to therapy. But they may worsen mental health crises, experts warnRead moreThe research is intended to feed into an early warning system for depression, in which wearable tech users receive data that will help them receive preventive treatments before an episode begins.So far, there are promising signs that lower activity levels could be a predictor, though Fried has been unable to identify whether this is because of exercise’s protective effect against depression or because people feel less energetic as their mental state deteriorates.“Wearable data can offer valuable insights into people’s emotions and experiences, but it’s crucial to understand its potential and limitations,” said Margarita Panayiotou, a researcher at the University of Manchester, after reading the study.“This research helps clarify what such data can reliably reveal and makes an important contribution to ongoing discussions about the role of technology in understanding wellbeing. It’s important to remember that wearable data does not necessarily represent objective truth and should be interpreted alongside broader context, including individuals’ perceptions and lived experiences.”Garmin has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSmartwatchesHealthShareReuse this content"

The two film-makers try to navigate the chaosByAdam Curtisand Ari Aster, withPaul MacInnesFri 8 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 07.03 EDTShareAri Aster’s new movie,Eddington, pits Joaquin Phoenix against Pedro Pascal as men with conflicting takes on how to get their small town through the crisis of Covid. It’s also a film about the contemporary political crisis in the US and the influence of technology on our lives.Adam Curtis’s latest documentary series, Shifty, covers similar themes but through the lens of British life in the Thatcher years of the late 1970s to early 1990s. This era, he argues, put in place a substantial shift in power away from the individual and the nation state, changes that are still playing out today.Thatcher, Farage and toe-sucking: Adam Curtis on how Britain came to the brink of civil warRead moreEarlier this summer, the two men met in London to discuss the thinking behind their work, the questions that animate them and the corroding power of nostalgia.Ari Aster:My family lives in New Mexico and I grew up there; it’s where I spent my adolescence. In 2020 a Covid scare brought me back home and I was in a situation where a lot of the people closest to me were in totally different algorithms. We couldn’t reach each other.In early June, when the fever reached its highest pitch, I started writing down what I perceived to be in the air. I didn’t know whether things were about to explode and boil over, or if we would ever come out of lockdown, but I could tell that something was happening. I’ve also always wanted to make a film about New Mexico. And so it kind of became a western.Adam Curtis:A thing I really like about the film is the sense that, up to that point, there was somehow a daddy in the room. Then, when Covid happens, Daddy leaves and all these groups are on their own. All the last vestiges of power, or big power, just disappeared. They can no longer see what they have in common.AA:They’re all connected in that they all care about the world, and they all know that something is wrong. But that’s where the connection ends. I wanted them all to be distinguished by a yearning for the America they believe in, but they’re not living on the same plane.View image in fullscreenFighting for our lives … Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal in Eddington.Photograph: BFA/AlamyAC:That’s the point where you start from: Daddy’s gone, they’re all on their own, they all have a dream of America, but they’re like billiard balls: they keep on hitting each other. And each time they hit each other they amplify each other’s version of reality and it just gets crazy.AA:Yeah, they’re all paranoid. And as those billiard balls start knocking into each other, I wanted the film itself to also become gripped by that paranoia. I was trying to take a capacious, objective stance in the beginning, and then that objectivity kind of falls away. I don’t know if the film is apolitical or if it’s omnipolitical, but all those fantasies of what is happening start to take over the film. That’s the idea.AC:If you have a world in which everyone is encouraged to be a total individualist, they tend to get trapped in that mindset. It’s wonderful when things are going well, because you, your own desires and thoughts are the centre of the world. But the moment things go wrong, you retreat into yourself. And the only thing you can trust is your own ideas. You come to believe in them intensely, because that’s the only thing that makes you feel safe. And I think that’s where we are now.What has happened is that we have become totally atomised and cannot reach each otherAri AsterInShifty, I was tracing the roots of that in Britain and I was trying to do it sympathetically. And Ari, I don’t think that in Eddington you apply the normal righteous disapproval of so many films today, either. You actually take the characters on their own terms. You might not sympathise, but you get an understanding of why people have retreated into their own world and will not accept any other reality. I think you’re dealing with what comes next.AA:They’re all unmoored, but they’re clinging to some buoy. Shifty really excited me because it felt like a mirror from the past. It was shocking to see how all these things that feel unprecedented right now are actually the current reverberation of something that started a long time ago. It’s just that the technology has changed, and because these things have been getting amplified for so long, the distortions have become more intense.AC:The most difficult thing to do, especially in our time, is make the recent past unfamiliar. It’s almost impossible. And that’s the task I set myself. It’s a bit like the Mona Lisa. If you point it out to someone, they don’t see it. They go: “Oh yeah, that’s the Mona Lisa.” They don’t look at it at all.View image in fullscreenBreaking out of the bubble … Ari Aster on the set of Eddington.Photograph: Richard ForemanWhat you want to do is find a way of breaking that. It’s how you edit the stuff a lot of you have lived through together, to make you look at it fresh. If you just live in a world of continuous fragmentation, the past never has a moment to settle down. In previous eras, you would have all those fragments of experience, but over 20 or 30 years, which is the length of time I was dealing with, most of those fragments would just disappear, leaving a few to settle down, out of which would come an agreed narrative about history.Instead, today we live in a world where those fragments are continually played back to us, as you show in the movie. I think that’s why people find it very difficult to understand how trapped they’ve become in their own world, because they have no story that explains how they got there. What you get is a continuous political narrative which says: politicians rise up, they prove to be shit, and they fall. That’s all we’re told these days.AA:Eddington is a movie about the environment. It’s not a movie that says: “This is the way to think, this is the way to feel, this is what’s happening.” Because what has happened is that we have become totally atomised and cannot reach each other. And as long as that persists – which a lot of people have a lot invested in – nothing can change. Hopefully by being a little bit more egalitarian in the way I’m assessing the landscape with as much objectivity as I can muster, I can reach some people that have been totally alienated by my side of the culture.AC:A good political film makes people reflect on themselves. The problem is that over the past 30 or 40 years, the movies that call themselves political have actually been the very opposite. They groom their audiences by saying to them: “You are right to think and believe the way you do.” In that way, they encourage people to wallow in their self-righteousness and so block any self-reflection. Which means that so many “radical movies” are actually reactionary.View image in fullscreen‘Nobody believes in the future any more’ … Emma Stone, Pedro Pascal, Ari Aster, Joaquin Phoenix and Austin Butler at Cannes film festival in May.Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty ImagesThere is no way forward unless people actually reflect on the limitations of their own self-righteousness and the possible dangers it has for society. That includes well-meaning liberals as much as it includes extreme rightwingers or tech-bro conspiracy theorists: it stops them realising that everyone might be part of a new system of power which works through increasing fragmentation and increasingly shrill self-righteousness. And I think it should be a badge of pride if you, Ari Aster, get that self-righteousness to squawk at you with Eddington. It’ll prove that you’ve done it right.AA:There’s a feedback loop of nostalgia. Not just nostalgia and trauma. We’re always looking back into the past to see why we are here right now. “Oh, it’s because this happened to me.” As opposed to – and this is what you’ve been talking about for ever – where is the new idea? Where is our vision of the future? Because nobody believes in the future any more. I don’t believe in the future, and I’m desperately looking for it.AC:You’re right about trauma. Increasingly over the last four or five years, people have retreated into themselves and are blaming their own past. They’re not only playing back the music or films of the past, they’re playing back their own past and finding in those fragments of their memory the reasons why they are feeling bad, anxious, uncertain, afraid and lonely – and it’s given the term trauma. Trauma is a very specific, real and frightening for those who experience it. But recently it’s been widened to such an extent that you are blaming yourself all the time through your own reworking of the past. Rather like AI goes back and reworks the past and plays it back to you. Now you’re doing that to yourself.The universe is not exclusively rational. It’s full of strange swirling waves of feeling and ghosts and myths that are often completely unrealAdam CurtisAA:All the characters in Eddington are living in different movies. The film is a western, right? But Joe [Joaquin Phoenix’s character, the sheriff of Eddington] would have seen all the westerns. That’s a huge part of his identity and what informs everything he does, including having become a sheriff in the first place. The way he walks is informed by the way John Wayne walks. He’s a 50-year-old man, so the action movies of the 80s and 90s would have been important to him. And then at the end of the movie, he gets to live in his own action movie. He’s shooting at phantoms. But that applies to every character in this film. The one thing that is definitely happening in Eddington is that a hyperscale datacentre is being built. And really, all of the stories in Eddington are just data, from one perspective.AC:Don’t give it away!AA:OK, sorry. Yes, I won’t give it away. But you’re right. There are other things outside they don’t see.AC:The most important thing that political film-making should do now is make us aware that there’s something else beyond – including beyond the internet. Everything now in movies really comes through the internet. But we know, logically, that the internet is not everything. There is something else there, but no one’s telling us about it.What I really like about Eddington is at the end you say there is something else outside. Something beyond the thin crust of hysteria and fear that keeps all of us trapped in bubbles today.People only search for conspiracy theories these days because no one else is giving them any stories. You know: those in power just want to manage you. And, quite frankly, managers never tell stories. They keep you there by repeating and repeating. So that’s why people don’t trust them and the most important thing to do is to acknowledge that.View image in fullscreen‘Shooting at phantoms’ … Joaquin Phoenix in Eddington.Photograph: Richard Foreman/Joe Cross/Mayor LLCThat’s why I call my series Shifty. That actually, nothing is certain and the only way you can deal with that as a journalist is by acknowledging it and trying to explain why the world feels like that today.The organisation I work for – the BBC – has created BBC Verify to try to reassert certainty. It is important because rationality is still the only thing we have to manage the complexity of the world. But on its own terms it’s not enough, because the universe is not exclusively rational. It’s also full of all kinds of strange swirling waves of feeling and ghosts and myths that are often completely unreal.A confident system of power takes all those mad psychodramas and creates a dominant story out of them. But when that goes – as has happened today – they run out of control sweeping through societies, creating uncertainty and suspicion.BBC Verify is important but it’s not enough because the universe is not exclusively rationalAdam CurtisWhat journalism and films should be trying to do today is to explain how that has happened – to acknowledge that uncertainty is the realism of our time because that is how people experience the world today. If you don’t do that, the people in their bubbles will be very suspicious of you. Because they know that we the journalists and the politicians and all the experts suffer from that same uncertainty. And we know that they know that. And that becomes toxic.AA:Certainty has gone for ever now. With the advent of deepfake and AI-generated imagery, belief in what we’re seeing and hearing is now forever gone.AC:Which means that the most radical thing to do is to say the only way we’re going to move forward is by bypassing all those things, movies, most popular culture, as evidence of the future. It’s a lovely nostalgic world you can go and play in. But actually, real politics, real moving forward, it’s going to come somewhere else, where the complexity of reality might be repossessed in a really fundamental way. I’ve got no idea what it is, but it ain’t going to come through movies or me making pretentious television programmes. It’s just not.Eddington is released in the UK on 22 AugustExplore more on these topicsAri AsterAdam CurtisCoronavirusJoaquin PhoenixPedro PascalMargaret ThatcherinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been performed in more than 80 countries and now – finally – makes its West End debut. There’s astarry rotating cast, kicking off with Lenny Henry and also including original performer Jonny Donahoe, as well as Ambika Mod, Sue Perkins and Minnie Driver. Jeremy Herrin directs alongside Macmillan and a posse of leading producers are backing the show.It all screams smash hit. But there’s something about the scale and downright snazziness of this production that doesn’t quite gel. The setup is simple. It’s about a young boy who, after his mum does “something stupid” when she has acute depression, decides to make a list about all the things that make life worth living. Waffles. Hedgehogs. Falling in love.Before the show begins, scribbled notes with items from the list are distributed throughout the audience. At regular intervals, the audience is required to shout out the items from the list. A few spectators are also pulled into various mime sequences and running gags and, with Henry, they carefully bring this boy’s story to life as he transitions from a hopeful young boy to faltering and thoughtful man.View image in fullscreenGood fun … Every Brilliant Thing.Photograph: Helen MurrayIn the very best productions of Macmillan’s play, the moments of audience interaction can feel really special. But on press night, everything feels slightly on edge. Perhaps the shiny new theatre and star performer are a little imposing. Every now and then, Henry can’t resist sparring with the crowd. It’s all good fun but every ad lib takes us one step closer to a standup show – and one step further from the warm heart of this play.It’s only when Henry isn’t trying to be funny that the show settles. There’s a stillness and steeliness to him when he talks about the importance of protecting our mental health. Henry also responds beautifully to all the music woven into the show, which plays such an important role and underlines just how much this boy has been forced to live on the edges of his family life. Listening behind doors. Hovering. Worrying. Never getting truly involved, for fear of what he may lose if he lets the happiness in.At@sohoplace theatre, London, until 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreLenny HenryEdinburgh festival 2025FestivalsEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Spanish film-maker Miguel Ángel Jiménez directs and co-writes this adaptation of the novel by Panos Karnezis.Bringing star power also is charismatic Danish star Vic Carmen Sonne; she plays his daughter Sofia, who has the honour and the terrible burden of a massive 25th birthday party thrown for her by the overbearing Marcos on his private island. The guest list consists almost entirely of his heavily tanned Eurotrash acquaintances and hangers-on, but this claustrophobic party is all the more painful as (like Onassis) Timoleon has recently suffered the terrible anguish of his son and favourite child dying in a plane accident.The film shows us that he concerns himself now with who Sofia is to marry and who his son-in-law is therefore to be – questions that, if his son had lived, would not be nearly so important – and he is nettled to see a close relationship between Sofia and his young English biographer Ian Forster, played by Joe Cole. In his heart, of course, Marcos would have preferred the other child to die and he has terrible plans for Sofia at the end of her party.This is a strong, confident picture that hits its measured stride early on. Its pace and style and language are dictated by a charismatic Dafoe; however, he gives the impression that this performance is not exactly a stretch for him. But he is always commanding, especially when talking to his various consiglieri, confiding amusingly to one intimate that it is good that children become rebellious and disagreeable; if they stayed as adorable as when they were young, parents could never part with them.The Birthday Party screened at the Locarno film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsWillem DafoeFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But, as Bernard MacMahon’s terrific, archive-stuffed documentary reveals, Led Zeppelin had a more roundabout gestation. Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones were in-demand session players in 60s London, while singer Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham were jobbing musicians in Birmingham. It wasn’t until Page joined the Yardbirds that he realised his dream of a no-singles group with a heavy, improvisational edge. Featuring interviews with the surviving members, rare audio of Bonham and big chunks of gig footage, it’s a fascinating slice of rock history.Saturday 9 August, Sky Documentaries, on demandThe PickupView image in fullscreenKeep moving … Pete Davidson and Eddie Murphy  in The Pickup.Photograph: Amazon MGM Studio/PARussell (Eddie Murphy) is an armoured truck guard edging towards retirement who is paired with irritating newbie Travis (Pete Davidson) on a long day of deliveries. However, their van is targeted by criminals led by Keke Palmer’s Zoe, forcing a change of plans for all involved. Oddly, Tim Story’schase caperturned heist thriller makes Murphy the straight man to Davidson’s goofball, at the expense of the star’s comic abilities. But the confident, charismatic Palmer takes up some of the slack, and the highway action sequences are smartly done.Out now, Prime VideoBack to the Future Part IIIView image in fullscreenTurn back time … Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox in Back to the Future Part III.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyShot back to back with Part II, the final part of thesci-fi trilogyis a much better film, largely due to the fun everyone seems to be having with the western setting. Dusting off the DeLorean, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) flies back to 1885 to save Christopher Lloyd’s stranded Doc Brown from being shot dead by Buford Tannen, Biff’s ancestor. Playful tweaks to the genre and a romance for Doc with Mary Steenburgen’s teacher are the new elements in an otherwise familiar plot of cobbled-together gadgetry, space-time dilemmas and jolly slapstick comedy.Saturday 9 August, 3.35pm, BBC OneMargrete: Queen of the NorthView image in fullscreenMajestic …  Trine Dyrholm in Margrete: Queen of the NorthPhotograph: Signature EntertainmentCharlotte Sieling’s2021 historical dramatakes a footnote from the life of a 14th-century Danish royal and gives it a dusting of Game of Thrones-style clan politics, generational scheming and nation building. The estimable Trine Dyrholm is magnetic as Margrete, who – despite being a woman in a man’s world – has unified Norway, Sweden and Denmark and presides over a time of peace. Then a man appears claiming to be her long-dead son, which puts her adopted heir Erik (Morten Hee Andersen) in a funk and threatens to destabilise her hard-won pact.Saturday 9 August, 1.05am, BBC TwoJimmy’s HallView image in fullscreenAbsorbing … Barry Ward and Simone Kirby in Jimmy’s Hall.Photograph: Bernard WalshEight years after his 2006 filmThe Wind That Shakes the Barleydelved into the 1920s Irish war of independence and civil war, Ken Loach returned to the country to assess its uneasy peace circa 1932.

But here it is courtesy ofFargoshowrunner Noah Hawley. The sci-fi thriller is set two years before the first film and centres on the crash-landing of a research vessel on Earth – in the middle of a battle between two corporations: pushy upstarts Prodigy and the villainous Weyland-Yutani. Prodigy’s gift to the world is transhumanism, in which human consciousness is implanted into seemingly indestructible bodies. Expect that proposition to be tested by the arrival of extraterrestrial specimens from the doomed spacecraft. The result is a tense, nasty and inventive series.Disney+, from Wednesday 13 AugustOutlander: Blood of My BloodView image in fullscreenShortbread box kitsch … how Jamie’s parents met: Brian Fraser (Jamie Roy) and Ellen MacKenzie (Harriet Slater) find love amid a clan rivalry.Photograph: Sanne Gault/Starz Entertainment/Amazon PrimeThis prequel toOutlanderboasts a similar tone: the kind of shortbread box kitsch that makes Mel Gibson’s Braveheart look subtle and understated. It tells the origin tales of Outlander’s lead characters Jamie Fraser and Claire Beauchamp via the romantic backstories of their parents. Jamie’s family history is a bloody affair, born out of forbidden love in the midst of a rivalry between two Highland clans. Claire’s involves time travel and takes place during the first world war.

The formula for this documentary genre feels familiar by now: screamingly passionate fans; the drawing of a parallel between the fate of club and town; and a carefully curated, slightly oversold rags-to-riches narrative.

After forming as a raised middle finger to snooty blokey indie bands “fiddling with their pedals with a face like a slapped arse”, their self-titled debut crashed into the Top 40 last month and topped the UK rock and metal albums chart.With inspirations ranging from the Clash, Bikini Kill and Amy Winehouse to the Slits’ guitarist Viv Albertine’s autobiography, Panic Shack are a fizzy, riffy, irreverently hilarious bundle of buzzsaw guitars, vim and vinegar. Crucially, they sound like they are having a ton of fun, surely the point of starting a band in the first place. Onstage, they have comically exaggerated poses and even their own dance, which went viral on TikTok.Girl Band Starter Pack – imagine Wet Leg’s Chaise Longue on pint-can energy drinks – describes a typical night out with rowdy enthusiasm: “I finish work, I text the girls / Let’s get a bevvy, four double voddys … we get silly, we get loud!” Other songs cover the media obsession with body image (Gok Wan, which sarcastically asks “If my stomach is flat and my arse is perky, maybe I could get everybody to like me”), sexual harassment (Smellarat) and their own friendship (Thelma and Louise). Latest single Pockets gleefully encapsulates their celebratory irreverence. It’s about, but of course, the usefulness of a bag when wearing a dress with no pockets, in which to put “Vape / phone / keys / lip gloss!”Dave SimpsonThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenLife-affirming … Big Thief.Photograph: Genesis BáezBig Thief – Grandmother (ft Laraaji)Their best song yet?

The first single is a triumph, looking back on a late friend with fondness and pain.Reuben Aziz – City GirlsThe British rap/R&B vocalist is puppy-loved-up, swooning over his one-in-a-million girl with the kind of gentle melody and tenderness that Drake reaches for when he’s in seduction mode.Ben Beaumont-ThomasSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The result was Kae Tempest meets New Order via the densely referential lyrics of Real Lies; a set of songs steeped in lump-in-the-throat nostalgia for more innocent times, and in the muted echoes of dancefloor euphoria.View image in fullscreenFor Those I Love: Carving the StoneOn this follow-up, the Dublin musician – now in his early 30s – adjusts his subject while clinging tightly to his fury and devastation. Aside from The Ox/The Afters, a tribute to a former hardman who dies from drink, there’s not much literal grief on Carving the Stone – but Balfe is still in mourning. His psychic wound is more abstract now, a slow-blooming bruise caused by the brutal Irish economy and the tech-addled meaninglessness of modernity. Over a boisterously ravey backdrop, No Scheme chronicles the lifestyles of Balfe’s erstwhile contemporaries (“life above their means / And driven mad by phone scams and everyday still spent on Facebook”), while Mirror rages against “cunting blackshirts” who promote nationalistic beliefs to the workers they exploit.Carving the Stone’s portraits of new kinds of poverty are too depressing – and depressingly accurate – to be beautiful, although the music offers occasional bursts of strange joy (Civic’s frantic breakbeat; the fiddle break in Of the Sorrows), while Balfe’s heartfelt, hyper-focused social commentary means it’s rare to find an album this rich in meaning.Explore more on these topicsMusicElectronic musicPop and rockSpoken wordalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Made up of militant chants and muscular rhythms perforated with ominous clangs, the genre mostly thrived in goth bars and clubs, except for the odd chart entry from key players such as Front 242. Even 40 years on, EBM still lurks on the fringes of dance music.View image in fullscreenAutumns: Basic FaceIrish producer Autumns is one name championing the industrial club sound through his stormy yet pumping hardware tracks and raucous live sets, which are all flailing limbs and swishing hair behind a tangle of wires. Since starting the project in 2013, he has put out a formidable 88 releases, including 13 albums;Basic Face is his latest.The bulk of the record follows the classic EBM formula: chugging loops strewn with sinister vocals and metallic sounds; in fact, White Walls sounds like an instrumental hit by scene legends Nitzer Ebb. The rhythms are beefy and catchy, elevated further by surprising elements such as the mutant-disco-style cowbells and angular post-punk riffs in A Grand Time to Witness Culture, or the sirens in Your Favourite Cowboy. Repetitive rather than progressive, the tracks are seemingly made for DJs and live sets, rather than home listening, which is strange given the cassette release. But this doesn’t feel like a fault of Autumns:they are intense and unrelenting, as any good EBM track should be.Only twice do we hear something less functional, and these moments work as good scene-setters, though not stand-alone tracks. On the intro No Gimmicks No Gigs, a disjointed vocal sample is interspersed with thrashes and fizzes that sound straight out of a forge. Your Tattoo is Shite, placed about halfway through the album, is a blistering, glitching whir of feedback – a disorienting experience, but onethat onlyamplifiesthe punchy material around it.Also out this monthNewport-based multi-instrumentalist and producerMemotonehas built a reputation among DIY circles for his quietly cinematic electro-acoustic compositions. His latest album Smallest Things (released on World of Echo) is another lovely, evocative listen, full of sparsearrangements that are sometimes soaring, sometimes jittery.On Sound Bath (Dark Entries),Coatshekpresents a dreamy, dimly lit collection of tracks inspired by an imaginary queer bath house. Expect ambient techno pitched low and slow – specifically at 107bpm, which the San Francisco producer deems the “optimal speed for sauna sex”. With every warm pad or deep, reverb-cloaked whisper, the record slowly builds tension, climaxing in the blissed-out 10-minute closer Eternal Lovers.Gush (Nettwerk), the latest record from Los Angles-based composerKaitlyn Aurelia Smith, is similarly intimate: an exploration of those warm, heady feelings that come with incipient romance, when, in her words, “the senses melt together”. Channelled through hushed vocals and bubbling electronica, it is suitably woozy: sensual and sometimes ecstatic.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicExperimental album of the monthClub cultureElectronic musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Durastanti’s book – a fictionalised memoir about growing up between rural southern Italy and Brooklyn, and between identities, as the hearing daughter of two deaf parents – was the first literary novel of an Italian writer from my generation to reach a global public. Published in English by Fitzcarraldo Editions in 2022, ina translationby Elizabeth Harris, its success was widely seen as a good omen, the sign that international publishers were starting to show interest in a new crop of Italian literature.A further reason for my enthusiasm was that a big part of Strangers I Know takes place in Basilicata, where my father is from. It is one of the country’s poorest regions, right at the arch of Italy’s boot, a place so derelict and forgotten that the one nationally renowned book about it, Carlo Levi’s wartime memoir Christ Stopped at Eboli, owes its title to the idea that the saviour, crossing Italy from the north, stopped at a village before the region’s border: Basilicata was never saved.Its breathtaking limestone canyons and ancient Greek temples notwithstanding, the region offers little in terms of recognisable, picturesque Italianness – the Tuscan hills, Venetian canals and clothesline-strewn Neapolitan alleys which, I felt, Italian novels were often expected to offer if they wanted to appeal to an international audience. Strangers I Knowseemed poised to broaden the range of what we understand as an Italian story – because it was also an American one, and because it eschewed all stereotypes about Italy.A recent pilot had to be rewritten: the Italian backdrop was too unfamiliar. Why not set it in Ireland?Not for long. After a pilot was written and slated for production, the broadcaster asked for a rewrite. The Italian backdrop, they said, was too unfamiliar. Why not set it in Ireland? It would be easier for audiences to relate to, and in its crucial aspects (Catholic, poor) it was kind of the same. The project was ultimately shelved.The history of the novel is deeply entwined with European nationalisms and national identities. Walter Scott’s historical novels drew from (and consolidated) Scotland’s history into a shared mythology; Alessandro Manzoni’s The Betrothed is still studied in Italian schools as the crucible that forged a unified language from a plethora of local variants; Goethe, Austen, Dostoevsky and Balzac all captured what they felt was the nature of a specific place and time, offering nations a mirror in which to see or imagine their national ethos.View image in fullscreen‘Picturesque Italianness’ … The TV adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s My Brilliant Friend.Photograph: Home Box Office (HBO)/2020 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.As books were translated and read across borders, a slightly paradoxical notion of two-layered reading emerged: novels offered, on the one hand, a very precise depiction of aspecificplace and time and national spirit; but through the specifics, somethinggeneralcould be glimpsed outside the national confines – about what it feels like to be a person, which to me sounds like a serviceable approximation of what the art of the novel is about. This gave rise to an idea of literature as a kind of exchange or conversation between national literatures, each with their allotted seats at the canon – Fernando Pessoa or Robert Musil, Henrik Ibsen or Émile Zola: of course, they were almost exclusively male seats.The imperialistic premise in this idea of literature as an egalitarian conversation between national traditions is blatant: as Milan Kundera remarked, what it took for a country to be awarded its own national literature – instead of being grouped into an ill-assorted umbrella term such as “Mitteleuropa” – was a colonial past. And yet that was still the way literature was taught and read, in Italy, until a couple of decades ago. We read Gustave Flaubert and Georges Perec. We read Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf. We read Thomas Mann andErnesto Sábato.And then we didn’t. The consolidation of the English-language publishing industry in the 1980s and 90s gave its most successful writers a worldwide reach and a critical impact that no authors from other countries could aspire to. The Italian contemporary canon, at the beginning of the millennium, was composed of David Foster Wallace and Zadie Smith and Jonathan Franzen; the country’s first creative writing programme, established in the mid-90s, owes its name to Holden Caulfield; its students (some of whom have been my students) learn technique by reading Ernest Hemingway and Joan Didion, who show; not Anna Maria Ortese and Elsa Morante, who tell. Their Italian syntax and style – as measured in Eleonora Gallitelli’s groundbreaking computational studies – are more influenced by English than the Italian of translators working from English.This didn’t happen only in Europe. As discussed in Minae Mizumura’s The Fall of Language in the Age of English – an essayistic memoir about the author’s having to choose between being an American and a Japanese writer, and choosing the latter, and regretting it – at the turn of the millennium the idea of national literatures, modelled as a system of literary discourses on a somewhat equal footing, no longer held. Instead, we moved into a world in which one of those traditions had expanded beyond the national, becoming de facto universal.There is nothing intrinsically lamentable about this, which can be seen as a way out of nationalisms. But there can be only one universal; and as the anglophone tradition ascended, other national literatures shrank to become increasingly local. In a system in which English-language literature deals transnationally with general issues, the specifics that had characterised national literatures (Austen’s England, Dostoevsky’s Russia) lose their role and become local colour, picturesque. When a story has universal ambitions, such as Durastanti’s Strangers I Know, it thus makes sense to recast it someplace more relatable, in a setting where the exoticism won’t get in the way.Something similar happened to me. Years ago, a German publisher declined to translate my second novel – a story of ambition and financial speculation – because the Italian backdrop might have confused a German readership used to imagining corporate raiders in New York, or perhaps in Frankfurt. But, he said, the chapters in which the protagonist visited his father in Venice were great, so poetic. Had I considered setting a book in Venice? Italy, for him, had ceased to be seen as a legitimate context for corporate ambition, as it was in Paolo Volponi’s Le Mosche del Capitale, and become a set of exotic backdrops: Naples, Puglia, Rome, the Tuscan hills, or Venice.A peripheral circle of local authors are outsourced with producing gondolas, popes, crying madonnas, and pizzaThis, in a way, is a division of labour: a way the international market for literature has tried to become more efficient by allocating the general discourse to a set of mostly English-speaking writers, while a peripheral circle of local colleagues are outsourced with producing gondolas, popes, crying madonnas, and pizza.But the landscape described by Mizumura has drastically rearranged itself over the past few years, and the primacy of anglophone literature seems to have faded. The authors in today’s contemporary canon – celebrated by critics worldwide, and imitated by aspiring novelists – come from much more varied backgrounds and write in many more languages.Roberto Bolaño,Annie Ernaux,Han KangandKarl Ove Knausgårdare the Franzens and Wallaces of two decades ago.Of course it is impossible to draw a precise line for a general shift of this kind, but “Ferrante fever” could be as good a watershed moment as any.Elena Ferrantewas a relatively niche writer (both in her country and abroad) whose novels achieved a spectacular, worldwide success, reaching the kind of ubiquity previously associated with people performatively readingInfinite Jestto show off. It also sparked a growing international interest in Italian literature, involving both younger writers (such as Durastanti, or myself for that matter) or allegedly “forgotten” classics, such as the works of Elsa Morante and Alba de Céspedes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The further consolidation of the US publishing industry has made it harder for innovative, ambitious novels to emerge. It could be an effect of the trendiness of “literature in translation” in the English-language market – even though the notion that it would have its own niche is largely unfathomable to non-native English speakers, used since childhood to reading literature in translation and calling it “literature”.It could also be that different books are being written. Since the turn of the century, writers from all over the world have felt the dual literary citizenship that Minae wrote about: seeing themselves as part of both a local and a universal tradition, reading Anna Maria Ortese at the Scuola Holden. It would have been natural to try to combine the two, working into their writing a thin veneer of exoticism to lead readers to engage with its deeper ideas.Readers in Buenos Aires or Naples could very well find a story set in Seoul more relatable than one set in Franzen’s MinnesotaOf course there is much, much more to, say, Ferrante’s novels than a picturesque Italian backdrop. But the backdrop’s recognisability – indeed, its very picturesqueness – has probably played a role in making them relatable to a wider audience. Bolaño’s The Savage Detectives similarly toys with cliches about Mexico, both subverting them and contextualising them into a wider picture. Han Kang’sThe Vegetarianplays into a strain of body horror that western readers have come to stereotypically associate with east Asian literature – only to explode it with a psychologically harrowing and politically powerful fable about resisting patriarchy.On the other hand, this increased international interest in non-anglophone literature could have another source: no matter where these books originated, their worldwide success often came as a result of their success in English. This was the case with, for instance, both Ferrante and Bolaño, who only caught on abroad after resonating with the English‑language market.It is particularly evident in Han’s case: The Vegetarian was published in South Korea in 2007, but gained international acclaim after Deborah Smith’s spectacularly successful translation was published almost a decade later. In a particularly significant twist, its Italian edition was translated from the English instead of Han’s Korean, not because no translators could be found but because the editor, who read it in English, found Smith’s prose more effective – more relatable?– than the renditions they initially commissioned from the original.This is not limited to recent, successful novels: two canonical 20th-century Italian authors, Natalia Ginzburg and Alba de Céspedes, have been translated internationally mostly after their English editions. Conversely, classic Danish author Tove Ditlevsen’s trilogy appeared in Italian after its US translation. If anglophone culture no longer beams its literature from the centre to what Umberto Eco called “the peripheries of the Empire”, it still acts as a transit hub between them, the arbiter of what is allowed to go beyond the confines of the local. My own novel,Perfection, has been acquired for translation in languages from Thai to Lithuanian only after its reception in English, and its International Booker shortlisting.This could be seen as another, subtler form of imperialism; and yet it also allows more room for agency. Our peripheries are closer to each other than the long way through the centre makes it seem: readers in Buenos Aires or Naples could very well find a story set in Seoul more relatable than one set in Franzen’s Minnesota.Durastanti’s latest novel, Missitalia, has a section set in Basilicata, mixing the true story of the women-only gangs that haunted its forests in the 19th century with the parallel-history discovery of oil there. As it is currently being translated into 10 languages (including English), she recently told me that her translators sometimes reach out to ask for help in rendering the region’s atmosphere. “Just think Appalachia,” is an answer she gives.Perfection by Vincenzo Latronico, translated by Sophie Hughes, is published by Fitzcarraldo (£12.99).

Perhaps it’s something we should do more often. After all, we owe them everything, from the air we breathe to the soil beneath our feet, and far less obvious things too. We have trees to thank for the swirl of our fingerprints, our posture, and possibly even our dreams.In her new book, British tree science consultant Harriet Rix presents trees as an awesome force of nature, a force that has, over time, “woven the world into a place of great beauty and extraordinary variety”. How have trees done this? And can they really be said to possess “genius”?If you think of life first emerging from the sea, hundreds of millions of years ago, you might picture something like the Tiktaalik, a human-sized floppy-footed fish that hauled itself out of the shallows some time in the Late Devonian. But the evolutionary eureka moment arguably came long before that, when one lucky greenalgawashed up on the Cambrian shore and managed to survive the deadly UV light on land.Element by element, trees have learned to control water, air, fire and the ground beneath us“Plants learning to survive and use UV light was a thunderbolt,” writes Rix. It “allowed a whole new chemistry to emerge, root and branch, in a whole new place: dry land … Safe from predators, who for the moment were left in the sea behind them, these photosynthesising cells started on a path that led to the amazing complexity of trees.”Viewed on cosmic fast forward, as part of “a strange, apparently accelerated world, in which continents drift around like rubber ducks, bumping into one another”, trees seem almost godlike, using their biochemical wizardry to transform the Earth from a stony, storm-ravaged wasteland into a place where life could thrive. They broke barren rock into soil, canalised flood waters into rivers, pumped oxygen into the atmosphere, and turned the desert green.Element by element, trees have learned to control water, air, fire and the ground beneath us, as well as fungi, plants, animals, and even people, shaping them according to their own “tree-ish” agenda. Some fairly knotty chunks of biochemistry and evolutionary history are smoothed by lush descriptions of contemporary habitats as Rix travels the world, from the cloud forests of La Gomera to the junipers of Balochistan. She is an intrepid and erudite guide.Despite the title, this is not a book that gives much weight to questions of tree consciousness or intelligence. It doesn’t stop to consider whether our leafy friends have feelings. Rix acknowledges that the early work of Suzanne Simard – whose research into resource exchange between trees via underground mycelial networks gave rise to the concept of the wood wide web – was “beautiful field science” and “immensely compelling”, but she gives short shrift to subsequent anthropomorphic claims that trees “talk” or “love” or “mother” one another. “Putting a nurturing mammalian face on to the giants of the forest was also a massive betrayal of the complexities of an organism that could be thousands of years old,” she writes. “Thinking of the 5,000 years in which Methuselah [a storied bristlecone pine] has had to negotiate existence makes simple narratives about the gentle exchange of nourishing sugars seem astoundingly trite.”What, then, is the genius of trees? Rix locates it in the elegant solutions they have devised to the constantly changing riddle of life. It’s a genius you can smell in the rich terpenes given off by trees to seed clouds, generating rain and expanding their own habitats. It’s a genius you can taste in the sweet fruit that makes animals do trees’ bidding, and arguably gave our simian ancestors their brains. It’s a vast, generative genius that has nurtured our own. Our clever fingers – and fingerprints – evolved to grip their branches. Our dreams were born in the safe, fragrant nests we built in their canopies. This is why, Rix argues, we find the smell of wood so comforting, and why we like to press our noses between the pages of books. Genius is too small a word for all of this.The Genius of Trees by Harriet Rix is published by Vintage (£25). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Lilia was lucky to be allowed to leave the Federation for London, where she worked on a device to enable neural entanglement. This could be a powerful tool for changing – or controlling – society, and there are those who will stop at nothing to get their hands on it. At the heart of this story is a dissident book, The Forever Argument, asserting the necessity of opposition in any society: “It keeps us not only honest, but human. Without it, anyone is a monster.” Like the fictional text, this thought-provoking, fast-moving thriller is also a heartfelt call for resistance to oppressive regimes.View image in fullscreenThe Phoenix Pencil Companyby Allison King(4th Estate, £16.99)Monica, a talented coder in present-day America, worries about her beloved grandparents, now in their 90s. She decides to track down her grandmother Yun’s long-lost cousin Meng, who remained in China after Yun emigrated. Once close, the two women were divided by political history, like so many Chinese families in the mid-20th century. Monica is puzzled when her attempt to connect with Meng results only in the gift of a single wooden pencil, but Yun understands. Before it is too late, she must tell her story – and reveal to Monica the secret power possessed by the women of the family, once used to reclaim the words written with the pencils their company sold in wartime Shanghai. The gift brought hardship and heartbreak, the shame of being forced by government officials to betray the secrets of people who bought their pencils, but also chances to preserve precious letters and poems that would otherwise have been lost. This unusual idea provides the single shining thread of fantasy illuminating an absorbing family saga interwoven with reflections on the power of stories, and who has the right to decide what is preserved or permitted to remain secret.View image in fullscreenHemlock & Silverby T Kingfisher (Tor, £22)The latest from the Nettle & Bone author is narrated by Anja, whose expertise is finding antidotes to poisons. She’s summoned by the king, who thinks his daughter Snow is being poisoned. Her symptoms don’t match any known illness, and there are no suspects or motive; the determinedly rational Anja eventually realises the solution will only be found through a magical mirror. There are echoes of classic fairytales in an original, highly entertaining story that slips easily between humour and horror, action and romance, and introduces a wonderfully sarcastic cat.View image in fullscreenSecret Lives of the Deadby Tim Lebbon(Titan, £9.99)It seems like a cool adventure to BB and Matt when Jodi suggests they break into a derelict old house in search of rumoured treasure. But a brutal killer has been following the same rumours, on the trail of a grotesque relic that might remove the curse put on his family generations ago; he’ll kill anyone who crosses his path. Tightly written and grippingly suspenseful, this fast-moving, violent tale is not for the faint of heart.View image in fullscreenThe Course of the Heartby M John Harrison(Serpent’s Tail, £10.99)Three Cambridge students follow an occult master into an English meadow to perform a ritual that leaves them haunted for the rest of their lives. Beginning with echoes of Arthur Machen and MR James, the novel soon dispenses with genre standards, merging gritty realism with dreamy fantasy and eerie horror. A groundbreaking work, written with a painterly eye for light and shade, it has been a cult classic since its first publication in 1992; this reprint should reach a much wider audience.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction booksScience fiction roundupFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The boards of the stage are dug up with a plough at the start – a sign of things to come. A chicken is bashed in a sack as part of a pagan sacrifice (the real chicken remains unharmed), a naked man emerges from within an animal’s carcass and there is an apocalyptic landscape of erupting pineapples.It’s wacky, but stays just on the right side of reckless. Directed by Stef Aerts, Joé Agemans, Thomas Verstraeten and Marie Vinck, and part of the Edinburgh international festival, this is a wordless piece, based on muscular movement and stunning live music composed by Joachim Badenhorst and Sean Carpio. The arresting scenes mark the arc of human progress, from the taking up of tools onwards. When the industrial age dawns, a steam engine is shown with human limbs wrapped around it, as if they are extensions of the machine.The title refers to a poem by Hesiod on agrarian culture, for what that’s worth, but the narrative stays oblique. Yet you feel the changing mood. There are revels and fertility rites when actors’ trousers are unbuttoned, skirts raised. One couple literally roll in a sack. Spiritual ceremonies are enacted, too, and spinning around fire.There is a construction phase, with nature tamed and a chorus of hammers on wood, a storm of sawdust. A house-like structure is erected from this industriousness. Civilisation arrives as animals are gutted, with fluttering red scarves standing in for blood and viscera. Performers, including Aerts, Agemans, Verstraeten and Vinck, plus Susan De Ceuster, Geert Goossens, Fumiyo Ikeda and Maryam Sserwamukoko, are as physical as dancers.View image in fullscreenCivilisation arrives … Works and Days.Photograph: Kurt van der ElstThere is an almost constant shaking, pounding, swirling on stage, and beauty, too, in some of the scenes, but it is invariably interrupted by savagery – a large animal, maybe an elephant, is eviscerated and strung up – or a violent sound.The sonic effects are enthralling, with instruments used in original ways: two flutes taped together, a table harp and saxophone that sounds like a didgeridoo, six Tibetan singing bowls fused as one and played with a bow and mallet … The music is inspired by Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, but seems so much stranger. The lighting, by Aerts, Agemans and Ken Hioco, is magnificent, too, with swarms of blackness and columns of light.Is this theatre, installation or dance? Who knows. As indefinable as it may be, it arrests. AI raises its head in the final moments. It is funny but unnerving.

So he is steeped in Wodehouse’s wonderland.That shows in his ease with this one-man play about the comic writer. He is a natural as “Plum”, the affectionate name that Wodehouse went by. Premiering as a touring show some years ago, and directed by Robin Herford, it is well oiled enough if wooden and unadventurous in its storytelling.It is the 1950s, Wodehouse is in his New York state home, writing another Jeeves and Wooster book. Wodehouse’s wife Ethel (“Bunny”) occasionally asks for a drink as an off-stage voice, while he writes letters to his beloved daughter “Snorkles” (his affectionate name for Leonora).That serves as a plodding form of exposition and backstory in William Humble’s script, although Wodehouse tells us himself that he is not one for deep thinking so we do not get much of his inner world. There is a further framing device in the shape of an American biographer who wants to write Wodehouse’s life story – he functions as another listener to whom Wodehouse can narrate his life and thoughts.The humour is lukewarm and predictable, with many spiffings,top-holes and cricketing metaphors for good measure. Occasionally, he sings. You certainly learn things about Wodehouse’s world but he does not turn into flesh and blood.The play becomes more interesting when it touches on Wodehouse’s controversial speeches in the second world war, recorded by the Nazis to be broadcast in the US. They followed his year-long internment and were taken in Britain as a sign of his complicity. It veers into darker territory still when we hear about his daughter’s fate. But just as Wodehouse does not like depth, so this comes too late and is too quickly smoothed over. It makes for an anodyne drama with not nearly enough comic bite.AtAssembly George Square Studios, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatrePG WodehouseEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Now from another corner of south London comes its near-namesake Accessible Pigeon Material, by Lewisham export Toussaint Douglass. Dry your eyes, mate? OK, Douglass’s compendium of autobiography and bird gags may not reduce you to tears. But it’s an eye-catching hour from an act with a distinctive line in do-things-his-own-way comedy.Eccentricity is relative, of course. Douglass promises (or should that be threatens?) that pigeons, pigeons and more pigeons will be all we’re getting, and, to stress the point, there’s one circulating the stage strapped to a remote-controlled car. Pigeon facts are then scattered like seed by a man with an outsized zeal for our feathered not-always-friends. But the show soon deviates from the avian theme, towards something more conventional for a standup debut: a “this is me” account of where Douglass comes from and what his life looks like. Dressed “like a croupier” at primary school and reared by his beloved gran, AKA “87-year-old flatmate”, he’s now starting a family with his partner (cue a fine gag about why he can’t use the word “girlfriend”), and still untangling his relationship with his emotionally absent dad.The disconnect between macho parent and misfit kid is the scab Douglass keeps picking atThe latter is embodied by a glove puppet of a boxer, deployed in a comically awkward father-son role play with a member of the audience. The disconnect between macho parent and misfit kid is the scab Douglass keeps picking at in a set that makes peace, finally, with his neurodivergence.Again, the show leans on one or two familiar structural props to make that point. And not all of its jokes land. But many do (one about easy peelers; another about wanting to die alone), occasionally because dismayed Douglass bellows the punchlines at us over and again until we acquiesce. That’s just what he has to do to get us normies to connect with his dotty way of seeing. It works: after a lifetime of ill-fitting introversion, Douglass has cracked how to make the inside of his mind seem not just accessible, but a very fun place to spend time.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalNeurodiversityreviewsShareReuse this content"

The evidence is there in the floral dresses, the sexual ambiguity and the air of transgression. That the Nirvana star never said anything about it, goes the line of thought, only points to the less accommodating mood of the grunge-era 1990s. The singer’s suicide at 27 might, in other times, have been included in the grim tally of trans death statistics.Three years after Cassie Workman told Cobain’s story inAberdeen, a melancholic spoken-word show, Emma Frankland is similarly drawn to reflect on the life of a musician who caught the imagination of a generation. Frankland knows the theory is unprovable, even a little absurd, but takes heart in the thought that it could be true. She refers to Cobain as she/her throughout.Having been a teenage grunge obsessive in pre-internet Falmouth, keeping vigil with her best friend when news broke of the singer’s death, Frankland can only fantasise about what it would have meant for her to have had a trans role model of such fame. What if Dave Grohl had revealed the secret to unsuspecting fans? What if Cobain herself had sung her truth? How different might trans solidarity have been?Hunched over an acoustic guitar in an exact copy of Cobain’s 1993MTV Unpluggedclothes – right down to the cigarette burn in the floppy brown cardie – she uses this idle fantasy as a way of talking about a deeper truth. In a poetic, engagingly spoken performance, directed by Harry Clayton-Wright, she moves from humour to anger as she considers the stresses of not being seen, not being accepted, not being valued.Even a female Icarus, she says in a twist on the classical myth, stretching her glorious wings and coming out to the world, might still be constrained, her feathers clipped by an intolerant society.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 24 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalSummerhallKurt CobainNirvanaTransgenderreviewsShareReuse this content"

Four years on from that blockbuster deal, which looked all but doomed to end in disaster, Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac (legally changed from McElhenney, a tongue-twisting trip wireapparently) have not only proven to beeminently noble stewardsof 160-year-old Wrexham FC; in hindsight, they look even cannier for deciding to make a great show of their attempt to reverse the club’s fortunes.Wrexham’s success shows that content is now truly king in footballRead moreWelcome to Wrexham – their Ted Lasso-like hourlong series documenting the club’s historic ascent from fifth division English football to, now, the Premier League doorstep – has been an unqualified hit with American audiences and critics, many of whom came into this premise as clueless as the new owners themselves. So it figures now that Wrexham has nabbedeight primetime Emmy nominations, Hollywood finds itself scrabbling to turn Reynolds and Mac’s offsides run into a proper reality TV subgenre, with three new Wrexham knockoffs hitting small screens starting from last week.Amazon’s Built in Birmingham: Brady and the Blues follows Tom Brady’s quest to turn around Birmingham City. From the kickoff, the seven-time NFL champion bristles at any attempts to frame his interest in City as a vanity project; that’s even as his series serves up another test ofthe Patriot Way,the TB12 methodand other winning formulas that fueled hisgridiron Cinderella story– a favoritechestnut. “What’s the difference between football and soccer”?” he asks, rhetorically. “Nothing.”Throughout the five-part series, Brady fancies himself a visionary and disrupter only to be revealed as a classic American know-it-all. “I’m a little worried about our new coach’s work ethic,” he says, hinting at some buyer’s remorse over former England captain Wayne Rooney – who turned out to be acomplete disasteras manager. Brady would have been far better served making a documentary on his conflicting interests as an NFL owner (of the Las Vegas Raiders) and the league’s highest-paid game analyst. The alternative, his Prime Video series, is as satisfying as a solitary morsel of dark chocolate – once aTB12 nightcap staple, bitter and unfulfilling. And that’s despite the excess of clips from Peaky Blinders. (Show creator Steven Knight is an executive producer on Birmingham.)FX’s Necaxa, the official Wrexham spinoff that debuted Thursday, offers a deeper dive into Liga MX – Mexicanfútbol. Surprisingly, Mac and Reynolds also feature prominently as executive producers and talking heads in this five-part series. The job of actually reviving the team falls to Eva Longoria, who further seizes the opportunity to reconnect with her Mexican roots. Apart from Mac and Reynolds’s cameos, the series is told completely in Spanish – a language that Longoria, a Texas native who grew up speaking English, is openly self-conscious about speaking. The obvious play here is cultural representation, and it will surely find an audience in a league that was oncemore watched in the USthan the Prem.Only one Wrexham knockoff really scores: ESPN+’s Running of the Wolves. At first blush the idea of a third-division Italian team owned by Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos, daytime TV’s impossibly good looking real-life married couple, couldn’t seem more far-fetched. But Consuelos isn’t playing a part here. In fact, he spent chunks of his formative years on the boot, grew up rooting for Juventus and speaks fluent (if heavily American inflected) Italian. It was in 2022 that he and Ripa joined the group that owns Campobasso FC, a properly downtrodden outfit. But you wouldn’t know it from the way Consuelos cheerleads for them on Live!, syndicated TV’s morning colossus.Campobasso is a real-life fantasy team for Consuelos. He bolts to Italy at a moment’s notice to participate in personnel meetings and stir enthusiasm around town. (“Really good haircuts, great tattoos and they smell amazing!” was how he assessed the team after greeting them coming off the bus before a friendly.) When co-owner Mark Rizzetta rings long distance from Italy to strategize about acquiring a star player who once seemed out of reach, Consuelos doesn’t hesitate to interrupt dinner at home with the wife to take the video call.Wolves doesn’t just nod at Wrexham and open with Ripa and Consuelos interviewing Reynolds on Live! about the club. (That’s as trash talk between Brady and Mac spices up a matchup between City and Wrexham … ) Wolves tweaks the Wrexham formula to more winsome effect over the course of its four hourlong episodes. Reynolds and Mac look like kings of comedy until they’re set against two former soap stars closing in on 30 years of marriage. “In my next life, I want to be an Italian football problem,” Ripa sighs as Consuelos and Rizzetta scramble to put a deal together at the transfer deadline. Throughout, Ripa makes clear to her husband that she’d have an easier time accepting the inconveniences if he’d just buy them a villa already.Where Birmingham City is just another mountain to climb for Brady, who never cottoned to the role ofstay-at-home dad, Consuelos is at pains to make his football dream a family affair. After one Wolves win Consuelos dances with his daughter inside the team’s rickety stadium, a far cry from the hallowed cathedrals of English football. (Square that with Brady mocking Birmingham City’s much nicer but still humble headquarters as he’s pulling up …) Consuelos attaches to players – not least Abdallah Soulemana, a lightly used Ghanan-American defenseman from the Bronx. In the pilot, Consuelos can’t bear the idea of cutting Soulemana and losing out on his potential, so he arranges a loan to another team and makes the extra effort to seek him out on the field to gently break the news.Still, once you get past the game highlights and human interest stories, there will be no missing these Wrexham knockoffs for what they truly are – hackneyed exercises in marketing and self-promotion, with a bit more spit and polish. And there’s no mystery to why American celebrities, masters of this dark art, are making reality TV the cornerstone of their global football exploits. Since Reynolds and Mac bought Wrexham, they’ve seen their initial $2.5m investment in the team mushroom intoa roughly $475m assetand the town of Wrexham reborn as a global tourist trap. Talk about faking it till you make it.It’s not hard to imagine Michael B Jordan (Bournemouth), Snoop Dogg (Swansea City) and more celebrity football owners getting into the international TV game. But itishard to imagine them replicating Consuelos’s genuine enthusiasm for the actual sport. You get the sense that if the day ever comes when he’s forced to sell the family stake in Campobasso, it’ll be to make way for owners with more cash to put them at the top of Europe’s football table – or to score Ripa her dream villa. In all likelihood, their particular football problems won’t feel quite so first world to sports fans who know from struggle.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionRyan ReynoldsTelevisionTom BradyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The floor’s open. Someone goes in for their second round, buying me some time with a two-step, a dribble and out. Another agonising pause. I know Tiger’s looking at me – he’s not going to let me get out of this, so I jump in. I’d been working on my running man, but the two‑step is my anchor now. And I just keep two-stepping. It’s fitful, it’s awkward, it’s out of time – but I’mdoingit, footworking in the middle of a dance circle. “You’re part of the culture now!” beams Tiger, as I jitterbug back to the sidelines.It’s my first time attending a footwork practice session, led by the instructor Tiger in the foyer of Central Saint Martins art college in London. I heard about these sessions through an “open decks” night dedicated to footwork, the furiously fast and bassy style of dance music from Chicago. The dance actually came before the music, but that part of it has never really caught on in the UK. Times are changing, though. Not since flailing to dubstep at university have I felt so enthused by the dancing side of club music.From the twist in the 60s to themigraine skankin the 00s, music fans have always loved to throw down moves – and surely the point of going to a nightclub is to dance. But nowadays that’s often far from the case. Phones have turned clubs into vehicles for social media content, with some DJs becoming exasperated at the way that punters – who often stand still, filming big-screen visuals, or each other – seem more interested in documenting the night than dancing.View image in fullscreen‘You feel invested in the event’ … Bristol Northern Soul Club.Photograph: Barnaby ChinnockThis can create a vibe-killing feedback loop. “I asked some friends why they don’t dance in public and some said because of the fear of being filmed,” the rapper Tyler, the Creator recently posted by way of introduction to his dance‑focused new album,Don’t Tap the Glass. “I thought: damn, a natural form of expression and a certain connection they have with music is now a ghost.”In Britain, it’s also getting harder to go out clubbing at all, due to the cost of living crisis and a drop in the number of nightclubs – about 400 have closed in the past five years. So, across the country, grassroots dance communities are countering this by creating safe spaces for people to learn new moves and feel emboldened to share them on the dancefloor. “People need something to do on a night out,” says Eve Burgsoul, who co-runsBristol Northern Soul Clubwith Levanna McLean. Dancing, she says, means “they areinthe experience”.Northern soul spun out of the Twisted Wheel nightclub in Manchester in the 60s before spreading to Wigan, Blackpool and Stafford in the 70s and generating an entire subculture of British people spinning, dipping and doing other elaborate moves to obscure, uptempo US soul music. It survived as a hobby for older generations, but Bristol NorthernSoulClub, and other nights like it, have galvanised a younger crowd. Their videos of McLean shuffling to soul classics and pop songs on the streets of Bristol have been such a hit that they have gained traction worldwide. “We’re viral in Russia because our dancing got remixed to a techno song,” says Burgsoul.Clubbers at Bristol Northern Soul Club nights learn the basics of keeping time and focusing on their feet. Knowing even some rudimentary moves means that “rather than standing there with a drink, waiting for someone to talk to you, you’ve got something to do”, says Burgsoul. “You feel invested in the event,” adds McLean.Learning to dance opens you up to whole new communities – something those in the ballroom scene know intimately. In the US, ballroom culture has provided solidarity for Black and Latin LGBTQ+ people since the 60s; the dancerLes Childformed the first British vogue collective, the House of Child, in the 80s. These houses can serve as surrogate families for community members estranged from their biological relations, as well as teams that perform for renown and cash prizes.It has lineage … you’re entering a community that’s larger than that moment in timeVogue is an integral feature of these balls. It’s a sharp battle dance consisting of five basic elements: spins and dips, duckwalk, catwalk, hands and floor. Smily discovered ballroom after he was disowned by his family at 17 and happened upon a vogue class at Studio 25 in Manchester, hosted by the ballroom dancer andManchester Ballroom Community(MBC) founder Sacha 007. Smily immediately took to the acrobatic style. “Voguing was a wholesome release of dopamine for me,” he says. “I channelled my energy into every move and people enjoyed it. Eventually, I went on to walk in Paris.”Smily now runs MBC and hosts open sessions where newbies pay to learn the basic elements of vogue. MBC has a large pool of beginners keen to walk balls, but nowhere for them to perform, since most vogue events happen in London and many can’t afford the trip. “Manchester definitely needed more queer, trans, Black and POC [people of colour] spaces,” says Smily. With money from the workshops and other fundraising events, MBC has managed to throw a few balls in Manchester and now hosts one of the city’s first OTA (open to all) vogue nights.View image in fullscreen‘Manchester needed more queer, trans, Black and POC spaces’ … Manchester Ballroom Community.Photograph: Courtesy:  Daniel QuansahPartnerships such as these are bringing dance out of the studio and into public spaces. In London, the footwork promoter 160 Unity has joined forces with After Werks, the class I attend, resulting in dance circles at the front of their last two nights in London. “The footwork crew has brought something to dance music that I’ve yearned for so long: communal dance,” says Chris Kanski, a 160 Unity punter and After Werks regular. He arrived at After Werks from a background in hardcore punk and metal. “Footwork nights give that spontaneous expression and that challenge that’s so special in hardcore punk. There are eyes on you and people are looking both at what you express and what you can do.”The same feeling is evident in the UK jazz dance scene, which took off in the 70s as teenagers began leaping, stomping and skipping to the sounds of acid jazz and Latin fusion at clubs such as Chaplins in Birmingham. The craze migrated south, where DJs such asGilles Petersonturned London into the new mecca of UK jazz dance with his nights at Dingwalls.View image in fullscreen‘There’s nothing like playing to an active audience who are really feeling the music’ … jazz dance sessions at Come Sunday in Birmingham.Photograph: @valere_nakasilaIt endures today. At the Bath House community building in London, I witness the jazz dance luminary Masumi Endo work tirelessly to encourage bystanders on to the floor for Jazzy Sport London’sNo Nation Under a Grooveparty, which brings together three dance communities: After Werks, Epic Jam (breakdance) and Footnotes (jazz dance). By the end of the evening, the dancing spirit has reached such a fever pitch that the whole room is moving together in one bubbling cauldron of styles.“There’s nothing like playing to an active audience who are sweating their tits off and really feeling the music,” says Jayson Wynters, who DJs at the jazz dance event Come Sunday atHockley Social Clubin Birmingham alongside Nick Schlittner. One of Come Sunday’s main challenges has been holding on to their young dancers, many of whom move to London in search of job opportunities in TV and theatre. But inM.uuyathey have a loyal, 32-year-old regular who relishes the intergenerational side of the event. “It has lineage,” he says. “You’re entering a community that’s larger than that moment in time.”Back at the footwork dance class, Tiger remembers how bouncers and DJs would welcome him into his local nightclub in Muswell Hill, London, where he went weekly to practise his moves. That was 18 years ago; he wonders whether “DJs and promoters should reach out to dancers more”.When they do, the effect can be intoxicating: earlier this year, he was the star of the night when the footwork legendsRP BooandDJ Spinnplayed at Venue MOT in south London. “If I’m doing the Biz Markie” – an old-school hip-hop move – “next to you in the club, I can show you what to do,” he says. And while he believes dancers are inherently free in expression, he argues that knowing some basic moves allows you to have the most amount of fun on the dancefloor.‘By 8pm it is time to head home’: whatever happened to the big night out?Read moreHe’s not wrong. My two-step has kept me occupied during an average club night on Rye Lane in Peckham, London, and my erk’n’jerks – another footwork move – have left me exhausted and elated after a particularly sweaty set in Bermondsey. My dancing isn’t going to save a club from its financial woes, but if promoters can partner with grassroots collectives, organise workshops and encourage dancers to the floor, they can benefit from an integral aspect of club culture that people, old and young, are clearly craving. “People love it,” says Kanski. “It’s real, it’s raw, it’s chaotic, it’s beautiful.”Come Sunday Monthly Jamis monthly at Hockley Social Club, Birmingham.Bristol Northern Soul Club All Dayeris at Wiper and True Taproom, 9 August.VH1 Ballis at Fulham Pier, 15 August.Footnotes x Jazzy Sport London Monthly Jamis at Next Door Records 2, London, 19 August.After Werks Monthly Open Decksis at AAJA Basement, London, 28 August.160 Unityis at Fold, London, 5 OctoberDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For a very different day, visit Prora and its massive beachside concrete apartment blocks, originally planned as a Nazi holiday complex, before becoming a Soviet army barracks, and now a part ruin, part reunification commercial and residential redevelopment.RichardProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Guys selling hot smoked fish meet you as you get off the ferry. Getting there is an adventure in itself, as the ferry takes you past the colossal cranes of Gdańsk’s shipyards. Long sandy beaches, pine forests and a small picturesque village make Hel a fantastic place to spend a few days. Famous for its seals, as well as its seaside, it really is the opposite of its fiery namesake.Lucy MooreSwimming and seafood in SwedenView image in fullscreenBjörkö island in the Gothenburg archipelago.Photograph: Amazing Aerial/AlamyWe’ve just returned from a Scandi road trip and had four fantastic, chilled nights on Björkö. It’s only 30 minutes from central Gothenburg by (free!) car ferry and regular buses. Great swimming and beaches; micro breweries and fresh fish; sunsets and sunrises to die for; days out in Gothenburg, including the excellent Liseberg theme park, with no queues for proper scary rides – highly recommended.JamesRowing in Finland’sÅland archipelagoView image in fullscreenKayaking at Kobba Klintar island in Åland.Photograph: Olivier Goujon/AlamyFuelled by our kids’ love of flags and a craving for quiet, we chose Åland, thousands of islands scattered between Sweden and Finland like granite gods wept there. We cycled between clouds and old boat sheds, stopping for smoked herring and cardamom pancakes with stewed prunes (sexier than it sounds). By the time Ivar lent us ancient alder oars to row to the next island, knowing they’d be returned by a friend, we’d learned that Åland doesn’t welcome visitors – it absorbs them.Eliza AinleyCliff-edge drama in north-west SpainView image in fullscreenThe coastal town of Ribadesella in Asturias.Photograph: Joaquin Ossorio-Castillo/AlamyBased in Oviedo (the ideal compact city), in Asturias, we would explore the coast one day, mountains the next, finding unexpected Gaudí buildings, gingerbread houses in Ribadesella, amazing cemeteries on cliff edges, enjoyable easy driving on perfect roads, gorgeous unspoilt beaches and great weather!

Bleik beach on Andøya is one of the longest in Norway – “bleik” means “white” or “pale” in Norwegian, and the almost empty white sand, coupled with refreshing blue sea and the towering cliffs behind the beach, made for a perfect end to a day’s hiking. Puffins abound here, and whale watching trips are available from Andenes, just a few miles to the north.RachelSeafood and sailing in Hanko, FinlandView image in fullscreenCamping at Gustavsvarn island, Hanko.Photograph: Markus Thomenius/AlamyHanko, Finland’s southernmost seaside gem, sits on a sandy dune that stretches out into the Baltic Sea.

To reach Hanko from Helsinki, take the VR train from Helsinki Central for about €15. Rent a bike once you arrive to explore the sandy beaches bordered by an ancient pine forest, historic villas and nature reserve. In the evening, enjoy fresh seafood with Baltic views and sit down for a pint of Lonkero.

With separate cycleways everywhere, you can explore the beautiful coastline up to Den Helder and,by ferry, Texel island (sandy beaches, pretty towns and robust Texel sheep). An unspoilt beach walkable from the campsite awaits, with dune footpaths that lead to restaurants built on stilts. The sunsets over the North Sea are stunning.

I felt sick to my stomachJulie-Anne KearnsFri 8 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareI’m of an age – 48 – that means I grew up without a computer. I didn’t use the internet until my early 20s, but once I did I was hooked, using it to keep in touch with friends. Over the years, the internet changed, but I always used the latest social media site to share my life with friends. Then, in 2021, I became ill – doctors noticed some changes in my genes and I ended up having a preventive double mastectomy and my ovaries removed. The stress caused my long-term relationship to break down. However, I tried to stay positive and shared my journey online to connect with others going through a similar thing.By November 2022, I’d built up quite a large following, and a message dropped into my inbox on Facebook from a man called Andrew. He said he was an army medic, based in Afghanistan, and he’d been moved by my story – his wife had recently passed away. We chatted for weeks, and I really opened up and started to feel close to him. One day, he messaged saying his internet was about to be cut off, and asked me to send him some gift cards with money on them.I immediately grew suspicious, and cut off contact with him. I posted about what had happened, and was shocked to realise this was a common romance scam known as trauma bonding, where a scammer locks on to a traumatic experience and uses it to bond with you.People started messaging me in droves, sharing their experiences. I was shocked and upset for them. I was working full-time as an NHS healthcare worker, but when I wasn’t at work I’d spend hours helping to track down scammers – and I’d post about the stories to warn other people on my TikTok account,@staysafewithmjules.One lady had fallen for a soldier and sent him thousands of pounds, but she had a feeling something wasn’t right. I discovered the scammer had stolen the identity of a real US soldier who had died in a car crash. She was absolutely devastated. There were dozens more like her.Experience: I found a stranger under my hotel bedRead moreAs my followers grew to more than 10,000, I started to become a target for scammers myself. I began to enjoy leading them along to the point they’d ask for money and send me their bank details – then I could report their bank or crypto account to the police.Because I deal with scams nearly every day, I didn’t think I’d become a victim myself – but somehow I did.Last year, I received a letter from HMRC about my yearly tax rebate. It said they’d added extra security to my account and I needed to send a copy of my passport and driving licence to confirm my identity. It sounds ridiculous now, but because the letter looked identical to ones I’d always received, I sent pictures of my documents to the email provided.A few days later, I started to get worried and called HMRC. To my horror, they told me I’d already claimed the £2,000 they owed me. They investigated and asked me about the bakery I’d recently opened. I can’t bake a cake to save my life. It slowly unravelled that someone had opened a fake business under my name, likely used for money laundering.I spoke to the police, and they were helpful in getting the fake business shut down, but further investigations showed my details were for sale on the dark web. I’d had dozens of loan applications made in my name, most of which had been rejected – but the endless attempts left my credit score in the gutter. Then I received a letter from a solicitor telling me I was being taken to court for non-payment of a £16,000 loan that had been taken out in my name. I felt sick to my stomach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The police advised me to change everything I could; email addresses, phone numbers, even my name and address.I worried about whether to share that I’d been scammed. It’s common for people to victim-blame and say they’d never fall for it, but it can happen to anyone. I’m glad I did share what happened to me because it might help someone else avoid going through it, too. And despite knowing it will continue to make me a target, I’ll keep running my social media pages hunting down scammers – my experience proves how important it is.As told to Heather MainDo you have an experience to share?

While pavlova is often my go-to, I also like the more relaxed, throw-together nature of Eton mess. I’ve given it my own spin here by using a brown sugar meringue, which adds a gorgeous, caramel flavour and makes all the difference compared with shop-bought shells. Macerate the peaches in sumac and lime, whip up some cream and yoghurt, then pile it all high on a pretty platter for a perfect pud for a crowd.Peach and sumac Eton messPrep5 minMacerate20 minCook2 hrCool2 hr+Serves10-12For the meringue60g caster sugar120g light brown sugar3 egg whites(about 120g)For the filling4 ripe peaches30g caster sugarJuice of ½lime1 tsp sumac250ml double cream150g greek yoghurt2 tsp icing sugar½ tsp vanilla bean pasteFresh mint, to finishHeat the oven to 120C (100C fan)/250F/gas ½ and line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. Mix the caster and light brown sugars in a small bowl and set aside.Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk on medium-low until they turn frothy. Turn up the speed to medium-high, then beat in the sugar mixture a tablespoon at a time. Once you have a stiff and glossy meringue, spoon tablespoon-sized dollops of it on to the lined tray, then bake for 80-90 minutes, until the meringues are firm to the touch and the paper peels off easily. Turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside for a few hours (overnight is best) with the door closed until they have cooled completely.Stone the peaches, then slice them all into eighths and put in a bowl with the sugar, lime juice and sumac. Stir gently to coat, then leave to macerate for at least 20 minutes.When you’re ready to serve, put the cream, yoghurt, icing sugar and vanilla in a bowl and whip to soft peaks. Break up half of the meringues and fold the pieces into the cream mix. Spoon half the mixture on to a platter and top with more broken meringue and some peach slices. Repeat with the remaining cream and meringue, then top with the remaining peaches and any juices from the peach bowl. Finish with a few fresh mint leaves and serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsDessertThe sweet spotBritish food and drinkFoodEggsBakingFruitSummer food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Rachel Crampton was facing a 23-hour flight with three children under the age of five. Unable to recruit a family member or friend to help out, she took to social media and offered a sizeable cash payment – A$1,000 (about £560 at the time) – to someone who would accompany her on the epic London-to-Sydney flight.Crampton, a Briton based in Sydney, was inundated with responses and found an “amazing Aussie girl” living in London who was homesick but could not afford the flight back to Australia.She has since turned that experience into a business which has just launched in the UK after success in Australia. Her website, Juurnee, matches those who want help on a flight with people willing to be their travel companion.View image in fullscreenRachel Crampton.Photograph: Rachel CramptonThose needing help could include a parent travelling solo with toddlers, an older person requiring some assistance, someone with a disability, an unaccompanied child, or a nervous flyer.The companion receives a payment that will cover part, or all, of the cost of their flight.At the time of writing there were 30 live requests for help on the site. These included a London-to-Switzerland return flight, where the full cost is offered to someone who can help an older passenger who uses a wheelchair; and a London-to-Sydney return trip, with 50% of the flight cost paid, for someone who can help a mother with her one-year-old (there is an option to help just one way).Crampton says more than 12,000 people have signed up to be a companion and many are qualified teachers, nurses, midwives, childcare workers and others who have clearances to work with children, or qualifications to assist people with disabilities.But she adds: “You don’t need to be a nanny or nurse – just a decent person willing to lend a hand.”People seeking a companion can post their offer for free and don’t pay for a successful match. They list the route, the date, the flight details and the sum they are willing to pay someone to travel with them.They can choose their own payment amount, although the website recommends 50% to 100% of a companion’s flight cost.Companions sign up for free and can view the offers, but pay a £15-a-year subscription to be able to message people directly to offer their services. They buy their own flights, so, to that extent, the person who needs help is not responsible for them.Once a companion has applied for an offer, the person requesting help has 14 days to accept and match with them. If selected, the companion will be put in touch with the individual needing help.View image in fullscreenAirports and flying produce an array of challenges, from crowded planes to the baggage hall.Photograph: Remko de Waal/EPACrampton recommends companions get paid at the end of the trip, and that an escrow service is used to hold the payment from when the agreement is struck until 48 hours after landing. “At the moment we are recommending our matched travellers use Escrow.com,” she adds.There is no official “contract” between the two parties provided by the site – for example, outlining what is expected of the companion – but Crampton says users are free to create one themselves. The website does providea guide that covers different scenarios.What if the companion doesn’t turn up at the airport? “We haven’t had this situation crop up just yet,” says Crampton.If, say, the companion rearranged their flight, they would not be paid their fee. “Hopefully, they would inform Juurnee, or the person they were meant to be helping, in advance, and then we can find another companion,” she says.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsAir transportTravel & leisureAirline industryTravelling soloTravelling with disabilitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since mid-2024 there have been 17 new designers appointed to head up houses including Gucci and Dior. But, in an industry fuelled by womenswear, just four of these appointments have been women.And there are other depressing statistics. Of the top 30 luxury brands in theVogue Business Index, a mere five creative directors are women. At Kering, the luxury conglomerate that owns Balenciaga and Valentino, there is just one: Louise Trotter at Bottega Veneta. At LVMH, the fashion behemoth that counts Loewe and Dior among its brands, again, just one label is helmed by a woman – Sarah Burton at Givenchy.There’s more. In February,research by 1Granaryfound that 74% of students at top fashion programmes are female, yet 88% of fashion’s top designer roles are held by men. The last time a woman won designer of the year at the Fashion awards was in 2012. And it’s not just designers. The majority of those in positions of power at brands, such as CEOs and executives, are also male.There is an anomaly, though. This week, the 19th iteration of Copenhagen fashion week (CPHFW), known in the industry as the fifth fashion week, is being held in the Danish capital. Of the 42 brands participating, 26 are founded and led by females.Stine Goya – who now sells her eponymous label in over 30 countries, with the US being its second-biggest market outsideDenmark– describes men’s continual domination of the fashion industry as “outdated”. Denmark’s structural approach to equality, she says, has become a key instigator of change, with policies aimed at improving wage equality and schemes to encourage women to return to work after having children. “Copenhagen has become an ecosystem for independent female-led brands,” she told me. “There is a spirit of collaboration here, and a willingness to do things differently. It has allowed women to take up space and build businesses on their own terms.”View image in fullscreenA look from Cecilie Bahnsen’s spring/summer ‘26 showPhotograph: James Cochrane/PR IMAGEStephanie Gundelach co-founded OpéraSport, a brand that specialises in creating contemporary wardrobe staples from upcycled materials, with Awa Malina Stelter in 2019. Gundelach says much of their motivation comes from the desire to overcome this type of gender inequality. “There is an unspoken bias in the fashion industry where often women have to work twice as hard to be seen as equally visionary. In Copenhagen, there is a shift happening.Womenare building their own platforms rather than waiting for a seat at someone else’s table.”Fashion’s idea of what a woman should look like impacts everything, from the models who appear on the catwalks to the design of the clothes. In 2024, for instance,1.4% of models on the catwalks at CPHFWwere plus-size while in New York, London, Milan and Paris just 0.8% of models were plus-size.Cecilie Bahnsen, who popularised the idea of wearing intricate and romantic dresses with practical trainers, says that as a woman designing for other women her ethos is based around comfort. “There is an ease to my pieces. They don’t outshine you.”“A lot of women want to wear something different to what male designers suggest they should wear,” says Anne Sofie Madsen, who this week relaunched her namesake brand with a new co-creative director, the stylist Caroline Clante. “We look at clothing with a female gaze. Our customers are not only dressing to be desired or admired, but also to be themselves.” This season’s collection included a pair of “evening jeans”, as well as meme-able “rat bags”.While the creative jobs at the top of the fashion industry have become synonymous with burnout, Danish designers take a more holistic approach to work-life balance, in line with Danish work culture generally. Madsen, who prior to launching her own label in 2011 worked alongside designers including Alexander McQueen and John Galliano, credits fashion’s traditional gauntlet of endless travelling, long hours and expectations to produce more than six collections a year as a catalyst for her hitting pause on her brand in 2017. “I realised that I was living a life that I didn’t want to live,” she says. “I wanted to figure out a different way to be in fashion.”View image in fullscreenMaking their own path … Awa Malina Stelter and Stephanie Gundelach at a Copenhagen fashion week event.Photograph: Martin Sylvest Andersen/Getty Images for DazedNow, Madsen and Clante are determined to build their brand to work around their lives, rather than making the brand their whole existence.

She allows her team of 26 women and four men to work flexible hours and discourages working at weekends. Gundelach and Stelter will often finish work at 3pm in order to spend time with their families, and Bahnsen’s five-year-old son is a regular sight in her atelier. Livia Schück, co-founder of Rave Review – who this season showed delicate boho-inspired dresses and skirts made from deadstock – took her post-show bow while holding her five-month-old daughter.“We don’t have a culture where you need to stay until five or six because that’s not workable when you have small kids,” says Stelter. “Our workers know what we expect of them, but they have the freedom to work flexibly. As long as the work is getting done we are happy.”Many Danes talk about the “law of Jante”, a sort of Scandinavian social code based on the idea that no one is better than anyone else. Gundelach describes how it feeds into “a collaborative rather than competitive energy” and says that “there is a strong community of female creatives lifting each other up, which I feel is quite rare”.Goya credits “a sense of openness” and an “ambitious creative scene” as a driving force for independent female designers. “It’s not been about having an ego. It is about building a team, a brand and a community.”As Isabella Rose Davey, chief operating officer of CPHFW, points out, the women paving a new path in the industry hope that others will follow their lead. “It is modern, forward thinking like this that we need to see more of outside Denmark to ensure that women are not locked out of senior positions.”To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterWomenDenmarknewslettersShareReuse this content"

Prune your stone-fruit tree now, and ensure a healthy winterCutting while the weather’s warm reduces the risk of fungal and bacterial diseases invadingClaire RatinonFri 8 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 09.28 EDTShareMany fruit trees are pruned in winter when they are dormant, in anticipation of the burst of energy that comes with spring. Yet established stone-fruit trees – plums, cherries, apricots and others in thePrunusfamily – should be pruned now to prevent them contracting silver leaf disease. Transmitted by spores active in the autumn and winter, and which infect trees through open wounds, this fungal disease can cause leaves to turn silver and lead to whole branches dying back.Pruning in summer is also prudent given that bacterial canker can find its way into a susceptible tree during the colder months of the year. Any wounds caused by pruning now will have plenty of time to heal before the seasons change.The aim when pruning a plum tree is to manage its size, shape and health, so start your cuts following the three Ds principle. Any branches that are dead, damaged or diseased should be the first to go. Once those are cleared, look for any that cross one another, and carefully prune those as crossing branches can rub, causing abrasions that can let disease in.Step back regularly to look at the tree as a whole. It’s easy to get fixated on one section before realising it’s become lopsidedThe next goal of pruning plum trees is to take the growth back by approximately a third, while creating or maintaining an open, goblet shape, which is ideal for air flow and vigour. You can do this by shortening branches, removing vertical ones (“watershoots”) and addressing congestion, especially at the centre of the tree. You can also remove any suckers that have appeared at the base.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Determine where to cut by finding an outward-facing bud that’s pointing in the direction that you want new growth to appear from, then make a sloped cut above it.While you’re doing this, step back regularly to look at the tree as a whole. It’s very easy to get fixated on sorting one section before realising that it’s all become lopsided. Cuts made now will determine the future shape of the tree, so it’s worth doing this job when you have time to be discerning.The point of judicious pruning isn’t merely to have more fruit – although that is a huge bonus – but also to ensure the health and vitality of trees so that they have long, fruitful lives. And if you inherit an old, neglected plum tree, you can use this approach to rehabilitate it. If it is done patiently and steadily over a few years (as aggressive pruning can be detrimental), it is possible to restore an abandoned tree to its former fruit-bearing glory.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensFruitFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His flagrant human rights violations have led tosanctions under the Magnitsky Act, imposed by President Trump.“Moraes’s allies in the judiciary and elsewhere are hereby warned not to support or facilitate his actions. We are monitoring the situation closely.”The message was a translatedrepost of a statementby Darren Beattie, the US’s senior official for public diplomacy.The Brazilian government viewed the message as a direct threat to theother supreme court justicespresiding over Bolsonaro’s trials and – given that Trump has yet to appoint an ambassador to Brazil – summoned the acting head of mission, chargé d’affaires Gabriel Escobar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The project has been championed by the president, but heavily criticised by environmentalists.Groups such as the NGO SOS Mata Atlânticawelcomed the vetoes, but said they would carry out a detailed review of both the discarded and remaining provisions “to continue mobilising civil society and ensure that congress upholds the gains secured”.ActionAid’s climate justice specialist, Jessica Siviero, said that “a full veto was essential, but the points that were struck down still represent progress”.Mighty Earth’s global director, João Gonçalves, also welcomed Lula’s vetoes and said he hoped congress would uphold them, warning that “if this destructive bill becomes law – just weeks ahead of Cop30 in Belém – it threatens to erode Brazil’s credibility on the global stage.”At Friday’s press conference, Lula’s ministers appeared careful not to criticise congress, stating that there were “positive” elements in the bill, which had been backed by agribusiness and mining interests as a way to “cut red tape” and “speed up” licensing procedures.“We hope to be able to streamline licensing processes without compromising their quality, which is essential for environmental protection at a time of climate crisis, biodiversity loss and desertification,” said Silva.Should Congress overturn the president’s vetoes, environmentalists and legal experts have warned the move could trigger a wave of lawsuits – both challenging the legislation itself and contesting projects approved through self-licensing – on the grounds that they violate Brazil’s constitution.Explore more on these topicsBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

That doesn’t mean that you have to swear allegiance to the head of a state of another foreign country.”This only happened, he pointed out, because Grenada was a former British colony and not because it was voted on by Grenadians.The governor-general, Dame Cécile La Grenade, the Crown’s representative in Grenada, assented to the two pieces of legislation to amend the oath, after they were approved in both the lower and upper Houses of Parliament.Grenada’s tourism and culture minister, Adrian Thomas, said the move was a response to decades of calls from Grenadians to change the oath, setting it amid a broader trend to decolonise society, assert the country’s independence and reform the constitution.He said: “Although we still have many institutions, like the royal prison, the Royal Grenada Police Force, we are on the road to decolonising our society and apart from the oath of allegiance we will be doing much more in years to come.”On the streets of St George’s, communications consultant Sherene Thomas-Isaac, said the change was “long overdue”.“We’re independent. I think that’s a mark of our sovereignty … We have to follow the true course of what independence means for our region,” she said.The change to the oath comes as theGrenadaReparations Commissionvowed to step up the pursuit of an apologyand reparations from the monarch and intensify calls for the removal of King Charles as the country’s head of state, after new research revealed that George IV personally profited from slavery on theCaribbeanisland.Arley Gill, the head of the commission, thanked Francis Alexis, a former attorney general and government minister, for lobbying for the change, which he described as “one small step in the further deconstruction of a new colonialism process”.Gill said: “We need to strengthen the lobby in Grenada to get rid of the king as head of state. The royal family is not fit and proper to be the head of state of a country where they have directly profited from slavery.

It’s off the table, absolutely off the table.”The Mexican president said her government had been informed of the executive order but insisted that “it had nothing to do with the participation of any military or any institution on our territory. There is no risk that they will invade our territory.”News of Trump’s secret directive to the Pentagon was first reportedby the New York Times,which cited people familiar with the matter, and noted that the order “provides an official basis for the possibility of direct military operations at sea and on foreign soil against cartels”.The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the move would enable the US government to use the military to target trafficking organizations.“It allows us to now target what they’re operating and to use other elements of American power, intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense, whatever … to target these groups if we have an opportunity to do it,” Rubio said.“We have to start treating them as armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug dealing organizations.“Trump has made going after Latin American drug-trafficking organizations a top priority of his administration:in February,the state department designated seven organized crime groups as foreign terrorist organizations, including five powerful cartels in Mexico.At the time, the White Houseclaimed these groupsconstituted “a national security threat beyond that posed by traditional organized crime” with activities including “infiltration into foreign governments across the Western Hemisphere”.It is unclear how much impact that designation has had, as US agencies already have a range of tools to target transnational organized crime groups by restricting their members’ abilities to travel or do business.But the designation would widen the range of potential targets for prosecution to include anyone who provides “material support” to the cartels.The Trump administration has alsodeployed thousandsof active-duty combat troops, as well as drones and spy planes to the south-west US border in order to crack down on the northward flow of drugs, particularly fentanyl, as well as staunch the flow of immigrants.Trump administration doubles reward for arrest of Venezuela’s president to $50mRead moreThis latest order would represent a profound and unprecedented escalation of tactics by the US government in Latin America, potentially opening the door for unilateral American military assaults across the region.Jack Riley, former deputy administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency who helped lead the capture of the drug kingpinJoaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, welcomed the Trump administration’s directive, having long been a proponent of designating cartels as terrorist organizations.“This to me is the next logical step,” said Riley. “It probably opens up avenues for training our counterparts, additional funding obviously, and puts some teeth into the federal agencies that are operating overseas.”Still, Riley cautioned that Trump’s order may face obstacles at home before troops can even set foot overseas.“You’re probably going to have some legal challenges in the US to his authority to do this without congressional approval,” he said. “But that doesn’t seem to bother him.”In Mexico, however, security analysts feared the move would not only be ineffective at eliminating drug-trafficking groups but also prove devastating to US-Mexico relations.“It’s not a welcome development,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, head of the North American observatory at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime. “And beyond the narrative, it seems to me that once again there’s been a misdiagnosis of these illicit markets and how we can weaken and dismantle them.”The news comes at a delicate time for US-Mexico relations, with Mexico in the midst of negotiating a tariff deal with the Trump administration as well as a new security agreement, which Sheinbaum had said was close to being signed.Mexico and the United States have often cooperated closely on security, including during the Mérida Initiative back under former President Felipe Calderón. But even then, said Farfán-Méndez, US boots on the ground was seen as a red line. This new move by the Trump administration would potentially cross that line – with devastating impacts on the countries’ relationship.“It would have very serious consequences, where Mexico would stop cooperating,” she said. “This does seem to me like it would lead Mexico to ask, ‘what’s the incentive to collaborate with you? If you’re going to take unilateral action anyway?’”Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasUS foreign policyDonald TrumpDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, the US offered a $15m reward for his arrest. That was later raised by the Biden administration to $25m – the same amount the US offered for the capture of Osama bin Laden in 2001, after the September 11 attacks.Despite the big bounty, Maduro remains entrenched after defying the US, the European Union and several Latin American governments who condemned his 2024 reelection as a sham and recognized his opponent as Venezuela’s duly elected president.‘We have to clear our names’: Venezuelan makeup artist who survived Ice detention tries to rebuild his lifeRead moreLast month, theTrump administrationstruck a deal to secure the release of 10 Americans jailed in Caracas in exchange for Venezuela getting home scores of migrants deported by the United States to El Salvador under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Shortly after, the White House reversed course and allowed US oil producer Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela after it was previously blocked by US sanctions.The prisoner swap sparked controversy, as one of the Americans freed in the exchange is an ex-US soldier who wasconvicted of killing three peoplein Spain in 2016. Dahud Hanid Ortiz, found guilty in Venezuela last year, was flown to Texas alongside the other nine freed Americans, whom rights groups had deemed “political prisoners”.Bondi said the justice department has seized more than $700m in assets linked to Maduro, including two private jets, and said 7m tons of seized cocaine had been traced directly to the leftist leader.Maduro’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.In her announcement, Bondi repeated claims linking Maduro to Tren de Aragua (TdA), the Venezuelan gang, saying: “Maduro uses foreign terrorist organizations like TdA … to bring deadly violence to our country … He is one of the largest narcotraffickers in the world and a threat to our national security.”Someexperts have cast doubtson the Trump administration’sclaimsthat TdA is “invading America”. The narrative that TdA is a state-sponsored terrorist group wreaking havoc on the US has been used to fuel the president’s aggressive and broad attacks on Venezuelan immigrants, with policies that advocates say have trampled on people’s due-process rights. In onehigh-profile case, Andry José Hernández Romero, a gay asylum seeker, was expelled to El Salvador after the US claimed his tattoos were proof he was a TdA member and “security threat”.Experts havenotedthat the Venezuelan government had previously protected TdA, but it was unlikely the gang was acting “at the direction” of the Maduro regime, as the White House has claimed.TheWashington Post reportedin April that a National Intelligence Council assessment concluded there were some low-level contacts between the Maduro government and TdA, but said the gang was not commanded by Venezuela’s leader.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroPam BondiTrump administrationAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The company’s share price tanked as a result of his detention.He was one of several high-profile executives in China – mostly from the finance industry – who have gone missing in recent years with little explanation amid a sweeping anti-corruption campaign spearheaded by the president, Xi Jinping.Bao’s disappearance rattled professionals in the Chinese banking industry as Beijing pressed its campaign to rein in lavish lifestyles among the financial elite.His release comes as China seeks to drive up business confidence, particularly for the country’s tech entrepreneurs, whose businesses have struggled under a years-long crackdown.The private sector has been reeling from weak domestic consumption and a prolonged debt crisis in the property industry, against a broader backdrop of heightened trade tensions with the US.Inside China’s fast-fashion factories as a US trade war looms - podcastRead moreChristopher Beddor, a deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, said: “This is certainly a positive signal, as Bao was the most high-profile financier detained in recent years.“Still, it won’t change the fact that the anti-corruption campaign continues to churn through the financial sector, and the common prosperity campaign has led to sweeping pay caps and even clawbacks. China’s financial sector remains a long way from its heyday only a few years ago.”Bao, widely regarded as one of China’s best-connected bankers, was released from detention earlier this week, the source said on Friday, declining to be identified because the information was not public.Bao had been involved in high-profile deals including the mergers of the ride-hailing companies Didi and Kuaidi, the food delivery giants Meituan and Dianping, and the travel platforms Ctrip and Qunar.China Renaissance Bao had yet to respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Chinese media outlets Caixin first reported Bao’s release, citing unidentified sources.China Renaissance’s shares jumped 17% on Friday to close at HK$6.87 ($0.8752) before the news of his release became public.Bao, who previously worked at Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, went missing in February 2023. Trade in China Renaissance shares was suspended in April 2023 after the bank delayed publication of its audited annual results as a result of mainland Chinese authorities detaining its chief executive.A Chinese financial publication reported in May 2023 he was detained by disciplinary and supervision officials. Authorities have not yet provided an explanation. China Renaissance resumed trading of its shares in September last year. They plunged 72% on their opening day.Sources have previously told Reuters he was taken away to assist in an investigation into a former colleague.Xie Yi Jing, who co-founded China Renaissance, replaced Bao as chair in February last year. Subsequently, Bao’s wife, Hui Yin Ching, was appointed as chair to lead the boutique investment bank in October, with changes in other senior management ranks as well.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

This caused widespread disruption on roads and flights.The state of Uttarakhand in northernIndiawas also hit by flash flooding and landslides as more than 200mm of rain fell within a day. One person has died and more than 50 people remain missing amid rescue efforts hampered by further heavy rain, which has made it more difficult to reach those areas in need.Uttarakhand is highly susceptible to landslides and flooding, especially during the monsoon season. This is due to the mountainous terrain of the Himalayas, which intensifies the rainfall as moist air is forced upwards, combined with the steep-sided valleys.After thesweltering heat in Japan last week, there was record-high rainfall in Kanazawa, the capital of the Ishikawa prefecture, on the west coast in Honshu. According to the Japanese meteorological agency, 148mm fell within three hours. This was due to an area of low pressure that moved in from the west across the Sea of Japan bringing a conveyor belt of warm moist air. This conveyor belt then supplied moisture to a cold front that was moving southwards across the country. The intensity of the rainfall was enhanced by average sea temperatures over the Sea of Japan 3-5C above the seasonal average.Bullet trains were disrupted and roads were closed as a result of this rain. More heavy rain and thunderstorms are forecast to move in from the south-west acrossJapanat the weekend and into early next week as another area of low pressure moves in, with this system also affecting South Korea. This wet weather comes outside of Japan’s normal rainy season, which stretches from early June to mid-July.Meanwhile, south-westEuropeis bracing for a heatwave that is expected to start this week and become more widespread by next week. Spain and France have issued warnings of temperatures above 40C, first in northern Spain by the end of this week and southern France next week. Bordeaux and Toulouse are expected to experience the most anomalous weather as temperatures rise to more than 12C above the seasonal average.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerExtreme weatherHong KongAsia PacificIndiaJapanSpainanalysisShareReuse this content"

It had also seen evidence of similar technology used in Chin state, near the country’s western border.There had been efforts to weaponise these unmanned aerial vehicles by fitting release mechanisms under the frame, Car said.Myanmar junta ends state of emergency as it prepares for electionsRead moreMyanmar has been gripped by conflict since themilitary seized power in a coup in 2021, provoking an armed resistance made up of anti-junta groups and older ethnic armed groups, which have succeeded in taking control of vast areas of the country’s borders.Over the past 12 months the junta has invested heavily in drone technology in an attempt to catch up with opposition groups, which have made effective use of such weaponry. Myanmar now ranks third globally for the number of drone events, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project, which tracks conflicts around the world – behind only Ukraine and Russia.Myanmar has been subject to an EU arms embargo in various forms since the early 1990s. Sanctions were widened in 2018 in response to military abuses against minorities, including the Rohingya. Further restrictions were imposed after the 2021 military coup.Campaigners, however, say sanctions are not wide-ranging enough, and that measures are inconsistent across the EU, as enforcement falls to individual member states.Yadanar Maung, spokesperson for Justice For Myanmar, said she was unsurprised by Car’s findings. “This is part of a pattern that has seen exports of communications equipment, spyware, UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] parts, aircraft and the propulsion system for the navy’s biggest warship,” she said.“None of these should have been transferred and, without rigorous enforcement by member states, companies will continue to do business with junta arms brokers with impunity,” Yadanar Maung added. “The EU also needs to expand its sanctions to effectively block the junta’s access to funds, arms and aviation fuel, in coordination with its allies.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It’s hard for industry innovations to be in total lockstep with national, and certainly international, controls.”Car’s report does not name the manufacturer that produced the anti-jamming technology, or the European country in which it is based. Perkins said the manufacturer had made every effort possible to prevent misuse of its product, which, though sensitive, was not considered either a military or dual-use good and therefore not subject to controls.The manufacturer shipped its products to a vetted distributor, based in China, in March 2023. The distributor then sold the product onwards as part of a much larger shipment, to another China-based company that integrates components into UAVs. In March 2024, the product integrator then sold the goods on to a company based in Ruili, an important trade hub on the border between China and Myanmar.There is no evidence of wrongdoing by the distributor and the product integrator, though Car researchers say the location of the end-user company, based on the border where there had been an escalation in conflict, could have been a red flag.“What is important to take away from this investigation is how to use the information that investigators like Car collects in conflict zones: capturing these red flags, alerting the manufacturers and trying to prevent future diversions,” Perkins said.Its report said there was a need for sustained monitoring to ensure sanctions were effective.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarAsia PacificWeapons technologynewsShareReuse this content"

We must not allow our country to be deceived,” he said.If medical aid is needed for Gaza residents affected by Israel’s recent attacks, he argued that treatment should take place in Gaza, not elsewhere.“As a nation that endured 350 years of colonisation, we must recognise that occupiers have countless tricks and deceptions. We must not fall for their sweet words,” he said.Another senior leader from Indonesia’s largest Muslim organisations, Nahdlatul Ulama, Rais Syuriah, also questioned the motive of the plan.“Is there a guarantee they can return to Gaza? Aren’t there many Palestinians out there who still can’t return home?” he asked, “This could actually make it easier for Israel to occupy more Palestinian land.”Indonesia’s foreign ministry, which backs a two-state solution to resolve the Middle East crisis, said at the time it “strongly rejects any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians”.A hospital to treat victims of the Covid-19 pandemic opened in 2020 on Galang, which had been until 1996 a sprawling refugee camp run by the United Nations, housing 250,000 of those who fled the Vietnam war.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaGazaUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesAsia PacificIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Speakingto the ABC in July, Feng described the arrest warrant as “political persecution and violation of basic human rights”.Two other exiled campaigners in Australia – Adelaide-based Ted Hui and Melbourne-based Kevin Yam – are also subject to arrest warrants and bounties. Earlier this year, anonymous letters and pamphlets weresent to properties in their respective cities offering $203,000for information on their locations.The G7’s rapid response mechanism (G7RRM), which was established to help nations “identify and respond to foreign threats to democracies”, said the arrest warrants were punishing people for “exercising their freedom of expression”.“This form of transnational repression undermines national security, state sovereignty, human rights and the safety of communities,” the statement, first published by Canada, said.“We encourage individuals to report suspicious activities and any incidents of intimidation, harassment, coercion or threats to their law enforcement authorities in accordance with domestic laws and regulations.“G7RRM members and associate members are committed to strengthening our efforts to safeguard our sovereignty, to keep our communities safe and to defend individuals from the overreach of governments trying to silence, intimidate, harass or coerce them within our borders.”When the arrest warrants were made last month, the UK’s foreign and home secretaries issued a joint statement condemning “transnational repression” and said they would “not tolerate attempts by foreign governments” to intimidate their critics in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

OneBluesky userfound the chatbot repeatedly claimed there were three Bs in “blueberry”.“Yep – blueberry is one of those words where the middle almost trips you up, like it’s saying ‘b-b-better pay attention,’” the chatbot said in the posted chat.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“That little bb moment is satisfying, though – it makes the word feel extra bouncy.”Another userfound the chatbot unable to correctly identify the US states containing the letter R. And when asked to produce a map, it misspelled states including “Krizona” and “Vermoni”. ChatGPT also double listed California and invented the states “New Jefst” and “Mitroinia”.WhenGuardian Australia askedthe latest model of ChatGPT to identify the number of Rs in Australia’s states and territories, it could identify those which did. But the AI also believed Northern Territory had just three Rs not five. When asked to produce it on a map, spelled the territory as “Northan Territor”OpenAI was contacted for comment. The company said on launching the new product that there would be fewer errors and AI hallucinations under the latest model.The source of the issues may be the way GPT-5 works as a combination of its AI models.GPT-5 has a “real-time router” that quickly decides which of its model to use depending on the conversation type and intent. OpenAI has said that if you askChatGPTto “think hard about this” it uses the latest reasoning model.“The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time,” OpenAI’s announcement stated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Putin has claimed four Ukrainian regions in their entirety, although much of their territory remains under Ukrainian control.US and Russian officials were working on a deal under whichRussiawould halt its offensive in exchange for the territorial concessions – making it a politically fraught proposal in Ukraine, Bloomberg said.Zelenskyy has responded by speaking with European leaders including the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who are key conduits to Trump.Fox News reported on Friday that the meeting could take place at the end of next week. Potential venues include Switzerland, Rome, Hungary and the United Arab Emirates, the conservative outlet said. Switzerland and Italy are parties to the international criminal court (ICC), which has issued an arrest warrant for Putin, and their law enforcement would theoretically be required to detain the Russian president. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán announced plans to withdraw from the ICC earlier this year.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said Putin did not have to meet Zelenskyy first before the US and Russian presidents could meet. “No, he doesn’t,” Trump said. “They would like to meet with me and I’ll do whatever I can to stop the killing.”View image in fullscreenThe US president, Donald Trump, says he will do whatever is possible to help end the conflict.Photograph: ShutterstockPutin said he was not ready to meet Zelenskyy, even as the Kremlin claimed preparations were under way for a bilateral summit with Trump next week.“I have nothing against it in general, it is possible, but certain conditions must be created for this,” Putin said of a meeting with Zelenskyy. “But unfortunately, we are still far from creating such conditions.”The US envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed a three-way meeting with Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy but the Kremlin had ignored that suggestion, said the Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, and was “focusing on preparations for a bilateral meeting with Trump in the first place”.No venue has been set for the potential summit but Putin did mention that Dubai in the UAE was a possibility during a meeting with its leader, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.In the past 48 hours, White House officials have offered conflicting statements about whether Trump would agree to meet Putin. Witkoff, a close friend of Trump’s, is seen as a strong proponent of the meeting and had proposed it to Putin this week, while the national security adviser and secretary of state, Marco Rubio, later said that “a lot has to happen before [a summit] can occur”.The wide gamut of foreign policy views in the administration, which includesJD Vance’s scepticism of Ukraineand belief that the US should turn its focus away from Europe toward more pressing threats such as China, has helped its approach appear haphazard, while Trump’s Oval Office comments suggest that the administration is still interested in holding a summit.Last month,Trump issued an ultimatum for Putinto agree to a ceasefire or face secondary sanctions with the deadline set for this Friday. That deadline appeared in place despite plans for the summit, although the White House has not said what secondary measures it could enforce.Kyiv opens war crime inquiry into head of notorious Russian prisonRead moreTrump did target India with a 25% tariff hike for purchasing Russian oil this week, singling out one of Moscow’s economic enablers in a move thatNew Delhi complained was unfair and selective.Trump had grown frustrated with Putin in public in recent months as the war dragged through its third year and Putin continued to launch nightly missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities despite Trump’s insistence that he could strike a deal within 24 hours of becoming president.“Putin … talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said last month. “So there’s a little bit of a problem there.”Asked on Thursday whether the deadline still applied, Trump said: “It’s gonna be up to him. We’re going to see what he has to say. It’s gonna be up to him. Very disappointed.”Trump last week also announced that he would reposition nuclear submarines in response to a social media post by Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev, who said that Trump was “playing the ultimatum game with Russia” and had taken a “step toward war”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaDonald TuskUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

He supported reduced taxes, electoral reform, cuts and an increased focus on environmental issues.Hestepped down as leader of the partyafter it was nearly wiped out in 2015 election, with some blaming the defeat on his decision to get into bed with the Conservatives in the first place, breaking a key election promise over university fees in the process.Clegg quit politics in the UK and took up a new role in 2018 in California as the head of global affairs and communications at Facebook.At the same time González Durántez pursued a number of interests including a mentoring project, Inspiring Girls International, and Altius Advisory, a consultancy she founded aimed at bettering business in Africa.Miriam González Durántez: ‘I don’t want my boys to think there are things girls can’t do’Read moreBefore that she spent years in Brussels and London advising on diversity, liberal reform, and international trade policy.They returned to the UK from California after Clegg left Meta in January and she nowspends weekdays in Spain and weekends when she can in London, according to a recent interview.Her lengthy career included three stints as a member of cabinet in the EU’s external relations commission, including one as a senior trade adviser to Chris Patten, the former British commissioner for external relations. She also spent two years working as a negotiator at the World Trade Organization.Her father,José Antonio González Caviedes, was mayor of Olmedo and served as a senator for the conservative People’s party (PP) from 1989 until he died in 1996.González Durántez was not available for comment, but when asked if she was considering setting up her own party, a spokesperson for Better Spain said the lawyer had been working for the past two years to mobilise civil society and on effort to “clean up Spanish politics” and “end the pendulum of corruption and counteract polarisation”.The spokesperson added: “She has publicly stated on numerous occasions that if Spanish political parties continue to ignore civil society, she would consider other options including political ones. For the time being she continues working on those objectives within España Mejor.“As part of her work as the founder of España Mejor, she has held meetings with all sorts of organisations, public institutions, businesses and citizens across Spain, as well as multiple political parties, within Spain and Europe.”Founding a new party and bringing it to a position of political heft is laden with risk in Spain, as it is in any country. Spanish politics remains doggedly bipartisan, with the socialist and conservative parties rarely achieving an overall majority.While the two-party system has been loosened from both left (Podemos) and right (Vox) the attempt by Ciudadanos, led by Albert Rivera, a young lawyer, to break the deadlock fizzled out to the point that the party didn’t even contest the 2023 general election.Pablo Simón, a political scientist at the Carlos III university in Madrid, predicted an uphill struggle for González if she throws her hat into the ring. “This proposal for a new centrist party seems to come from above, not from the grassroots,” he said.“I think it’s a bad moment to launch such a party. For one thing, voters who are fed up with the government are moving the right and the far right and prefer pre-existing parties to new ones. It would make more sense to wait for the European elections when there is a better chance of gaining representation.“Miriam González is largely unknown in Spain. When you launch a party it’s best to have a someone well-known to front it. Perhaps González would make a better deputy than leader.”He added that liberal parties had had little success in newer democracies such as Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. “This is because, being new democracies, the politics are polarised between left and right.”Political power couplesView image in fullscreenHillary and Bill Clinton after voting in 2016.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APIt may be some time before Miriam González Durántez decides whether to follow her husband’s footsteps into formal politics, but if she does she will join an illustrious list of power couples who have graced the world stage.1. Bill Clinton and Hillary ClintonAlthough she was unsuccessful in her attempt to follow Bill into the White House, Hillary Clinton and her husband were at one time the most powerful couple in modern American politics. A lawyer, politician and diplomat, Hillary achieved high office in her own right as two-time senator for New York and US secretary of state. The pair continue to wield influence with the Clinton Foundation.2. Nelson Mandela and Winnie MandelaBefore their divorce and her marginalisation after his release from prison in 1990, the couple were considered the mother and father of the nation of South Africa. Winnie Mandela became an MP and a minister and during the fight against apartheid she wasa potent symbol of the struggle, but her reputation was seriously damaged several times by allegations of murder and corruption. She was convicted of kidnapping, assault, theft and fraud. As one of the most visible faces of the resistance, she was regularly detained and harassed by the police and considered so powerful she was even prohibited from speaking to the media.3.Cristina Fernández de Kirchnerand Néstor KirchnerCristina Fernández de Kirchner became the first woman to be elected president of Argentina in 2007, a role she held until 2015. Succeeding her husband Néstor, thecharismatic but divisive figurewas permanently banned from public office in June over a corruption conviction.Explore more on these topicsSpainMiriam González DurántezNick CleggEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Josias Ndanga, president of the association, insists the claims are an excuse, saying: “We’re convinced we’re being discriminated against on ideological grounds.”The move comes just days after the conservative local authority in Jumilla in south-east Spainbanned Muslims from using public facilities to celebrate religious festivals, a decision that has been widely condemned by political opponents, Muslim organisations and the Catholic church.Outrage as Spanish town bans Muslim religious festivals from public spacesRead moreKúpula sought permission to hold the festival in three separate locations but on each occasion the application was refused despite the fact that, according to Ndanga, they went through all the appropriate channels and met the necessary requirements.The organisers say that various events have recently been staged in these same locations, among them a youth festival and international family day.The local authority in the Madrid Río neighbourhood rejected the festival on grounds that it would involve “an excessive use of public space” and was “exclusive in character, suggesting it would be of little public interest”.A councillor for the Más Madrid party accused José Luis Martínez-Almeida, Madrid’s conservative mayor, of censorship.“Almeida’s government doesn’t like cultural diversity and has blocked this celebration on racist grounds,” the party’s Cuca Sánchez was quoted as saying. “If Almeida likes an event, it can go ahead; if not, he censors it.”Jorge Donaire, spokesperson for the socialist party in Madrid, said: “They don’t want anything that springs from the community … What they like is macro-events that attract a lot of publicity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Run by Deutsche Bahn (DB) and France’s SNCF, it has been hailed as a milestone in European train travel.It is not the only new service linking Europe’s cities. From next May, the ČD ComfortJet, operated by the Czech, German and Danish railways, will carry you all the way fromPrague to Copenhagen, calling at Dresden, Berlin and Hamburg, in just over 11 hours.Major new routes are being built: a high-speed Alpine tunnel linking Lyon and Turin; the Fehmarn Belt connecting Germany and Denmark; Rail Baltica, which will join Tallinn in Estonia to Warsaw via Riga in Latvia and Kaunas in Lithuania.View image in fullscreenA Deutsche Bahn high-speed train at the Gare de l’Est in Paris.Photograph: AlamyOn the face of it, then, high-speed, long-distance rail travel in Europe seems to be finally taking off. But in fact, fast, efficient cross-border rail services between the continent’s major urban centres remain, for all the media fanfare, very much a rarity.For a whole raft of reasons – inadequate infrastructure, unwilling operators, incompatible systems, incomprehensible timetabling and (last but not least) impossibly complicated ticketing – long rail journeys across Europe are all too often a pastime rather than a practical travel alternative.Imagine, for the sake of illustration (few except slow-travel aficionados would ever actually attempt it), a four-country trip from Spain’s second-biggest city, Barcelona, to Marseille in France, then on to Italy’s largest port, Genoa, ending in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia.Map showing route from Ljubljana to BarcelonaFor starters,says Jon Worth, an independent writer and campaigner on European cross-border rail travel, while there is a high-speed line across the Spanish-French border, for most of the year it carries only four trains a day, and five in summer.“Why?” Worth says. “Because the new trains run by the Spanish operator, Renfe, haven’t been approved to run in France, and SNCF has cut the size of its fleet capable of running in Spain. So the trains that do run are invariably packed, and prices are sky-high.”Next, only one of those four or five daily trains will run direct from Barcelona to Marseille, and it arrives in France’s biggest port so late that you miss the last service to Nice, which is where you need to be in order to catch a train to Italy.So, you must then board a slow regional train the next morning for the hour-long ride to Ventimiglia, followed, with luck and good timing, by a relatively fast intercity connection along the Ligurian coast to Genoa.From there, things only get worse. Trains crossing the Italy-Slovenia border at Gorizia-Nova Gorica run at weekends only. Those doing so at Villa Opicina, near Trieste, are daily but very irregular. So the 370 miles (600km) to Ljubljana via Milan and Venice will take up to 13 hours and probably involve travelling via Villach in Austria.“It’s one of the worst borders to cross anywhere in the EU,” says Worth. “Very few, very slow trains.” Moreover, althoughEuropean night trainsare making a much-hyped but in reality slow and difficult comeback, there isn’t one on this route.(Actually, that’s not strictly true. The Espresso Riviera, operated by Treni Turistici Italiani, is a delightful upmarket sleeper service from Rome to Marseille and back. Unfortunately, it runs only in July and August, and then just once a week.)View image in fullscreenA train crosses the Salcano (Solkan) bridge, Slovenia.Photograph: Simon Kovacic/AlamyLeaving aside the nonexistent connectivity, the obstacles facing the long-distance European rail traveller will have become apparent long before they actually get on a train. Planning a trip and buying tickets (as well resolving problems if things go wrong) are daunting challenges in themselves.Seasoned travellers recommendDeutsche Bahn’s websiteas the best and most comprehensive planning tool for navigating the seemingly infinite complexities of Europe’s train schedules, but few novices would describe even that as user-friendly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unlike plane travel, through train tickets are rare – and if they exist, they are often more expensive than a combination.Moreover, although services such asTrainline– which anyway only offers only a small selection of possible routes – can sell you a through journey from, say, Barcelona to Nice, it will be two tickets with two different operators, sold in one transaction.“That means,” says Worth, “if anything goes wrong – say, a train is late and you miss your connection – you have no passenger rights at all. Worse, few stations will be able to help. Unlike in an airport, you’ll have to sort it out yourself.”Across the continent, similar issues recur, vastly complicating journeys that could, in principle, be smooth, practical, sustainable travel alternatives – and pushing even those willing to accept a longer and more expensive trip on to Europe’s ferociously competitive airlines.View image in fullscreenThe Lyon-Turin train tunnel, which is not scheduled to be completed until 2033.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesSometimes, infrastructure is the main obstacle. French TGVs and Italian Frecciarossas link Paris to Milan in seven hours, for example, but must crawl through the Alps until the new Lyon-Turin high-speed line and tunnel is completed, theoretically in 2033. Meanwhile, the current route is heavily susceptible to damage from increasingly frequent landslides: after reopening in April following a 20-month closure for mudslides, it had to shut down again for several days in July for the same reason.At other times, the issue is a lack of cooperation between rail operators. Astonishingly, there has been no direct train connection between Madrid and Lisbon – two neighbouring European capitals – since a Spanish sleeper service was discontinued in 2020.The 450-mile journey now requires two changes and multiple tickets and takes more than eight hours. Lines are being electrified but there is no guarantee that Renfe and Portugal’s CP, which have very different strategies, will combine forces and deliver a through service.“Operators still mostly think and work nationally,” says Worth. “CP is old-style, regular, but has only just started work on its first high-speed line. Renfe is modern, high-speed connections between Spain’s major cities. They’re just not a good fit.”Different technologies and operating systems are a major block. In principle, that can be overcome with modern, multi-system rolling stock, but it is significantly more expensive. A pan-European signalling system, ECTS, is on its way but not there yet.Other obvious European rail connections badly in need of upgrading, Worth argues, could include Berlin-Warsaw, which still runs on slow tracks for much of its six-hour journey (though that may change, givenPoland’s ambitious high-speed rail plans).And in Scandinavia, a high-speed service linking Oslo to Stockholm or Copenhagen remains a pipe dream. A project that would slash travel times between the Norwegian capital and Gothenburg in Sweden to an hour has, so far, made zero progress.Explore more on these topicsRail transportEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It said the imposition of tariffs on gold cast products “makes it economically unviable to export them to the US”.Its president, Christoph Wild, said: “We are particularly concerned about the implications of the tariffs for the gold industry and the physical exchange of gold with the US, a longstanding and historical partner for Switzerland.”Record bullion exports of more than $36bn (£27bn) made up more than two-thirds of Switzerland’s trade surplus with the US in the first quarter, according to Swiss customs data.The price of US goldfutures hit an all-time intraday high of $3,534 on Friday after the details of the ruling letter,first reported by the Financial Times, emerged.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Switzerland’s rate is among the highest in the world, after Brazil, Syria, Laos and Myanmar.According to reports, gold bars were in such demand in the US in May after Trump’s announcement of sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs the previous month that Costco capped how many gold bars could be bought in a day.Explore more on these topicsGoldTrump tariffsCommoditiesDonald TrumpTariffsSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The pair have bonded over their Christian faith anddifficult childhoods.Before speaking to reporters on Friday afternoon, Lammy and Vance were filmed fishing for carp together in a pond near Chevening House. Expressing his love for the UK and describing Lammy as a “good friend” and “gracious host”, Vance joked that their varying degrees of success in the carp pond was the “one strain on the special relationship”.“All of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary did not,” he said.View image in fullscreenJD Vance (l) and David Lammy fishing in a pond in the grounds of Chevening, Kent.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/APVance is staying at Chevening with his wife and family and will spend the weekend there with Lammy and his family before going on holiday to the Cotswolds. The vice-president said the people who had built Chevening and sustained it “really love the human spirit”, and heaped praise on the UK, saying it had a “lot in common” with the US and that the two countries should work together to “bring greater peace” to the world.While it has been billed as a private visit, Vance and Lammy held a formal bilateral on Friday afternoon where they discussed the continuing crisis in Gaza, including theIsraeli security cabinet’s decision to take over Gaza City, as well as the war in Ukraine and US-UK trade and technology policy. A government source described the meeting as “constructive”.Before the meeting Vance notedGazaas one area where there “may be disagreements” between the White House and Downing Street despite their shared goal to end the war.Asked by reporters for his thoughts onthe UK’s plans to recognise Palestine, Vance said: “Obviously, the United Kingdom is going to make its decision. We have no plans to recognise the Palestinian state. I don’t know what it would mean to really recognise a Palestinian state given the lack of functional government there.”He said that while both governments wanted to resolve the crisis in Gaza, they “may have some disagreements about how exactly to accomplish that goal, and we’ll talk about that today”.In the recent past Vance hascriticised the UKover what he saw as infringements to freedom of speech. In February, he claimed a “backslide away from conscience rights has placed the basic liberties of religious Britons” under threat and he attacked the use of laws to enforce buffer zones around abortion clinics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What we need is a ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, the release of all hostages by Hamas and a negotiated solution,” he said.Explore more on these topicsJD VanceDavid LammyIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It has been used to illustrate the Israel Defense Forces’ “values” page, and appears endlessly in the Hebrew media and on pro-Israel sites.It is ironic that at the end of his life the central figure in the picture, Yitzhak Yifat, rejected at least some of the photograph’s meaning.Speaking to the Guardianin 2017, with the benefit of five decades of hindsight, he reflected on that conquest.“I can say that the results of the war were bad. We realised that we had conquered another people. A whole people. And now it seems we cannot now get to a true peace, a real peace,” he said.What was true then remains true today, as Israel’s security cabinet hasauthorised the full occupationonce again of Gaza, beginning with Gaza City.While Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested it will be required until Hamas can be replaced, the international community should consider the strong likelihood that Israel will maintain an open-ended control of all of Gaza – a recipe, say critics, forperpetual war.And although the statement from Netanyahu’s office describing the decision and its aims does not include the word “occupation” – with all the international legal obligations that would entail – no one should be in any doubt that this is what is envisaged.When will we finally admit: the Gaza death toll is higher than we’ve been told | Arwa MahdawiRead moreNetanyahu’s history in politics and diplomacy is one of endless excuses for why Israel should never meet the commitments it made in the Oslo peace process towards real self-determination and a Palestinian state, describing endlessly over the years the lack of a “partner for peace” or claiming that any Palestinian state would be a threat to Israel.In practical terms, Israel’s decision to seize full control ofGazaappears as reckless as it is delusional and inhuman, not least the notion that Israel will maintain control until the “establishment of an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority”. As it currently stands, that alternative remains a fiction of Netanyahu’s imagination.What will seem more plausible for many will be the far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich’s unpalatable parsing of the decision on Friday. “We are erasing the Palestinian state,” he declared, “first in action and then officially”.In financial terms, as Israeli media have pointed out, the move is likely to place another huge financial burden on a country that has been haemorrhaging money during more than two years of conflict in theatres from Lebanon to Syria, Iran, Yemen and Gaza.Speaking to the rightwing Israel Hayom newspaper this week, Ram Aminach, an expert in Israel’s military economics, suggested the cost of taking Gaza under full control could run to almost $6bn in the coming months, with “incomprehensible costs” associated with sustaining a Palestinian population of 2 million people in a shattered territory.“Look at the international pressure Israel faces today and multiply that by five, at the least,” he said. “To ease that pressure, we’ll need to take care of the population in Gaza. No international player is going to help pay for that, not while Israel is seen the way it is right now.”View image in fullscreenPalestinians run towards parachutes carrying aid packages airdropped over the northern Gaza Strip.Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersAnd there is an even bigger question: whether Israel has the resources to maintain an occupation that may be long-term.Envisaged, according to briefings to Israeli journalists, as involving five divisions in an operation lasting five to six months, it assumes that the IDF is capable of achieving more than it has in two and a half years of war in which it has been forced to launch multiple operations in areas where it has claimed Hamas was defeated only to see fighters return.Nor is the recent history of military occupations encouraging, not least the US and British experience of insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan.That appears, at least in part, to have been in the mind of the IDF’s chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, when he made clear his opposition to the plan, suggesting it would lead to the death of the remaining Israeli hostages and greater risk to soldiers in an already exhausted Israeli military from improvised explosive devices.While Zamir has expressed his opposition in private to Netanyahu, others have made the same points publicly, among them the Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, who described the decision as a “disaster that will lead to many more disasters”.Charging that Netanyahu had been dragged into the decision by his far-right allies who have campaigned for Jewish settlement in Gaza, he described the plan as “a move that will kill the hostages and many soldiers, will cost Israeli taxpayers tens of billions and will destroy Israel’s diplomatic relations”.“This is exactly what Hamas wanted: for Israel to end up stuck in Gaza without a goal, in a useless occupation, the point of which no one understands,” Lapid said.All of which leaves what will be regarded by many in the international community as the most glaringly problematic issue. While the IDF controls 75% of Gaza, the remaining 25% of territory where the new Netanyahu offensive will be focused is where 80% of Gaza’s population has been displaced to.How Israel plans to achieve its full control without a massive increase in civilian deaths in an already starving and desperate Palestinian population is chillingly undescribed.Multiple mass fatality incidents around the Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s food distribution sites – where, according to the UN and other aid organisations, Israeli soldiers have killed hundreds of aid seekers – suggests that the IDF should not be counted on to behave humanely when confronted by those civilians.Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister,said on Friday: “The Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is wrong and we urge it to reconsider immediately. This action will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages. It will only bring more bloodshed.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The plan falls short of taking over the whole of Gaza as Netanyahu said he had intended before the meeting.Netanyahu announces plan to take over Gaza City, marking another escalation in devastating warRead moreStarmer said Israel and Hamas should de-escalate the conflict and agree to a ceasefire, and that the prospect of a negotiated two-state solution was “vanishing before our eyes” without the two sides engaging “engaging in good faith in negotiations”.“Every day the humanitarian crisis inGazaworsens and hostages taken by Hamas are being held in appalling and inhuman conditions. What we need is a ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, the release of all hostages by Hamas and a negotiated solution,” Starmer said.“Our message is clear: a diplomatic solution is possible, but both parties must step away from the path of destruction.”1:20'Nothing left to occupy': Palestinians react to Netanyahu's Gaza plan – videoSeveral other countries, including Finland and Turkey, have criticised Israel’s announcement and called on its government to de-escalate the conflict.The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, said it was increasingly clear that Netanyahu’s goal was “ethnic cleansing” in Gaza. He urged Starmer to cease all arms exports to Israel and sanction Netanyahu and his cabinet.The energy minister Miatta Fahnbulleh told Sky News the Israeli government’s decision to take over Gaza City was wrong. “We think that it will risk escalating an already intolerable situation, and the consequence will be more bloodshed,” she said. “There’s no one that can see what is happening and unfolding in Gaza that isn’t horrified by it.“Our priority is, in order to try and get a ceasefire, we’ve got to get parties around the table. I know it feels incredibly hard given the current situation, but it has to be the priority.”Starmer has saidthe UK will recognise a Palestinian statebefore the UN general assembly in September if Israel does not agree to a ceasefire and a pathway towards a two-state solution.Before the meeting of his security cabinet, Netanyahu had set out a plan to take control of the whole of Gaza and eventually hand governance of the territory to friendly Arab forces opposed to Hamas.The plan announced on Friday morning stopped short of that after reservations from Israel’s top general who reportedly said it would endanger the remaining 20 or so living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel’s army after nearly two years of war on various fronts.Many families of hostages are also opposed, fearing further escalation will doom their loved ones.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelForeign policyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

His case is continuing.Nicola Sturgeon announces divorce from Peter MurrellRead moreSturgeon faced police questioning but was never charged and has since been exonerated of all wrongdoing. In March this year, she was told she faced no further action in Police Scotland’s fraud inquiry.In her book, excerpts of which were published in the Times on Friday, she describes her shock over the police raid in April 2023, the “utter disbelief that … police were in my home, that they had a warrant to arrest my husband and search the house”.She felt creeping anxiety and dread in the weeks after Murrell’s arrest, waiting for police to question her, and when they did arrest her, she was “horrified and devastated, though also relieved in a strange sort of way.Nicola Sturgeon to stand down as MSP next yearRead more“At least the ordeal of waiting was over.”Sturgeon had stepped down from her post just months earlier in February 2023, citing burnout. After her police interview in June, she was released pending investigation and sought refuge at a friend’s home in the north-east of Scotland.The arrests had made her feel as if she “had fallen into the plot of a dystopian novel”. Investigations into her actions as party chief continued for more than a year, and she says she felt frightened despite knowing she had done nothing wrong.“I retain both faith in and respect for our country’s criminal justice system. However, none of that changes this fact: being the subject of a high-profile criminal investigation for almost two years, especially having committed no crime, was like a form of mental torture.”She writes that she felt “overwhelming” relief when authorities informed her this year she was no longer a suspect.The excerpts also offer a window into the veteran politician’s thoughts on parenthood and the deep grief she felt upon having a miscarriage in 2010, at the age of 40. She had never had any great desire to be a parent, and that when she did fall pregnant she was “deeply conflicted” due to her work.“In my stupid, work-obsessed mind the timing couldn’t have been worse. By the Scottish election, I would be six months pregnant. It may seem hard to believe now, but even in 2010 it wasn’t obvious how voters would react to a heavily pregnant candidate,” she wrote.But she knew her husband, Peter, would be overjoyed to be a father and he was “ecstatic” to learn the news, she wrote. However, upon telling doctor about noticing “spots of blood”, she had an urgent appointment at Glasgow Royal Infirmary the following day.“I think I’d known in my heart what the outcome would be, but I was still hoping for the best,” she wrote. After four days of “constant agony, the most excruciating pain I have ever experienced”, the pregnancy “passed”.“I had the presence of mind to call Peter into the bathroom and, together, we flushed our ‘baby’ down the toilet,” Sturgeon said. “We later resolved to try again, but I knew then that we had lost our one chance.“Later, what I would feel most guilty about were the days I had wished I wasn’t pregnant,” she wrote. “There’s still a part of me that sees what happened as my punishment for that.”She writes that she had been expecting a baby girl whom she would have named Isla. “I do deeply regret not getting the chance to be Isla’s mum.”Sturgeon announced in March this year she would stand down as an MSP at the next Scottish parliament election, expected in 2026.Frankly will be published on Thursday 14 August.Explore more on these topicsNicola SturgeonScottish National party (SNP)ScotlandScottish politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He had attacked his former partner at the hotel after Mickleburgh conceded to attending a birthday meetup as a gesture of kindness, prosecutors said. They said he then launched a “vicious and murderous attack” and tried to cover up the killing, telling police Mickleburgh had died after falling out of bed.Cartwright had maintained his innocence throughout the trial and pleaded not guilty to all charges. He was found not guilty of the charge of controlling or coercive behaviour and will serve a minimum 28-year sentence.During the month-long trial, the Guildford crown court heard how Mickleburgh, from Axminster in Devon, had been an “incredible mother” and successful businesswoman.View image in fullscreenSamantha Mickleburgh had agreed to attend the birthday dinner with Cartwright because she thought he had no one else to celebrate with.Photograph: Surrey Police/PAShe had agreed to attend the birthday dinner with Cartwright because she thought he had no one else to celebrate with. Honouring her prior commitment, she had organised a room with separate twin beds, and a six-course dinner at the five-star Pennyhill Park hotel in Bagshot.But the court heard that after the second course, Mickleburgh became unwell, with restaurant staff saying she struggled to stand when Cartwright walked her out. Upon return to their room, Cartwright raped and strangled her, causing a skull fracture. He called an ambulance the following morning, claiming he had found her dead in bed next to him.The court heard he had also placed an engagement ring on Mickleburgh’s finger to make it appear as if they had rekindled their romance, and that he had staged the room to make it appear as if they had engaged in consensual sex.Justice Murray in handing down his sentence on Friday said Mickleburgh’s family had described her as “caring, thoughtful, fun, well-organised, generous to a fault and devoted to her family”. They had suffered grief that lay “beyond words to fully describe”.The court had earlier heard from her family who described him as an “evil, controlling, manipulative predator” who thought he would get away with the murder.One of her sisters, Tracey Carter, spoke of an “indescribable amount of pain and suffering” after recalling how the family had welcomed Cartwright into their “homes and hearts”.“I wish she had never met you. Did you feel proud of yourself when you lied to my father, saying that Sam had died in her sleep, knowing full well the horror that you had put her through?” Carter said in her victim impact statement.The jury handed down a unanimous verdict of guilt on charges of murder and rape.Prosecutors had argued that his behaviour towards Mickleburgh had been “cruel, repressive and overbearing” and that he had a history of such behaviour in his previous relationships.Moses Koroma, prosecuting, said the jury had seen “straight through Cartwright’s claims that this had all resulted from her falling out of bed”.Explore more on these topicsSurreyCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

It is the first time since last summer’s riots that there has been a mass and national standing up of specialist public order officers.Some of the extra riot officers will be deployed on the streets, kitted out in helmets and shields to act as a deterrent. Others will be held in reserve and all will be on standby to be rushed across England and Wales to hotspots of violence and rising tension, a police source with knowledge of the planning for this weekend said.The same source stressed there was no specific intelligence of violence, but 800 extra riot officers were ordered to be made ready on Friday, on top of the 2,200 planned already.At least 20 protests targeting hotels used by the government to house asylum seekers are thought possible this weekend, with each one in turn potentially attracting a counter-protest.Police in England brace for disorder as far right promote anti-migrant protestsRead moreAs of 8pm on Friday, 10 protests against asylum seekers had attracted numbers ranging from the dozens to about 100, according to Hope Not Hate, which monitors extremist groups.Stand Up to Racism said about 130 of its supporters had faced about 80 protesters in Leeds. In Chestnut, about 100 protesters against asylum seekers faced 10 anti-racism activists with handmade signs. The group said it had a major mobilisation in Islington, facing about 10 on the other side.One senior officer in an area expecting a protest said: “It is impossible to tell what you are going to get. Within crowds you can get different factions, concerned locals, bystanders, extremists.”Officers will need to keep both sides apart as well as ensure disruption is kept to a minimum.The 3,000 riot officers have been requested from local forces and will be directed by the National Police Coordination Centre.Local commanders will make decisions about specific deployments. In some areas public order officers may deploy in full riot gear from the start to act as a deterrent. Other forces will prefer to have officers in regular uniforms, so called “soft hats”, to start with, with fully kitted riot officers in reserve and close by if trouble erupts.The far right is involved in some, if not most, of the protests but those attending are expected to include local people concerned by claims linking asylum seeker hotels to serious crime.Police public order resources this weekend face a pincer movement from right and left.TheMetropolitan policeis calling in support from other forces as it faces three days of substantial public order challenges, including an anti-migrant protest in Islington, north London, on Friday night, with more are expected at another in Canary Wharf on Sunday.On Saturday in centralLondonthere will be a pro-Palestine march, along with a protest encouraging supporters of Palestine Action – and opponents of its ban under terrorism laws – to dare police to arrest them.Organisers and police sources agree privately hundreds are likely to turn up, the range likely to be 200 to just under 1,000, encouraged to hold placards containing the words “I support Palestine Action”, which police say will lead to arrest.How will police respond to rally against Palestine Action ban?Read moreOrganisers hope to stretch to breaking point the police and criminal justice system’s ability to deal with a mass defiance. Police believe they will manage unless the numbers exceed expectations.0:33Anti-migrant and anti-racist protests take place outside the Britannia hotel in east London – videoIn London, small groups of protesters started to gather from about 5pm on Friday across the road from the Britannia International hotel in Canary Wharf. Riot police scrambled to keep groups of masked men who broke away from the anti-asylum seeker protest from reaching a separate group of anti-racism activists who had attempted to walk down to the hotel.About 200 anti-migrant protesters – including men waving St George’s flags and an Israeli flag – had gathered across the road from the hotel, with some hurling abuse at a Stand Up to Racism protest of about 100 activists, trade unionists and others.Police kept a distance but vans with public order officers were also stationed in streets nearby. Two people were arrested.On Sunday in London, there will be a march in support of the release of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas in the 7 October 2023 attack, as well as football’s Community Shield match. The start of football’s lower divisions this weekend will also require police resources.Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan, who will lead the policing operation, warned people who want to protest against the banning of Palestine Action that they should expect a terrorism charge.She said: “Anyone showing support for Palestine Action can expect to be arrested. An arrest under the Terrorism Act can have very real long-term implications – from travel, to employment, to finances.”There was some unease in Nuneaton on Friday afternoon, before what is expected to be a big turnout at a protest outside the council building on Saturday.The Warwickshire town has become a target for far-right activists in recent days, after two Afghan men were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and raping a 12-year-old girl. They have now been charged in relation to the alleged incident.The Reform UK council leader, 19-year-old George Finch, accused the police of covering up the claim that the men, Ahmad Mulakhil and Mohammad Kabir, are asylum seekers.A group of retired women sitting outside a cafe said they supported the protest. “I think it’s good … They’re only protecting the children. That’s all they’re doing,” said one woman, who would not give her name because “you can’t have an opinion because you’ll get locked up”.Warwickshire’s police chief constable, Alex Franklin-Smith, took the unusual step of publishing a letter to Finch on Wednesday, writing that the police had asked the Home Office to confirm the immigration status of the two men accused in connection with the alleged rape, and “did not and will not cover up such criminality”.Care workers Chijioke “CJ” Ani and Musa Samson, both originally from Nigeria, had also heard about the protest. Ani said he would go to work and go home, and not stay in the town on Saturday.He said he had seen a lot of anti-immigration sentiment on social media. “Some of them are misinformed or acting out of impulse,” he said. “It makes me feel like someone will attack me someday. It’s definitely getting worse because the far right are getting stronger.”While the men, originally from Nigeria, had found Nuneaton to be a friendly town, Samson said he had experienced some racism with men making noises at him as he approached a local bar.Most people the Guardian spoke to in Nuneaton said they would be avoiding the town centre.Lawrence McIntyre was serving teas and coffees from The Kiosk in the town centre. He said: “I do feel sorry if it does put people off coming down shopping. The market traders and the small businesses, they rely on [customers].”He said there had been plenty of diversity in the town for a long time and it had not been a problem until now.View image in fullscreenAnti-migration demonstrators outside the Cresta Court hotel in Altrincham on Friday.Photograph: Jon Super/The GuardianView image in fullscreenAnti-migration demonstrators at the Cresta Court hotel in Altrincham on Friday.Photograph: Jon SuperIn Altrincham, Greater Manchester, protesters and counter-protesters were separated by a busy road outside the Cresta Court hotel. Far-right agitators were met locals who shouted about apparent crimes that they said asylum seekers had committed.“Go back to where you’ve come from, we don’t want you,” shouted one woman towards the hotel. On the other side of the road, counter-protesters chanted that refugees were welcome. In a rare moment of unity, the far right began singing “fuck Keir Starmer” to the tune of Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes and the anti-fascists joined in.Explore more on these topicsPoliceMetropolitan policeProtestImmigration and asylumLondonPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Hers is one of 31 properties listed by MPs where at least some portion of the rent was paid to another person.The Guardian’s analysis found one in eight Westminster MPs – including 10 with government posts – declared a rental income from property in the last year.This includes almost a quarter of the Conservative parliamentary party (27 MPs), just 11% of Labour MPs (43 MPs) and 10% of Liberal Democrats (7 MPs).The two MPs with the largest declared property incomes are both from Labour. Jas Athwal, MP for Ilford South, rents out 15 residential and three commercial properties in London. Last year, he was criticised by Keir Starmer after he was accused ofrenting out flats with black mouldand ant infestations.Tory MPs owning rental properties - graphAthwal was followed by the former chancellorJeremy Hunt, who rents out seven flats in Southampton, and has half a share in a holiday home in Italy and an office building in London.Most of the 169 properties rented out by MPs were residential, but some MPs also let out business and commercial premises. More than two in five (43%) of the properties rented out by MPs were in London.The figures have intensified scrutiny of Ali’s case, which has cast new light on the debate over landlord interests in parliament. Ali resigned on Thursday night after it was revealed she had ended her tenants’ fixed-term contract in order to sell the property, but re-listed it for rent at a higher price within six months.The practice is one the Labour government is seeking to ban under its flagship renters’ rights bill. The bill will end “no fault” evictions under section 21, which allows landlords to throw out tenants without reason.Since the policy was first proposed in April 2019 under Theresa May, 123,889 section 21 claims have progressed to court, and 124,360 households in England have been threatened with homelessness as a result of being served a notice.Originally, the legislation would have banned landlords who evict tenants in order to sell from re-letting the property for 12 months However, theHouse of Lordsamended the bill to reduce this period to six months. The bill was one of several pieces of legislation that became delayed until after the parliamentary summer recess.MPs must only declare a rental property on the register of interests if it, either by itself or as part of a portfolio, provides rental income of more than £10,000 in a calendar year – meaning more MPs could be landlords without declaring it. The Guardian analysis excluded agricultural land holdings.Right to buy in England ‘fuelled housing crisis and cost taxpayers £200bn’Read moreThe disclosure has drawn sharp criticism from housing campaigners. Jae Vail, a spokesperson for the London Renters Union, said: “The sheer number of landlords in parliament is shocking. During an unprecedented housing crisis, it’s a blatant conflict of interest that MPs are making millions from struggling renters – while some even use taxpayer money to cover their own personal rents. Tenants need a government that works for us, not one that profits from our hardship.”Ben Twomey, the chief executive of Generation Rent, said MPs were “around three times more likely to be landlords than the rest of us”, adding: “Landlord power within parliament has left renters with few legal protections when it comes to arbitrary evictions or unreasonable rent hikes. The government must use this moment to double down on its manifesto promise to renters to fix our broken renting system.”One senior figure on the left of the party went further: “We can’t claim to fight for renters while half the PLP are landlords collecting rent from people struggling through the housing crisis. Rushanara’s case is only the tip of the iceberg. Voters see the hypocrisy and it’s killing our credibility on housing.”A spokesperson for Ministry of Housing,Communities& Local Government said:“There are already clear transparency rules around this.“We’re focused on improving standards and security for tenants, and our renters’ rights bill will level the playing field between landlords and tenants. We’re determined to deliver this landmark legislation swiftly, so tenants can have greater security in their homes.”Explore more on these topicsHousingRachel ReevesDavid LammyCommunitiesJeremy HuntKeir StarmerHouse of LordsnewsShareReuse this content"

That wasn’t food you dropped. If you had been PM then UK would be speaking German!”The bombing of Dresden by the RAF and US air force in February 1945 is believed to have killed tens of thousands of civilians. It remains one of the most controversial allied acts of the second world war, amid questions marks over its strategic necessity and the widespread destruction in civilian areas.Huckabee, who became the first evangelical Christian to be Washington’s envoy toIsraelafter Donald Trump nominated him following last November’s presidential election, did not leave it at that.In afollow-up post, he wrote: “How much food has Starmer and the UK sent to Gaza?”He claimed Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, had sent 2m tons of food toGaza, “none of it even getting to hostages”, making an apparent reference to unsupported claims that Hamas is intercepting deliveries and hoarding aid.“Maybe UK PM ought to sit this one out & follow Arab League who said Hamas should disarm & release ALL hostages immediately.”The ambassador’s blunt comments went well beyond the public remarks of Trump when he met Starmer at Turnberry in Scotland last month. The US presidentdeclined to criticise Starmer in his presenceafter it emerged that Britain was preparing to recognize Palestinian statehood in the absence of a ceasefire in Gaza.US ambassador to Israel says US no longer pursuing goal of independent Palestinian stateRead moreHuckabee, a former Republican presidential candidate, hasa history of making intemperate comments in Israel’s favour. In 2008, he said, “There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.” He has also declined to use the term “West Bank”, claimed by Palestinians a territory for part of a future state – instead referring to the territory by the biblical name of Judea and Samaria, which is used by Israel.He has also declined to call Israeli settlements in the territory by that name, insisting on calling them “communities”.In June, he told the BBC that Muslim countries should provide the land for a Palestinian state.“At what point does it have to be in the same piece of real estate that Israel occupies?” he said. “Muslim countries have 644 times the amount of land that are controlled by Israel. So maybe if there is such a desire for the Palestinian state, there would be someone who would say we'd like to host it.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyMike HuckabeeIsraelKeir StarmerGazaWest BankPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

He announced the location in a brief post on his Truth Social site.Russian state media agency Tass confirmed the date and location of the meeting, citing Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov.Earlier in the day, Trump told reporters in the White House the meeting “would have been sooner, but I guess there’s security arrangements that unfortunately people have to make”.The US president also said “there’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both”Ukraineand Russia and that the issue would be discussed soon but he gave no further details.Bloomberg reported on Friday that the deal could cement some of Putin’s territorial gains in Ukraine, in effect freezing the battle lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Putin has claimed four Ukrainian regions in their entirety, although much of their territory remains under Ukrainian control.‘Freeze’ in Ukraine war may be close, says Tusk, as US and Russia plan talksRead moreUS and Russian officials were working on a deal under which Russia would halt its offensive in exchange for the territorial concessions – making it a politically fraught proposal in Ukraine, Bloomberg said.Trump’s comments came after Poland’s prime minister said a “freeze” in the conflict could be close, after speaking with the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has communicated with Trump and European leaders in recent days.“There are certain signals, and we also have an intuition, that perhaps a freeze in the conflict – I don’t want to say the end, but a freeze in the conflict – is closer than it is further away,” Donald Tusk said during a news conference. “There are hopes for this.”Tusk said Zelenskyy was “very cautious but optimistic” about the ceasefire, Reuters reported. Ukraine was keen that Poland and other European countries play a role in planning for a ceasefire and an eventual peace settlement, Tusk said.Trump has previously expressed his readinessto meet Putinone on one without preconditions, including direct negotiations between Putin and Zelenskyy, stoking fears that Ukraine may be left out of negotiations for the framework of a potential ceasefire.If the summit happens, it would be the first US-Russia summit since 2021, when former president Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva.Zelenskyy has responded by speaking with European leaders including the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who are key conduits to Trump.The US envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed a three-way meeting with Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy but the Kremlin had ignored that suggestion, said the Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, and was “focusing on preparations for a bilateral meeting with Trump in the first place”.Putin has said he is not ready to meet Zelenskyy, even as the Kremlin claimed preparations were under way for a bilateral summit with Trump next week.“I have nothing against it in general, it is possible, but certain conditions must be created for this,” Putin said of a meeting with Zelenskyy. “But unfortunately, we are still far from creating such conditions.”Last month,Trump issued an ultimatum for Putinto agree to a ceasefire or face secondary sanctions with the deadline set for this Friday. That deadline appeared in place despite plans for the summit, although the White House has not said what secondary measures it could enforce.Trump did target India with a 25% tariff hike for purchasing Russian oil this week, singling out one of Moscow’s economic enablers in a move thatNew Delhi complained was unfair and selective.Trump had grown frustrated with Putin in public in recent months as the war dragged through its third year and Putin continued to launch nightly missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities despite Trump’s insistence that he could strike a deal within 24 hours of becoming president.“Putin … talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said last month. “So there’s a little bit of a problem there.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpVladimir PutinRussiaUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

It said the imposition of tariffs on gold cast products “makes it economically unviable to export them to the US”.Its president, Christoph Wild, said: “We are particularly concerned about the implications of the tariffs for the gold industry and the physical exchange of gold with the US, a longstanding and historical partner for Switzerland.”Record bullion exports of more than $36bn (£27bn) made up more than two-thirds of Switzerland’s trade surplus with the US in the first quarter, according to Swiss customs data.The price of US goldfutures hit an all-time intraday high of $3,534 on Friday after the details of the ruling letter,first reported by the Financial Times, emerged.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Switzerland’s rate is among the highest in the world, after Brazil, Syria, Laos and Myanmar.According to reports, gold bars were in such demand in the US in May after Trump’s announcement of sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs the previous month that Costco capped how many gold bars could be bought in a day.Explore more on these topicsGoldTrump tariffsCommoditiesDonald TrumpTariffsSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

One in five disconnected homes remain without power for at least a week.The utility shut off 16,327 households in the month leading up to 25 June. New York was hit by its first heatwave between 23 and 25 June, breaking daytime and night-time recordsin Central Parkand driving asurge in emergency room visits.View image in fullscreenA construction crew from a ConEdison electric repair team continues road work in the Chinatown neighborhood of New York on 15 February 2025.Photograph: Robert Nickelsberg/Getty ImagesNew York is among the most expensive places for electricity, with families shouldering above-inflation price hikes in recent years on top of unaffordable housing and the broader cost of living crisis stemming from the Covid pandemic.Heat-related deaths account for about3% of all fatalities from May through September, making New York the second deadliest city for heat after Phoenix, Arizona.How Mamdani connects climate policy to his affordability agenda as he runs for New York mayorRead moreIn the past five years, more than 40% of New Yorkers have fallen into arrears, and 23% of households were disconnected at least once – leaving families without access to a fridge, internet, cooking facilities and heat or cooling until they can find the money to pay for reconnection.Black and Latino New Yorkers are more than twice as likely as white residents to fall behind, and almost eight times more likely to have a utility shutoff, according to the2024 Poverty Tracker/Robin Hood reporton energy insecurity.“Disconnection is an effective cost recovery strategy but it’s also completely inhumane. It’s traumatizing for families and costs some people their lives,” said Diana Hernandez, co-author of the report and associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University.“People want to pay their bills but they are unaffordable for too many families.”View image in fullscreenPeople walk across the Brooklyn Bridge on a day where the heat index is expected to top 100 degrees Fahrenheit in New York on 25 July 2025.Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesAlmost 16% of New York homes – one in six Con Edison residential customers – were behind on their energy bills at the end of 2024, with debts totaling $948m, according to data submitted by the utility to the state regulator.But as Con Edison ramped up disconnections over the past six months, the debt fell to $840m by the end of June with 12.5% of New Yorkers now behind on their bills.At the current rate, Con Edison could disconnect 150,000 households by the end of the year, the highest number by any utility in the country, according to Mark Wolfe, an energy economist.“Energy is unaffordable so people fall behind. The disconnection numbers show that Con Edison is aggressively cracking down, and life is going to become harder for poor people in New York,” said Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (Neada).Researchers at Neada, the organization for state directors of the federally funded Low Income HomeEnergyAssistance Program (Liheap), collated the debt and disconnection figures submitted to the New York Public Services Commission, the regulator.There is no demographic breakdown but people of color, households with children, renters in small buildings, and people with pre-existing medical conditions who rely on electronic devices such as oxygen dispensers, as well as Bronx residents are all more likely to experience energy poverty and therefore a disconnection, the 2024 Robin Hood report found.A Con Edison spokesperson said: “Termination of service is a last resort, and we do so only after extensive outreach and exhausting all other options … nearly two-thirds of residential customers in arrears are on payment plans. It is essential that our customers pay their bills to maintain safe service and the most reliable system in the nation.”Most customers were reconnected within 24 hours and 80% within a week, the spokesperson added.View image in fullscreenA woman uses a fan to cool off on a day where the heat index is expected to top 100 degrees Fahrenheit in New York on 25 July 2025.Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesNationwide, an estimated one in three households experience energy poverty – the inability to access sufficient amounts of electricity and other energy sources due to financial hardship. Low-income households, people of color and states with the fewest social safety nets are disproportionately affected, and millions of families are regularly forced to ration food, medicines, energy and other essentialsAcross New York state – and the country – a patchwork of regulations prevent some households from being shut off on very hot or cold days, but millions are not protected at all.New York, like much of the US, is susceptible to extreme highs and low temperatures, and the climate crisis is driving more frequent and more intense heatwaves.The number of heat deaths has been rising over the past decade, and on average 525 people in New York City die prematurely each year for heat-related reasons – the vast majority due to the impact high temperatures and humidity have on existing medical conditions, according to thelatest figures from the city’s department of public health.Heat kills twice Black New Yorkers at twice the rate of white residents due to past and current structural racism that creates economic, healthcare, housing, energy and other systems that benefit white people and disadvantage people of color,the report found.Most deaths occur in homes without access to a functioning air conditioning.Citywide, 11% ofNew Yorkers do not have air conditioners at home but the rate is much higher in low-income communities of color. One study found that a fifth of renters do not use their air conditioner due to cost.And while protections have improved in recent years, it has not been enough to shield families hit hardest by rising energy prices, rents and inflation – or the increasingly brutal heat and humidity.According to its website, Con Edison currently suspends disconnections on the hottest and coldest days based on forecasts from the National Weather Service. In the summer, the utility will not disconnect a family the day of or day before the heat index – what the temperature feels like when humidity is taken into account – is forecast to hit 90F (32.2C) at Central Park – one of the shadiest parts of the city. It also suspends disconnections for two days after a 90F heat index day.Yet temperatures in some neighborhoods in the Bronx and upper Manhattan, where there are fewer trees, less access to air conditioning, more Black and Latino residents, and most heat deaths, exceed Central Park by 6 to 8 degrees due to the heat island effect,according to one study from 2022.Energy poverty is a chronic problem for many New Yorkers.View image in fullscreenA ConEdison van in the Bronx borough of New York on 20 July 2019.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesNew York state is the largest recipient of Liheap, the chronically underfunded bipartisan federal program that helped about 6m households keep on top of energy bills last year – and which narrowly survivedbeing cut completely from Trump’s 2026 budget.In fiscal year 2024-25, New York received $379m (almost 10%) of the total Liheap fund, and Governor Kathy Hochul invested an additional $35m to supplement support for heating bills in January after Liheap money ran out with months of winter still to go.In the summer, the Liheap program only covers the cost of an air conditioning unit and installation for qualifying low-income households in New York – not energy bills. A city program can provide a means-tested loan for working families in arrears.Disconnections declined during the pandemic thanks to a statewide moratorium and debt forgiveness schemes, as well as child tax credits and a boost to food stamps among other federal programs that helped lift millions of Americans out of poverty. But the Covid-era social safety programs have now all been terminated, and recent focus groups conducted by Hernandez and her colleagues found people still struggling to recover and rationing energy use because they were so concerned about rising bills.“The city has got better at advocating for households disproportionately impacted by disconnections but it’s a drop in the bucket of where it should be,” said Hernandez, the energy justice expert. “The 88,000 households disconnected are people who have done everything to get the money and still couldn’t get caught up. It illustrates families have been left completely exposed.”Yet energy costs are about to get even higher in New York.View image in fullscreenPeople cool off at a fire hydrant in New York on 25 June 2025.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will make electricity production more expensive, leading to residents paying $140 a year on average more by 2030, according toanalysis by Energy Innovation.The bill also slashes benefits such as Snap (food stamps) and Medicaid, which will put further pressure on millions of families.Meanwhile, Con Edison is under fire from city and state politicians including Hochul and the city comptroller (chief finance officer) and former mayoral candidate, Brad Lander, for requesting a rate hike of 11% for electricity and 13% for gas, which the regulator is currently considering. Con Ed’s proposed electricity rate hike could raise the average household bill by $372 next year. (The utility provides gas to 1.1m homes.)“The combination of rising temperatures, rising electricity rates, the possible termination of the federal Liheap program, and this increase in shutoffs by Con Ed risks dramatically increasing heat-related illness and deaths for New Yorkers,” Lander told the Guardian.“There needs to be strategies in place so that people will pay their bills – but to punish people who are poor by cutting off their electricity ever, but especially in extreme heat or wintertime, is inhumane. It is a form of debtors’ prison.”Con Edison said it provided $311m in bill discounts to income-eligible customers last year, and the regulator (PSC) recently expanded the Energy Affordability Program to help more vulnerable residents.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUtilitiesClimate crisisExtreme heatnewsShareReuse this content"

A consortium of oil majors led by the state-run energy company YPF, along with Shell and Chevron, is pushing ahead with plans for the country’s largest crude oil export port and a fossil gas liquefaction ship in the gulf.A map showing the location of Punta Colorada and the surrounding nature reservesPart of theVaca Muerta Sur project, the infrastructure involves constructing a271-mile (437km) pipeline, which is due to enter service in late 2026, from the Neuquén basin to an export terminal at Punta Colorada on the Atlantic coast.The pipeline is designed to transport 550,000 barrels per day (bpd), or 88,000 cubic metres, by 2027, with the possibility of increasing capacity to 700,000 bpd. There will be astorage facility able to hold 4m barrelsand a large-capacity tanker will dock every five days.“The oil companies are moving in, and nobody is talking about it,” Gaffet says. “The situation is desperate.”View image in fullscreenMagellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) at the San Lorenzo colony on Argentina’s Valdés peninsula, where tens of thousands of the birds nest.Photograph: Image Source /AlamySince taking office in 2023, President Javier Milei – a climate-crisis denier – has dismantledArgentina’s environmental protection policies, abolished the environment ministry, cut funding and threatened towithdraw from the Paris climate agreement.View image in fullscreen‘It will have a disastrous impact,’ says María Leoní Gaffet.Photograph: H BarberBut those who object to the project warn of the potential for catastrophic consequences for local fauna, including the world’s largest colony of Magellanic penguins. San Matías Gulf borders the Península Valdés protected area and nearby reserves, including Islote Lobos national park and Caleta de los Loros.“It will have a disastrous impact on biodiversity, from the smallest marine life up to the whales and orcas,” says Gaffet.The primary concern is the threat of oil spills. María Raquel Perrier, a marine biologist, says oil ports are “inherently dirty” and even the “inevitable microspills” can deprive water of oxygen.“These spills kill vulnerable species and disrupt the entire biodiversity system,” says Perrier.For example, oil strips the insulating qualities from the fur of sea otters, making them prone to hypothermia, and clogs up the feathers of birds, stopping them from flying.The gulf’s semi-enclosed geography also means polluted water lingers, says Perrier, who warns thatArgentinais ill-equipped to respond to potential spills. “In one case earlier this year, we only found out [about a spill] because fishers said the sea had turned black,” she says.View image in fullscreenRookeries of sea lions on the Valdés peninsula. During the summer, from early December, the colony can be home to more than 2,000 of the animals.Photograph: Iakov Filimonov/AlamyDiana Visintini, who runs whale-watching tours, says increased maritime traffic also raises the risk of collisions. “We already see,from the scars on their backs, where propellers have hit whales in the outer seas. Imagine what could happen if oil traffic comes here,” she says.Once hunted to near extinction, southern right whales now number about 5,500 in the area. Visintini says studies in Massachusetts, in the US, show thatoil tanker collisions are a major cause of the population declineof a similar species, the North Atlantic right whale.View image in fullscreenFabricio Di Giacomo says only two public hearings on the project have been held.Photograph: Harriet BarberThe Buenos Aires-basedInstituto de Conservación de Ballenashas warned thatindustrial noise pollutionin the gulf could further harm whales, hindering communication, creating chronic stress and disrupting migration patterns.Coastal communities dependent on fishing and tourism also feel threatened. Sergio Fernández, a 60-year-old fisher and guide, says: “All the people living and working here, we are all at risk. Any spill will be huge; it will be a storm. The only people it won’t affect are those who invest.”Oil spills contaminate water, air and food with toxic chemicals such as polyphenols and benzene,and can cause serious health problems. Cecilia Salcedo, a 44-year-old teacher, fears for her children, foreseeing “a sea they can’t swim in; a sea that’s privatised, taken over by corporations”.View image in fullscreenTourists watching a southern right whale breaching off the Valdés peninsula in Patagonia.Photograph: Gabriel Rojo/AlamyOpponents of the project say they have been excluded from any debate. Fabricio Di Giacomo, 43, a resident who is a member of the San Matías Gulf collective, says only two public hearings have been held about the project. He adds that those opposed to the project have faced intimidation from locals who support it. He has footage of a hearing in the Río Negro town of Sierra Grande in 2023 when campaigners were blocked from entering.View image in fullscreenCecilia Salcedo worries generations to come will suffer from the oil projects.Photograph: Harriet Barber“There were 10 or 15 men waiting for us outside,” he says. “They said we couldn’t be there and blocked the entrance so that we couldn’t get in.“I was officially registered to speak at the assembly. But these men were threatening me, saying they would kill me.”Gaffet and Visintini argue that the oil terminal should be moved to open waters. “We’re not saying they shouldn’t extract the oil,” Gaffet says, “just take it to the open sea at Viedma, or through Buenos Aires province, which already has a port.”“Why should we sacrifice another area? Because they want to build the cheapest pipeline possible? The price is too high, to lose this nature so a few people get rich.”Shell did not respond to requests for comment. Chevron said YPF should comment on the case, as the Argentinian company was the leader of the consortium.YPF responded in a statement on behalf of the consortium, saying that the project would create thousands of jobs.Argentina’s future lies in the balance as vast oilfields poised for extractionRead more“At its peak, it will create over 5,000 direct jobs, as well as thousands of indirect jobs across related sectors.”The statement did not directly comment on the dangers of oil spills, but said an environmental impact study was approved by Río Negro’s energy secretariat in 2024 and was subjected to a public hearing.YPF said: “The study, carried out by two internationally recognised consultancies, involved various field surveys with the participation of up to 50 specialists, including terrestrial and marine biologists, fisheries engineers, oceanographers, sociologists, architects and others.”The Río Negro and Chubut provincial governments did not respond to requests for comment. But the Río Negro administration has previously said the project’s impact would be “moderate to low”.Meanwhile, Visintini and the local fishers have begun oil spill response training. “We have to be prepared for what might happen,” Visintini says.View image in fullscreenPipes at a shale oil and gas site in the Neuquén basin, part of Argentina’s vast Vaca Muerta shale field.Photograph: Ricardo Ceppi/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsArgentinaThe Latin and Caribbean oil rushAmericasCoastlinesOil spillsOil (Environment)Oil (Business)Oil and gas companiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The company’s share price tanked as a result of his detention.He was one of several high-profile executives in China – mostly from the finance industry – who have gone missing in recent years with little explanation amid a sweeping anti-corruption campaign spearheaded by the president, Xi Jinping.Bao’s disappearance rattled professionals in the Chinese banking industry as Beijing pressed its campaign to rein in lavish lifestyles among the financial elite.His release comes as China seeks to drive up business confidence, particularly for the country’s tech entrepreneurs, whose businesses have struggled under a years-long crackdown.The private sector has been reeling from weak domestic consumption and a prolonged debt crisis in the property industry, against a broader backdrop of heightened trade tensions with the US.Inside China’s fast-fashion factories as a US trade war looms - podcastRead moreChristopher Beddor, a deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, said: “This is certainly a positive signal, as Bao was the most high-profile financier detained in recent years.“Still, it won’t change the fact that the anti-corruption campaign continues to churn through the financial sector, and the common prosperity campaign has led to sweeping pay caps and even clawbacks. China’s financial sector remains a long way from its heyday only a few years ago.”Bao, widely regarded as one of China’s best-connected bankers, was released from detention earlier this week, the source said on Friday, declining to be identified because the information was not public.Bao had been involved in high-profile deals including the mergers of the ride-hailing companies Didi and Kuaidi, the food delivery giants Meituan and Dianping, and the travel platforms Ctrip and Qunar.China Renaissance Bao had yet to respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Chinese media outlets Caixin first reported Bao’s release, citing unidentified sources.China Renaissance’s shares jumped 17% on Friday to close at HK$6.87 ($0.8752) before the news of his release became public.Bao, who previously worked at Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, went missing in February 2023. Trade in China Renaissance shares was suspended in April 2023 after the bank delayed publication of its audited annual results as a result of mainland Chinese authorities detaining its chief executive.A Chinese financial publication reported in May 2023 he was detained by disciplinary and supervision officials. Authorities have not yet provided an explanation. China Renaissance resumed trading of its shares in September last year. They plunged 72% on their opening day.Sources have previously told Reuters he was taken away to assist in an investigation into a former colleague.Xie Yi Jing, who co-founded China Renaissance, replaced Bao as chair in February last year. Subsequently, Bao’s wife, Hui Yin Ching, was appointed as chair to lead the boutique investment bank in October, with changes in other senior management ranks as well.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

For anyone tuned in to the 29 July game between the Atlanta Dream and Golden State Valkyries, the initial reaction was disbelief. In a world where feeds are increasingly AI-generated and algorithmically tuned for confusion, the boundaries between real and unreal have softened into clay. Our senses, once reliable, now compete with simulation. What does it mean when dildos become airborne at WNBA games?Not once,not twice,but repeatedly? Protest? Performance art? Or just another malformed blip in the automated dreamscape we scroll through daily?Another WNBA game disrupted by sex toy thrown on court in ChicagoRead moreTwo men have been arrested thus far in these grotesque affronts.One was 18,the other 23, part of Gen Z, the prime consumer of debased meme culture. Authorities have not identified suspects in the most recent two dildo-throwing incidents. However, Delbert Carver, a 23-year-old man, was arrested in connection with the first incident during a WNBA game in Atlanta. According to ESPN, Carver may face charges of disorderly conduct, public indecency or indecent exposure and criminal trespass. In an affidavit, he allegedly admitted that the act was “supposed to be a joke” and intended “to go viral”.When dildos become airborne atWNBAgames more than once, the meaning shifts. It reveals the collapse of coherence under TikTok’s attention economy. These aren’t protests or insults that make a point. They’re spectacles. The goal is to provoke. In a memetic landscape poisoned by irony, absurdity is the point. The dildo isn’t symbolic. Its function is noise.Philosopher Guy Debord would be shocked at how on the nose we have become. His work argued we live in a “society of the spectacle,” where life is mediated through image, and authenticity is replaced by performance. Today, women’s sports are doubly mediated, first through the lens of athletic competition, then through the social gaze that still questions their legitimacy. Laura Mulvey’s theory of the “male gaze” further sharpens this: Women, particularly in visual media, are often positioned not as agents but as objects. In this context, female athletes are not merely participants in a game. They’re props in someone else’s viral moment. The dildo becomes mise-en-scène.The memeification of rebellionBut this isn’t just theoretical. It’s real. So is the disrespect. The dildo is a weaponized farce. It’s thrown not just to interrupt but to dominate the narrative, to remind players that their gender, their careers and their stage remain vulnerable to mockery. It stops the game. Hijacks it, even. And reasserts the notion, violent and comical, that women’s achievements exist on borrowed time within a culture still conditioned to belittle them.So far, the suspects in these cases are part of Gen Z, a generation raised in and by the internet. Their actions cannot be dismissed as isolated provocations. They must be contextualized within TikTok’s cultural logic, or worse, the absurdist ethos of “Skibidi Toilet”. If you are a normally functioning adult with a job, you might ask, “What is Skibidi Toilet?”Skibidi Toiletis a viral animated web series featuring surreal, low-resolution battles between human heads protruding from toilets and humanoid characters with surveillance equipment for heads. Glitchy visuals, overstimulating pacing, and meme loops create a vibe without meaning.But to understand these trolls’ intentions, and see the direction society is headed, we must contextualize them within TikTok’s cultural logic. The garish green dildo mirrors the surreal, low-fi, uncanny aesthetic of Skibidi Toilet or any number of algorithm-fueled meme cycles. The dildo is an anti-symbol. Its meaning is its absurdity. Skibidi brainrot encapsulates a generation fluent in irony but starved for meaning. The dildo is funny not because it says something, but because it says nothing. It’s the irrational object breaking into a space of rationality.View image in fullscreenTwo of the WNBA sex toy-throwing incidents have taken place during games involving Sophie Cunningham and the Indiana Fever.Photograph: Ron Jenkins/Getty ImagesThis kind of hyper-chaotic media serves as both entertainment and an ambient worldview for young men raised online. Their minds normalize prank-as-expression. In this context, throwing a dildo on to the court during a WNBA game isn’t just an act of crude rebellion. It sadly mirrors the Skibidi Toilet ethos: low-effort disruption cloaked in irony, where the gesture is meant to be meaningless and provocative at once. As traditional signifiers of rebellion (punk, political protest, counterculture) fade or fragment in the digital noise, young men are absorbing frameworks of meaninglessness, where “funny = power” and shock is its own reward.Furthering the chronically online element of all this, in the last two days,a crypto memecoin group has claimed creditfor the recent dildo-throwing incidents at WNBA games, reframing what seemed like rogue trolling as a deliberate guerrilla marketing stunt. The group, which openly mocks the league and brags about not watching women’s sports, celebrated the act online as a victory. If true, this spectacle is engineered by people who understand that visibility matters more than meaning in an algorithm-driven culture.This is how meme culture is rotting America: not from the inside, but from online. The internet’s lack of regulation is its greatest strength and its most dangerous flaw. It allows once-fringe ideologies and juvenile impulses to scale without resistance. Ideas that would have died in solitude or been challenged in a public square now find shelter in forums and meme loops, rewarded by engagement. In this new economy of attention, even humiliation has utility. We’re left with a culture where trolling becomes its own form of marketing.From trolls to Trump: the end of shameHow did we arrive at this level of collective debasement? Despite living in an era of unprecedented digital access,over half of American adults (54%) read below a sixth-grade level, and 21% are considered illiterate as of 2022. This foundational deficit in literacy undermines a person’s ability to evaluate online messages critically. Thus, a generation raised on irony struggles to decode satire, or even manipulation. Back in 2013, 66% of fourth graders couldn’t read proficiently. It was a warning sign that today’s adults would fail to distinguish viral provocation from genuine meaning. Online, many young people now build identity from meme fragments, unconsciously mimicking behavior they don’t fully understand. Lacking media literacy, they become perfect vessels for cultural incoherence.All of this really boils down to the death of shame within society. And it starts at the top. Donald Trump’s most enduring legacy isn’t a policy but a persona as the shameless troll who made humiliation a political strategy. His constant provocation and gleeful disdain for norms created a playbook both parties use now. Liberals respond with faux-moral outrage, conservatives with Nietzschean bravado, but the end result is the same: a culture addicted to performance, where shame is no longer a deterrent.This logic has trickled down into every corner of public life through race, class, gender and especially online culture, where symbolic acts of ressentiment become viral currency. The dildo thrown at a women’s basketball game isn’t just a crude joke but a memeified act of humiliation. It doesn’t challenge power on any level, it just wants attention. And in a culture without shame, the humiliation sticks to the target, not the perpetrator. In this case, the WNBA players themselves.The fact that these incidents have popped up simultaneously across the country, from New York to Atlanta to Chicago, shows that the lack of shame is collective, bipartisan and here to stay. This is where we are: everything is bait. We’ve collapsed the distinction between trolling and activism, and so we land – like the dildo itself – on the bottom of the floor, laughing, recording, retweeting, but never asking what it says about who we’ve become.Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Prolonged cheers for Mboko interrupted play 30 minutes intothe men’s finalbeing played concurrently 330 miles west in her hometown of Toronto. “I guess the Canadian player won in Montreal,” chair umpire Fergus Murphy explained to the confused players.That’s the Mboko effect.With wins over four-time grand slam champion Osaka, reigning Roland Garros champion, and world No 2 Coco Gauff, 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, and 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, Mboko became just the third teen in the open era to oust four major champions at a WTA event. She’s the youngest sinceSerena Williamsran the table to win the 1999 US Open.If you find yourself in a “first since” or “youngest since” Serena stat, you know you’ve done something special.“I think my biggest takeaway is the sky’s the limit,” Mboko told the Guardian after the win. “I never would have thought I would win a WTA 1000 so soon, that this would be my first WTA title, too.”Mboko started the year ranked outside the top 300 and proceeded to win the first 20 matches she played, all in straight sets, and sweeping up five ITF titles in the first three months of the season. The bulk of her wins came at professional tennis’ minor league equivalent, but that stretch of play showed what Mboko could do if she got on a roll.Maya Joint is a 19-year-old Australian who has already won two WTA titles in her breakout season.

It is as intelligent as it is physical, a potent blend of power and discipline. She can overwhelm her opponents with power or use her speed and defense to trap them into errors. The choice, on any given day, is hers.Ben Shelton rallies to beat Karen Khachanov in Toronto for biggest title of careerRead more“She’s very athletic,” said top-seeded Gauff after Mboko handed her a 6-1, 6-4 exit in the round of 16. “She’s a great ball striker, and she seems pretty positive out there on the court, doesn’t get really too negative.”“I don’t know her too well, but I’ve gotten to talk to her a little bit over the course since Rome. I think she has a great support system around her, and I think that’s important when you’re young and on tour.”Mboko’s coach Nathalie Tauziat watched from the sidelines as her charge learned in real time how to compete and manage stress. So long as she kept her head, Tauziat told her, the talented teen was always in with a shot. Montreal proved to be her showcase. Her win over Osaka was her third come-from-behind win of the tournament. In the semi-finals, she saved a match point to stun No 3 seed Rybakina in a third-set tiebreak.“In the beginning of the year when I was winning a lot of matches and tournaments, I just had a lot of confidence in myself, to be honest,” Mboko said. “I don’t know where that confidence came from, maybe it was just self-belief. I tried to carry that momentum as much as I possibly could.”View image in fullscreenVictoria Mboko celebrates after winning the second set over Elena Rybakina on Wednesday in the Montreal semi-finals.Photograph: Minas Panagiotakis/Getty ImagesMboko’s parents, Cyprien Mboko and Godee Kitadi, fled the Democratic Republic of Congo due to the political turmoil in 1999 and emigrated to the United States. Victoria was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, before the family relocated to Toronto. Her older siblings all played tennis, with her sister Gracia and brother Kevin being good enough to play at the collegiate level.She spent her summers running around the grounds at the National Bank Open chasing autographs and photos with her favorite players like Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gael Monfils. She even has a photo of herself at eight years old holding a replica of the trophy.Ten years on, she’s no longer a pretender. Hours after the trophy ceremony, Mboko still couldn’t believe she had her hands on the real thing. She will leave Montreal as one of the 25 best players on the WTA Tour, ranked at an astonishing No 24.When asked whether she feels like one of the 25 best players in the world, Mboko’s humility kicked in.“I don’t think I could say yes to that, to be honest,” she said. “It happens, and I honestly think everything’s been happening so fast that I don’t really have time to process it, let alone look at the rankings.Canadian teen Victoria Mboko caps dream run in Montreal with first WTA Tour titleRead more“I feel like when I settle down a little bit and kind of realize what has just happened, so many things will change and I’ll have a different perspective going forward.”That perspective now shifts to the US Open, a tournament that has been very good to the Canadians. In 2019, a 19-year-old Bianca Andreescu became Canada’s first grand slam singles champion there. Two years later, Leylah Annie Fernandez stormed into the final. Could Mboko follow their well-worn path? She certainly isn’t ruling it out.“When I started playing on the WTA Tour, I never thought in my head if I belonged or not because I just thought, a match is just a match,” Mboko said.“I always knew everyone was really good, but I felt that at the end of the day, anything is possible.”Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsCanadaCoco GauffSerena WilliamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But has the US done enough to guarantee success?American track athletes have not dominated the Paralympics in the way they have the Olympics. More money and commitment is neededLarry BorowskyFri 8 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 07.09 EDTShareAlthough he came up just short in one of the most thrilling events of last weekend’s US Track and Field Outdoor Championships, Miguel Jimenez-Vergara could still take satisfaction in a crowd-pleasing performance.Competing for the first time at the famous Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, the 24-year-old waged a tense tactical war over 5000m with the US’s fastest wheelchair racers. Entering the final lap, Jimenez-Vergara vaporized a tightly packed field with a ferocious acceleration that energized the crowd. Only one competitor could rise to the challenge: reigning Paralympic gold medalist Daniel Romanchuk. Jimenez-Vergara still led by a wheel as they rocketed through the final turn at more than 20 mph; Romanchuk caught him in the final 50m and won by a tenth of a second.It was an exhilarating show, and worthy of the big-league setting. But Jimenez-Vergara rejected attempts to spin it as a triumph.“I just want to win,” he said. “I’m not here to soak up the fans or soak up the atmosphere. I know you probably want me to say I’m excited to be at Hayward and get more visibility [for disabled athletes]. And we do need more eyes on us. But for me, I’ll race in the parking lot. I just want to beat the guy next to me. I just want to be the best.”That sums up both the promise and the pitfalls of the weekend’s historic championship. For the first time, USA Track and Field showcased America’s Paralympic talent on the sport’s biggest stage, side by side with their better-known, better-paid Olympic teammates. It’s a clear win for parasports equity, one that recognizes disabled competitors as supremely gifted athletes rather than novelty acts.But it’s a largely symbolic victory, and glaringly overdue. Achieving the type of success Jimenez-Vergara hungers for – global dominance in paratrack – will require more than splashy gestures toward inclusion. It will take a level of money and commitment far beyond what Team USA has previously invested in parasports. There’s urgency to post a high medal count when theParalympicscome to US soil in Los Angeles three years from now. But time is short, and talk is cheap.‘My drag racing career is taking off’: a Paralympic hero’s next stepsRead more“Seeing the integration actually happen is really cool,” says sprinter Jarryd Wallace, a four-time Paralympian and longtime advocate for equity. “It shows how much growth there has been. But in order to make the heights climb even higher, we’ve got to keep asking questions. No one really knows the right direction yet. We’re finding out what the needs are, what the resources and opportunities are. And I think it’s going to catapult us to places we’ve never seen US parasport before.”The places wehaveseen US parasport before can generously be described as third-rate. Until last year, national championships and Paralympic trials were routinely staged at high school and community-college tracks that lacked accessibility accommodations for the athletes, media hookups for journalists, and comfort amenities for the public. The stands (if there were any) were inevitably empty. The tracks themselves were often an embarrassment.“The venues haven’t been so great in the past,” says Tatyana McFadden, one of US paratrack’s most recognizable stars and the winner of 22 Paralympic track and field medals, a US record. “Long-jump pits have not been the right size. There have been holes in the track and not enough water for the athletes.” The 2024 national meet and Paralympic trials were held at top-notch facilities – but only after Paralympians filed a formal grievance following the 2023 national championships. Going forward, it’ll be Hayward Field every year.“It’s nice when you can just go out and compete without worrying if there’s a divot in your lane,” says McFadden. “It’s good to be treated like elite athletes. We deserve this.”US paraathletes also deserve the same pay as their non-disabled peers, and they’ve made some progress on that front – since 2021, Paralympic medal bonuses have been equivalent to Olympic bonuses (they were one-fifth as large previously). But performance-based compensation in other major para events continues to lag. So do stipends for travel, training, equipment, and living expenses.Given their relative dearth of resources, US paratrack athletes have compiled an admirable record of international success. While they haven’t matched the preeminence of their Olympic comrades – who have led the world in track medals (overall and gold) at every Olympics since 1992 – US Paralympians have brought home 212 track medals this century, more than every nation except China. They hold dozens of world records. It’s an impressive ledger, but other countries have been catching up or surging ahead in recent cycles. Since 2000, China has won twice as many Paralympic track medals as the United States. Brazil has invested heavily in parasports since hosting the 2016 Paralympics; last summer it nearly matched Team USA in overall track medals and won the same number of golds. Great Britain, Russia, and European countries have vastly expanded their paraathletic recruitment and training initiatives. And nearly every nation has unified their para and able-bodied track programs into a single governing body – a step the United States took belatedly this year, when US Track and Field absorbed the paratrack wing.That organizational merger formalized a de facto fusion that’s been happening for decades. US Paralympic and Olympic athletes routinely train and travel together, share coaches and sponsors, and regard each other as peers. “I moved to the Olympic Training Center in 2005, and Al Joyner was my coach,” says April Holmes, a trailblazing Paralympic sprinter who now serves as interim CEO of SafeSport USA. “I trained with all of his [Olympic] athletes. There was already a conversation back then – ‘Why aren’t our Nationals together?’ The administration finally caught up to what was happening on the track.”“The rest of the world has been doing it, and we should be doing it too,” adds shotputter Josh Cinnamo, a world record-holder and member of Team USA’s Athletes Commission. “If we’re going to speak like we’re one organization, then let’sbeone organization.”Nobody in the US wants to see China dominate Team USA on the Paralympic track in three years. But it may take the Americans longer than that to catch up. While top-tier US paraathletes such as McFadden, Romanchuk, Ezra Frech, Hunter Woodhall, and Brittni Mason can compete with anyone in the world, America’s talent pipeline is nowhere near as productive on the Paralympic side as on the Olympic side.“We are missing a bridge between junior level competition and the international level,” says retired Paralympian Amanda McGrory, a seven-time medalist who now provides color commentary on NBC Universal’s paratrack coverage. “After you win your state or regional championship, there’s nowhere to go. Where do you find a coach? How do you make that jump from high school or collegiate competition to the world-championship level? There hasn’t been a lot of direction for most people. That’s where we really need some support.”Jimenez-Vergara illustrates the obstacles athletes face. After piling up national championships and international medals in his teens, he floundered for several years, training on his own with sporadic coaching. “I was trying to get to the Tokyo Paralympics, but I didn’t know how,” he says. “It just wasn’t happening. I just didn’t have the speed.” He might have remained stuck if his old junior coach hadn’t brokered an introduction to US Paralympic track coach Joaquim Cruz. That eventually led to a berth at the US Olympic and Paralympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California, which made an immediate and dramatic impact.“I stopped viewing myself as just a wheelchair racer,” Jimenez-Vergara explains. “Being around all the sprinters, the throwers, the jumpers, I realized that I am a track athlete. That meant I had to act like one. I had to start doing the track things these other guys had been doing for years and years.”He took advantage of the personal trainer, gym, nutritionist, sports psychologist, and other forms of support he’d always lacked access to. The effects became clear in 2023, when Jimenez-Vergara won a gold and two silvers at the Parapan American Games, a standard proving ground for emerging US Paralympians. This season he’s staged a running back-and-forth duel with his one-time idol, Romanchuk, typified by the tight finish in last weekend’s 5000m. By 2028, he may be ready to challenge for a Paralympic podium.There are plenty of prospects like Jimenez-Vergara who are still out there floundering, and the USATF hasn’t yet built a system for finding and developing them. It will take an aggressive recruiting blitz for the US to have any chance of running down the Chinese.“USA Track and Field has an established model of how to identify talent and get them to the next level,” McGrory says. “And I think that’s replicable on the Paralympic side. China has done a really good job at discovering and developing young talent. It makes them hard to catch. But that’s where USA Track and Field can help.”“USATF just needs to do what they do well,” adds Wallace. “They just need to lean in to who they are.”Bringing the Para Track Nationals to Hayward Field was a necessary first step, but not a sufficient one. Team USA still has a lot of race left to run.Larry Borowsky is the editor of Amplitude, a national lifestyle magazine for amputees.Explore more on these topicsLA Paralympic Games 2028ParalympicsDisability and sportUS sportsLA Olympic Games 2028featuresShareReuse this content"

The portrayal of Liverpool as lavish spenders, insists Slot, is misleading.“The net spend of us compared to the other teams is not in our favour if you look at the last two seasons,” he said. “It’s completely normal that we are one of the favourites, because we won it last season. And we brought in good players. Like all the other teams did, by the way. This is what makes this league so nice. I think there’s only been one exception [a team winning the league after a frugal summer] in the last two, three, four, five, six years, and that’sLiverpoollast season.“Every team in the Premier League is spending money. So if we are only favourites because we’ve spent a bit, I would see that as weird because we’ve lost a lot as well. But that we are favourites because we won it last season and we played so well, that’s clear. And the ambitions haven’t changed, because the ambition of this club is always to compete for every trophy.”View image in fullscreenHugo Ekitiké is one of Liverpool’s summer recruits.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersSlot believes it is premature to say Liverpool’s squad represents an upgrade on last season and says the departures of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Luis Díaz – as well as the tragic loss of Diogo Jota – cannot be ignored. “The players we’ve brought in have done really well already, as expected,” he said. “But I cannot tell you now if these players are able to perform at the same level every three days; we first have to start the season. And I did know Luis Díaz was able to do that, and all the other ones were able to do that. So that is another challenge in the Premier League, because we play so many games.“For Milos Kerkez, it’s going to be his first time at this level probably that he might have to play every three days. Florian Wirtz comes from the Bundesliga, where he was used to playing every three or four days, but we have to ask him in two months if the intensity levels of the Premier League are comparable with the Bundesliga.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After five rounds, the eight-time title winner Michael Adams, 53, led with 4.5/5 by half a point from a group of eight, who included the top-seeded former Russian champion Nikita Vitiugov. Victory would enable the Taunton, Somerset-based grandmaster to equal Henry Atkins’s nine championships from the first half of the 20th century and leave him just one short of Jonathan Penrose’s total of 10 from the second half. Adams’s subtle fourth round rook endgameagainst the GM Nigel Davies was a classic, while in round five he exploited Shreyas Royal’s hesitant openingto establish early dominance.Adams retained his slender half point over a 10-player peloton in Thursday’s sixth round with a solid draw against Vitiugov, but the two eye-catching results were by Royal, as the 16-year-old won antruly elegant 27-moveragainst IM Marcus Harvey, and 11-year-old Supratit Banerjee, who showcased his burgeoning talent bydefeating GM Simon Williams.The championship outcome remained unclear after Friday’s seventh round, when Adams missed a chance to consolidate his lead and was joined by Royal, who defeated Wadsworth.

So it is no surprise that Kieran McKenna’s Ipswich are back in theChampionshipat the first opportunity.Should Birmingham emulate Friday night’s opponents, they have no intentions of following the same path. Every bold statement to emerge from the club over the summer makes it abundantly clear that this period in the second tier is expected to be brief. Sights have been set high and, on the basis of this performance against opposition that took points off clubs such as Chelsea, Tottenham and Aston Villa last season, it is easy to see why.Birmingham City v Ipswich Town: Championship opener – liveRead moreThere is, if not a swagger, then a visible belief in the way Birmingham’s players go about their business. That they were denied victory by a cruel added-time penalty decision should do little to detract from the dominance they showed for the majority of a fiery encounter.When Jay Stansfield smashed home from close range 10 minutes into the second half it was just rewards for the home side’s assured display, which looked set to earn them all three points. Alas, five minutes into the eight added on, an Ipswich corner was headed on to the arm of the substitute Lyndon Dykes, who knew nothing about it. George Hirst did not waste the opportunity to equalise from the penalty spot with the visitors’ only shot on target all night.“I thought it was really, really harsh,” said Birmingham head coach, Chris Davies, of the penalty decision. “He’s gone up, his arms are raised – you have to raise your arms to jump. It’s really harsh. That’s happened now and we have to take it. It had a huge impact on the game but it’s football. It can happen.”Nonetheless, Davies was delighted with his side’s performance: “I thought we were the better team, we dominated the match and deserved to win the match, but for the misfortune of a decision.“There was a lot to like. The players, it should give them confidence. We have retained the spirit, fight and determination we showed last season.”A fiercely contested match frequently boiled over into numerous melees involving multiple players from both teams. Footage from one of those immediately after Hirst’s converted penalty seemed to show a Birmingham fan attempt to strike the Ipswich midfielder Jack Taylor.“Jack’s alright,” said McKenna. “Somebody just showed me it. It’s obviously not ideal. The authorities will deal with it.”It is an intoxicating time to be a Birmingham supporter after watching their team set a Football League record for points (111) and wins (34) when romping to the League One title last season. There have been signings aplenty, bullish proclamations and a documentary that their American chair, Tom Wagner, boasted is one of “Amazon Prime’s top performing shows”.View image in fullscreenJay Stansfield rifles home after Kyogo Furuhashi’s chip left Ipswich goalkeeper Alex Palmer stranded to put Birmingham in front.Photograph: Nick Potts/PANo surprise, then, that St Andrew’s was bouncing long before kick-off. If the only trade-off local fans must make for such delirium is the slightly odd sight of a United States flag flying above their home stadium then it is one they will likely stomach happily.It took 55 minutes for the deadlock to be broken, but it seemed inevitable that it would be the hosts to do so, such was their casual dominance of the ball. Kyogo Furuhashi’s chip over the onrushing Alex Palmer rebounded off the far post and straight into the path of Stansfield, who had all the time in the world to rifle the follow-up past the defender Dara O’Shea on the line.Birmingham did not lose a single home league game last season and only one side who fell behind at St Andrew’s departed with a point.It looked for a long time as if Ipswich would not add to that tally, until the Dykes handball. Hirst struck his penalty low and firm down the middle.It was not the only decision that went against Birmingham. The hosts were unlucky not to take the lead after seven minutes, when the former Celtic forward Furuhashi – one of four summer signings in Birmingham’s starting XI – produced a wonderful lob over Palmer, only for the referee, Andrew Kitchen, to rule that he had fouled Jacob Greaves to win the ball. It was a soft decision, to say the least, prompting the home fans to voice their disdain.They would do so again when denied all three points at the death, but there was plenty elsewhere to hearten them.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipBirmingham CityIpswich Townmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Jackson has fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge after the arrivals of Liam Delap and João Pedro, with Eddie Howe’s side believed to be frontrunners to sign the 24-year-old. He is understood to have trained alone on Friday after informing Chelsea that he would like a move away from west London, with Milan having also been linked with the 24-year-old.Chelsea had valued him at £80m but are likely to accept a reduced fee of around £65m as they attempt to reshape their attacking options by signing Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig and Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho.‘No excuses’: Manchester United admit new £50m training hub must spark successRead moreNewcastle are thought to be favourites to sign the player who joined from Villarreal in 2023 for £32m and also want to bring in Brentford’s Yoane Wissa aftermissing out on Benjamin Sesko, who is set to join Manchester United. Wissa was left out of Brentford’s squad for their friendly against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Friday having informed them that he wants to leave, although Newcastle have yet to agree a fee for the DR Congo forward.Howe is keen to reinforce his front line after Callum Wilson left on a free while Alexander Isak is likely to move to Liverpool if Newcastle can agree a fee with the champions.On Thursday, Enzo Maresca said that Jackson, who signed a nine-year contract in September 2024, could leave Chelsea this month. “When the transfer window is open, unfortunately or fortunately, anything can happen,” he said. “This also involves Nico’s situation. At the moment we also had two strikers arrive, João and Liam. So we will see what happens.”Chelsea have opened talks with United over Garnacho having already agreed personal terms with the 21-year-old but it is understood that they are reluctant to pay his £50m valuation.Chelsea are also hopeful of concluding negotiations with Leipzig over Simons, the Netherlands forward who is understood to have agreed personal terms despite interest from Bayern Munich.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not that his absence prevented the night’s subtext being all about the man who was not there.Liverpool should be title favourites but not because of spending, insists SlotRead moreAfterwards Howe admitted he “does not know what the future holds” for Isak after revealing he will continue to train in isolation next week. “We’ve had discussions and it’s clear we can’t involve him in the group at the moment,” said Newcastle’s manager. “I don’t know how long that will last. He is training later than the rest of the squad.“From our perspective we’d like to see him back with the team but the situation has to be right for the team. He’s contracted to us so, of course, there’s a chance he could play for Newcastle again. But I don’t know what the future holds.”Given Newcastle’s continuing struggles to sign a replacement, Howe was asked if he could simply insist that a player who swerved the club’s pre-season tour of Singapore and South Korea should honour his deal but the manager, who said he did not think the board had yet disciplined the 25-year-old, demurred. “It’s not that straightforward,” he said. “We’d have done that if we could but we’re not currently in a position to do that.“The team has, of course, been disrupted by this. But that doesn’t mean we can’t overcome this and come back even stronger.”View image in fullscreenMatt Targett heads Newcastle level against Espanyol in Friday’s friendly at St James’ Park.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAThe sight of more than 20,000 empty seats on Friday night at a customarily full arena will alarm Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian ownership but the sparse crowd was arguably more about Howe saving most of his first XI for Saturday afternoon’s second La Liga friendly against Atlético Madrid than an outright mutiny at an admittedly dismal transfer window before a Champions League campaign.In Isak’s absence, and with his fellow striker Callum Wilson having moved to West Ham, the endearingly enthusiastic but hugely inexperienced Will Osula led the attacking line as Newcastle, with the outstanding Lewis Miley looking like an England central midfielder in the making, were left without a victory in this troubled pre-season.With a decent striker on the pitch they would arguably have won. The only problem is that the entire No 9 species seem to have developed an allergy to Tyneside. Bryan Mbeumo, João Pedro, Liam Delap and Benjamin Sesko rank among those forwards who have turned Newcastle down and the St James’ Park board will not countenance selling Isak to Anfield for a sum well in excess of £110m until two new attacking faces are secured.With the transfer window’s closure fast approaching it is all turning into a race against the clock, not to mention a game of who blinks first. Despiteexcluding Isak from a training ground barbecuelast week in the wake of the striker’s unsanctioned trip to train alone at his old club Real Sociedad, Howe still does not know where the striker who scored 27 goals for him last season will be playing when Liverpool visit on this month’s bank holiday Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would surely be much better to reinvest Liverpool’s fee on some decent new players – the Coventry midfielder Jack Rudoni anyone? – and create a new hero or two.Although a good-humoured, family-dominated crowd of just over 30,000 was not exactly typical of the more vehemently partisan Premier League crew, there is a sense that many Newcastle fans have already loosened the emotional ties that until very recently bound them tightly to Isak. Granted they feel more than a little let down but there is a mood of almost shrugging acceptance that Liverpool have turned his head and they will never again sing their former Abba-pastiche anthem, Gimme, Gimme a Striker from Sweden.Should Yoane Wissa, Ollie Watkins, Nicolas Jackson – (not that Newcastle fans seem overly keen on him) – Jørgen Strand Larsen, Samu Aghehowa, Gonçalo Ramos or any other potential attacking recruits start scoring regularly it will surely be a case of “the king is dead, long live the king”.In any case, Howe already has a Targett on his side. Matt, a veteran full-back, operating on the left of a midfield three, discovered his latent Isak streak as he met Miley’s cross to head Newcastle level after Edu Expósito has expertly half-volleyed Espanyol into the lead. After that Newcastle’s impressive debutant in goal, the Southampton loanee Aaron Ramsdale, saved Javi Puado’s penalty before Murphy’s goal preceded Kike García’s deserved leveller.There is evidently much work to be done on Tyneside before next weekend’s Premier League opener at Aston Villa. “The balance of our squad isn’t quite right,” said Howe. “But I’m hopeful we can adjust that in the next couple of weeks.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweTransfer windowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Crystal Palace manager admitted he was still smarting from losing twice in a row against his daughter Alina at Connect 4 after the team’s recent tour to his native Austria, where they prepared for the game against Liverpool. “I was really upset, really,” Glasner said. “This, I think, is just a mindset you have and this is what we try to create always: have the confidence that you can win it and give your best.”Ethan Nwaneri targets bigger role with Arsenal after signing long-term dealRead moreInstilling that kind of belief into the players has been credited by the Palace chair, Steve Parish, with inspiringGlasner’s side to beat Manchester Cityin May. The Cup triumph was the south London club’s first major trophy and was meant to act as a springboard for further success, especially as Parish had promised after the semi-final victory over Aston Villa that they would not repeat “some of the mistakes” of last summer, when four players were signed on deadline day and Palace had to wait until their ninth Premier League game for a win. “It’s not how you wished a transfer window would work,” was Glasner’s withering assessment last October.But Palace’s planning has been severely disrupted by the uncertainty surrounding which European competition they will play in. Parish spent most of Friday at the court of arbitration for sport in Switzerland as the club attempt to have their demotion from the Europa League to the Conference League overturned. Glasner again revealed his frustration during the Austria tour, saying he had been “promised that we would be more active and bring in the new players earlier this year”.He attempted to downplay those comments on Friday and predicted that Palace would be in much better shape than at the start of last season. Glasner also straight-batted questions about the futures of Eberechi Eze and Marc Guéhi, both linked with moves away. He was never afraid to speak his mind about squad investment during spells in charge of Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt, and his reluctance to discuss extending a contract that, like Guéhi’s, expires next summer is another major headache for Parish to deal with.View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace were hoping they could use their FA Cup triumph as a springboard for more success but have been bogged down in arguments over their European place.Photograph: Getty Images/Sportsphoto/Allstar“This contract is not important at the moment,” Glasner said. Asked whether what happens before the end of August could affect whether he wants to resume talks, he replied cryptically: “We will see.”At Wolfsburg Glasner was set on a collision course with the sporting director Jörg Schmadtke – who spent a year at Liverpool in the same role – when, in November 2020, he publicly criticised the failure to bring in enough attacking reinforcements after qualifying for the Europa League. Glasner remained in charge until the end of the season despite a rocky relationship with Schmadtke and guided Wolfsburg to fourth in the Bundesliga before leaving to join Eintracht.He voiced similar concerns after leading them to victory in the Europa League and agreed to depart at the end of the 2022-23 season despite reaching the German Cup final and the knockout stages of the Champions League.With only the backup goalkeeper Walter Benítez and Croatia defender Borna Sosa, who will compete with Tyrick Mitchell to start at left wing-back, added this summer, time is of the essence for Palace once they discover their fate at Cas on Monday. Signing a forward is a priority, having been beaten by Aston Villa to Ivory Coast striker Evann Guessand and with Eddie Nketiah likely sidelined for two months with a hamstring injury. Glasner would also like more defensive cover, with Chadi Riad expected to be out until at least October as the Morocco international recovers from a knee injury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If somebody thinks that’s nonsense, OK, let’s see. That’s it. I didn’t say: ‘Hey, sign three players, because then Oliver Glasner is happy.’ I will go home and be happy today. Everything’s fine. If Crystal Palace want to make the next step and be better than last year, then it’s my advice. Let’s sign at least two players that can achieve this.”Palace are hopeful their appeal to Cas will be successful and Glasner acknowledged it had been difficult to accept Uefa’s decision at a club who have never played in a major European competition and will contest their first Community Shield tomorrow.“If we have to play in the Conference League it feels like we are punished but being innocent,” he said. “On the other side if we had ended the season in position seven and go straight into the Conference League we all would have celebrated.

Leaks have become not only common but expected, by clubs, journalists and agents. So whenPortounveiled Luuk de Jong, it stunned the football world. Not even employees and teammates knew until moments before his presentation at a friendly against Atlético Madrid. So how did they pull it off?What unfolded was a story with the intrigue of a spy thriller. The striker was the last to board the plane he took from the Netherlands to Porto last Sunday and timed his arrival on matchday to avoid crossing paths with anyone. Upon landing, he was the first off the plane and ushered into a van with tinted windows that drove him to the stadium. His entourage – anonymous to fans – collected his luggage.Darwin Núñez expected to join Al-Hilal after Liverpool agree £46.3m feeRead moreIn the van the club’s social media team were secretly gathering footage. “It’s quite strange,” De Jong told them. “In these times, with so much social media, to keep something like this a secret … It’s going to be a big surprise. Let’s hope we can keep it quiet until the presentation.”The real challenge was yet to come: the medical. To avoid raising suspicion, Porto had registered De Jong in the clinic’s system as a handball player. The doctors and nurses had no idea they were assessing a high-profile football transfer.Once the examinations were done, De Jong took a service lift from the clinic’s garage to the Estádio do Dragão’s first floor. There, he had a meal and waited. From a window, he watched his soon-to-be teammates arrive and saw them greeted by cheering fans, high fives exchanged and autographs signed. For three to four hours regular checks for leaks were made on social media among those in the know.As kick-off approached, it was finally time to introduce De Jong to the team. The head coach, Francesco Farioli, gathered the squad in the dressing room and shocked them by walking in with the former Barcelona and Netherlands striker. After a short speech from Farioli, De Jong said hello to each player in turn. He will compete with Samu Aghehowa and Deniz Gül to lead the attack.It was with shock and disbelief that the 49,000 fans in attendance greeted De Jong, who scored 18 goals and provided 13 assists for PSV last season before his contract expired. The stadium announcer had been calling the players out one by one and before introducing the captain, the last to be summoned, he teased a surprise signing, listing his previous clubs.Then came the reveal: “And now, our new No 26, Luuk de Jong” – the cue for the 6ft 2in centre-forward to walk on to the pitch. Club journalists broadcasting the presentation had to look up his name to check his stats, caught out like everyone else. The plan was a success.View image in fullscreenLuuk de Jong celebrates scoring for PSV Eindhoven in May 2025, in one of his last games for the club.Photograph: Robin van Lonkhuijsen/EPA“I have to give credit to what Porto did with Luuk de Jong because there are always a lot of people involved,” says Pedro Mendes, the former Porto, Spurs and Portugal midfielder turned agent for MNM Sports Management. “When negotiations are being done for a player, you have the agents, the buying club, [often] a selling club, even the player’s family. The footballer can ask for friends’ or relatives’ opinions. Even inside the club, you have the scouting department, the financial director.

He strives to keep deals under wraps but, in the age of social media, that has become nearly impossible. “At the airport, there is a system in place to see who goes in or out,” he says. “When I was a player, that didn’t exist. From our end, we try to keep everything private.”In the 80s and 90s, Porto had a tradition of unveiling a surprise signing at what they term their presentation friendly. Back then keeping a secret was relatively easy — you just had to keep the newspapers at bay. The president, André Villas-Boas, wanted to revive that tradition, rekindling a childhood memory and offering fans an unforgettable moment.“The president told me he remembered that, when he was a kid, the presentation day always came with a surprise,” De Jong said. “A player they didn’t know just walking out of the tunnel. He told me it would be amazing if we were able to achieve this today, especially with social media, travelling and airports. I told him we could give it a try.”Farioli, who coached Ajax last season, led the negotiations with De Jong. The 34-year-old was convinced by the project and signed a one-year deal with an option to extend for another season. The process between the initial talks and the signing took about a week. Only Villas-Boas and a handful of Porto’s top directors knew and, for a fleeting moment, football returned to a bygone era.Explore more on these topicsPortoTransfer windowPSV EindhovenEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Coll still saved efforts from Beth Mead – after a retake – and Leah Williamson during the shootout, which England won 3-1.“The Spanish keeper had it on her bottle,” Hampton told TalkSport. “So I thought when she was going in goal I’ll just pick it up and throw it into the English fans so she can’t have it.”The Chelsea player added: “I never put it on a bottle because anyone can do that, so that is why I put it on my arm, and the TV caught that. It wasn’t hard – when she has gone in the goal it [the bottle] is on its own, isn’t it? It is in a towel, you just pick it up.“Mine is blank, but it has the same sponsors and stuff so I just put mine in there, chucked her one into the fans and she had an empty bottle. She was looking for where it is. She was walking back and I was walking the other way. She was so confused. I was trying so hard not to burst out laughing [because] I was like: ‘Oh, I don’t know where it has gone’ … but you have got to do something haven’t you?”England also came through adramatic penalty shootout win over Swedenen route to Euros glory, in which both sides failed to convert spot-kicks at crucial moments. Hampton described that shootout as “traumatic” and “horrendous”.She said: “Before the games we as a keeper group have meetings and we analyse every penalty that each individual from the opposing team has had. I think Alexia [Putellas] had 46 penalties we had to sit there and watch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That may be a legacy of the 13 consecutive seasons Fulham spent in the division until 2014, and this being Marco Silva’s fifth season at Craven Cottage. The club are a known quantity, receiving rather less than the respect due to Silva and his players. Since promotion in 2022, only Brentford and Nottingham Forest have emulated Fulham in beating the drop to create a continuingPremier Leaguelegacy.Fulham don’t give off the same ultra-modern ”model club” vibes as those others despite often playing highly attractive football. There was disappointment last season that European football has not returned to the Cottage. Silva’s team had an unhappy habit of squandering promising positions, amid some wild inconsistency.Beating Liverpool 3-2on 6 April was a keynote performance for Silva’s style of play, taking the game to the eventual champions, playing muscular, high-risk football. On 10 May, despite taking the lead, a 3-1 loss to an inferior Everton team ended dreams of even the Conference League.That Everton loss coincided with a launch day for the Riverside Stand, a £350m project designed to future-proof the club by bringing non-matchday revenue into the coffers as a haute cuisine membership establishmentserving up the luxury lounge lifeon the banks of the Thames. For less-well-heeled fans who wonder why the club have been thus far inactive in the summer transfer market and rail against some eye-watering prices being charged for Craven Cottage tickets, the Riverside development’s architectural focus facing away from the pitch may become symbolic. The hope among fans is that the owners don’t try to tread water. So many have taken that gamble and lost.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerSilva has been a prime asset toFulham, proven in regenerating fallen talent, Alex Iwobi a prime example. Cottagers fans are treated to some fine, attacking football but, entering the final year of his contract, how committed should Silva remain? Beyond a reserve goalkeeper, he welcomed nobody fresh to summer training in Portugal. “Unfortunately, we don’t have players to adapt for our group … we usually use this time for new signings to adapt,” said Silva. He was also quoted thus: “In the short term, I’m looking at Fulham and then we’ll see what happens next season.” That suggests ambitions will need to be matched to retain him.View image in fullscreenThe view from the top of the new Riverside Stand, part of a £350m project designed to future-proof the club by bringing non-matchday revenue into the coffers.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianOff-field pictureTo complete the Riverside Stand, the owner Shahid Khan’s vision overran significantly in timing and finances. It will take time to feel the benefit. The Khan family’s ownership has so far come at their significant loss, an estimated £417m since 2013, averaging £38m a year. Relegation would be disastrous, as Khan has admitted when twice suffering that fate. Described by Forbes as the “face of the American dream”, Shahid has an extensive portfolio of sports and business interests, as does his son Tony; the director of football operations is also supremo of All Elite Wrestling. How focused on Fulham they remain is being queried.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 34-year-old Parisian is best known as a former Monaco goalkeeper and for the season he spent on loan at Atlético Madrid, where he did not play a minute as Jan Oblak retained the gloves. “His arrival will further strengthen the team and add depth to Marco’s squad,” said Tony Khan on Lecomte’s unveiling, words that drip with deep irony as fans wait – increasingly impatiently – for someone, anyone, else to arrive.Stepping upJoshua King, not to be confused with the Norwegian forward of the same name, is a teenage, playmaking midfielder who featured eight times last season in the Premier League. A four-year contract in July confirmed Fulham’s faith, and fans hope he does not follow the path of other graduates from a highly regarded academy. Jay Stansfield, Fábio Carvalho, Patrick Roberts and Ryan Sessegnon, the last of them now returned, were lost talents who never got to flower. Silva usually prefers his senior pros hard-bitten but said last season of King: “A top talent we have on our hands that we have to keep giving these experiences to.”A big season for …Last season’s club-record addition, Emile Smith Rowe, has plenty to prove after an unconvincing first campaign. Silva’s reign has been notable for its lack of transfer duds but the former “Croydon De Bruyne”, as he was hailed at Arsenal, failed to impose himself. That came as Iwobi and Andreas Pereira were Silva’s most favoured attacking midfielders. Behind them, Sasa Lukic and Sander Berge offered height and muscle to central areas. Six goals and three assists was not a disastrous return for Smith Rowe but a player of undoubted talent was too often on the periphery. At 25, he remains ripe for the restorative powers with which Silva has revived a number of the squad.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Premier LeagueFulhamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s obviously touching on the Ashes and Australia so it makes it tricky. From a rehab point of view you can probably get it strong again within eight weeks. So that could be an option, but again obviously still waiting to get the full report on it.”Woakes is the most experienced member of England’s bowling unit after the retirement of Stuart Broad two summers ago and the decision to move on from record wicket-taker James Anderson in 2024.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamCricketThe AshesnewsShareReuse this content"

I want to help us win as much as possible and bring happiness and glory to the club. This is where I feel at home. I think I’ve actually become more direct over the past few years and I’ve added more goals, so I’m excited for what will come next.”Along with Myles Lewis-Skelly, who also signed a new long-term Arsenal contract this summer after breaking into the first team and ­making his senior England debut last season, Nwaneri is regarded as one of the best young prospects to have emerged from Arsenal’s Hale End academy in recent years.Max Dowman has been tipped to follow in their footsteps and the 15-year-old was praised by Mikel Arteta afterArsenal’s 3-2 defeatby Villarreal in a pre-season friendly on Wednesday, when Nwaneri started in midfield.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The start of competition in Mason, Ohio also marked her first day of training withher new coach Francisco Roig. She was determined to make the most of it.Having already trained in the afternoon, Raducanu and Roig spent the evening working quietly through each shot in her game. Alongside ample technical conversations about her groundstrokes and second serve, there was also plenty of laughter as the pair began the task of learning more about each other and how their personalities match. Only a furious evening downpour forced them off the court.Emma Raducanu: ‘I hope Francisco Roig can help me beat the top players’Read moreWhile many ofRaducanu’s numerous coaching changeshave come during difficult moments in her career, this is rather a hopeful occasion. This tournament is something of a milestone for Raducanu, who has earned a seeding of No 30 in a reflection of the consistent training and match wins that have allowed her to rebuild her ranking over the past few months. Now No 27 in the WTA Race with few points to defend until the end of the year, she has a great opportunity to finish even higher and make an impression at the US Open later this month.As she has built confidence in her game, Raducanu has performed well against mid-ranked players, but it is also clear the current iteration of her game has a ceiling. She has consistently looked underpowered against the biggest shotmakers and she is not quite quick enough to frustrate them with her defensive capabilities. After following up hersemi-final run in Washingtonwith two wins in Montreal, this was further reinforced by her 6-2, 6-1defeat against the recent Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimovain the third round last week. The challenge for Raducanu and Roig over the coming months will be to see how she can use her abilities to test the best players in the world.Her tournament will begin on Saturday afternoon with a tough match against Olga Danilovic of Serbia, who scuppered a potential all-British second-round match by defeating a struggling Katie Boulter 6-0, 7-5 on Thursday. Should Raducanu win, she could face the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, in the third round on Monday.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu and her new coach Francisco Roig appear to have been practising well together but will have to establish their working relationship.Photograph: Frey/TPN/Getty ImagesWith so many top players opting out of the first weeks of the US hard-court swing, Cincinnati marks a significant moment in the buildup to the US Open as many of the main contenders attempt to build their form for the final grand slam tournament of the year. While Sabalenka is competing for the first time since a brief mid-season break, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will also return to competition for the first timesince their Wimbledon finallast month.After 18-year-old Victoria Mboko’s incredible triumph in Torontoon Thursday night, she and the beaten finalist, Naomi Osaka, have already withdrawn from Cincinnati.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s especially the case on Bluesky, the young Twitter alternative popular in Gaza.Bluesky has deactivated nearly all of Al-Batsh’s accounts after just a few days, she said. The longest she has been able to hold on to one is 12 days.When the social network marks one account as spam, she creates another one, hoping to reassure potential donors that she is not a bot.View image in fullscreenA view of northern Gaza from a Jordanian aid plane on 5 August 2025.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianThe shutdowns, therefore, ironically force her to resort to exactly the behavior that Bluesky, in its effort to combat bots and scams, is seeking to root out: batch following and then repeatedly tagging the same people who engaged with their previous accounts.Al-Batsh no longer tags people in every post after a stern email from Bluesky, hoping to abide by the platform’s rules. “But now no one can find my posts,” she said.In other words, in an act of desperation, these Palestinians often do operate like bots. With every fresh account, it becomes harder for people like Al-Batsh to shake the accusation. Low follower counts and posts that repeatedly tag others en masse are often tell-tale signs of a bot.Recently, though, a grassroots answer to the problem has emerged. Since May, new Bluesky accounts Al-Batsh has made have something new: all her posts end with a green checkmark emoji and the phrase: “Verified by Molly Shah,” a reference to a Germany-based lawyer-turned-activist who has been independently verifying Gaza crowdfunding campaigns.There are a handful of other volunteers doing the same work on Bluesky. And similar efforts exist on other social media platforms. Some are even run by entire teams of volunteers: there’s GazaFunds and Radio Watermelon on X and Instagram, and Gaza Vetters on Tumblr.Still, Shah said, she wished there was a better system in place. “This centers me too much,” she said.A guerrilla verification networkShah has been on Bluesky since the early days of the relatively young platform’s life, when she had only about 7,000 followers and knew of only one or two people from Gaza with a Bluesky account, including one person named Jamal.That’s how her verification project started: she had encouraged Jamal, a friend of a friend, to open a Bluesky account and shared his posts on her own profile, hoping to bring attention to his crowdfunding campaign in early 2024. It worked. Jamal raised $10,000.View image in fullscreenPalestinians flock to the Zikim crossing to acquire limited flour and basic food aid as the famine worsens with the ongoing Israeli blockade in North Gaza,  on 7 August 2025.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/Anadolu via Getty ImagesShah’s verification project snowballed as more people in Gaza joined the social network. Many reached out to her, hoping she’d share their campaigns with her now 57,000 followers. She began asking for information about the individuals or families in the campaigns before sharing them, and that’s how her guerrilla authentication network got its start.Today, Shah has a spreadsheet of more than 300 accounts she’s vetted and verified. They use the same badge of authentication as Al-Batsh, “verified by Molly Shah”, in their posts and profile pages. The stamp doesn’t always prevent a Bluesky account from being flagged as spam by the company’s systems, but her hope is that it will help other people on Bluesky confirm that the person behind the account is genuine.“The verification seems to help people recognize that they’re real people,” Shah said. “I just want people to get to know Palestinians. To me, I don’t think of it as fundraising as the main goal, though I’m happy to help them do that. I think of it as [combatting] the persistent and insistent dehumanization of Palestinians.”‘Everything we do is under siege’: small fundraisers try to provide lifeline in GazaRead moreThe vetting process isn’t standard, Shah said, and can include doing a video call, having someone Shah has already vetted or knows personally to vouch or viewing documentation that proves their identity and shows that they’re still in Gaza. All of this takes time. Al-Batsh said she waited two months before she heard back from Shah. Occasionally, Shah will come across a person pretending to be in Gaza or misrepresenting their situation in other ways. For the most part, the people who reach out to her are in fact real people in Gaza in need of help.Stopping devastating scamsGaza has reached catastrophic levels of famine, according to aid and human rights organizations, which raises the stakes of each fundraising campaign and even each post on Bluesky. Duaa Al-Madhoun, another mother in Gaza trying tofeed her three children, said she, too, has had dozens of her Bluesky accounts deleted. Buying flour, milk and diapers cost her $100 a day when those items are available. Lately, diapers and milk have been harder to find, she said, and she’ll go some days without eating so that she can feed her children.“My child wears nylon bags, no diapers. He suffers from diaper rash,” Al-Madhoun said. “Food is scarce and very expensive. If food is available, I just eat some rice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In one case, Calhoun said, a family they are in touch with in Mawasi, Khan Younis, reached out to them about an older woman in their town who had not eaten for several days. They were able to raise $110 to buy her flour and transferred the money to her the next day.“It can be instantaneous,” Calhoun said. “I don’t think people realize that your help can make an impact in a day.”To receive the money collected through fundraisers, Palestinians need to work with a “receiver”, someone outside of Gaza who sets up the campaign and collects the money on their behalf and wires the money through their banks. That’s because the platforms use payment processors that do not operate in Gaza.The system has meant that Palestinians have been required to place a great deal of trust in these middle actors, who are people they’ve never met.It also means the campaigns, and the Palestinians relying on them, are vulnerable to scams.View image in fullscreenAmira Muteir holds the hand of her five-month-old baby Ammar, whom she says is wasting away from malnutrition, in Gaza City, on 5 August 2025.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersCalhoun and Shah say many of the scams they do see exploit and victimize Palestinians.Al-Batsh’s first campaign was hosted on GoFundMe by a woman who listed her location as Tucson, Arizona. The campaign raised nearly $37,000. Al-Batsh received about $34,000 before the campaign host told Al-Batsh that she had trouble logging into the campaign. “I never received the rest of the money,” Al-Batsh said.“It breaks my brain to think about,” Calhoun said. “It’s frustrating because the people in Gaza can’t make their own fundraisers. They’re at the whims of somebody else and they have to trust somebody to do good by them.”Requesting changes from BlueskyA spam label on Bluesky is enough to deter donations. Ad hoc verification systems like Shah’s provide some level of guarantee that the money people are donating will actually help someone in Gaza rather than a bot farm or scammer.When Shah shares a campaign, it makes a difference. Al-Batsh’s campaign has received 10 donations ranging from $5 to $505 in the two days since Shah shared her post. Before that, she was averaging two to three donations a day, if that.Though her verification network has helped some Palestinians maintain their online lifelines, Shah says it’s not a sustainable system. She is overwhelmed with requests and had to decide to share only one account a day.In the meantime, thousands of Bluesky users have signed open letters and made public pleas asking the company to improve its moderation practices.“We understand that some Gazans post in a way that may trigger some of Bluesky’s internal automated spam rules when posting fundraising links,” one of theopen letters, with 7,000 signatures, reads. “However, treating a group of extremely vulnerable people the same way that the platform treats t-shirt bots and phishers is not only incredibly cruel, it has also exacerbated the situation of desperate people just attempting to survive.”View image in fullscreenIsraeli activists in Tel Aviv protest against Israel’s bombing, starving and displacement of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.Photograph: Ariel Schalit/APBlueskysaidin response to the open letter that the company was “committed to ensuring” people in Gaza “can be heard” on the platform. However, it continued, some of the behaviors of these accounts violated community guidelines, and it encouraged users to “focus their efforts through authentic accounts”.Bluesky did not respond to a request for comment.“We can’t get every moderation decision right, which is why we maintain an appeals process,” the post continued. Shah and others connected with people in Gaza say few people get a response from the company when they file an appeal. It remains difficult for Palestinians to maintain their accounts for more than a few days.Bluesky had an opportunity to improve its moderation system in the early days of the war in Gaza, when there were fewer people on the platform, Shah said. She wishes they had taken it.“It sounds like Bluesky is saying: ‘We’re getting rid of spammers,’ but really what they’re getting rid of are people who are desperate,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyBlueskyGazaPalestinian territoriesCrowdfundingCrowdsourcingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, recorded fatigue levels had a very slight association with the smartwatch data, while sleep had a stronger correlation.Eiko Fried, an author of the study, said the correlation between the smartwatch and self-reported stress scores was “basically zero”.He added: “This is no surprise to us given that the watch measures heart rate and heart rate doesn’t have that much to do with the emotion you’re experiencing – it also goes up for sexual arousal or joyful experiences.”He noted that his Garmin had previously told him he was stressed when he was working out in the gym and when excitedly talking to a friend he had not seen for a while at a wedding.“The findings raise important questions about what wearable data can or can’t tell us about mental states,” said Fried. “Be careful and don’t live by your smartwatch – these are consumer devices, not medical devices.”Fried said although there was a lot of academic work looking for physiological signals that can act as proxies for emotional states, most were not precise enough. This is because there is an overlap between positive and negative feelings – for example, hair standing on end can signal anxiety as well as excitement.Fried, an associate professor in the department of clinical psychology at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and his team tracked stress, fatigue and sleep for three months on 800 young adults wearing Garmin vivosmart 4 watches. They asked them to report four times a day on how stressed, fatigued or sleepy users were feeling before cross-referencing the data.And the results,publishedin the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, found that none of the participants saw the stress scores on their watches meet the baseline for significant change when they recorded feeling stressed. And for a quarter of participants, their smartwatch told them they were stressed or unstressed when they self-reported feeling the opposite.The relationship with physical fatigue, described by Garmin as “body battery”, was “quite a bit stronger than for stress but overall quite weak” said Fried. Garmin does not disclose the calculations it uses to work out the body battery score, though he suspected it was a combination of a pulse measurement and activity levels.The relationship with sleep was stronger again, though Fried noted it measured sleep duration and told us little about how well rested someone was, other than the fact there tended to be a relationship between how long you slept and how well rested you felt.There was a significant association between the Garmin and self-reported data for two-thirds of the sample for sleep. The researchers noted that in nearly all cases, if participants went from one day of self-reporting bad sleep quality, to another day with a good score, they could predict an increase in sleep duration on the Garmin of around two hours. “This is a really noticeable effect,” they said.AI chatbots are becoming popular alternatives to therapy. But they may worsen mental health crises, experts warnRead moreThe research is intended to feed into an early warning system for depression, in which wearable tech users receive data that will help them receive preventive treatments before an episode begins.So far, there are promising signs that lower activity levels could be a predictor, though Fried has been unable to identify whether this is because of exercise’s protective effect against depression or because people feel less energetic as their mental state deteriorates.“Wearable data can offer valuable insights into people’s emotions and experiences, but it’s crucial to understand its potential and limitations,” said Margarita Panayiotou, a researcher at the University of Manchester, after reading the study.“This research helps clarify what such data can reliably reveal and makes an important contribution to ongoing discussions about the role of technology in understanding wellbeing. It’s important to remember that wearable data does not necessarily represent objective truth and should be interpreted alongside broader context, including individuals’ perceptions and lived experiences.”Garmin has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSmartwatchesHealthShareReuse this content"

The broadcaster and author saw the views ticking up on YouTube; his phone was pinging incessantly. But the realisation that things had become, well, really quite surreal came when an older gentleman approached him at an event in Washington and, in Urdu, said: “I watched you with the 20 crazies.”The man was referring to the British-American commentator’s appearance onSurrounded, a gladiatorial one-v-many debate web series, hosted on YouTube by Jubilee Media. During the debate – billed as “1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives” – Hasan was asked about his “ethnic background”, by a man who the Guardian unmaskedas the organiser of two violent far-right protests. Another debater laughed maniacally to applause while agreeing he was a fascist. He was later sacked and condemned – and then raised $30,000 (£22,300) from supporters on a Christian crowdfunding site. The video has now been viewed more than 10m times.“I saw the massive audience it gets with young people. I thought, well, that’s a good place to be,” says Hasan, who launched Zeteo, his own alternative news platform, last year. “But it’s really cut through in a way even I didn’t imagine – it’s been phenomenal for both good reasons and bad.”Mehdi Hasan: ‘Most people ask the question and move on. I don’t’Read moreHasan’s near two-hour debate – diced, sliced and repackaged for infinite resharing – has propelled Jubilee Media into the mainstream consciousness, sparking conversations about the political and societal impact of new media formats, and plenty of existential angst.Launched in 2017, the rapidly expanding entertainment company has attracted swathes of younger viewers by transforming polarised debate – never in short supply in Trump’s US – into eminently clippable content. The company also produces dating and game shows, but Surrounded – which pits one expert against a greater number of adversaries, who race to a single chair to make their point on a hot political topic – is its most notorious.In recent months Surrounded has gone where few traditional broadcasters would care to tread, with titles including “Flat Earthers vs Scientists: Can We Trust Science?” (31m views), or “Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative? (Feat. Charlie Kirk)” (30m views). Its 2024video with Ben Shapiro– in which a trans man tore into the rightwing pundit in afour-minute rant– was the fifth most-watched election-related content on YouTube.Jubilee’ s 1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives (ft. Mehdi Hasan)Its founder and chief executive, Jason Y Lee, who started Jubilee as a non-profit in 2010 after a video of himbusking for charity went viral, toldVarietythat the company wants “to show what discourse can and should look like”. It could become, he argued, the “Disney for empathy”. But how does its performative pugilism sit with its stated aim to “provoke understanding and create human connection”?Spencer Kornhaber, who writes about popular culture for the Atlantic, believes the idealism is genuine, if shot through with ambition. “Empathy, in the Jubilee context, is standing for voyeurism and curiosity about other human beings,” says Kornhaber. “Lee didn’t say he wants to be the new UN. He wants to be Disney – a for-profit entertainment company that is culturally ubiquitous, will merchandise anything and is known for its ability to spin out franchises.”Jubilee has benefited from the proliferation of free-speech absolutism, as well as the internet’s shift to social and video, says Julia Alexander, a media correspondent for Puck News. But while it may have started with the aim of transforming negative conversations, it has, she claims, “succumbed to the hateful vitriol that defines a lot of social media”. It never stood a chance against the “unspoken but understood currency of the internet”, she adds: namely, that rage-fuelled and fearful content provokes more engagement than empathy or actually listening.“I hope that they choose to focus on creating positive content for the internet, God knows we can use it,” she says. “But I worry, because they are a company that is incentivised to continuously scale and perform better each quarter. They’ll have no choice but to continue doing more of these types of videos and just get more extreme.”Mehdi Hasan on how to beat Donald Trump in a debate - podcastRead moreHasan, who is alsoa Guardian contributor, says he understands viewers’ attraction to the more extreme videos Jubilee has produced. He is the author of Win Every Argument, a book about the art of debating, and argues that traditional media deserted the battlefield, allowing platforms such as YouTube – nowthe No 1 source of televised entertainment in the US– to commandeer the space.“Mainstream media did such a shit job of facilitating debate and discussion and [giving a platform to] people with unorthodox views,” he says. “But I do think it’s a balancing act between the two extremes. Between censorship and narrowing of opinion and no standards at all, no guardrails, just put out anything you like on YouTube as long as it gets clicks.”He also understands – even agrees with – some of the criticism he has faced for going on Surrounded. The writer and disability rights advocate Imani Barbarin argued that while clips of Hasan’s takedown of far-right extremists had been shared by progressives trumpeting his “win”, an equal number had been shared as proof he lost. “We live in a meme-ified culture of politics,” said Barbarin,in a post on X. “Those moments are quite literally being plucked out of space and time […] the surrounding context of that moment no longer matters.”Hasan says if he has regrets, it was that he did not find out more about the people he was facing, arguing that he was not aware such extremists would be among them. But whether he regrets taking part overall? The jury is out.“I stand by what I said. I think I did a fair enough job as a debater,” he says. “The bigger meta question is whether the format itself is a problem. Is there value in doing these debates? And I don’t know the answer to that: maybe ask me in five years.”Explore more on these topicsYouTubeTelevision industryInternetThe far rightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it can also facilitate exploitation of very human needsFri 8 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 04.48 EDTShareJoaquin Oliver was 17 years old when he was shot in the hallway of his high school. An older teenager, expelled some months previously, had opened fire with a high-powered rifle on Valentine’s Day in what becameAmerica’s deadliest high school shooting. Seven years on, Joaquin says he thinks it’s important to talk about what happened on that day in Parkland, Florida, “so that we can create a safer future for everyone”.But sadly, what happened to Joaquin that day is that he died. The oddly metallic voice speaking to the ex-CNN journalist Jim Acostain an interviewon Substack this week was actually that of a digital ghost: an AI, trained on the teenager’s old social media posts at the request of his parents, who are using it tobolster their campaignfor tougher gun controls. Like many bereaved families, they have told their child’s story over and over again to heartbreakingly little avail. No wonder they’re pulling desperately at every possible lever now, wondering what it takes to get dead children heard in Washington.But they also wanted, his father, Manuel, admits, simply to hear their son’s voice again. His wife, Patricia,spends hoursasking the AI questions, listening to him saying: “I love you, Mommy.”No parent in their right mind would ever judge a bereaved one. If it’s a comfort to keep the lost child’s bedroom as a shrine, talk to their gravestone, sleep with a T-shirt that still faintly smells like them, then that’s no business of anyone else’s. People hold on to what they can. After 9/11, families listened until the tapes physically ran out to answerphone messages left by loved ones, calling home to say goodbye from burning towers and hijacked planes. I have a friend who still regularly re-reads old WhatsApp exchanges with her late sister, and another who occasionally texts her late father’s number with snippets of family news: she knows he isn’t there, of course, but isn’t quite ready to end the conversation yet. Some people even pay psychics to commune, in suspiciously vague platitudes, with the dead. But it’s precisely because it’s so hard to let go that grief is vulnerable to exploitation. And there may soon be big business in digitally bringing back the dead.As with the mawkishAI-generated videoRod Stewartplayed on stage this week, featuring the late Ozzy Osbourne greeting various dead music legends, that might mean little more than glorified memes. Or it might be for a temporary purpose, such as the AI avatarrecently createdby the family of a shooting victim in Arizona to address the judge at the gunman’s sentencing. But in time, it may be something more profoundly challenging to ideas of selfhood and mortality. What if it were possible to create a permanent AI replica of someone who had died, perhaps in robot form, and carry on the conversation with them for ever?View image in fullscreenAn AI image of Ozzy Osbourne and Tina Turner shown at a Rod Stewart concert in the US, August 2025.Photograph: Iamsloanesteel InstagramResurrection is a godlike power, not for surrendering lightly to some tech bro with a messiah complex. But while the legal rights of the living not to have their identities stolen for use in AI deepfakes arebecoming more established, the rights of the dead are muddled.Reputation dies with us – the dead can’t be libelled – while DNA isposthumously protected. (The 1996birth of Dolly the sheep, a genetic clone copied from a single cell, triggered globalbans on human cloning.) The law governs the respectful disposal of human tissue, but it’s not bodies that AI will be trained on: it’s the private voicenotes and messages and pictures of what mattered to a person. When my father died, personally I never felt he was really in the coffin. He was so much more obviously to be found in the boxes of his old letters, the garden he planted, the recordings of his voice. But everyone grieves differently. What happens if half of a family wants Mum digitally resurrected, and the other half doesn’t want to live with ghosts?That the Joaquin Oliver AI can never grow up – that he will be for ever 17, trapped in the amber of his teenage social media persona – is ultimately his killer’s fault, not his family’s. Manuel Oliver says he knows full well the avatar isn’t really his son, and he isn’t trying to bring him back. To him, it seems more a natural extension of the way the family’s campaign already evokes Joaquin’s life story. Yet there’s something unsettling about the plan to give his AI access to a social media account, to upload videos and gain followers. What if it begins hallucinating, or veering on to topics where it can’t possibly know what the real Joaquin would have thought?While for now there’s a telltale glitchiness about AI avatars, as technology improves it may become increasingly hard to distinguish them from real humans online. Perhaps it won’t be long before companies or even government agencies already using chatbots to deal with customer inquiries start wondering if they could deploy PR avatars to answer journalists’ questions. Acosta, aformer White House correspondent, should arguably have known better than to muddy the already filthy waters in a post-truth world by agreeing to interview someone who doesn’t technically exist. But for now, perhaps the most obvious risk is of conspiracy theorists citing this interview as “proof” that any story challenging to their beliefs could be a hoax, the same deranged liefamously peddledby Infowars host Alex Jones about the Sandy Hook school shootings.The professional challenges involved here, however, are not just for journalists. As AI evolves, we will all increasingly be living with synthetic versions of ourselves. It won’t just be the relatively primitive Alexa in your kitchen or chatbot in your laptop – though already there are stories of peopleanthropomorphisingAI or evenfalling in lovewith ChatGPT – but something much more finely attuned to human emotions. When one in 10 British adults tell researchers they haveno close friends, of course there will be a market for AI companions, just as there is today for getting a cat or scrolling through strangers’ lives on TikTok.Perhaps, as a society, we will ultimately decide we’re comfortable with technology meeting people’s needs when other humans sadly have not. But there’s a big difference between conjuring up a generic comforting presence for the lonely and waking the dead to order, one lost loved one at a time. There is a time to be born and a time to die, according to the verse so often read at funerals.

But surely no one has thought of putting Silent Hill and Fifa 98 together before now.Billed as “the world’s first online survival horror football game,” Fear FA 98 (pronounced Fear-fa, like Fifa) has you pulling out knives, rusty scissors and syringes, summoning demons and using decapitated heads as the ball, in moves that make the likes of Diego “handball” Maradona and Luis “bitey” Suárez look like angelic stalwarts of the Fifa fair play guide.View image in fullscreenThe bowels of the world churn with insatiable horror … Fear FA 98.Photograph: Celery Emblem/Jacob Jazz“People say this is just football with blood, but there’s a lot more to it than that,” says 55-year-old solo developer Jacob Jazz. “I’m mixing survival horror games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil with the gameplay of Fifa and eFootball Winning Eleven [Pro Evolution Soccer in the UK]. You need to play football to keep progressing in the story mode of a classic survival horror game.”The plot goes like this: Earth’s core has become a nest of colossal twisted serpents due to an event called the Transmigration, which saw an invasion of monsters from a dark and forbidden civilisation. Now, the bowels of the world churn with insatiable horror – like the terraces at Old Trafford come the Manchester derby. There’s an array of modes – one player, third-person horror, story, competitive and online – and whichever you go for, you’ll want to arm your team with serial killers, sectarians and psychopathic nurses to play at stadiums including the Backrooms, Sematary Hill and Chainsaws United. A quiet kickabout down the park this most certainly isn’t.Fear FA 98 has taken a year to develop and a successful Kickstarter campaign has now reached its €5,000 (£4,300) goal for a hopeful Halloween 2025 release on Steam. Switch, Xbox and PS5 ports may follow if Jazz can raise substantially more investment. A stand-alone tie-in with Nike – Nike Mare 98, featuring football-playing zombies in Nike trainers – is available to download for PC now.Jazz has been making games for 17 years. His portfolio includes the Baobabs Mausoleum horror series, which features the 8-bit retro adventure series Flamingo’s Creek, on Steam, Xbox and PS4. His other project, horror game Tamarindos Freaking Dinner, is coming soon to the Switch. Until now, he’s been testing his skills in the lower divisions of the PC games scene.

It would solve absolutely nothing. It will merely pile fresh military, humanitarian and political problems on to the mounds of those already created in the conflict. It will make every human agony worse, not better. Governments around the world must do whatever they can – the US above all – to stop it.There is still time. The plan announced on Friday is for an operation to take military control ofGazaCity, home to a million displaced Palestinians. They will be forcibly evacuated, yet again, to the southern Gaza Strip over the coming weeks. Aid distribution is certain to be a secondary consideration, logistically challenging and woefully inadequate for a population where malnutrition is already severe. The threat to life in Gaza, including to the remaining Israeli hostages captured on 7 October 2023, will get much worse.Friday’s announcement leaves open the question of whether the operation will be extended later to the entire Gaza Strip. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said this is his wish. The current decision to limit the takeover seems to reflect objections from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chiefs. But there is no guarantee that an even larger takeover will not then follow. Mr Netanyahu always ratchets up. The sum of his choices amounts toperpetual war.This is a strategy that ensures, for the moment, that Mr Netanyahu remains in power. But it does not ensure a military victory. It escalates the fight with Hamas without any way of ending it. Twenty months of attacks may have devastated Hamas, but the capacity to mount a limited insurgency remains. Such insurgencies are hard to defeat, as the US found in Vietnam and Iraq, and Britain learned in its former empire and in Northern Ireland. “Everybody is going to be in this meat grinder,” a senior Israeli former soldier graphicallytold the BBCthis week.The misery will be felt in Israel too. The plan could be adeath sentencefor the 20 or so living hostages. It could also guarantee that the bodies of about 30 believed dead will disappear for ever. Mr Netanyahu’s decision, in effect, to put punishing Hamas above the freeing of Israeli hostages will agonise their families and deepen domestic political divisions. The strain on Israeli society is already intense, withIDF chiefsopposing the Gaza takeover and arguing unsuccessfully for more targeted operations. Now more Israeli soldiers will die too.The takeover shows how cavalierly Mr Netanyahu is willing to deepen Israel’s political isolation as long as he has Washington’s support. Other foreign governments have condemned the plan.Britainsaid it was simply “wrong” and “will only bring more bloodshed”.Germany, Israel’s second largest military supplier, put a ban on weapons for use in Gaza, a significant move. In realpolitik terms, however, everything comes down to the US. President Trump should condemn the takeover plan and match the German stance. US allies should insist that he does so. Hamas’s allies must be pressured too.Mr Netanyahu’s approach is not merely wrong. It will make things worse, much worse for people in Gaza in the short term most of all, but worse for Israelis in the long term too. His policy is exactly the kind of historic folly so well described by the historianBarbara Tuchmanas “a perverse persistence in a policy demonstrably unworkable or counter-productive”. Mr Netanyahu is sowing dragon’s teeth for years to come, and the sooner he is stopped the better.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now it’s time to skive off among the worst people Britain has to offerFri 8 Aug 2025 08.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 13.07 EDTShareIdon’t have access to the employment contract, but find myself increasingly intrigued by a question: how many days annual leave does a vice-president of the United States get? In the past five months alone, JD Vance has been on a skiing holiday, then a family trip to Disneyland, then a kayaking jaunt in Ohio – and now, he’s about to pitch up for an extendedsummer stay in the Cotswolds. More on all those in a bit. But let’s face it: if Vance were a politician in this country, he’d have been fitted with an unflattering holiday-related nickname months ago, and no one would take him remotely seriously.Still, time for another well-earned rest for Vacay Vance/the right honourable member for the Sun Lounger. And something of a break in tradition with recent times, in which he has preferred to holiday in national parks where the Trump administration has cut half the jobs, perhaps reasoning that if his security can successfully upend the infrastructure to assist his recreation during his stay, then those jobs were never really essential anyway. Only last weekend, the VP and family were holidaying near Caesar Creek Lake in Ohio, where his Secret Service team had the army corps of engineerschange the outflow of a lake. Depending on who you believe, this was either to “support safe navigation” of his huge, heavy-boated security detail, or to create “ideal kayaking conditions” for Vance, who was certainly pictured in a canoe over the period. Listen, sometimes JD just wants a lazy river, other times he wants rushing rapids. It’s called public service: look it up.Anyway, he’s just about to kick off a holiday in some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years – namely, Britain. Thanks for being in us, sir! As a point of order, though, over here we wouldn’t dream of allowing a politician to reroute one of our rivers. Instead, we allow the water companies to reroute sewage into them. Feel free to take a kayak out as often as possible during your stay. In fact, we insist on it.As for why Vance has picked the Cotswolds, it’s possibly a smart move to holiday somewhere filled with so many of the absolute worst people in the country. In the modern-era Cotswolds, JD is unlikely to even be the ghastliest person in the village. And he has, unfortunately, been the target of heckling and protest on recent trips. March found him skiing en famille at Sugarbush ski resort in Vermont, forced to run a gauntlet of placard-wielding objectors before reportedly opting to move location. Again: should have gone to Courchevel, where he wouldn’t even make the top 100 of the Most Hideous People on the Chairlift at Any Given Moment poll.View image in fullscreenResidents in Waitsfield, Vermont, protest against JD Vance during the vice-president’s skiing holiday in March 2025.Photograph: Jeff Knight/APThen last month it was Disneyland, against the backdrop of widespread Ice raids on undocumented immigrants across California, where his presence drew a sarcastic welcome from its governor, Gavin Newsom. “Hope you enjoy your family time, @JDVance,” this ran. “The families you’re tearing apart certainly won’t.” Vance responded by posting: “Had a great time, thanks.” A review not wholly borne out from fellow park users’ video footage, which showed the boos and protests continuing even as he trotted towards the Autopia ride and lunched furtively at the Pirates of the Caribbean restaurant.But look, the Vance family’s Cotswolds accommodation promises to be far more agreeable, and is not even made of fibreglass. In fact, according to the Daily Mail, it’s an 18th-century manor house in six sprawling acres of grounds that include a tennis court. Whether they also contain a swimming pool is unclear – as is whether Vance swims in a T-shirt when he’s alone with his family, like he famously does at hotels. Either way, the property has reportedly been crawling with Secret Service agents all week. Amenity-wise, it’s supposedly extremely close to Jeremy Clarkson’s Diddly Squat empire, setting up a potentially compelling episode for the next season of Clarkson’s Farm, should Vance care to call in on a temporary neighbour who recentlydescribed himas a “bearded God-botherer” and “twat” with “no clue about history”.The Vances won’t be tied to that one property, we learn, with a visit to hang out with David Lammy and his family at the foreign secretary’s country residence, Chevening, also planned for this coming weekend. Lammy has made so much of the two men’s shared Christian bond that you’d imagine he might squire the whole gang along to church on Sunday morning. Parts of the local St Botolph’s church date back to the 11th century – not quite as old as the Sleeping Beauty Castle in Anaheim, to be sure, but certainly able to hold its own with the Autopia ride. Also on the agenda, finally, is a trip to London, which Vance recently described as “not English any more”. Well, nor is the US, but that doesn’t seem to put him off.For the lucky British people, meanwhile, the Vance holiday serves as a mere amuse bouche to the main meal – the unprecedented second state visit next month of Donald Trump, who will make landfall on 17 September for a run of dates that convenientlyoccurs during parliamentary recess, thus avoiding the controversial spectacle of the president addressing the house. But if Trump’slast state visitwas anything to go by, it’ll be three days of remorseless rolling news wank about the “pageantry”, intense grandstanding by embarrassing politicians keen to suck up to him/define themselves against him, and 958 talking heads droning cluelessly on about how both sides have “got what they want out of it”. We’ll be positively begging to go back to these low-key days of the Vance vacance, so let’s enjoy them while we can.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJD VanceOpinionUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s the thing, Bret. It almost certainly is.Let’s start with the official figure from Gaza’s ministry of health, the one all media outlets cite, which is around 60,000 direct deaths – 18,500 of whom are children. These numbers, according to theEconomist, are derived from two lists. One is based on information from hospitals. The other is based on an online survey in which people report their relatives’ deaths. While there are numerous pro-Israel voices keen to discredit the death toll, the Economist notes that “[i]ndependent investigators have confirmed that those on the ministry’s two lists have almost certainly died”.Humanitarian agencieshave also said that, historically, statistics from the ministry of health are reliable.While Stephens may not think 60,000 dead Palestinians is much to worry about, it’s a huge number: the equivalent of a 9/11 happening every day for 20 days. But, due to limitations in capturing data, that number is also almost certainly a massive underestimate. It is far more likely that the real death toll is in the hundreds of thousands. And by “real death toll” I mean direct deaths from military campaignsandindirect deaths due to the famine created by Israel’s siege on Gaza, as well as deaths from preventable illnesses or medical conditions that couldn’t be treated due to Israel’s blockade on medical supplies and destruction of hospitals. It also means bodies that are rotting under the rubble and may never be formally identified. In January of this year, it was estimated there were atleast 10,000 bodiesburied under the wreckage of Gaza.As I sit here in Australia watching Israel starve Palestinians to death, I can’t help but think it could have been me | Plestia AlaqadRead moreTrying to figure out the real death toll is difficult – by design. Infrastructure in Gaza has been almost completely obliterated: the UN estimates up to92%of all residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict. Many of the hospitals, which played a key part in counting the dead, have been destroyed or are barely functioning. Israeli strikes have repeatedly causedinternetand phone blackouts. Gaza, more generally, has become what Israel’s leaders and influencers promised to make itfrom the very beginning: a place where no human being can live.Meanwhile, Israel has refused to allow foreign reporters free access into Gaza (although it takes some on heavily curated propaganda trips),systematically murderedPalestinian journalists on the ground andhampered effortsfor independent third-party investigations into mass graves and suspected war crimes. These are not exactly the actions of a party that has nothing to hide.Despite the difficulty of counting fatalities, there have been several attempts to calculate a more accurate death toll. In July 2024, for example, theLancet medical journal published a letterfrom respected scientists which tried to calculate indirect deaths, noting that in “recent conflicts, such indirect deaths range from three to 15 times the number of direct deaths”. The authors suggested that by this measure, “it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza”. Writing in the Guardian in September 2024, Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, noted that the Lancet estimates were “very conservative” and extrapolated the methodology to estimate about335,500 deaths in totalby the end of 2024. We are now, of course, inching towards the end of 2025.Then, in January 2025,research published in the Lancetestimated that the death toll in the first nine months of war was about 40% higher than numbers recorded by the Palestinian territory’s health ministry. The peer-reviewed statistical analysis was conducted by academics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Yale University and other institutions. This used death toll data from the health ministry, and social media obituaries to estimate that there were between 55,298 and 78,525 deaths from traumatic injuries in Gaza up to 30 June 2024. Again: that’s just direct deaths from traumatic injuries and those numbers are from more than a year ago now.In June 2025, anew studyled by Michael Spagat, a researcher of war and armed conflict at the University of London, estimated that more than 80,000 Palestinians had been killed in Israel’s military campaign in Gaza between 7 October 2023 and 5 January 2025. This study, which has not been peer-reviewed yet, wasconducted independentof Gaza’s ministry of health records and is the first actual empirical study: researchers on the ground surveyed a sample of 2,000 households, representative of Gaza’s population before 7 October 2023. Of those deaths, 75,200 were classified as violent deaths and 8,540 were “indirect” deaths.All of which to say: we have absolutely no idea how many people have been killed in Gaza. And, now that Gaza hasslid into man-made famine, documenting the dead will only become harder. Throughout 2025,Iraq Body Count(IBC) has been publishing, with permission, English versions of the victim names lists irregularly produced by the information unit within Gaza’s ministry of health. Spokespeople from IBC have said the team of 15 people at the ministry of health, who have been documenting the dead in Gaza, are now starving and at serious risk of becoming unable to continue their work.While numbers don’t matter for the purpose of proving a genocide, I would bet my own life that the number is much higher than the 60,000 figure media outlets report. Go look at therare picturesthat have come out of Gaza, which is a wasteland, and tell me you don’t agree. At this stage it feels like journalistic malpractice to talk about 60,000 people being dead, without explaining that the number is likely far higher.I would love to be proved wrong on all this. I would love to find out that Israel has “only” killed 60,000 people. I would love to find out that all the children who arebeing shot in the headjust carelessly walked into bullets and weren’t beingdeliberately targeted. I would be ecstatic to discover that the IVF center in Gaza that was destroyed by Israel wasn’t targeted, as a UN report says, aspart of an effort to destroy“in part the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group”.And it would be very easy for Israel’s government, which keeps screaming “blood libel” as accusations of genocide mount, to correct the record if it wanted to. It could let foreign journalists have unfettered access to Gaza. It could allow independent agencies to conduct investigations. But it will not do any of these things. So, to echo Bret Stephens, the first question the pro-Israel “there’s no genocide chorus” needs to answer is: Why won’t Israel let independent parties verify the death count? I think we all know the answer to that.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnistThis article was amended on 8 August 2025.

His initial Pavlovian training by his mob lawyer Roy Cohn and subsequent experience inmore than 4,000 lawsuitsand countless scandals seem to have ingrained in him that lying, the more outrageous the better, buys him time, plays to his credulous followers as insouciant defiance, and wears down his accusers.When Trump’s distractions failed to distract from theJeffrey Epsteinfiles, he offered a story without missing a beat to distance himself from any taint. In his tale, he was traduced by Epstein. Trump was taken advantage of, violated, despoiled. There could be no guilt by association; Trump was a victim, too.Perhaps, after claiming to no effect that Barack Obama, Joe Biden and the former FBI director James Comey had fabricated the files, he felt that he had at last found ground where he could gain some traction. Trump always designates a scapegoat, but neither Tren de Agua nor Hunter Biden would fit with Epstein. All along, Trump has missed the easiest and most obvious scapegoat. Why not blame Epstein for Epstein? Trump just needed to invent a story.Why did Ghislaine Maxwell do what she did? | Moira DoneganRead moreHe began by blurting on 28 July: “But for years, I wouldn’t talk to Jeffrey Epstein. I wouldn’t talk because he did something that was inappropriate. He hired help, and I said, ‘Don’t ever do that again.’ He stole people that worked for me. I said, ‘Don’t ever do that again.’ He did it again. And I threw him out of the place – persona non grata. I threw him out, and that was it. I’m glad I did, if you want to know the truth.”After establishing the premise of his story, he added more detail the next day. “People that work in the spa – I have a great spa, one of the best spas in the world at Mar-a-Lago – and people were taken out of the spa, hired by him. In other words, gone. And other people would come and complain, ‘This guy is taking people from the spa.’ I didn’t know that. He took people that worked for me. And I told him, ‘Don’t do it any more.’ And he did it. I said, ‘Stay the hell out of here.’”A reporter followed up to ask if any of those employees were young women, an opportunity for further Trump story enhancement. “The answer is yes, they were in the spa,” Trump said. “I told him, I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people, whether it was spa or not spa’ … And he was fine. And then not too long after that, he did it again.”Then Trump was asked if one of those young women was Virginia Giuffre, who was exploited by Epstein beginning at age 16 in 2000 until she escaped his clutches in 2002, eventually filing lawsuits against him that helped break the case open. “I think she worked at the spa,” Trump replied. “I think that was one of the people, yeah. He stole her.” He added, “And by the way, she had no complaints about us, as you know – none whatsoever.”Trump’s self-defensive remarks were an accumulation of lies and distortions, each one at risk of tumbling on the next. Unfortunately, it was contradicted by the factual timeline. And his comments about Giuffre, the tragically abused child who bore witness, for whom he offered not a word of sympathy, depicting her as stolen property, offended the Giuffre family, who came forward to denounce his heartlessness. “It was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been ‘stolen’ from Mar-a-Lago,” read the family’s statement. This was not the public relations success that Trump had hoped for to lay the Epstein scandal to rest.Trump suggested in his story that Giuffre was only one of the “people” Epstein had poached from him. In his telling, he first warned Epstein before he “stole” Giuffre. In fact, it wasGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend and accomplice, who recruited Giuffre and participated in her sexual abuse. There is no record of others than Giuffre recruited from the Mar-a-Lago spa. Trump’s story of multiple “people” and his warning to Epstein are baseless.Still, the ever reliable White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated: “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees.” Trump went onNewsmaxto praise her, the press secretary, as if she were the winner of a modeling contest: “She’s become a star. It’s that face, it’s that brain, it’s those lips, the way they move, they move like she’s a machine gun.”It was true Trump had not spoken ‘for years’ to Epstein. But there his truthfulness endedIt was true Trump had not spoken “for years” to Epstein. But there his truthfulness ended. Three years after Trump claimed he had cut his ties to Epstein for stealing Giuffre, in 2003, Trump sent him a risqué poem celebrating his 50th birthday inside his drawing of a naked woman, signing his name to represent pubic hair, according to the Wall Street Journal. “We have certain things in common, Jeffrey … A pal is a wonderful thing … and may every day be a wonderful secret.”According to theWashington Post, their relationship ruptured not in 2000 as Trump claimed, but in 2004 over a real estate rivalry to purchase a Palm Beach estate. Trump, whose casinoswent bankrupt that year, somehow found the cash to outbid Epstein. Four years later, Trump sold the estate to a Russianoligarchclosely tied to Vladimir Putin for double the price, at $95m. “Don’t say Russian,” Trumptold a reporterfrom the Palm Beach Post. He urged the reporter just to write “foreign”.Trump and Epstein socialized together for years with “young women”, some underage, and often with models, including a party for “calendar girls”at Mar-a-Lago in 1992, where the two were the only other guests, andTrump’s alleged gropingof the model Stacey Williams in Trump Tower with Epstein present in 1993. Trump denies these allegations.“Epstein enjoyed hanging out backstage at beauty pageants and fashion shows with his Palm Beach and New York neighbor and friend Donald Trump, former models said,” the Miami Herald reported. Trump himself owned three beauty pageants. He described going backstage on theHoward Stern radio talk showin 2005: “You know they’re standing there with no clothes … And you see these incredible looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that.”Trump created Trump Model Management, also known as T Models, in 1999. T Models recruited girlsas young as 14to the US ontourist visaswith lavish promises of fame and fortune, and once they arrived paid them minimally. “It is like modern-day slavery,”saidone of the models, Rachel Blais. “Honestly, they are the most crooked agency I’ve ever worked for, and I’ve worked for quite a few.”Epstein wanted a modeling agency of his own. He admired Trump’s T Models and sought to replicate it. He invested in one based in Paris operated by Jean-Luc Brunel, a model agency head who was also accused of sex trafficking. Courtney Powell Soerensen, a model, told the Miami Herald: “Epstein had to have his slimy peons and Brunel was the ideal person to do the job.” Brunel had been the subject of a 60 Minutes exposé as an alleged sexual abuser of models in 1988. In New York, in the 1990s, Brunel lived in Trump Tower. “The modeling agency was the perfect vehicle for Epstein to get more victims,” Giuffresaid. Heather Braden, a model,toldthe Miami Herald she saw Brunel, Epstein and Trump at parties together frequently in the early 1990s. Brunel was charged with rape in 2021 and died by apparent suicide in a French prison in 2022, about two years after Epstein’s apparent suicide.Trump had never before told his self-exonerating story about how he had broken with Epstein over Giuffre. But he had spoken publicly about his relationship with Epstein in 2002, when he rejoiced in their friendship toNew York magazine: “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”Little remarked upon in the citation of this quote was that Trump’s response to the writer appears intended to offer a more positive and vivid picture of Epstein, at least in Trump’s eyes, than the reclusive and serious image Epstein was trying to promote. Trump’s description was preceded in the article by this set-up: “Epstein likes to tell people that he’s a loner, a man who’s never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk toDonald Trump, a different Epstein emerges.”Trump, always seeking to elevate himself, preened in talking about Epstein as following his example as a Casanova. Now he continues to stonewall the public over the Epstein files. Days after Maxwell was interviewed by the deputy attorney general Todd Blanche in her Florida prison, she was granted transfer to a minimal security penitentiary in Texas. Her move heightens the intrigue surrounding her deposition, which the administration is keeping secret despite calls by Democratic senators for its release.By invoking Giuffre, Trump has activated her family. They were enraged by the favor suddenly granted to Maxwell and wonder whether it is part of a deal. “President Trump has sent a clear message today: pedophiles deserve preferential treatment and their victims do not matter,” read theirstatement. “This move smacks of a cover-up. The victims deserve better.” Trump’s ill-conceived story about Giuffre has undermined rather than bolstered him in maintaining control of the storyline.Sidney Blumenthal is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionJeffrey EpsteinGhislaine MaxwellcommentShareReuse this content"

For anyone tuned in to the 29 July game between the Atlanta Dream and Golden State Valkyries, the initial reaction was disbelief. In a world where feeds are increasingly AI-generated and algorithmically tuned for confusion, the boundaries between real and unreal have softened into clay. Our senses, once reliable, now compete with simulation. What does it mean when dildos become airborne at WNBA games?Not once,not twice,but repeatedly? Protest? Performance art? Or just another malformed blip in the automated dreamscape we scroll through daily?Another WNBA game disrupted by sex toy thrown on court in ChicagoRead moreTwo men have been arrested thus far in these grotesque affronts.One was 18,the other 23, part of Gen Z, the prime consumer of debased meme culture. Authorities have not identified suspects in the most recent two dildo-throwing incidents. However, Delbert Carver, a 23-year-old man, was arrested in connection with the first incident during a WNBA game in Atlanta. According to ESPN, Carver may face charges of disorderly conduct, public indecency or indecent exposure and criminal trespass. In an affidavit, he allegedly admitted that the act was “supposed to be a joke” and intended “to go viral”.When dildos become airborne atWNBAgames more than once, the meaning shifts. It reveals the collapse of coherence under TikTok’s attention economy. These aren’t protests or insults that make a point. They’re spectacles. The goal is to provoke. In a memetic landscape poisoned by irony, absurdity is the point. The dildo isn’t symbolic. Its function is noise.Philosopher Guy Debord would be shocked at how on the nose we have become. His work argued we live in a “society of the spectacle,” where life is mediated through image, and authenticity is replaced by performance. Today, women’s sports are doubly mediated, first through the lens of athletic competition, then through the social gaze that still questions their legitimacy. Laura Mulvey’s theory of the “male gaze” further sharpens this: Women, particularly in visual media, are often positioned not as agents but as objects. In this context, female athletes are not merely participants in a game. They’re props in someone else’s viral moment. The dildo becomes mise-en-scène.The memeification of rebellionBut this isn’t just theoretical. It’s real. So is the disrespect. The dildo is a weaponized farce. It’s thrown not just to interrupt but to dominate the narrative, to remind players that their gender, their careers and their stage remain vulnerable to mockery. It stops the game. Hijacks it, even. And reasserts the notion, violent and comical, that women’s achievements exist on borrowed time within a culture still conditioned to belittle them.So far, the suspects in these cases are part of Gen Z, a generation raised in and by the internet. Their actions cannot be dismissed as isolated provocations. They must be contextualized within TikTok’s cultural logic, or worse, the absurdist ethos of “Skibidi Toilet”. If you are a normally functioning adult with a job, you might ask, “What is Skibidi Toilet?”Skibidi Toiletis a viral animated web series featuring surreal, low-resolution battles between human heads protruding from toilets and humanoid characters with surveillance equipment for heads. Glitchy visuals, overstimulating pacing, and meme loops create a vibe without meaning.But to understand these trolls’ intentions, and see the direction society is headed, we must contextualize them within TikTok’s cultural logic. The garish green dildo mirrors the surreal, low-fi, uncanny aesthetic of Skibidi Toilet or any number of algorithm-fueled meme cycles. The dildo is an anti-symbol. Its meaning is its absurdity. Skibidi brainrot encapsulates a generation fluent in irony but starved for meaning. The dildo is funny not because it says something, but because it says nothing. It’s the irrational object breaking into a space of rationality.View image in fullscreenTwo of the WNBA sex toy-throwing incidents have taken place during games involving Sophie Cunningham and the Indiana Fever.Photograph: Ron Jenkins/Getty ImagesThis kind of hyper-chaotic media serves as both entertainment and an ambient worldview for young men raised online. Their minds normalize prank-as-expression. In this context, throwing a dildo on to the court during a WNBA game isn’t just an act of crude rebellion. It sadly mirrors the Skibidi Toilet ethos: low-effort disruption cloaked in irony, where the gesture is meant to be meaningless and provocative at once. As traditional signifiers of rebellion (punk, political protest, counterculture) fade or fragment in the digital noise, young men are absorbing frameworks of meaninglessness, where “funny = power” and shock is its own reward.Furthering the chronically online element of all this, in the last two days,a crypto memecoin group has claimed creditfor the recent dildo-throwing incidents at WNBA games, reframing what seemed like rogue trolling as a deliberate guerrilla marketing stunt. The group, which openly mocks the league and brags about not watching women’s sports, celebrated the act online as a victory. If true, this spectacle is engineered by people who understand that visibility matters more than meaning in an algorithm-driven culture.This is how meme culture is rotting America: not from the inside, but from online. The internet’s lack of regulation is its greatest strength and its most dangerous flaw. It allows once-fringe ideologies and juvenile impulses to scale without resistance. Ideas that would have died in solitude or been challenged in a public square now find shelter in forums and meme loops, rewarded by engagement. In this new economy of attention, even humiliation has utility. We’re left with a culture where trolling becomes its own form of marketing.From trolls to Trump: the end of shameHow did we arrive at this level of collective debasement? Despite living in an era of unprecedented digital access,over half of American adults (54%) read below a sixth-grade level, and 21% are considered illiterate as of 2022. This foundational deficit in literacy undermines a person’s ability to evaluate online messages critically. Thus, a generation raised on irony struggles to decode satire, or even manipulation. Back in 2013, 66% of fourth graders couldn’t read proficiently. It was a warning sign that today’s adults would fail to distinguish viral provocation from genuine meaning. Online, many young people now build identity from meme fragments, unconsciously mimicking behavior they don’t fully understand. Lacking media literacy, they become perfect vessels for cultural incoherence.All of this really boils down to the death of shame within society. And it starts at the top. Donald Trump’s most enduring legacy isn’t a policy but a persona as the shameless troll who made humiliation a political strategy. His constant provocation and gleeful disdain for norms created a playbook both parties use now. Liberals respond with faux-moral outrage, conservatives with Nietzschean bravado, but the end result is the same: a culture addicted to performance, where shame is no longer a deterrent.This logic has trickled down into every corner of public life through race, class, gender and especially online culture, where symbolic acts of ressentiment become viral currency. The dildo thrown at a women’s basketball game isn’t just a crude joke but a memeified act of humiliation. It doesn’t challenge power on any level, it just wants attention. And in a culture without shame, the humiliation sticks to the target, not the perpetrator. In this case, the WNBA players themselves.The fact that these incidents have popped up simultaneously across the country, from New York to Atlanta to Chicago, shows that the lack of shame is collective, bipartisan and here to stay. This is where we are: everything is bait. We’ve collapsed the distinction between trolling and activism, and so we land – like the dildo itself – on the bottom of the floor, laughing, recording, retweeting, but never asking what it says about who we’ve become.Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But there’s growing evidence of the damage wood-fired heaters and open fires are doing to our health – and the environment.As a group of University of Technology Sydney academicsrecently put it– “a wood-fired heater is like having a truck idling in your living room all day (albeit with the bulk of the emissions escaping via the chimney)”.So what do we know about wood burning and are there alternatives for those wanting a cosy open-fire feel in their home without damaging the Earth?What the evidence saysAccording to a 2024 study, wood burning in fireplaces and heaters is one of thebiggest sources of air pollutionin many parts of Australia. While only about 10% of Australian homes use wood burning as their primary heat source, they create more than half of Australia’s fine particulate pollution.The health costs of this are bad enough, but the effect on the planet is also significant. Evenso-called eco friendly wood heatersare doing damage - producing more particulate pollution than a modern truck.The solar battery rebate has arrived – here’s how to steer clear of scammersRead moreThat’s because burning firewood in fireplaces and domestic heaters produces methane and black carbon particles that worsen global heating. One study estimates that wood heaters cause as much ormore emissions than gas or reverse-cycle air conditioning. On top of that, much of the firewood sold in urban areas comes from forest timber – further depleting essential carbon banks.Lisa Cunial is a psychologist who has lived in Orange in NSW for more than 20 years. She says Orange is cold for seven months of the year and a lot of people use wood-burning heaters in their homes. “Being quite a major regional city, it’s a real problem.”After the 2019 bushfires, Cunial ended up in hospital with severe breathing difficulties. “Wood is very much part of the culture here. But for me it means I literally have to stay inside the house with air filters even though I live near bushland and a wetland,” she says.Mapping wood heater pollutionFay Johnston, the director of the Centre for Safe Air and professor of environmental epidemiology at the University of Tasmania’s Menzies Institute for Medical Research recently created awood heater pollution mapshowing which parts of Australia are estimated to have the most severe air pollution from wood heaters.“When people think of pollution they often picture smokestacks, vehicle exhaust and coal-fired power stations, but wood heaters pollute more fine particulate matter into the air we breathe than any of these sources,” she says.Johnston also points to the impact of firewood collection on Australia’s forests and habitat. “One study estimated that, if we stopped burning wood and clearing forest for heating, Australia would reduce its annual greenhouse gas emissions by8.7m tonneseach year, aboutone-fifthof Australia’s car emissions.What can you do?According to Arabella Daniel, a Melbourne inner-city councillor and clean air community advocate who runsMy Air Quality Australia, in the absence of strong public health or climate messaging, wood heating is wrongly seen as desirable and natural. “That lifestyle image is pushed, but the health [and environmental] impacts are ignored,” she says.Wood heaters are sold cheaply with no warnings, despite evidence of serious environmental harm. “Burning wood is normalised, yet it worsens air pollution and contributes to climate change. Harvesting firewood damages biodiversity and depletes forests.”No backyard required: I tried growing vegetables on a 20th-floor balcony – here’s what I learnedRead moreShe says now is the time for the Australian government to recognise wood heater pollution as a serious public health and climate issue, and to provide subsidies to phase them out over time, beginning with stopping new wood heater installations.“Providing financial support to help people switch to clean, efficient, electric alternatives is cost effective. Public education is vital – people need to understand the health risks and the benefits of going electric. Such government action is already happening with getting off gas – we need to get off wood too.”Johnston agrees, saying it’s time for governments to restrict the installation of new wood heaters in high-density residential areas where people will be affected by smoke pollution. “Point-of-sale legislation should be introduced requiring wood heaters to be replaced with non-polluting electric alternatives before a property changes hands.”She says while we have sophisticated systems in place for food and water standards, “the problem of wood heaters has persisted because no environment or health authority in Australia sees themselves as bearing primary responsibility” for it.Are there alternatives?While there are some wood burning heaters that produce less emissions than others, including thisultra-low emission modeldeveloped in New Zealand, Daniel says the emissions from those models may still be too high to be safe for health or the climate.“Those models were tested on NZ softwoods and not Australian hardwoods so the emissions will be greater here. All of these models still emit climate pollution and threaten our forests. We know the best alternative is for clean, electric split systems.”She says for those who want the cozy appearance of a roaring fire in their homes without the climate impacts, the best option is an electric fireplace. There are plenty of different kinds of systems on the market that offer the appearance of a warm glowing flame but without any emissions.These might not have the same romantic feel as wood, but you’ll be doing the climate – and your health – a favour.Explore more on these topicsAir pollutionChange by degreesEnergyClimate crisisHealthGreenhouse gas emissionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just glimpsing or half-hearing the headlines can be enough to plunge you into a sinkhole of gloom.If it’s not the Trump administrationending $500m worth of fundingfor the very vaccine programmes that helped rescue billions from the menace of Covid – as part of Robert F Kennedy Jr’s determined effort to rollback mass immunisation, one of the greatest gifts science has given humankind – it’s the ongoing agony of Gaza, only set to increase after Benjamin Netanyahu responded to a global outcry over his use of starvation as a weapon not by moving to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the strip, as so desperately needed, but rather to escalate the war yet further, his security cabinet agreeing early Friday morning totake over Gaza City.If it’s not a climate crisis that seesheat records brokensummer after summer, it’s themassacre in Sudan of more than 1,500 civilianssheltering in a camp for displaced people, the attack conducted over 72 bloody hours by paramilitaries backed by the United Arab Emirates, a western ally.Or it’s the steady breakdown of tolerance that had held, imperfectly, for decades – witness those with loud megaphones who have beenall but urging their followersto stage a repeat of last August’s violence in England and Northern Ireland directed at asylum seekers or the Spanish town that hasbanned the celebration of Muslim religious festivalsin public spaces.The supply of bad news is voluminous and apparently without end. You lament what is happening now, with the proliferation of social media pumping out falsehood, whether AI-generated or human-made, and hate – and then you are reminded of our recent past. Wednesday marked 80 years to the day since an atomic bomb, surely one of the darkest bequests science has given humankind, took the lives ofas many as 140,000 peoplein Hiroshima.All this could lead even a sane person to despair of their fellow human beings and what they are capable of. The urge is strong to run away, to turn off the news and escape.And yet that presents a new problem: guilt. When wars rage and innocents are slaughtered, it can feel selfish, even frivolous, to think about or pay attention to anything else. “Don’t look away,” urge those posting graphic horror on social media. Yet the need to look away, and to get away, is compelling, precisely because of the turmoil all around.Tentatively, I want to make a moral case for escapism, for allowing oneself a break from world events. Not on the therapeutic grounds of personal wellbeing and mental health – though those are surely obvious – but as an essential means of retaining our ability to see the world, and the people, around us.My own somewhat guilty pleasure this summer has been to follow the contest between the England and India cricket teams, which came to a thrilling climax on Monday. I appreciate that there will be some Guardian readers – and not only in the US – who will be poised to swipe, or turn, the page at the mere mention of the word cricket. But stay with me, because this is not a point about sport, but about life.Across five separate matches, each one played from morning till dusk for five straight days, these two sides of 11 men did battle with everything they had. It was a physically gruelling competition. The England captain, Ben Stokes, who looks as if he could have commanded a platoon of men in the trenches at the Somme, has a body that has been battered through years of relentless exertion. He is an all-rounder, both batter and bowler, which , combined with his leadership duties, means he scarcely rests. After one of the five matches, he wasconfined to bed for four days.The third Test match was won at the death thanks to a ball delivered by England’s Shoaib Bashir. He managed to spin it in such a way that it confounded the opponent who faced it, and he did that despite nursing a broken finger. In the closing moments of the final match on Monday, England’s Chris Woakes walked out to the middle, apparently ready to face a hard, heavy cricket ball hurtling at him at a terrifying 90mph, with one arm in a sling, his shoulder dislocated. When he ran, his face was a rictus of pain. In the end, England fell just short.It was an enthralling 25 days, sometimes played out in searing summer sun, sometimes interrupted by July rain. What we witnessed from both teams was a display of determination so extreme, it is rarely glimpsed outside the realms of violent fanaticism. There were moments of folly and failure, dropped catches and bad decisions, but these were athletes aiming for, and often reaching, the heights of true excellence. You didn’t have to be a fan of cricket to find the sight exhilarating. In the end the series was drawn, and perhaps that was oddly fitting. The teams had matched each other in their resolve not to be beaten.You could say the same of the Lionesses, the England women who got so close to defeat at the European football championships they all but found a seat for it on the team bus, but who never succumbed. Their commitment to succeeding, to being better, was riveting to see.But it’s not confined to sport. Watch the performances of Florence Hunt and Rory Walton-Smith, the two young leads in theBBC drama Mix Tape, and you see a perfect evocation of first love. Or you could read this week a touching account of what is surely avaledictory tour by the great Paul Simon. The author noted how Simon’s voice is no longer what it was, how “It’s lost its highs & lows, stuck in a breathy mid-range.” The band on stage adjust accordingly, but “Simon is such an artist, so instinctively musical, he makes the most of the voice he’s got, wringing every little bit of feeling & nuance out of it. You can see him working at it, just as obsessively committed to quality as ever.”That obsessive pursuit of excellence is the thread that runs throughJohn & Paul, Ian Leslie’s quite brilliant study of Lennon and McCartney and the enduring music each spurred the other to produce. It’s a reminder of what humans can do, the heights they can reach, the joy they can bring.None of it makes any of the other stuff go away. Trump is still there when the Test match ends; death still stalks Gaza when you close Leslie’s book. But it is a useful antidote all the same. No, not useful – essential. For it’s when we feel ourselves plunged into the abyss, when our despair at our fellow human beings pulls strongest, that we most need to look upward – and glimpse the stars.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCricketOpinionWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Itsproposed adjustmentto council tax in England is crude and possibly cruel, and does nothing to help with Rachel Reeves’s “missing £40bn”. It is designed merely to shift money from rich regions to poor ones, and thus correct an imbalance in Britain’s regional wealth. As such it is overdue and welcome.British budgetary policy used to be classy. It was top hats and secrets and standing room only in parliament. Now it comprises a scruffy marathon of leaks, squeaks and denials. Lobbies form, rebels threaten and ministers pledge and unpledge.The local government secretary,Angela Rayner, has sought advice on a scheme to adjust the regional burden of council tax, unreformed since it replaced poll tax in 1993. The change is aimed at correcting its most severe defect: that poor people pay more in tax than in fairness they should, and rich people pay less. Government grants do not compensate councils accordingly.Thus at its crudest, the system means that a band H property in Hartlepool, County Durham, pays£3,000 a year morein council tax than a multimillion-pound townhouse in Westminster. On my own two-bedroom house in Wales, the basic council tax is £3,862. On my London house, many times its value, the tax going to the local borough is half that, just £1,850. Ever since this tax was introduced 30 years ago no government minister has dared order a national revaluation of properties, despite wild leaps in house prices. Nor has there been any widening of tax bands. A revaluation due in 2005was ditchedby the then local government secretary, David Miliband, who admitted it was done out of sheer fear.Keir Starmer has no excuse for letting this continue. He has a big majority. Local government finance is in chaos. Many councils face bankruptcy. Services are closing everywhere, especially discretionary ones such as youth clubs, childcare and museums. He is clearly minded to do something, but he appears terrified of radicalism. He simply wants to tilt central grants more towards poorer councils at the expense of rich ones, and leave the system the same.Astudy of the planby the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests some bizarre consequences. The central government grant to local councils is to be reallocated through a morass of algorithms assessing local needs. Central grants would be slashed for 186 councils and increased for 161. Thirty councils would see their grants cut by more than 10% in the next three years, and some inner London boroughs by as much as 25%.The maths is beyond comprehension. The south-east does badly, which is to be expected. Yorkshire, Manchester and, for some reason, the East Midlands do well. Norwich, Crawley and indeed Enfield and Hillingdon also fare well. Suffolk and Leicestershire are losers, while Slough and Harlow are winners. Indeed, the more you look down the list, the more you wonder how officials worked it out, beavering away in their Whitehall attic. It seems suspiciously tilted to areas gained by Reform UK.The change would go some way to meeting Boris Johnson’s bid to “level up” regional Britain, though he did little levelling himself beyond inventing the phrase. He rightly drew attention to the fact that the UK’s disparity in disposable income between rich and poor, south and north, is nowstatistically widerthan that of any country in the EU. Regional poverty impedes productivity, investment and national growth.As for council tax, even when he was mayor of London, Johnsonprotested at the gapbetween what “a Russian oligarch is paying on his stuccoed schloss in Kensington” and “what such a gentleman might be asked to pay in Paris or New York”. At least if the oligarch had a second home in Cornwall or Wales, he might now be hit with a council tax surcharge that could reachup to £10,000 a year.In other words, Starmer and Rayner may be hoping to reverse some of the disparity between councils in rich and poor parts of the country. They will hardly be reversing it between rich and poor individuals. Taxpayers in rich areas may see their bills rise steeply, perhaps even by more than the normal limit of 5%. But that is the nearest this reform gets to a mansion tax.What Rayner appears to lack the guts to do is tackle the central unfairness built into the council tax. The time is surely overdue to revise the wildly out-of-date valuations of taxable properties, and the wildly limited range of bands by which the tax is assessed. It is absurd for the richest houses to be charged just three times the poorest. A two-bedroom flat should not be paying only a third of what a sumptuous palace pays. A clearbasis for revaluationis outlined by the IFS. It should be adopted.The government is tinkering with a broken wheel. It is gesturing in the direction of levelling up, but merely by reforming a centralist device – a grant. It should dare to be leftwing and go for the jugular. Houses should be taxed for their proper value. If you cannot call it a mansion tax, call it what it is: a property tax. But make sure it’s a proper one.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCouncil taxOpinionLabourAngela RaynerEnglandNorth-south dividecommentShareReuse this content"

Time to be brave – and take a new tackFri 8 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTShareBritain is in danger of going bankrupt. It may happen slowly or quickly, but sinceLabourtook office this possibility has increasingly been promoted and discussed in the press, by opposition parties and in the City of London.What exact form will this bankruptcy take? The prophets of doom tend to be vague about the timescale, but more certain about the cause of the coming meltdown: the state spending too much, generally on people who have little.“Rip up the benefits system and start again,” was theheadline of a columnby the usually measured Matthew Parris in the Times this week. The welfare state, he wrote, is “in danger of toppling the whole economy”. Unsustainable numbers of claimants are “joining the bandwagon as it careers towards the abyss”.Such warnings appear to be given credibility by worried bulletins from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), a Conservative-Lib Dem creation intended to build confidence in Britain’s fiscal position but in practice more often doing the opposite. “The UK’s public finances have emerged from a series of major global economic shocks in a relatively vulnerable position,”said the OBR last month. “Underlying public debt is now at its highest level since the early 1960s and is projected to rise further … An ageing population and rising costs of healthcare and other age-related expenditures are … projected to push … debt above 270% of GDP by the early 2070s.”Already, a sustained rise in thecost of government borrowing, disappointing economic growth and tax revenues, and a little-questionedpush to increase defence spendingare all worsening the situation. This autumn, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will probably have to produce a budget in an atmosphere of acute financial anxiety, and possibly outright panic.Labour chancellors have been here depressingly often before: in 1931, during the Great Depression that helped destroy Ramsay MacDonald’s government; in 1976, when confidence collapsed in the finances of Jim Callaghan’s administration and the UK had to get a loan from the International Monetary Fund; and in 2008, when Gordon Brown’s chancellor, Alistair Darling,warned that economic circumstanceswere “arguably the worst they’ve been in 60 years”.On each occasion, the financial thunderclouds built up during late summer. With parliament not sitting, leaving a void for speculative news to fill, and many voters approaching the end of holidays and beginning to think about autumn belt-tightening, in August Britain may be particularly receptive to bleak forecasts about government borrowing.Yet far less attention is paid to the doom-mongers’ political assumptions. When journalists, economists and politicians say sternly that Britain “can’t afford” certain things, they rarely mean nuclear weapons that will probably never be used, or bailouts for reckless banks, or therapidly growing grantfor a royal family that already hashighly profitable estates. When sweeping austerity is called for, the most entrenched establishment interests are usually exempt.Nor do these supposed tellers of hard financial truths often consider whether the UK can afford low taxes on the rich, by international and historic standards, or the deterioration in public services already caused by cuts, with all its damaging consequences for productivity, social relations and public health. The surprise at the angry, run-down state of the country still expressed by many commentators – from the Financial Times to the Daily Telegraph – suggests a determination not to see austerity, social divisions and political upheaval as in any way connected. It’s a sign of the enduring influence of Thatcherism that so many people can look at our ever harsher society and economy and still conclude that the solution is not more government support for citizens, but less.Thus, a panic about the size of the state is created yet again. What can the government do to stop it – assuming it actually wants to? In 1931, 1976 and 2010, Labour responded to fiscal crises in what is revealingly regarded, across mainstream politics, as the conventional way: by proposing cuts. There remains a puritanical side to the party – perhaps partly a legacy of its origins in tightly run cooperative societies – that enjoys trying to prove that Labour governments are more frugal than Tory ones.When Labour has an expansive, confident leader, such as Tony Blair in the 1990s, spending restraint can make the party look measured and responsible: being careful now in order to spend more later. But under less persuasive leadership, cuts can become a trap. Some voters will always believe that Labour is profligate in office – and others that it is never generous enough. The party lost all three general elections after MacDonald, Callaghan and Brown’s governments chose cuts.Tentative Labour governments can be too influenced by pro-austerity interests. After the 1976 crisis had subsided, and the Callaghan administration had enacted sharp spending reductions, his chancellor, Denis Healey, discovered that the government debt forecasts he had been given by Treasury officials had been far too pessimistic. “The figures were billions out,” he told me decades later. “The big problem they have in the Treasury is getting governments to control spending. So any excuse they can find for getting spending cut, they will take.”Rachel Reeves is hoping deregulation will save the economy. We know how that ends | Larry ElliottRead moreNow, the scale of the government’s problems seems less open to interpretation. This week, the respected National Institute of Social and Economic Research warned that “the chancellor cannot simultaneously meet her fiscal rules, fulfil spending commitments and uphold manifesto promises to avoid tax rises for working people. At least one of these will need to be dropped.” Global financial markets, which have become even more interconnected and powerful since Labour’s last fiscal crisis in office, and which are operated by people who won’t bear the brunt of British public spending cuts, will scrutinise the budget with their customary coldness.Yet somehow Labour needs to break free of the argument, almost a century old now, that its more progressive policies and poorer people’s living standards are the first things that should be sacrificed in hard times. Perhaps one way is to highlight austerity advocates, past and present, such as George Osborne and Kemi Badenoch. Can the country really afford more of that kind of haughty, socially disastrous politics, Labour could ask.But then it would have to set out an alternative: a centre-left politics that can survive financial crises – or avoid them altogether. After so many fearful retreats, that work has barely begun.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyOpinionLabourAusterityEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Now the time is ripe for a resetFri 8 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 11.29 EDTShareThe German Green party, Die Grünen, was once the envy of its sister movements across Europe. In the spring of 2021 it was the most popular party in the country, with apredicted vote shareof close to 30%. The world’s press evenbegan to askwhether the next chancellor would be Green. Fast-forward four years and you find a party in crisis: divided, out of power and stagnating at just above 10% in the polls after losing 33 seats in February’s federal election. The party is now searching for a path back to the mainstream – not a moment too soon given the rapid erosion of Germany’s political centre.One of the Greens’ key problems is personnel. At their peak in 2021 they had two lead figures inAnnalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, who were widely regarded as pragmatists – a prerequisite for effective government in Germany’s compromise-oriented system. After the 2021 election, Baerbock became foreign minister in Olaf Scholz’s SPD-Green-liberal “traffic light coalition”, and Habeck vice chancellor and minister for economic affairs and climate action.After the collapse of that government, the Greens lost a million votes and fell into fourth place in this year’s elections. Key personnel are departing en masse. Habeck wants tomove to Denmark; Baerbock is now president of the United Nations General Assembly. Meanwhile the entire leadership board of the party’s Green Youth wingquit the partyaltogether. In theory, this should have opened an opportunity for a reset.The party elected a new leadership duo – Franziska Brantner, 45, and Felix Banaszak, 35 – and new Green Youth leaders: the climate activist Jakob Blasel and the self-proclaimed “leftwing radical” Jette Nietzard. But far from being a reboot, this setup has highlighted deep internal divisions. Since the Greens emerged out of the anti-nuclear, environmental and peace movements of the 1980s and became a serious political player,there has been a riftbetween the party’s pragmatists, known asRealos, and its fundamentalists, orFundis.These old ideological faultlines have reappeared with a vengeance, and follow generational lines. You could practically hear the collective sigh of relief at the top of the party whenNietzard announcedthat she wouldn’t run for the Green Youth leadership again this autumn. She has repeatedly alienated the centrist voter groups the Greens are trying to win back, appearing in clothing imprinted with the anti-police acronym “ACAB” and the anti-capitalist slogan “Eat the rich”. Last monthshe ponderedwhether resistance to any future government coalition containing the far-right AfD should be “intellectual or perhaps with weapons”.Those may be positions shared by other German leftwingers, but that space on the political spectrum is alreadyoccupied by Die Linke, which has recently made gains by taking a more stridently combative position against the right. People as far to the left as Nietzard aremore likely to vote Die Linkethan Green. The two parties are now neck and neck in the polls, with 10-12% each.The new Green leadership is determined to resolve the party’s split personality and find its way back to the centre, and to power. Banaszak wants to put clear blue water between his party and the radical left. He told the German press that “it wasn’t a secret” that he and Nietzard “mostly held different opinions”. With her gone, the new leadership is hoping to restore aRealo-dominated party. To this end they are using the parliamentary summer recess to travel to areas of Germany where the “atmosphere is heated”, astheir campaignput it, especially working-class strongholds in the industrial Ruhr region and the former East Germany.The pair were ridiculed for this initially, especially when Banaszak ensured he was photographedsitting on the floorof a train, even though German politicians have unlimited use of first class. But if the trip helps bring the Green leadership closer to Germany’s political realities, it could be more than just a publicity stunt. On a recent visit to Thuringia, an AfD stronghold in the former East Germany, Banaszak was told by theteenage sonof a Green mayor that “people here think of the Greens as radical climate activists”, but if they see that Green politicians can bring improvements – if “life is breathed back into a village, roads are repaired” – then their reputation might be restored.In the West German industrial town of Duisburg, Brantner pondered whether the Greens lost young male voters by failing to offer a positive place for them. Whenever the concept of masculinity was mentioned, she suggested, it was preceded by the word “toxic”. Such self-criticism is new and important. TheAfD strategyfor coming to power is to provoke a Trump-style polarisation of politics. The Greens will play into their hands if they move further to the left, abandoning the centre ground the AfD seeks to destroy.The AfD are circling like vultures. But in Berlin, I found a new, young left rising against them | Owen JonesRead moreThere is plenty of room for a mainstreamGreen partyin Germany’s political landscape. They could become the country’s foremost centre-left force if they play their cards right, strengthening moderate politics overall. Part of their potential is that they can work with conservatives. The southern state of Baden-Württemberg has been led by the Green Winfried Kretschmann since 2011, and he is popular even with conservative voters, running a coalition with the centre-right CDU – a model that could also work on the federal level.Like it or not, there is a conservative majority in German society looking for an expression of its views on the political stage. The CDU has vowed never to work with the AfD, but this binds them to an increasingly unpopular Social Democratic Party (SPD). Adding a CDU-Green coalition to the range of options would strengthen the centre, and in doing so strengthen a democracy that is under attack. Not to mention that it would also restore environmental concerns to a political culture that appears to have sidelined them.Whether the new Green leaders can take a deeply divided party with them on their path to pragmatic progressivism remains to be seen. But try they must – not just for the sake of their own party, but for the sake of German democracy.Katja Hoyer is a German-British historian and journalist.

So why are people in Victoria so mad?Anna Spargo-RyanJacinta Allan’s plan to legislate the right to flexible work has sent many ‘Office People’ into a panic. But they’re fighting an imaginary enemyThu 7 Aug 2025 21.02 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 02.45 EDTShareIt is suddenly very important to certain Victorians that their laptops have playdates. Every day, the laptops will travel to a communal location, where they will do parallel play for eight hours before returning home again. This is crucial to the survival of traditional values as we know them.The Victorian Labor party has pushed back on this essential social ceremony. At the party’s state conference last weekend,Jacinta Allan announced a plan to protect Victorians’ right to flexible work, “if reasonable”. Essentially, that means people who use computers instead of hammers and Bunsen burners.Allan isn’t suggesting we all hang out in our PJs every day (sadly). If enacted, the proposal would give Victorians the right to spend three days in the office and two days at home (or somewhere else, as long as they have a Teams background that looks like a home).Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThis has upset certain people. After all, a lot can happen in two days. Chicken can go bad. A parcel can be delivered. Workers can defy their employment contracts and watch several seasons of Grey’s Anatomy.Pushback has been quick and fierce. Most of the criticism reasonably centres on Allan’s ability to implement it: various lawyers are quoted as saying it’s unenforceable. The AFR has said it’s a“plan built on hypocrisy”, whileSky News’ commentator called it a “stunt”. Most are – rightly – calling it an obvious election ploy (it would only be implemented in 2026, if Labor is re-elected).Less boringly, The Age referred to“the cynical artistry of legislating to protect something not at risk”. The suggestion is that Allan is campaigning to protect Victorians’ right to keep doing what they’re already doing. Which is wrong, but not in the obvious way.In 2019, before working from home was invented,as many as 30% of Australians worked from home. Almost a third of us understood the specific joy of rolling out of bed and down the hallway instead of spending65 minutesgoing somewhere else.It wasn’t perfect. The Office People found it deeply suspicious: surely grown adults couldn’t be trusted to do any work unless a manager could see them. What if they went shopping? Played with their dog? Or simply napped all day? Despite a total lack of evidence, certain people pushed a narrative that autonomous working was a scam invented by Peter Alexander.The pandemic amplified both the technology and the distrust. Our primary function became video calling. We learnt to dress for work from the waist up. Time trackers went mainstream – and so did mouse jigglers. We invited ourselves to fake meetings so no one would see our Teams “away” status and think we’d skived off to a pub lunch instead of emailing.For the existing 30%, a lot of this was welcome progress. It was no longer weird to see someone’s pet/child/sentient trash pile in the background. The washing finally got done. Children saw their parents before bedtime. And way, way, way less time was wasted on commutes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What if no one ever came back to the office? What if they liked this new life? What if – lord mayor protect us – they never again had to choose between catching the train and not smelling like a toilet? For these and other – secret – reasons,they began to insist people return to the officefull-time.Whatever their reasoning, they are – as ever – fighting an imaginary enemy. Remote working increased during peak Covid but it’s still pretty darn close to the 2019 numbers:36% of Australians usually worked from home in 2024(compared with 40% in 2021). Almost everyone still leaves their house to teach, build, cook, save lives, drive buses, grow food, sell mobile phone plans and, yes, type.A plan – however cynical – to protect flexible working doesn’t enshrine what Covid produced. We can never go back to what we were already doing (being the weird guys who knew how to use the company VPN) and the thing I want to keep doing is quietly typing without being surveilled. This week’s criticism has merely revealed that classic conservative trope: it was already happening. You just didn’t care until you felt personally attacked.Explore more on these topicsVictorian politicsOpinionVictoriaLabor partyLiberal partyJacinta AllanIndustrial relationscommentShareReuse this content"

Jones and Julie Delpy tell allZoe WilliamsFri 8 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareHostage is a political thriller, and observes the conventions in many ways. The pace is absolutely flawless, it’s twisty, it has emotional heft. The British prime minister, Abigail Dalton, played bySuranne Jones, faces her husband, Alex Anderson (Ashley Thomas), being kidnapped. Their marriage is well drawn – “it’s happy, it’s assured, they’re supportive of each other,” Jones says. As we chat in Netflix’s central London offices, she’s always saying five things at once, only one of them out loud. Here, the subtext (I’ve decided) is: it’s actually pretty skilled work, creating a not-schmaltzy, passionate but familiar love match in which all the audience’s hopes and prayers are with the abducted spouse. That’s why normally when fictional politicians are the victims of a family kidnapping, it’s one of their kids.Meanwhile, the French president, Julie Delpy’s Vivienne Toussaint, is also in Britain, is also being blackmailed, and has her own dilemmas: principally, does she go over to the dark side, by echoing the far right on anti-immigrant narratives, or stick to her principles, whatever those may still be.Delpyis hilarious on this, and actually most things. “That’s something I found interesting in the show. Sometimes I wonder, I truly wonder, is there any politician who really has a conscience? I look at Macron – I cannot believe someone with a conscience wouldn’t be questioning themselves, questioning who they have picked [as a cabinet], questioning what’s going on with French politics.” “Youreallywonder whetheranypolitician has a conscience?” I ask, just to be clear. “Well, yes.”View image in fullscreenJulie Delpy as Vivienne Toussaint, the French president in Hostage.Photograph: Kevin Baker/NetflixHostage came about through a lot of to-and-fro betweenMatt Charman, the writer and creator, andSuranne Jones– the pair shared an agent 10 years ago and always got on. He’s most famous forBridge of Spies, which Steven Spielberg directed and the Coen brothers co-wrote, in 2015. “Every time I watch Suranne,” he says, “I’m aware of how relatable and human she is. I thought: ‘OK, if she were prime minister, maybe I would feel differently about political drama. What if we bought ourselves goodwill with someone like Suranne, that would allow an audience just for a second to say: ‘Hang on a minute. Let me hear her out’?”As much as Charman is a storyteller, enamoured of the thriller form, he also has this surprising sense of civic purpose, of using the show to suggest that maybe if we thought of politicians as fully human, they might turn out to be, well, at least human-adjacent. “Someone used the phrase ‘sophisticated protein’, and it’s one of those American phrases that makes you wince, but truthfully it’s quite an interesting formulation. People might enjoy the propulsiveness of the thriller, but they want the values of the lead character to be about something and their backstory to be meaningful.”The result is quite unusual, in so far as – unlike all political thrillers – it doesn’t remind you of any other. It’s a little biting but it’s not House of Cards cynical, it has a breakneck pace but it’s not 24, the dialogue is sharp but never played for laughs. Jones is relatable, patriotic, trying her best, absolutely in love with her kidnapped husband, an almost nostalgic portrait of an idealised prime minister from more innocent times. Delpy is far more worldly, far more compromised, both a better fit for the turbulence of modernity and more likely to be capsized by it. The whole dynamic marches in an interesting syncopation with the real-life politics that unfolded as they shot it, in which the far-right pressures on the European political landscape have become much more pronounced, and through that lens you could squint at it and see it almost as documentary drama. Then there’ll be a giant explosion outside Downing Street or a kidnapper in an eerie mask, and you’re back in the world of the blockbuster summer thriller.“The hardest thing about writing something that’s in dialogue with where we are now,” Charman says, “is that every time something happens in real politics,mainlyyou’re thinking: ‘What does this mean for my kids, is the world OK?’ But on a low level, you’re thinking: ‘Does this mean my drama is going to be out of date when it comes out?’”“I thought it was very clear as a story,” Delpy says. “To me it seemed very accessible, and actually quite entertaining.” She’s a breath of fresh air, talking about her work, never breathy, always surprisingly impartial, like a mother saying about her children: “Yes, the middle one’s quite intelligent, but the youngest, not so much.” She’ll never buy into the idea that politicians are inherently interesting – “at least in France, I’ve never really been amazed by any of them” – and thinks, in some ways, drama is miles from the reality of politics, by definition, because real life has lost the plot.“The way politics works now, is that they bombard you with outrageous things, so that you forget what happened yesterday,” she says. “It’s almost impossible to stand against anything. It’s a very difficult time.” Yet one central theme, the demonisation of migrants for political capital, dominates her character’s arc. “She starts off as someone who isn’t flirting with the extreme right, and she slowly starts to go there – which is something you see happening a little bit to everyone in the centre; they’re not necessarily ideologically far right, but they’re feeling they have to flirt with it, to comply with the perceived demands of the electorate. They think it’s better if we slide to the right to stay in power, rather than having the far right in power. I think they really do believe that, you know.”View image in fullscreenTough at the top …  Deply and Jones in HostagePhotograph: Des Willie/NetflixDrama is making its own, more subtle compromises with the new right, which is to avoid “not just leftwing projects but anything that has any views on social issues at all. Unless it’s pure entertainment with no political consciousness whatsoever, unless it’s The Troll 5, it’s hard to get it made,” Delpy says. “I made a film recently called Meet the Barbarians, it’s about refugees. And it was really hard to find funding for it. And it’s a comedy, it’s really entertaining. Hostage also was not the easiest thing on the planet. Of course they had Netflix, and once you have that all is well, but every project has its hurdle.”Suranne Jones is also an executive producer on Hostage. “I was born with a clipboard,” she says, “literally, came out of my mum’s womb, ticking things off on my to-do list. I have no interest in directing, no interest in telling other actors what to do or my vision. But finding new talent, putting teams together, the writers’ room process, the imagining of what a show could look like, the aftermath – I love all that.” It made her very unprecious about the edit. “I really felt I needed to put the human into the prime minister, constantly. And, actually, we probably edited a lot of that out.”Hostage is plainly female-led, in the sense that the leads are women, as are the two directors – Isabelle Sieb and Amy Neil – but that doesn’t feel like a laboured or radical act. You don’t get the sense that these fictional female leaders have brought an emotional range that men couldn’t possibly have, nor that you’re in an idealised near-future where electorates have finally woken up to the fact that women can be in charge. “In the US, they have this very negative view of women in politics, but it’s not like that in Europe,” Delpy says simply.View image in fullscreenCaptive audience … Ashley Thomas (right) in Hostage.Photograph: Ollie Upton/NetflixIf anything, Hostage makes a subtler gender point, that the differences within the sexes are greater than any between them. “Suranne and Julie present such a different view of what a powerful female leader is,” Charman says. “Julie’s got this incredible directing career, an amazing track record in French and American cinema. And there are not many people who burn as brightly on screen as Suranne. I thought: ‘what would it look like for them to go toe to toe?’”A lot of people have called Hostage the newBodyguard, partly because it’s so satisfying as drama – the way it races, the way it pays off, the way you don’t feel as if you’re being played, even though someone’s always in charge of your emotions and it’s definitely not you. Yet you wouldn’t call it escapist, when so many moments and gestures in it clarify rather than distract from the chaos and impossible choices of the world we’re in. Or, at least, the world we’re in today. Julie Delpy says: “One friend of mine, who survived the second world war, said: ‘Things can always get worse. You think you’re in the worst situation but, unfortunately, there’s always worse than what you think is the worst.’” Against her sardonic pessimism, Charman can sometimes sound almost innocent. “If you can pull the humanity through the thriller all the way to the end, then hopefully you’ve got the journey that you always wanted to go on,” he says, winningly. After all, thrillers needsomeinnocence.Hostage is on Netflix on21 August.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSuranne JonesJulie DelpyDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

And trauma has been twisted to make us blame ourselves. How can we make sense of our lives? The two film-makers try to navigate the chaosByAdam Curtisand Ari Aster, withPaul MacInnesFri 8 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 8 Aug 2025 07.03 EDTShareAri Aster’s new movie,Eddington, pits Joaquin Phoenix against Pedro Pascal as men with conflicting takes on how to get their small town through the crisis of Covid. It’s also a film about the contemporary political crisis in the US and the influence of technology on our lives.Adam Curtis’s latest documentary series, Shifty, covers similar themes but through the lens of British life in the Thatcher years of the late 1970s to early 1990s. This era, he argues, put in place a substantial shift in power away from the individual and the nation state, changes that are still playing out today.Thatcher, Farage and toe-sucking: Adam Curtis on how Britain came to the brink of civil warRead moreEarlier this summer, the two men met in London to discuss the thinking behind their work, the questions that animate them and the corroding power of nostalgia.Ari Aster:My family lives in New Mexico and I grew up there; it’s where I spent my adolescence. In 2020 a Covid scare brought me back home and I was in a situation where a lot of the people closest to me were in totally different algorithms. We couldn’t reach each other.In early June, when the fever reached its highest pitch, I started writing down what I perceived to be in the air. I didn’t know whether things were about to explode and boil over, or if we would ever come out of lockdown, but I could tell that something was happening. I’ve also always wanted to make a film about New Mexico. And so it kind of became a western.Adam Curtis:A thing I really like about the film is the sense that, up to that point, there was somehow a daddy in the room. Then, when Covid happens, Daddy leaves and all these groups are on their own. All the last vestiges of power, or big power, just disappeared. They can no longer see what they have in common.AA:They’re all connected in that they all care about the world, and they all know that something is wrong. But that’s where the connection ends. I wanted them all to be distinguished by a yearning for the America they believe in, but they’re not living on the same plane.View image in fullscreenFighting for our lives … Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal in Eddington.Photograph: BFA/AlamyAC:That’s the point where you start from: Daddy’s gone, they’re all on their own, they all have a dream of America, but they’re like billiard balls: they keep on hitting each other. And each time they hit each other they amplify each other’s version of reality and it just gets crazy.AA:Yeah, they’re all paranoid. And as those billiard balls start knocking into each other, I wanted the film itself to also become gripped by that paranoia. I was trying to take a capacious, objective stance in the beginning, and then that objectivity kind of falls away. I don’t know if the film is apolitical or if it’s omnipolitical, but all those fantasies of what is happening start to take over the film. That’s the idea.AC:If you have a world in which everyone is encouraged to be a total individualist, they tend to get trapped in that mindset. It’s wonderful when things are going well, because you, your own desires and thoughts are the centre of the world. But the moment things go wrong, you retreat into yourself. And the only thing you can trust is your own ideas. You come to believe in them intensely, because that’s the only thing that makes you feel safe. And I think that’s where we are now.What has happened is that we have become totally atomised and cannot reach each otherAri AsterInShifty, I was tracing the roots of that in Britain and I was trying to do it sympathetically. And Ari, I don’t think that in Eddington you apply the normal righteous disapproval of so many films today, either. You actually take the characters on their own terms. You might not sympathise, but you get an understanding of why people have retreated into their own world and will not accept any other reality. I think you’re dealing with what comes next.AA:They’re all unmoored, but they’re clinging to some buoy. Shifty really excited me because it felt like a mirror from the past. It was shocking to see how all these things that feel unprecedented right now are actually the current reverberation of something that started a long time ago. It’s just that the technology has changed, and because these things have been getting amplified for so long, the distortions have become more intense.AC:The most difficult thing to do, especially in our time, is make the recent past unfamiliar. It’s almost impossible. And that’s the task I set myself. It’s a bit like the Mona Lisa. If you point it out to someone, they don’t see it. They go: “Oh yeah, that’s the Mona Lisa.” They don’t look at it at all.View image in fullscreenBreaking out of the bubble … Ari Aster on the set of Eddington.Photograph: Richard ForemanWhat you want to do is find a way of breaking that. It’s how you edit the stuff a lot of you have lived through together, to make you look at it fresh. If you just live in a world of continuous fragmentation, the past never has a moment to settle down. In previous eras, you would have all those fragments of experience, but over 20 or 30 years, which is the length of time I was dealing with, most of those fragments would just disappear, leaving a few to settle down, out of which would come an agreed narrative about history.Instead, today we live in a world where those fragments are continually played back to us, as you show in the movie. I think that’s why people find it very difficult to understand how trapped they’ve become in their own world, because they have no story that explains how they got there. What you get is a continuous political narrative which says: politicians rise up, they prove to be shit, and they fall. That’s all we’re told these days.AA:Eddington is a movie about the environment. It’s not a movie that says: “This is the way to think, this is the way to feel, this is what’s happening.” Because what has happened is that we have become totally atomised and cannot reach each other. And as long as that persists – which a lot of people have a lot invested in – nothing can change. Hopefully by being a little bit more egalitarian in the way I’m assessing the landscape with as much objectivity as I can muster, I can reach some people that have been totally alienated by my side of the culture.AC:A good political film makes people reflect on themselves. The problem is that over the past 30 or 40 years, the movies that call themselves political have actually been the very opposite. They groom their audiences by saying to them: “You are right to think and believe the way you do.” In that way, they encourage people to wallow in their self-righteousness and so block any self-reflection. Which means that so many “radical movies” are actually reactionary.View image in fullscreen‘Nobody believes in the future any more’ … Emma Stone, Pedro Pascal, Ari Aster, Joaquin Phoenix and Austin Butler at Cannes film festival in May.Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty ImagesThere is no way forward unless people actually reflect on the limitations of their own self-righteousness and the possible dangers it has for society. That includes well-meaning liberals as much as it includes extreme rightwingers or tech-bro conspiracy theorists: it stops them realising that everyone might be part of a new system of power which works through increasing fragmentation and increasingly shrill self-righteousness. And I think it should be a badge of pride if you, Ari Aster, get that self-righteousness to squawk at you with Eddington. It’ll prove that you’ve done it right.AA:There’s a feedback loop of nostalgia. Not just nostalgia and trauma. We’re always looking back into the past to see why we are here right now. “Oh, it’s because this happened to me.” As opposed to – and this is what you’ve been talking about for ever – where is the new idea? Where is our vision of the future? Because nobody believes in the future any more. I don’t believe in the future, and I’m desperately looking for it.AC:You’re right about trauma. Increasingly over the last four or five years, people have retreated into themselves and are blaming their own past. They’re not only playing back the music or films of the past, they’re playing back their own past and finding in those fragments of their memory the reasons why they are feeling bad, anxious, uncertain, afraid and lonely – and it’s given the term trauma. Trauma is a very specific, real and frightening for those who experience it. But recently it’s been widened to such an extent that you are blaming yourself all the time through your own reworking of the past. Rather like AI goes back and reworks the past and plays it back to you. Now you’re doing that to yourself.The universe is not exclusively rational. It’s full of strange swirling waves of feeling and ghosts and myths that are often completely unrealAdam CurtisAA:All the characters in Eddington are living in different movies. The film is a western, right? But Joe [Joaquin Phoenix’s character, the sheriff of Eddington] would have seen all the westerns. That’s a huge part of his identity and what informs everything he does, including having become a sheriff in the first place. The way he walks is informed by the way John Wayne walks. He’s a 50-year-old man, so the action movies of the 80s and 90s would have been important to him. And then at the end of the movie, he gets to live in his own action movie. He’s shooting at phantoms. But that applies to every character in this film. The one thing that is definitely happening in Eddington is that a hyperscale datacentre is being built. And really, all of the stories in Eddington are just data, from one perspective.AC:Don’t give it away!AA:OK, sorry. Yes, I won’t give it away. But you’re right. There are other things outside they don’t see.AC:The most important thing that political film-making should do now is make us aware that there’s something else beyond – including beyond the internet. Everything now in movies really comes through the internet. But we know, logically, that the internet is not everything. There is something else there, but no one’s telling us about it.What I really like about Eddington is at the end you say there is something else outside. Something beyond the thin crust of hysteria and fear that keeps all of us trapped in bubbles today.People only search for conspiracy theories these days because no one else is giving them any stories. You know: those in power just want to manage you. And, quite frankly, managers never tell stories. They keep you there by repeating and repeating. So that’s why people don’t trust them and the most important thing to do is to acknowledge that.View image in fullscreen‘Shooting at phantoms’ … Joaquin Phoenix in Eddington.Photograph: Richard Foreman/Joe Cross/Mayor LLCThat’s why I call my series Shifty. That actually, nothing is certain and the only way you can deal with that as a journalist is by acknowledging it and trying to explain why the world feels like that today.The organisation I work for – the BBC – has created BBC Verify to try to reassert certainty. It is important because rationality is still the only thing we have to manage the complexity of the world. But on its own terms it’s not enough, because the universe is not exclusively rational. It’s also full of all kinds of strange swirling waves of feeling and ghosts and myths that are often completely unreal.A confident system of power takes all those mad psychodramas and creates a dominant story out of them. But when that goes – as has happened today – they run out of control sweeping through societies, creating uncertainty and suspicion.BBC Verify is important but it’s not enough because the universe is not exclusively rationalAdam CurtisWhat journalism and films should be trying to do today is to explain how that has happened – to acknowledge that uncertainty is the realism of our time because that is how people experience the world today. If you don’t do that, the people in their bubbles will be very suspicious of you. Because they know that we the journalists and the politicians and all the experts suffer from that same uncertainty. And we know that they know that. And that becomes toxic.AA:Certainty has gone for ever now. With the advent of deepfake and AI-generated imagery, belief in what we’re seeing and hearing is now forever gone.AC:Which means that the most radical thing to do is to say the only way we’re going to move forward is by bypassing all those things, movies, most popular culture, as evidence of the future. It’s a lovely nostalgic world you can go and play in. But actually, real politics, real moving forward, it’s going to come somewhere else, where the complexity of reality might be repossessed in a really fundamental way. I’ve got no idea what it is, but it ain’t going to come through movies or me making pretentious television programmes. It’s just not.Eddington is released in the UK on 22 AugustExplore more on these topicsAri AsterAdam CurtisCoronavirusJoaquin PhoenixPedro PascalMargaret ThatcherinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In common with the Morgan and Graham dramas, it is set around a notable television interview.The early realisation in TV that millions of viewers would happily sit on sofas to watch celebrities chatting on chairs meant that the role of talkshow host – Jack Paar,Johnny Carson,David Frost,Michael Parkinson– soon evolved a breed of alpha guests:Peter Ustinov, Kenneth Williams, Robin Williams and, in America, Oscar Levant, a classical pianist and movie supporting actor (An American in Paris) who became a waspish and risque late-night anecdotalist.Wright imagines a 1958 encounter betweenPaar(Ben Rappaport) and Levant (Sean Hayes), in which, just before a ratings-crucial broadcast, the presenter discovers that his star guest, who will also play out the show at the piano, has recently been committed to a mental health facility. Scenes of off-air and on-air tension alternate.As in the 1996 movieShine– also turning on whether a psychiatric patient will succeed with a complex piano piece – there is a risk of glorifying the myth that men (as they generally are) with identified conditions can do much what they want. Also, in a play that explicitly hymns integrity and honesty in the entertainment industry, it feels queasy that the events depicted in Good Night, Oscar never occurred as shown.Levant was once released from a mental health facility to guest on a quiz show but the play’s fictional transference of this incident to The Tonight Show on its first transmission from the west coast injects false jeopardy and adds to a sense of moral confusion.View image in fullscreenTension on and off air … Ben Rappaport as Jack Paar, with Sean Hayes as Oscar Levant.Photograph:  /Johan PerssonWright follows the standard stance of stage plays set in television – also found in Sorkin’s screen-about-screen work, The Newsroom andStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip– that a potentially beautiful and influential medium is ruined by greedy and censorious executives. That’s a fair view but in Good Night, Oscar the spoilsport NBC honcho must decide whether someone is physically fit to appear. Audiences encouraged to despise network chief Bob Sarnoff (Richard Katz) for trying to keep a seriously unwell man off air would perhaps soon join calls for the sacking of broadcast bosses who failed in their “duty of care” by allowing such a vulnerable person to broadcast now.As Levant, Hayes gives a performance of such busyness – twitches, tics, lip curls, cigarette business – that you wonder if the stage has a fast-forward button. He also, in the moment that surely guaranteed his Tony award, delivers the piano climax live at a Steinway with exceptional panache. Lisa Peterson’s slick, whizzy production, co-starring Rosalie Craig as Levant’s wife June, is a thrilling theatrical experience but, perhaps perversely for a play arguing for television to be more serious, does not bear looking at too closely.At the Barbican theatre, London, until 21 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreTalk showsMental healthUS televisionTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The more you see, the higher the bar rises, but the itch to be astounded is never scratched. A handful of magicians at the Edinburgh fringe have audiences queueing around the block, but there are more than 100 to take a punt on, in the hope that the next show might be the one to blow you away.In an unglamorous venue,Andrew Frost’s tricks are not flashy and there are no dramatic lighting changes. But the tricks are phenomenally well controlled. Frost is a former woodwork teacher, and you can envisage him winning over a class of reluctant teenagers. He admits an hour-long show of card tricks isn’t the sexiest draw, but his unserious attitude and impressive sleight of hand easily keep the audience entertained. As soon as you think you might know what or where a certain card is, he is five steps ahead and your certainty disintegrates.View image in fullscreenImpressive sleight of hand … Andrew Frost: The Greatest Card Magician in the World.Photograph: Adam HillThe show’s title, Andrew Frost: The Greatest Card Magician in the World, is tongue-in-cheek, taken from a more hesitantly worded review. Saying the phrase weighs on him nevertheless, Frost determines to offload the crown to one of us instead. The key to a good card trick, Frost tells us, is to capture the hearts of the audience and then to find a satisfying way of finding their selected card. Simple. Deciding he doesn’t quite fit the bill of the heart-stealer, he brings in a volunteer for a dashing finale, letting them, with their nervous excitement, be the one to capture our hearts. Aided by his delighted makeshift assistant, this is a solid hour of intimate, absorbing card magic.Ava Beaux puts more emphasis on the narrative for her show, wrapping tricks around a whimsical story of witches’ familiars and dual identity. Performed as part of the free fringe,Ava & Beaux: Tales of Magichas moments of impressive mind reading, with a baffling trick based around a hidden squirrel. Flatter sequences rely on a ubiquitous shop-bought trick like metal rings, where the secret doesn’t feel buried deep enough to be worth digging for. The story sometimes trips her up, getting in the way of the magic, and leaving little room for tricks between the tale, but her charm wins over the room.The standout section inJames Phelan’s show, The Man Who Was Magic, is a riveting stuck-in-the-mud drill with one audience member reading the mind of another. Even more fascinating for the fact that it doesn’t work on the first attempt, it’s a glimpse into Phelan’s skill in mentalism, though surprisingly little use is made of this throughout. Phelan frames his show by weaving a slight story about dreaming of performing magic as a kid. With handwritten notes conjuring the idea of manifesting your future, he creates a sweet moment encouraging a nine-year-old from the audience to do the same.The rest of the show doesn’t live up to the standard expected from the award-winning magician who predicted the lottery. The show doesn’t stretch into the enormous space of McEwan Hall, with the audience in the circle largely ignored. He needs a camera for the more fiddly sections in such a large theatre, while some parts of the show feel as if they are still being road-tested.Phelan is a genial performer and deftly handles the trickier customers in the crowd, but something about this show feels blase, missing much of the buildup that comes before the release. With a predictable finale about prediction, the setup is fumbled this afternoon, robbing the trick of some of its power to thrill. For such an acclaimed magician, this show aches for more invention.View image in fullscreenGenial … James Phelan: The Man Who Was MagicThen we come to the queue that doesn’t just go around the theatre but out of the square, over the road and into a car park.Ben Hartis a fringe favourite for a reason. It is common sense that a magician will only touch an object on stage when they are up to something, because every trick seems more impossible when even the idea of the magician’s interference is hard to comprehend. Hart quickly dispels any cynics by letting us be the ones who touch, hold and shuffle. “Look at my hands,” he reminds us. “Watch my sleeves.” Overhearing someone doubting that he put an important object into an important bag, he does the action again, this time standing back and letting an audience member do the honours.The Remarkable Ben Hart presents a “best of” compilation with sleight of hand, mentalism, card magic and other harder-to-categorise tricks. Hart gives us plenty of showmanship but doesn’t waste much time inventing a story to neatly tie everything together, preferring to leap straight in with what we’re all here to see. With his personable, waggish manner, a few of Hart’s tricks are almost casually jaw-dropping. He acts surprised when something entirely and definitely solid disappears right in front of our eyes. “Do you know,” he says, with a little smirk of delight at our gasps, “I have no idea how that works.” A few of his setups are less spectacularly weighty than others, but the sense of wonder never wavers.In the extravagant Palais du Variété, Hart’s production has an old-world charm, particularly as a mighty storm threatens to rip the tent away during the performance. “The spirits are with us,” Hart jokes as the tent billows. You get the sense the audience would be happy if the storm kept us stuck in here all night.Andrew Frost: The Greatest Card Magician in the World is at10 Dome at Pleasance Domeuntil 25 August; Ava & Beaux: Tales of Magic is atSpeakeasy at PBH’s Free Fringe @ Voodoo Roomsuntil 24 August; James Phelan: The Man Who Was Magic is atMcEwan Hall at Underbelly, Bristo Square, until 13 August, thentouring the UK until March 2026; The Remarkable Ben Hart is atPalais du Variété at Assembly George Square Gardensuntil 24 August, thentouring the UK until April 2026.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025MagicEdinburgh festivalTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)FestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Soft focus trees form a velvety blue-green sanctuary for a mill whose dilapidation and decay strikes Boucher as delightfully picturesque. In fact, it doesn’t look like a real place at all but a dreamy idyll, inspired by Chinese landscape scenes which were hugely popular in 18th-century Europe. You can picture Boucher’s aristocratic clients delighting in this view of country life and even having a water mill like this one built as a garden folly beside their water feature.

You’re probably familiar with the sins: the first is employing it as a filler word, to give you time to think: “I was, like, trying to speak in a socially acceptable way.” The second is using it to mean “said”, as in: “My English teacher was like, ‘Don’t talk like that.’” And the third is using it to denote approximation: “People who police the word are all, like, a million years old.”Yet, we all made it to adulthood despite the verbal carnage; many of us even have jobs that require communication. Now that millennials are, like, becoming the establishment, will the stigma against the word disappear?Megan C Reynolds, a millennial and author of Like: A History of the World’s Most Hated (And Misunderstood) Word, says part of what older generations rejected about “like” – as with so much language – was its relative newness during our childhoods, which “probably made them feel old”. The controversial use of the word came to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, though it has beenevolving since the year 1200, according to the linguist Alexandra D’Arcy. Today it is a firm part of the English lexicon, stretching from its inescapability onLove Island, to its role as the title of an Ice Spice EP (Like..?), to its regular employment by NPR’s “erudite, measured” interviewer Terry Gross, whohas been praisedfor using “like” as “stepping stones within sentences, on which she presses her weight, pivots, and tucks into her point”.The way we tell stories now is fundamentally different because we make space for feeling as well as factsMegan C Reynolds, author of LikeReynolds argues that, as millennials begin to dominate the workforce, “the usage of ‘like’ will soon be the status quo.”Languageevolves, generally for the better, she writes. Contrary to what our grade school teachers might have suggested, there are no real linguistic laws. The only language police are self-appointed.Still, using the word carries some embarrassment. As Reynolds and others point out, much of the vitriol directed at “like” is tied to its association with young women, beginning with the 1980s stereotype of the valley girl – a teen in the Los Angeles suburbs who, God forbid, enjoyed shopping. It’s true, researchers have found, thatyoung women in particularplay a leading role in shaping our language. But at the same time, as Reynolds writes: “The policing of the way women speak – which, in turn, makes women feel as if they need to police themselves, often subconsciously – is a sport that will never get old.”Why do people, like, say, ‘like’ so much?Read moreThat internalization, along with the history of finger-wagging, can make things difficult. “I have a friend who works for the FBI – she works with a lot of men – and has said that her father used to tell her to not say ‘like’ a lot, and it’s been sort of drilled in her head,” Reynolds says.It all leaves the word in a sort of purgatory – no longer condemned outright yet not fully embraced. That makes this an opportune moment for Reynolds’s book, which, despite the “history” in its title, might better be described as a series of meditations on the word. Reynolds reflects, of course, on Love Island and Terry Gross, as well as influencer culture, films ranging from My Fair Lady to Clueless (a movie exposing the misguidedness of the valley girl stereotype), and the different ways we use language, from texting with friends to emailing across the office (where we shift into what she calls “corporate drag”, with all its reaching out, circling back and touching base).But what’s most memorable about the book is Reynolds’s celebration of the word’s unique ability to grease the wheels of communication. “Like”, she argues, actually improves our ability to relate our experiences.For one thing, it allows us to combine words and feelings in a story. As D’Arcy tells Reynolds in the book: “The simple story that has been told about ‘like’ is that it came in and replaced ‘say’.” In fact, things are more complex: with “like”, “people started quoting way more than speech. And, in particular, they started quoting those internal states” – what they felt rather than what they actually said. So you might tell a friend: “My boss was like, ‘What the hell is wrong with you?’” when in fact the boss’s language was far more polite. But this more colorful version perhaps relates both the boss’s tone and how it made you feel, with the word “like” signaling to the listener that they shouldn’t take us literally.As Reynolds writes: “The way we tell stories now is fundamentally different because we make space for feeling as well as facts.”a book coverMeanwhile, when we discuss thorny topics, the word offers a chance to pause, and perhaps pivot or soften our language. “Not every situation requires a hammer,” Reynolds writes. “‘Like’ smooths the edges from strong, sharp, uncomfortable emotions, lowering the intensity until it feels more manageable.” Or, as she puts it in conversation: “It is just really hard to say complicated emotional things directly.” The word “gives you a minute to get your shit together mentally and also lets the other person know that you are getting your shit together”.Most of all, Reynolds doesn’t want people to beat themselves up. “I would argue that saying ‘like’ a lot is not the thing you should be upset at yourself for,” she says. “So if I could disabuse anyone of that notion, then my job is done.”In any case, there’s plenty of newgen Z slangto be frightened by instead.Explore more on these topicsBooksLanguageWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The floor’s open. Someone goes in for their second round, buying me some time with a two-step, a dribble and out. Another agonising pause. I know Tiger’s looking at me – he’s not going to let me get out of this, so I jump in. I’d been working on my running man, but the two‑step is my anchor now. And I just keep two-stepping. It’s fitful, it’s awkward, it’s out of time – but I’mdoingit, footworking in the middle of a dance circle. “You’re part of the culture now!” beams Tiger, as I jitterbug back to the sidelines.It’s my first time attending a footwork practice session, led by the instructor Tiger in the foyer of Central Saint Martins art college in London. I heard about these sessions through an “open decks” night dedicated to footwork, the furiously fast and bassy style of dance music from Chicago. The dance actually came before the music, but that part of it has never really caught on in the UK. Times are changing, though. Not since flailing to dubstep at university have I felt so enthused by the dancing side of club music.From the twist in the 60s to themigraine skankin the 00s, music fans have always loved to throw down moves – and surely the point of going to a nightclub is to dance. But nowadays that’s often far from the case. Phones have turned clubs into vehicles for social media content, with some DJs becoming exasperated at the way that punters – who often stand still, filming big-screen visuals, or each other – seem more interested in documenting the night than dancing.View image in fullscreen‘You feel invested in the event’ … Bristol Northern Soul Club.Photograph: Barnaby ChinnockThis can create a vibe-killing feedback loop. “I asked some friends why they don’t dance in public and some said because of the fear of being filmed,” the rapper Tyler, the Creator recently posted by way of introduction to his dance‑focused new album,Don’t Tap the Glass. “I thought: damn, a natural form of expression and a certain connection they have with music is now a ghost.”In Britain, it’s also getting harder to go out clubbing at all, due to the cost of living crisis and a drop in the number of nightclubs – about 400 have closed in the past five years. So, across the country, grassroots dance communities are countering this by creating safe spaces for people to learn new moves and feel emboldened to share them on the dancefloor. “People need something to do on a night out,” says Eve Burgsoul, who co-runsBristol Northern Soul Clubwith Levanna McLean. Dancing, she says, means “they areinthe experience”.Northern soul spun out of the Twisted Wheel nightclub in Manchester in the 60s before spreading to Wigan, Blackpool and Stafford in the 70s and generating an entire subculture of British people spinning, dipping and doing other elaborate moves to obscure, uptempo US soul music. It survived as a hobby for older generations, but Bristol NorthernSoulClub, and other nights like it, have galvanised a younger crowd. Their videos of McLean shuffling to soul classics and pop songs on the streets of Bristol have been such a hit that they have gained traction worldwide. “We’re viral in Russia because our dancing got remixed to a techno song,” says Burgsoul.Clubbers at Bristol Northern Soul Club nights learn the basics of keeping time and focusing on their feet. Knowing even some rudimentary moves means that “rather than standing there with a drink, waiting for someone to talk to you, you’ve got something to do”, says Burgsoul. “You feel invested in the event,” adds McLean.Learning to dance opens you up to whole new communities – something those in the ballroom scene know intimately. In the US, ballroom culture has provided solidarity for Black and Latin LGBTQ+ people since the 60s; the dancerLes Childformed the first British vogue collective, the House of Child, in the 80s. These houses can serve as surrogate families for community members estranged from their biological relations, as well as teams that perform for renown and cash prizes.It has lineage … you’re entering a community that’s larger than that moment in timeVogue is an integral feature of these balls. It’s a sharp battle dance consisting of five basic elements: spins and dips, duckwalk, catwalk, hands and floor. Smily discovered ballroom after he was disowned by his family at 17 and happened upon a vogue class at Studio 25 in Manchester, hosted by the ballroom dancer andManchester Ballroom Community(MBC) founder Sacha 007. Smily immediately took to the acrobatic style. “Voguing was a wholesome release of dopamine for me,” he says. “I channelled my energy into every move and people enjoyed it. Eventually, I went on to walk in Paris.”Smily now runs MBC and hosts open sessions where newbies pay to learn the basic elements of vogue. MBC has a large pool of beginners keen to walk balls, but nowhere for them to perform, since most vogue events happen in London and many can’t afford the trip. “Manchester definitely needed more queer, trans, Black and POC [people of colour] spaces,” says Smily. With money from the workshops and other fundraising events, MBC has managed to throw a few balls in Manchester and now hosts one of the city’s first OTA (open to all) vogue nights.View image in fullscreen‘Manchester needed more queer, trans, Black and POC spaces’ … Manchester Ballroom Community.Photograph: Courtesy:  Daniel QuansahPartnerships such as these are bringing dance out of the studio and into public spaces. In London, the footwork promoter 160 Unity has joined forces with After Werks, the class I attend, resulting in dance circles at the front of their last two nights in London. “The footwork crew has brought something to dance music that I’ve yearned for so long: communal dance,” says Chris Kanski, a 160 Unity punter and After Werks regular. He arrived at After Werks from a background in hardcore punk and metal. “Footwork nights give that spontaneous expression and that challenge that’s so special in hardcore punk. There are eyes on you and people are looking both at what you express and what you can do.”The same feeling is evident in the UK jazz dance scene, which took off in the 70s as teenagers began leaping, stomping and skipping to the sounds of acid jazz and Latin fusion at clubs such as Chaplins in Birmingham. The craze migrated south, where DJs such asGilles Petersonturned London into the new mecca of UK jazz dance with his nights at Dingwalls.View image in fullscreen‘There’s nothing like playing to an active audience who are really feeling the music’ … jazz dance sessions at Come Sunday in Birmingham.Photograph: @valere_nakasilaIt endures today. At the Bath House community building in London, I witness the jazz dance luminary Masumi Endo work tirelessly to encourage bystanders on to the floor for Jazzy Sport London’sNo Nation Under a Grooveparty, which brings together three dance communities: After Werks, Epic Jam (breakdance) and Footnotes (jazz dance). By the end of the evening, the dancing spirit has reached such a fever pitch that the whole room is moving together in one bubbling cauldron of styles.“There’s nothing like playing to an active audience who are sweating their tits off and really feeling the music,” says Jayson Wynters, who DJs at the jazz dance event Come Sunday atHockley Social Clubin Birmingham alongside Nick Schlittner. One of Come Sunday’s main challenges has been holding on to their young dancers, many of whom move to London in search of job opportunities in TV and theatre.

That was 18 years ago; he wonders whether “DJs and promoters should reach out to dancers more”.When they do, the effect can be intoxicating: earlier this year, he was the star of the night when the footwork legendsRP BooandDJ Spinnplayed at Venue MOT in south London. “If I’m doing the Biz Markie” – an old-school hip-hop move – “next to you in the club, I can show you what to do,” he says. And while he believes dancers are inherently free in expression, he argues that knowing some basic moves allows you to have the most amount of fun on the dancefloor.‘By 8pm it is time to head home’: whatever happened to the big night out?Read moreHe’s not wrong. My two-step has kept me occupied during an average club night on Rye Lane in Peckham, London, and my erk’n’jerks – another footwork move – have left me exhausted and elated after a particularly sweaty set in Bermondsey.

You need to play football to keep progressing in the story mode of a classic survival horror game.”The plot goes like this: Earth’s core has become a nest of colossal twisted serpents due to an event called the Transmigration, which saw an invasion of monsters from a dark and forbidden civilisation. Now, the bowels of the world churn with insatiable horror – like the terraces at Old Trafford come the Manchester derby. There’s an array of modes – one player, third-person horror, story, competitive and online – and whichever you go for, you’ll want to arm your team with serial killers, sectarians and psychopathic nurses to play at stadiums including the Backrooms, Sematary Hill and Chainsaws United.

The boards of the stage are dug up with a plough at the start – a sign of things to come. A chicken is bashed in a sack as part of a pagan sacrifice (the real chicken remains unharmed), a naked man emerges from within an animal’s carcass and there is an apocalyptic landscape of erupting pineapples.It’s wacky, but stays just on the right side of reckless. Directed by Stef Aerts, Joé Agemans, Thomas Verstraeten and Marie Vinck, and part of the Edinburgh international festival, this is a wordless piece, based on muscular movement and stunning live music composed by Joachim Badenhorst and Sean Carpio. The arresting scenes mark the arc of human progress, from the taking up of tools onwards. When the industrial age dawns, a steam engine is shown with human limbs wrapped around it, as if they are extensions of the machine.The title refers to a poem by Hesiod on agrarian culture, for what that’s worth, but the narrative stays oblique. Yet you feel the changing mood. There are revels and fertility rites when actors’ trousers are unbuttoned, skirts raised. One couple literally roll in a sack. Spiritual ceremonies are enacted, too, and spinning around fire.There is a construction phase, with nature tamed and a chorus of hammers on wood, a storm of sawdust. A house-like structure is erected from this industriousness. Civilisation arrives as animals are gutted, with fluttering red scarves standing in for blood and viscera. Performers, including Aerts, Agemans, Verstraeten and Vinck, plus Susan De Ceuster, Geert Goossens, Fumiyo Ikeda and Maryam Sserwamukoko, are as physical as dancers.View image in fullscreenCivilisation arrives … Works and Days.Photograph: Kurt van der ElstThere is an almost constant shaking, pounding, swirling on stage, and beauty, too, in some of the scenes, but it is invariably interrupted by savagery – a large animal, maybe an elephant, is eviscerated and strung up – or a violent sound.The sonic effects are enthralling, with instruments used in original ways: two flutes taped together, a table harp and saxophone that sounds like a didgeridoo, six Tibetan singing bowls fused as one and played with a bow and mallet … The music is inspired by Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, but seems so much stranger. The lighting, by Aerts, Agemans and Ken Hioco, is magnificent, too, with swarms of blackness and columns of light.Is this theatre, installation or dance? Who knows. As indefinable as it may be, it arrests. AI raises its head in the final moments. It is funny but unnerving.

Shakespeare’sKing Lear, for example, remains open to interpretation. Its story of a retiring king bequeathing his lands to his daughters before descending into madness can, in the right hands, engage with many themes in the modern day including dementia.It was not really necessary for writer-director Dan Colley to construct a whole new play about it, but that is what the Irish theatre-maker has done in Lost Lear. Venetia Bowe plays a retired actor, now resident in a care home, whose memory has faded in every respect apart from a word-perfect recall of Shakespeare’s play. To keep her relaxed, the staff take on the parts of Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and the Fool as she loops repeatedly through her favourite scenes of parental regret.The idea recalls Enda Walsh’sThe Walworth Farce, in which a family protect themselves from the outside world by endlessly performing a shaky comedy, and it has a similar interest in mental decline.The difficulty with plays on this theme is that dementia is a mental state, not a dramatic question. You can evoke the dislocation it creates, as well as the sense of loss and frustration it leaves for loved ones, but you cannot resolve it.In a classy production, Lost Lear evokes it well. Joined by Peter Daly, Manus Halligan, Em Ormonde and Clodagh O’Farrell on Andrew Clancy’s institutional set, Bowe is the youthful woman trapped in an elderly body that we see only as the show progresses. First, we know her for her exacting standards, her brusque disregard for anyone but herself and her facility with language. Only later do we see her as a fragile old woman. Nothing can change, but the play has a sentimental appeal.At theTraverse, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalKing LearTraverse theatreDementiaMental healthreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now from another corner of south London comes its near-namesake Accessible Pigeon Material, by Lewisham export Toussaint Douglass. Dry your eyes, mate? OK, Douglass’s compendium of autobiography and bird gags may not reduce you to tears. But it’s an eye-catching hour from an act with a distinctive line in do-things-his-own-way comedy.Eccentricity is relative, of course. Douglass promises (or should that be threatens?) that pigeons, pigeons and more pigeons will be all we’re getting, and, to stress the point, there’s one circulating the stage strapped to a remote-controlled car. Pigeon facts are then scattered like seed by a man with an outsized zeal for our feathered not-always-friends. But the show soon deviates from the avian theme, towards something more conventional for a standup debut: a “this is me” account of where Douglass comes from and what his life looks like. Dressed “like a croupier” at primary school and reared by his beloved gran, AKA “87-year-old flatmate”, he’s now starting a family with his partner (cue a fine gag about why he can’t use the word “girlfriend”), and still untangling his relationship with his emotionally absent dad.The disconnect between macho parent and misfit kid is the scab Douglass keeps picking atThe latter is embodied by a glove puppet of a boxer, deployed in a comically awkward father-son role play with a member of the audience. The disconnect between macho parent and misfit kid is the scab Douglass keeps picking at in a set that makes peace, finally, with his neurodivergence.Again, the show leans on one or two familiar structural props to make that point. And not all of its jokes land. But many do (one about easy peelers; another about wanting to die alone), occasionally because dismayed Douglass bellows the punchlines at us over and again until we acquiesce. That’s just what he has to do to get us normies to connect with his dotty way of seeing. It works: after a lifetime of ill-fitting introversion, Douglass has cracked how to make the inside of his mind seem not just accessible, but a very fun place to spend time.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalNeurodiversityreviewsShareReuse this content"

One of them asked a colleague stationed at one of the entry doors to the auditorium not to let Cauthery in.The couple were left standing in the foyer for 15 minutes before a supervisor arrived, overruled the earlier decision and said the couple could attend the concert after all.“We felt extremely upset, not to say humiliated, by their behaviour towards us. I’m a middle-class ex-public school boy brought up to believe that Brits are decent and law abiding and that one can live one’s life freely,” Cauthery said.“I was merely showing solidarity with the Palestinian people and expressing my support for what I believe, and the UN believes, is a legitimate state. My wife and I feel strongly that Palestine should be recognised as a state and indeed it seems thatour government is finally about to do so.“I have lived inLondonall my adult life and am very proud of the diversity of my city. It is tragic that this small pin badge should be seen as a threat to the Royal Albert Hall which surely should be one of the symbols of our democracy. The result of this incident was that we were too distressed to enjoy the concert and left at the interval.”View image in fullscreenThe chief executive of the Royal Albert Hall said: ‘We have also spoken to our contractor to ensure that a similar situation doesn’t arise again.’Photograph: Grant Rooney Premium/AlamyAfter being contacted by the Guardian, James Ainscough, the chief executive of the Royal Albert Hall, issued an apology to the couple.He said: “I have written to apologise to Mr and Mrs Cauthery, who were initially halted at the door on Friday by one of our contractors. This isn’t in line with our policy and was a mistake. The duty manager who stepped in to resolve the situation was correct to authorise their subsequent entrance.“As well as writing to apologise for an experience that was understandably upsetting and humiliating, we have offered a full refund and an invitation to return to the hall as our guests, so we can give the couple the warm welcome that was sadly lacking on Friday.“We have also spoken to our contractor to ensure that a similar situation doesn’t arise again.”Cauthery said he would donate the refunded ticket fee to the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, which Ainscough said was “laudable”.In a letter of apology to the couple, Ainscough said: “Music has an enduring power to bring people together, and we want the Hall to offer a warm welcome to all who come to enjoy our concerts. It is very sad to think that your experience with us on Friday was the very opposite of that. I do hope you will consider returning to the hall in the near future so we have an opportunity to give you the warm welcome you should expect.”Cauthery said: “I’m very grateful to RAH for responding in this way. Of course we will continue to go and enjoy concerts there.”Explore more on these topicsRoyal Albert HallPalestinian territoriesGazaLondonPromsProms 2025FestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The news of her engagement to another man brought “bitter disappointment” – as he puts it in the letter.In what may be allusions to both lost love and opium, he says in the letter: “My delirious imagination had early concentrated all hopes of happiness in one point – an unattainable point! This circumstance has produced a dreaminess of mind, which too often makes me forgetful of others’ feelings.”He thanks Dyer for “a very flattering review of a very indifferent composition of mine”, The Fall of Robespierre, a three-act play that Coleridge and Robert Southey wrote with the intention of raising funds for “pantisocracy”. This was a scheme to found a commune in rural Pennsylvania with 12 men and 12 women who would marry and bring up their children in an equal society without private property.Coleridge is deprecating about some of his first poems, published in the newspaper the Morning Chronicle, though writes that two are “not so bad as the rest”.Soon after writing the letter,he headed to south-west England and met Wordsworth. In 1798, the pair published a joint volume of poetry, Lyrical Ballads, considered to be a starting point for the English romantic age.A standout in the collection was Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. In 1797, Coleridge put his quill pen down on the wondrous Kubla Khan, which he apparently wrote after experiencing an opium-influenced dream.Rees said it was possible Coleridge was being a little dramatic in the letter. “There is clearly an element of performance – Coleridge is writing to an older and more experienced man whose opinion he very much respected.“I think we see two sides of Coleridge here. He is both fishing for compliments and yet also self-critical and not satisfied with what he has written so far.“Luckily Dyer does seem to have risen to the occasion and provided Coleridge with enough encouragement that he didn’t retire into obscurity. His was a candle destined to burn bright and hard, not to fade and gutter.”The Coleridge letter, which has a price tag of £10,000, is one of 80 items in Bernard Quaritch’s new catalogue of English books and manuscripts from 1500 to 1840.Explore more on these topicsSamuel Taylor ColeridgePoetrynewsShareReuse this content"

It takes place at Wembley Arena in London on 17 September.Brian Eno is overseeing Together for Palestine, which brings together British and Palestinian artists at the 12,500-capacity venue to raise funds for Choose Love, a British charity working with 23 partner organisations in Gaza to deliver food, medical supplies and other support.The Palestinian musicians Adnan Joubran, Faraj Suleiman and Nai Barghouti are scheduled to perform alongside Eno and a host of top UK artists: Bastille, Cat Burns, Damon Albarn, Greentea Peng, Hot Chip, James Blake, Jamie xx, King Krule, Mabel, Obongjayar, Paloma Faith, Rachel Chinouriri and Sampha, with “one-off contributions” from Rina Sawayama, PinkPantheress and Riz Ahmed.Eno said: “In the face of the horrors of Gaza, silence becomes complicity. Artists have always helped societies to point out injustice and imagine better futures. That’s why this concert matters. It’s time for us to come together – not just to raise our voices, but to reaffirm our shared humanity.”Khaled Ziada, founder and director of the London Palestine film festival, is producing the event alongside Eno and Tracey Seaward, the film producer who also produced the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.Ziada said: “In a world where governments and mainstream media have fallen silent in the face of genocide, this gathering becomes a chorus of resistance – where artists and communities come together to grieve, to rage and to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Palestinian people.”Singer-songwriter Chinouriri, who supported Sabrina Carpenter on a recent tour, called on other musicians to “join me in building a bridge to victims in Gaza and beyond, we must break through the privilege of our bubble and speak with truth and justice”. Albarn said: “Pacifism is an action. Peace is an action. To live peacefully requires vision and commitment … I am grateful for this opportunity to act in solidarity with the Palestinian people.”The production design of the event is being handled by Es Devlin, the Olivier and Tony award-winning stage designer who, as well as working in theatre, has designed huge pop shows for the likes of Beyoncé, the Weeknd, U2 and Lady Gaga.Devlin is collaborating with Palestinian artist Malak Mattar on Together for Palestine, and said the Wembley Arena stage “will express the rich beauty of Palestinian culture”.Eno has been a longstanding supporter of Palestine and the cultural boycott of Israel.In 2017 he hada dispute with Nick Caveover the cultural boycott, with Cave characterising the boycott movement as “people that are trying to shut down musicians, to bully musicians, to censor musicians, and to silence musicians”. Eno replied: “This has nothing to do with ‘silencing’ artists – a charge I find rather grating when used in a context where a few million people are permanently and grotesquely silenced.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockBrian EnoIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

How did the cast ofThe Returned(more than 10 years ago now, though it feels like yesterday) look so gorgeous all the time, despite seemingly ordinary costumes, hair and makeup? Is Gallic bone structure really that different? Do clothes just hang better on the other side of la Manche? Is that why they call it “the sleeve”? Is it a clue?Forgive me. I am consumed by this puzzle. The success of a French drama can be measured by how successfully the official narrative mystery distracts me from the conundrum, and here the new six-part series Promethea does just fine.We begin with married couple the Lassets – Caroline (Marie-Josée Croze), a headteacher, and Charles (Thomas Jouannet), a doctor – hitting something that dashes out of the woods as they are driving home on a dark, rainy night. It turns out to be a teenage girl (played by Fantine Harduin) with neither a stitch of clothing nor a scratch on her. She remembers nothing about where she comes from or who she is, except for her name, Prométhée. They take her to hospital where she is examined by doctors and questioned by the police and, later by Charles’s colleague, psychoanalyst Marie (Odile Vuillemin). No concerned parents have reported her missing and the only clue to her identity is a tattoo on her wrist of a jellyfish.The police, led by the permanently vaping officer Elise (Camille Lou), have been investigating the brutal murder two months previously of a teenage girl called Lea, but have come up with nothing. This changes when Prométhée starts drawing sketches that seem to match photos taken of the crime scene and having flashbacks to bloody horrors that suggest much but obviously won’t resolve into solid information until we have had a few more episodes of fun with them.The Lassets’ daughter was killed in a motorcycle accident two years before, and the sense of pervasive grief is heartbreakingly shown, not least in their inadvertent emotional neglect of their sweet son, Hugo (Aymeric Fougeron). They are all immured by misery and Hugo doesn’t resent his parents for their behaviour, but takes what comfort he can in his girlfriend, Vanessa (Margot Heckmann). When Prométhée moves in with the Lassets to avoid going into foster care, the emotional stakes increase in intensity and complexity.Clues and connections begin to take shape as everyone hares off on their own private investigations. Charles would like to know why there is blood on the car windscreen, but no visible injury to the girl herself. And it’s hard not to agree that this is a fundamental question that needs to be answered. He sends a blood sample to the lab for testing. Prométhée tracks down the house that she keeps drawing from memory flashbacks and the jellyfish tattoo artist who may know who she is.Vanessa is Elise’s sister, which entwines the two families and plot lines from the start. Then Prométhée starts scrabbling in Lea’s garden and unearths a box of photos that one may assume the teenage girl did not intend her parents to see, but which at last provide a lead for Elise and her team. It is almost enough( along with Marie’s icy, watchful presence and her volunteered information that she has brittle bone disease – the equivalent of ostentatiously placing a gun on a Chekovian mantlepiece) without the suggestion of the supernatural that hardens into near-certainty as Prométhée begins to reveal unexpected physical powers. By this time, we are along for the stylishly creepy ride, so let’s enjoy it.There is nothing wonderfully new or innovative here, but it is a nicely packaged and paced six hours of solid entertainment. It is a flavoursome binge rather than something to be lingered over and savoured, but who doesn’t have an appetite for that? And the sorrows of the two sets of parents add enough heft to keep it from being a simple potboiler, though with everything apart from their grief, tidy resolution is promised, every loose end tied up. Apart, of course, from that mystery of how they look so ordinary and so good all the time.Promethea launches on Channel 4 on Sunday and is available from streaming now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it’s something we should do more often. After all, we owe them everything, from the air we breathe to the soil beneath our feet, and far less obvious things too. We have trees to thank for the swirl of our fingerprints, our posture, and possibly even our dreams.In her new book, British tree science consultant Harriet Rix presents trees as an awesome force of nature, a force that has, over time, “woven the world into a place of great beauty and extraordinary variety”. How have trees done this? And can they really be said to possess “genius”?If you think of life first emerging from the sea, hundreds of millions of years ago, you might picture something like the Tiktaalik, a human-sized floppy-footed fish that hauled itself out of the shallows some time in the Late Devonian. But the evolutionary eureka moment arguably came long before that, when one lucky greenalgawashed up on the Cambrian shore and managed to survive the deadly UV light on land.Element by element, trees have learned to control water, air, fire and the ground beneath us“Plants learning to survive and use UV light was a thunderbolt,” writes Rix. It “allowed a whole new chemistry to emerge, root and branch, in a whole new place: dry land … Safe from predators, who for the moment were left in the sea behind them, these photosynthesising cells started on a path that led to the amazing complexity of trees.”Viewed on cosmic fast forward, as part of “a strange, apparently accelerated world, in which continents drift around like rubber ducks, bumping into one another”, trees seem almost godlike, using their biochemical wizardry to transform the Earth from a stony, storm-ravaged wasteland into a place where life could thrive. They broke barren rock into soil, canalised flood waters into rivers, pumped oxygen into the atmosphere, and turned the desert green.Element by element, trees have learned to control water, air, fire and the ground beneath us, as well as fungi, plants, animals, and even people, shaping them according to their own “tree-ish” agenda. Some fairly knotty chunks of biochemistry and evolutionary history are smoothed by lush descriptions of contemporary habitats as Rix travels the world, from the cloud forests of La Gomera to the junipers of Balochistan. She is an intrepid and erudite guide.Despite the title, this is not a book that gives much weight to questions of tree consciousness or intelligence. It doesn’t stop to consider whether our leafy friends have feelings. Rix acknowledges that the early work of Suzanne Simard – whose research into resource exchange between trees via underground mycelial networks gave rise to the concept of the wood wide web – was “beautiful field science” and “immensely compelling”, but she gives short shrift to subsequent anthropomorphic claims that trees “talk” or “love” or “mother” one another. “Putting a nurturing mammalian face on to the giants of the forest was also a massive betrayal of the complexities of an organism that could be thousands of years old,” she writes. “Thinking of the 5,000 years in which Methuselah [a storied bristlecone pine] has had to negotiate existence makes simple narratives about the gentle exchange of nourishing sugars seem astoundingly trite.”What, then, is the genius of trees? Rix locates it in the elegant solutions they have devised to the constantly changing riddle of life. It’s a genius you can smell in the rich terpenes given off by trees to seed clouds, generating rain and expanding their own habitats. It’s a genius you can taste in the sweet fruit that makes animals do trees’ bidding, and arguably gave our simian ancestors their brains. It’s a vast, generative genius that has nurtured our own. Our clever fingers – and fingerprints – evolved to grip their branches. Our dreams were born in the safe, fragrant nests we built in their canopies. This is why, Rix argues, we find the smell of wood so comforting, and why we like to press our noses between the pages of books. Genius is too small a word for all of this.The Genius of Trees by Harriet Rix is published by Vintage (£25). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Durastanti’s book – a fictionalised memoir about growing up between rural southern Italy and Brooklyn, and between identities, as the hearing daughter of two deaf parents – was the first literary novel of an Italian writer from my generation to reach a global public. Published in English by Fitzcarraldo Editions in 2022, ina translationby Elizabeth Harris, its success was widely seen as a good omen, the sign that international publishers were starting to show interest in a new crop of Italian literature.A further reason for my enthusiasm was that a big part of Strangers I Know takes place in Basilicata, where my father is from. It is one of the country’s poorest regions, right at the arch of Italy’s boot, a place so derelict and forgotten that the one nationally renowned book about it, Carlo Levi’s wartime memoir Christ Stopped at Eboli, owes its title to the idea that the saviour, crossing Italy from the north, stopped at a village before the region’s border: Basilicata was never saved.Its breathtaking limestone canyons and ancient Greek temples notwithstanding, the region offers little in terms of recognisable, picturesque Italianness – the Tuscan hills, Venetian canals and clothesline-strewn Neapolitan alleys which, I felt, Italian novels were often expected to offer if they wanted to appeal to an international audience. Strangers I Knowseemed poised to broaden the range of what we understand as an Italian story – because it was also an American one, and because it eschewed all stereotypes about Italy.A recent pilot had to be rewritten: the Italian backdrop was too unfamiliar. Why not set it in Ireland?Not for long. After a pilot was written and slated for production, the broadcaster asked for a rewrite. The Italian backdrop, they said, was too unfamiliar. Why not set it in Ireland? It would be easier for audiences to relate to, and in its crucial aspects (Catholic, poor) it was kind of the same. The project was ultimately shelved.The history of the novel is deeply entwined with European nationalisms and national identities. Walter Scott’s historical novels drew from (and consolidated) Scotland’s history into a shared mythology; Alessandro Manzoni’s The Betrothed is still studied in Italian schools as the crucible that forged a unified language from a plethora of local variants; Goethe, Austen, Dostoevsky and Balzac all captured what they felt was the nature of a specific place and time, offering nations a mirror in which to see or imagine their national ethos.View image in fullscreen‘Picturesque Italianness’ … The TV adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s My Brilliant Friend.Photograph: Home Box Office (HBO)/2020 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.As books were translated and read across borders, a slightly paradoxical notion of two-layered reading emerged: novels offered, on the one hand, a very precise depiction of aspecificplace and time and national spirit; but through the specifics, somethinggeneralcould be glimpsed outside the national confines – about what it feels like to be a person, which to me sounds like a serviceable approximation of what the art of the novel is about. This gave rise to an idea of literature as a kind of exchange or conversation between national literatures, each with their allotted seats at the canon – Fernando Pessoa or Robert Musil, Henrik Ibsen or Émile Zola: of course, they were almost exclusively male seats.The imperialistic premise in this idea of literature as an egalitarian conversation between national traditions is blatant: as Milan Kundera remarked, what it took for a country to be awarded its own national literature – instead of being grouped into an ill-assorted umbrella term such as “Mitteleuropa” – was a colonial past. And yet that was still the way literature was taught and read, in Italy, until a couple of decades ago. We read Gustave Flaubert and Georges Perec. We read Jane Austen and Virginia Woolf. We read Thomas Mann andErnesto Sábato.And then we didn’t. The consolidation of the English-language publishing industry in the 1980s and 90s gave its most successful writers a worldwide reach and a critical impact that no authors from other countries could aspire to. The Italian contemporary canon, at the beginning of the millennium, was composed of David Foster Wallace and Zadie Smith and Jonathan Franzen; the country’s first creative writing programme, established in the mid-90s, owes its name to Holden Caulfield; its students (some of whom have been my students) learn technique by reading Ernest Hemingway and Joan Didion, who show; not Anna Maria Ortese and Elsa Morante, who tell. Their Italian syntax and style – as measured in Eleonora Gallitelli’s groundbreaking computational studies – are more influenced by English than the Italian of translators working from English.This didn’t happen only in Europe. As discussed in Minae Mizumura’s The Fall of Language in the Age of English – an essayistic memoir about the author’s having to choose between being an American and a Japanese writer, and choosing the latter, and regretting it – at the turn of the millennium the idea of national literatures, modelled as a system of literary discourses on a somewhat equal footing, no longer held. Instead, we moved into a world in which one of those traditions had expanded beyond the national, becoming de facto universal.There is nothing intrinsically lamentable about this, which can be seen as a way out of nationalisms. But there can be only one universal; and as the anglophone tradition ascended, other national literatures shrank to become increasingly local. In a system in which English-language literature deals transnationally with general issues, the specifics that had characterised national literatures (Austen’s England, Dostoevsky’s Russia) lose their role and become local colour, picturesque. When a story has universal ambitions, such as Durastanti’s Strangers I Know, it thus makes sense to recast it someplace more relatable, in a setting where the exoticism won’t get in the way.Something similar happened to me. Years ago, a German publisher declined to translate my second novel – a story of ambition and financial speculation – because the Italian backdrop might have confused a German readership used to imagining corporate raiders in New York, or perhaps in Frankfurt. But, he said, the chapters in which the protagonist visited his father in Venice were great, so poetic. Had I considered setting a book in Venice? Italy, for him, had ceased to be seen as a legitimate context for corporate ambition, as it was in Paolo Volponi’s Le Mosche del Capitale, and become a set of exotic backdrops: Naples, Puglia, Rome, the Tuscan hills, or Venice.A peripheral circle of local authors are outsourced with producing gondolas, popes, crying madonnas, and pizzaThis, in a way, is a division of labour: a way the international market for literature has tried to become more efficient by allocating the general discourse to a set of mostly English-speaking writers, while a peripheral circle of local colleagues are outsourced with producing gondolas, popes, crying madonnas, and pizza.But the landscape described by Mizumura has drastically rearranged itself over the past few years, and the primacy of anglophone literature seems to have faded. The authors in today’s contemporary canon – celebrated by critics worldwide, and imitated by aspiring novelists – come from much more varied backgrounds and write in many more languages.Roberto Bolaño,Annie Ernaux,Han KangandKarl Ove Knausgårdare the Franzens and Wallaces of two decades ago.Of course it is impossible to draw a precise line for a general shift of this kind, but “Ferrante fever” could be as good a watershed moment as any.Elena Ferrantewas a relatively niche writer (both in her country and abroad) whose novels achieved a spectacular, worldwide success, reaching the kind of ubiquity previously associated with people performatively readingInfinite Jestto show off. It also sparked a growing international interest in Italian literature, involving both younger writers (such as Durastanti, or myself for that matter) or allegedly “forgotten” classics, such as the works of Elsa Morante and Alba de Céspedes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The further consolidation of the US publishing industry has made it harder for innovative, ambitious novels to emerge. It could be an effect of the trendiness of “literature in translation” in the English-language market – even though the notion that it would have its own niche is largely unfathomable to non-native English speakers, used since childhood to reading literature in translation and calling it “literature”.It could also be that different books are being written. Since the turn of the century, writers from all over the world have felt the dual literary citizenship that Minae wrote about: seeing themselves as part of both a local and a universal tradition, reading Anna Maria Ortese at the Scuola Holden. It would have been natural to try to combine the two, working into their writing a thin veneer of exoticism to lead readers to engage with its deeper ideas.Readers in Buenos Aires or Naples could very well find a story set in Seoul more relatable than one set in Franzen’s MinnesotaOf course there is much, much more to, say, Ferrante’s novels than a picturesque Italian backdrop. But the backdrop’s recognisability – indeed, its very picturesqueness – has probably played a role in making them relatable to a wider audience. Bolaño’s The Savage Detectives similarly toys with cliches about Mexico, both subverting them and contextualising them into a wider picture. Han Kang’sThe Vegetarianplays into a strain of body horror that western readers have come to stereotypically associate with east Asian literature – only to explode it with a psychologically harrowing and politically powerful fable about resisting patriarchy.On the other hand, this increased international interest in non-anglophone literature could have another source: no matter where these books originated, their worldwide success often came as a result of their success in English. This was the case with, for instance, both Ferrante and Bolaño, who only caught on abroad after resonating with the English‑language market.It is particularly evident in Han’s case: The Vegetarian was published in South Korea in 2007, but gained international acclaim after Deborah Smith’s spectacularly successful translation was published almost a decade later. In a particularly significant twist, its Italian edition was translated from the English instead of Han’s Korean, not because no translators could be found but because the editor, who read it in English, found Smith’s prose more effective – more relatable?– than the renditions they initially commissioned from the original.This is not limited to recent, successful novels: two canonical 20th-century Italian authors, Natalia Ginzburg and Alba de Céspedes, have been translated internationally mostly after their English editions. Conversely, classic Danish author Tove Ditlevsen’s trilogy appeared in Italian after its US translation. If anglophone culture no longer beams its literature from the centre to what Umberto Eco called “the peripheries of the Empire”, it still acts as a transit hub between them, the arbiter of what is allowed to go beyond the confines of the local. My own novel,Perfection, has been acquired for translation in languages from Thai to Lithuanian only after its reception in English, and its International Booker shortlisting.This could be seen as another, subtler form of imperialism; and yet it also allows more room for agency. Our peripheries are closer to each other than the long way through the centre makes it seem: readers in Buenos Aires or Naples could very well find a story set in Seoul more relatable than one set in Franzen’s Minnesota.Durastanti’s latest novel, Missitalia, has a section set in Basilicata, mixing the true story of the women-only gangs that haunted its forests in the 19th century with the parallel-history discovery of oil there. As it is currently being translated into 10 languages (including English), she recently told me that her translators sometimes reach out to ask for help in rendering the region’s atmosphere. “Just think Appalachia,” is an answer she gives.Perfection by Vincenzo Latronico, translated by Sophie Hughes, is published by Fitzcarraldo (£12.99).

Lilia was lucky to be allowed to leave the Federation for London, where she worked on a device to enable neural entanglement. This could be a powerful tool for changing – or controlling – society, and there are those who will stop at nothing to get their hands on it. At the heart of this story is a dissident book, The Forever Argument, asserting the necessity of opposition in any society: “It keeps us not only honest, but human. Without it, anyone is a monster.” Like the fictional text, this thought-provoking, fast-moving thriller is also a heartfelt call for resistance to oppressive regimes.View image in fullscreenThe Phoenix Pencil Companyby Allison King(4th Estate, £16.99)Monica, a talented coder in present-day America, worries about her beloved grandparents, now in their 90s.

Once close, the two women were divided by political history, like so many Chinese families in the mid-20th century. Monica is puzzled when her attempt to connect with Meng results only in the gift of a single wooden pencil, but Yun understands. Before it is too late, she must tell her story – and reveal to Monica the secret power possessed by the women of the family, once used to reclaim the words written with the pencils their company sold in wartime Shanghai. The gift brought hardship and heartbreak, the shame of being forced by government officials to betray the secrets of people who bought their pencils, but also chances to preserve precious letters and poems that would otherwise have been lost. This unusual idea provides the single shining thread of fantasy illuminating an absorbing family saga interwoven with reflections on the power of stories, and who has the right to decide what is preserved or permitted to remain secret.View image in fullscreenHemlock & Silverby T Kingfisher (Tor, £22)The latest from the Nettle & Bone author is narrated by Anja, whose expertise is finding antidotes to poisons. She’s summoned by the king, who thinks his daughter Snow is being poisoned. Her symptoms don’t match any known illness, and there are no suspects or motive; the determinedly rational Anja eventually realises the solution will only be found through a magical mirror. There are echoes of classic fairytales in an original, highly entertaining story that slips easily between humour and horror, action and romance, and introduces a wonderfully sarcastic cat.View image in fullscreenSecret Lives of the Deadby Tim Lebbon(Titan, £9.99)It seems like a cool adventure to BB and Matt when Jodi suggests they break into a derelict old house in search of rumoured treasure. But a brutal killer has been following the same rumours, on the trail of a grotesque relic that might remove the curse put on his family generations ago; he’ll kill anyone who crosses his path. Tightly written and grippingly suspenseful, this fast-moving, violent tale is not for the faint of heart.View image in fullscreenThe Course of the Heartby M John Harrison(Serpent’s Tail, £10.99)Three Cambridge students follow an occult master into an English meadow to perform a ritual that leaves them haunted for the rest of their lives. Beginning with echoes of Arthur Machen and MR James, the novel soon dispenses with genre standards, merging gritty realism with dreamy fantasy and eerie horror. A groundbreaking work, written with a painterly eye for light and shade, it has been a cult classic since its first publication in 1992; this reprint should reach a much wider audience.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction booksScience fiction roundupFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Spanish film-maker Miguel Ángel Jiménez directs and co-writes this adaptation of the novel by Panos Karnezis.Bringing star power also is charismatic Danish star Vic Carmen Sonne; she plays his daughter Sofia, who has the honour and the terrible burden of a massive 25th birthday party thrown for her by the overbearing Marcos on his private island. The guest list consists almost entirely of his heavily tanned Eurotrash acquaintances and hangers-on, but this claustrophobic party is all the more painful as (like Onassis) Timoleon has recently suffered the terrible anguish of his son and favourite child dying in a plane accident.The film shows us that he concerns himself now with who Sofia is to marry and who his son-in-law is therefore to be – questions that, if his son had lived, would not be nearly so important – and he is nettled to see a close relationship between Sofia and his young English biographer Ian Forster, played by Joe Cole. In his heart, of course, Marcos would have preferred the other child to die and he has terrible plans for Sofia at the end of her party.This is a strong, confident picture that hits its measured stride early on. Its pace and style and language are dictated by a charismatic Dafoe; however, he gives the impression that this performance is not exactly a stretch for him. But he is always commanding, especially when talking to his various consiglieri, confiding amusingly to one intimate that it is good that children become rebellious and disagreeable; if they stayed as adorable as when they were young, parents could never part with them.The Birthday Party screened at the Locarno film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsWillem DafoeFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 2010, Andrei Ujică’s three-hour The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceauşescu was a film footage collage of his dictatorial life and times; andin 2020 Radu Jude’s The Exit of the Trainsused official archive material to shed light on wartime antisemitism. Jude, with co-director Christian Ferencz-Flatz, has now curated a found-footage fever dream of Romania’s post-Ceauşescu passion for capitalism.It is a mosaic of moments from TV ads in the 1990s, frantically flogging everything: soft drinks, sausages, laxatives, a new Dracula-based theme park, shares in Thatcher-style government privatisation schemes and mobile phones. One rather witty ad has Ceauşescu making a speech being interrupted by a phone – the tagline promises “free speech”. Romanian legends like Ilie Năstase and Nadia Comăneci appear, while the clips are broadly divided into chapter-headings; one tranche of ads displaying gender stereotypes is introduced with the Godardian intertitle “Masculine Feminine”. Sometimes Jude and Ferencz-Flatz take out the audio entirely so we can just focus on the eerie garish images in silence. Freeze-frames show us the quasi-porn ecstatic closing of eyes at the moment of taste. Ads for actual porn phone lines show us something similar. In one “cutting room floor” moment, we see multiple takes of an unhappy actor in an ad for financial services stumbling over the line “We all strive to multiply your money” over and over again.It’s an amusing collection – a glimpse of the id of Romania’s new psyche – but perhaps the same thing could be done and the same point made with TV ads from anywhere in the world. (In our online social media world, these expensively crafted vignettes themselves look a little antique.) I wonder if there is moreover a touch of naivety in a prestigious movie director treating ads as crude, almost unauthored primitive material to be ironically edited and juxtaposed by a higher artistic mind. Many advertising directors, after all, go on to make brilliant films – including the great Romanian auteurCristian Mungiuwho, before he was an arthouse film-maker of note, made a series of amusing TV ads for mobile phones featuring the yet-to-be-discovered actor Vlad Ivanov. At any rate, this is a diverting addition to Jude’s filmography.Eight Postcards from Utopia is on Mubi from 8 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsRomaniaTelevisionAdvertisingreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been performed in more than 80 countries and now – finally – makes its West End debut. There’s astarry rotating cast, kicking off with Lenny Henry and also including original performer Jonny Donahoe, as well as Ambika Mod, Sue Perkins and Minnie Driver. Jeremy Herrin directs alongside Macmillan and a posse of leading producers are backing the show.It all screams smash hit. But there’s something about the scale and downright snazziness of this production that doesn’t quite gel. The setup is simple. It’s about a young boy who, after his mum does “something stupid” when she has acute depression, decides to make a list about all the things that make life worth living. Waffles. Hedgehogs. Falling in love.Before the show begins, scribbled notes with items from the list are distributed throughout the audience. At regular intervals, the audience is required to shout out the items from the list. A few spectators are also pulled into various mime sequences and running gags and, with Henry, they carefully bring this boy’s story to life as he transitions from a hopeful young boy to faltering and thoughtful man.View image in fullscreenGood fun … Every Brilliant Thing.Photograph: Helen MurrayIn the very best productions of Macmillan’s play, the moments of audience interaction can feel really special. But on press night, everything feels slightly on edge. Perhaps the shiny new theatre and star performer are a little imposing. Every now and then, Henry can’t resist sparring with the crowd. It’s all good fun but every ad lib takes us one step closer to a standup show – and one step further from the warm heart of this play.It’s only when Henry isn’t trying to be funny that the show settles. There’s a stillness and steeliness to him when he talks about the importance of protecting our mental health. Henry also responds beautifully to all the music woven into the show, which plays such an important role and underlines just how much this boy has been forced to live on the edges of his family life. Listening behind doors. Hovering. Worrying. Never getting truly involved, for fear of what he may lose if he lets the happiness in.At@sohoplace theatre, London, until 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreLenny HenryEdinburgh festival 2025FestivalsEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Made up of militant chants and muscular rhythms perforated with ominous clangs, the genre mostly thrived in goth bars and clubs, except for the odd chart entry from key players such as Front 242. Even 40 years on, EBM still lurks on the fringes of dance music.View image in fullscreenAutumns: Basic FaceIrish producer Autumns is one name championing the industrial club sound through his stormy yet pumping hardware tracks and raucous live sets, which are all flailing limbs and swishing hair behind a tangle of wires. Since starting the project in 2013, he has put out a formidable 88 releases, including 13 albums;Basic Face is his latest.The bulk of the record follows the classic EBM formula: chugging loops strewn with sinister vocals and metallic sounds; in fact, White Walls sounds like an instrumental hit by scene legends Nitzer Ebb. The rhythms are beefy and catchy, elevated further by surprising elements such as the mutant-disco-style cowbells and angular post-punk riffs in A Grand Time to Witness Culture, or the sirens in Your Favourite Cowboy. Repetitive rather than progressive, the tracks are seemingly made for DJs and live sets, rather than home listening, which is strange given the cassette release. But this doesn’t feel like a fault of Autumns:they are intense and unrelenting, as any good EBM track should be.Only twice do we hear something less functional, and these moments work as good scene-setters, though not stand-alone tracks. On the intro No Gimmicks No Gigs, a disjointed vocal sample is interspersed with thrashes and fizzes that sound straight out of a forge. Your Tattoo is Shite, placed about halfway through the album, is a blistering, glitching whir of feedback – a disorienting experience, but onethat onlyamplifiesthe punchy material around it.Also out this monthNewport-based multi-instrumentalist and producerMemotonehas built a reputation among DIY circles for his quietly cinematic electro-acoustic compositions. His latest album Smallest Things (released on World of Echo) is another lovely, evocative listen, full of sparsearrangements that are sometimes soaring, sometimes jittery.On Sound Bath (Dark Entries),Coatshekpresents a dreamy, dimly lit collection of tracks inspired by an imaginary queer bath house. Expect ambient techno pitched low and slow – specifically at 107bpm, which the San Francisco producer deems the “optimal speed for sauna sex”. With every warm pad or deep, reverb-cloaked whisper, the record slowly builds tension, climaxing in the blissed-out 10-minute closer Eternal Lovers.Gush (Nettwerk), the latest record from Los Angles-based composerKaitlyn Aurelia Smith, is similarly intimate: an exploration of those warm, heady feelings that come with incipient romance, when, in her words, “the senses melt together”. Channelled through hushed vocals and bubbling electronica, it is suitably woozy: sensual and sometimes ecstatic.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicExperimental album of the monthClub cultureElectronic musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

The result was Kae Tempest meets New Order via the densely referential lyrics of Real Lies; a set of songs steeped in lump-in-the-throat nostalgia for more innocent times, and in the muted echoes of dancefloor euphoria.View image in fullscreenFor Those I Love: Carving the StoneOn this follow-up, the Dublin musician – now in his early 30s – adjusts his subject while clinging tightly to his fury and devastation. Aside from The Ox/The Afters, a tribute to a former hardman who dies from drink, there’s not much literal grief on Carving the Stone – but Balfe is still in mourning. His psychic wound is more abstract now, a slow-blooming bruise caused by the brutal Irish economy and the tech-addled meaninglessness of modernity. Over a boisterously ravey backdrop, No Scheme chronicles the lifestyles of Balfe’s erstwhile contemporaries (“life above their means / And driven mad by phone scams and everyday still spent on Facebook”), while Mirror rages against “cunting blackshirts” who promote nationalistic beliefs to the workers they exploit.Carving the Stone’s portraits of new kinds of poverty are too depressing – and depressingly accurate – to be beautiful, although the music offers occasional bursts of strange joy (Civic’s frantic breakbeat; the fiddle break in Of the Sorrows), while Balfe’s heartfelt, hyper-focused social commentary means it’s rare to find an album this rich in meaning.Explore more on these topicsMusicElectronic musicPop and rockSpoken wordalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

While pavlova is often my go-to, I also like the more relaxed, throw-together nature of Eton mess. I’ve given it my own spin here by using a brown sugar meringue, which adds a gorgeous, caramel flavour and makes all the difference compared with shop-bought shells. Macerate the peaches in sumac and lime, whip up some cream and yoghurt, then pile it all high on a pretty platter for a perfect pud for a crowd.Peach and sumac Eton messPrep5 minMacerate20 minCook2 hrCool2 hr+Serves10-12For the meringue60g caster sugar120g light brown sugar3 egg whites(about 120g)For the filling4 ripe peaches30g caster sugarJuice of ½lime1 tsp sumac250ml double cream150g greek yoghurt2 tsp icing sugar½ tsp vanilla bean pasteFresh mint, to finishHeat the oven to 120C (100C fan)/250F/gas ½ and line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. Mix the caster and light brown sugars in a small bowl and set aside.Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk on medium-low until they turn frothy. Turn up the speed to medium-high, then beat in the sugar mixture a tablespoon at a time. Once you have a stiff and glossy meringue, spoon tablespoon-sized dollops of it on to the lined tray, then bake for 80-90 minutes, until the meringues are firm to the touch and the paper peels off easily. Turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside for a few hours (overnight is best) with the door closed until they have cooled completely.Stone the peaches, then slice them all into eighths and put in a bowl with the sugar, lime juice and sumac. Stir gently to coat, then leave to macerate for at least 20 minutes.When you’re ready to serve, put the cream, yoghurt, icing sugar and vanilla in a bowl and whip to soft peaks. Break up half of the meringues and fold the pieces into the cream mix. Spoon half the mixture on to a platter and top with more broken meringue and some peach slices. Repeat with the remaining cream and meringue, then top with the remaining peaches and any juices from the peach bowl.
