Many are particularly concerned thatRachel Reevesis set to go further than the former Tory chancellor George Osborne who, despite cutting working-age benefits for four years, kept the personal independence payments (Pip) rising.Some of those in the meetings revealed that No 10 officials appeared taken aback by the scale of the anger, especially from new MPs who have been unstintingly loyal.Senior government figures have signalled in private conversations that they may still be open to change, but any climbdown could leave the chancellor with a major fiscal hole to fill.Government officials believe that freezing the Pip would almost certainly require a vote on primary legislation, as certain benefits are protected by the Social Security Administration Act 1992, which states they should rise by inflation each year.Given the government’s large majority, there is little chance of it failing to push through its planned changes to the disability benefit system, but some Labour MPs said they would nevertheless struggle to vote for any measures that take money away from the poorest in society.One told the Guardian: “We’re in government and I feel utterly useless. They [No 10] will understand our frustrations, though largely private, when we get a chance to vote.”The Guardian view on Labour’s welfare plans: betraying the vulnerable | EditorialRead moreMinisters hope plans to reform employment schemes will help to win over some worried Labour MPs.About £1bn is expected to be ploughed into helping the long-term sick back into work after the welfare secretary faced down opposition from the Treasury ahead of £6bn cuts to the UK benefits budget.Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is understood to have secured the savings to pay for employment support despite tensions with the Treasury, which was said to have questioned the value of the schemes.At prime minister’s questions, Starmer told MPs that he understood the worries of disabled people and their families over the welfare cuts. He added: “But we inherited a system which is broken, it is indefensible, economically and morally, and we must and we will reform it.“We will have clear principles, we will protect those who need protecting. We will also support those who can work back to work, but Labour is the party of work, we’re also the party of equality and fairness.”Kendall is now expected to announce the plans in a Commons statement early next week. Government insiders acknowledged that she will have a “hard argument to make” over disability benefits, but believe the public supports welfare cuts more generally.“While the next election won’t be won or lost on welfare, we do need to show progress on limiting the rising bill,” one source said. They argued that the bill for disability benefits, which rose by nearly £13bn to £48bn between 2019-20 and 2023-24, is unsustainable.Under current plans, the bulk of almost £6bn of cuts will come from the Pip, which is not linked to work. Eligibility criteria for the key disability benefit will be tightened, while some Pip payments are expected to be frozen. Despite some early speculation, the benefit will not be means tested.There are also expected to be smaller cuts including raising the basic rate of universal credit for those looking for – or in – work, while cutting it for those judged as unfit for work, as an incentive for some disabled people to seek employment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others will continue remotely.The £1bn for back-to-work programmes for the long-term sick ranges from “supportive phone calls” to more intensive work placements and courses.One government source said Reeves’s department had been “very short-sighted” over the value of the back-to-work schemes, and where the savings should be spent. But a Treasury source said that she understood the importance of reinvesting in such programmes.The focus will be on people aged 22 and over who are out of work, with those between 18 and 21 covered by the government’syouth guaranteeannounced in the autumn in a drive to get hundreds of thousands into jobs or education.Labour wants to tackle the one in eight young people aged 18 to 24 who are not currently in education, employment or training. Ministers have already warned that they will lose their benefits if they refuse to take up opportunities.The chancellor has turned to the welfare bill to plug a gap in the public finances after higher borrowing costs and a worsening growth outlook wiped out the headroom she had to operate within her own fiscal rules.However, economists said that only straightforward cuts to benefit levels and tighter eligibility could be included in the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts for the spring statement later this month, and that it would be reluctant to include reforms as bankable savings.In a private meeting of Labour MPs on Monday,Starmer saidBritain’s benefits system is the “worst of all worlds”, with the number of people out of work or training “indefensible and unfair”.The prime minister said he would take tough decisions to cut the bill for working-age health and disability benefits, which is expected to hit £70bn by 2030. The government has already vowed to cut £3bn over the next three years.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerBenefitsDisabilityWelfareLiz KendallRachel ReevesLabourShareReuse this content"

The corporation has now said that it is “deeply sorry” to four women who had also been subjected to a campaign of abuse by Belfield over several years.While Belfield was cleared of stalking Helen Thomas, Rozina Breen, Liz Green and Stephanie Hirst, the judge ruled they had been targeted by him in “a personal campaign of revenge”, leaving them all needing psychological support. Belfield washanded an indefinite restraining orderpreventing him from contacting the women.The BBC said it failed to take earlier warnings from the women seriously enough. “People who work for the BBC are often in the public eye and under scrutiny, however, it is unacceptable for anyone to be the target of sustained abuse in the way that Rozina Breen, Elizabeth Green, Stephanie Hirst and Helen Thomas were over a number of years,” it said.“We recognise that before 2019 we simply didn’t do enough for these members of staff in understanding the full impact that Alex Belfield’s unacceptable behaviour had on them. For that we are deeply sorry and offer a full and unreserved apology.”The broadcaster said it had expanded its mental wellbeing resources for staff and strengthened its ability to launch internal investigations. “We are significantly better equipped to manage these issues now and in the future, but we will never be complacent,” it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has already admitted it “fell short and failed people” – including its own staff – after finding evidence of “bullying and misogynistic” behaviour by its former Radio 1 DJTim Westwood.Last year it apologised to the parents of a young person who made a complaint about the disgraced BBC presenterHuw Edwards, admitting it should have acted more quickly.After the apology, received years after she first raised the alarm about Belfield, Green said his actions had meant that “fear becomes part of your life”.“I expected the BBC to use available laws to stop it, for us to be listened to and taken care of,” Green said. “For over a decade, that did not happen. They have apologised for that and say lessons have been learnt. Every employer needs to protect their staff. The four of us were high-profile women in the north. We have all subsequently left the BBC.”Vine said the BBC was right to apologise to the women, adding that they had initially been told to “ignore and delete” thousands of abusive emails. “The advice should have been ‘log and keep’,” he said. “Because of this bad advice, incriminating material which might have increased Belfield’s five and a half-year jail term was lost to the court.“The BBC began to take the case seriously only when [the former director general] Tony Hall and [the current director general] Tim Davie took charge.

The Kremlin has not publicly said whether or not it supports an immediate ceasefire.If Putin refuses,“I understand that we could count on strong steps. I don’t know the details yet, but we are talking about sanctions and about strengthening Ukraine,”Volodymyr Zelenskyysaid on Tuesday.Trump said on Wednesday that he had received “positive messages” regarding the ceasefire, but “a positive message means nothing”. The White House later said that Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, would be in Moscow later this week.“It’s up toRussianow,” Trump said from the White House. “Our people are going to Russia right now as we speak. And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia.”Trump did not directly promise to target Russia with sanctions if Vladimir Putin does not sign the deal, but said he could “do things financially that would be very bad for Russia”.He added, however: “I don’t want to do that, because I want to get peace.”Asked whether he believed Putin would hold to a ceasefire, given he had broken them in the past, Trump said: “We haven’t spoken to him yet with substance, because we just found out. We’re going to know very soon. I’ve gotten some positive messages, but a positive message means nothing. This is a very serious situation. This is a situation that could lead to world war three.”Defence ministers from Europe’s five leading military powers, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland and France met in Paris on Wednesday to discuss the formation of a “reassurance force” that would guarantee peace inUkraineif a settlement was agreed.Lecornu said they were “hoping to see a ceasefire tomorrow” and that 15 countries were willing to contribute to a force of up to 30,000 personnel that would secure Ukraine’s airports, ports and infrastructure on a permanent basis.However, the ministers emphasised they still wanted the US to provide a backstop guarantee to support peacekeepers, and hinted that the minerals deal due to be signed by the US and Ukraine would be insufficient.John Healey, the UK defence secretary, stressed that the UK wanted “the US to play a part in the reassurance force”. When asked whether a minerals deal could amount to a security guarantee for Ukraine, he said it was “a step towards a process where we get a ceasefire”, implying it was not necessarily sufficient.Late on Wednesday, Russian state television showed Putin making his first visit to the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion last year.View image in fullscreenA still from a video released by the Kremlin shows Vladimir Putin with Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, in a visit to the Kursk region.Photograph: Kremlin.ru/ReutersDressed in military camouflage, the Russian president expressed hope his army was on the brink of “fully liberating” the territory, and told senior commanders that Ukrainian soldiers captured in Kursk should be treated as terrorists.“I am counting on the fact that all the combat tasks facing our units will be fulfilled, and the territory of the Kursk region will soon be completely liberated from the enemy,” he said. On Wednesday, Russian forces entered the central square of Sudzha, the largest Russian settlement controlled by Ukraine.Minutes after footage of Putin’s remarks aired on Russian state TV, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, suggested his troops were pulling back to minimise losses.Zelenskyy also appeared to hint at an organised withdrawal in his comments on Wednesday. “The military command is doing what it should do – saving the maximum number of lives of our soldiers,” he said.Last month,in an interview with the Guardian, Zelenskyy said Ukraine hoped to swap the territory it held in Kursk region for areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the Americans proposed a full ceasefire, which was agreed after calls made by the two delegations to their respective presidents.Cautious Zelenskyy keeps cards close to his chest after Ukraine ceasefire proposalRead moreHe said that while monitoring sea and air ceasefires would be easy, he hoped Ukraine’s western partners would provide a plan for how to monitor a ceasefire along the frontline, “given who we are dealing with and given our experience of the past years”.Some Russian officials indicated scepticism about the prospect of a ceasefire, saying Moscow was unwilling to stop the fighting as its forces this week made rapid gains in reclaiming territory in Kursk region.Putin has repeatedly rejected the possibility of a temporary ceasefire, saying he was focused on addressing the “root causes” of the conflict. Earlier this year, he told Russia’s security council there “should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but a long-term peace”.Instead, the Russian leader has set out a list of maximalist demands to end his invasion, including Ukraine forgoing Nato membership, undergoing partial demilitarisation and ceding full control of the four Ukrainian regions Putin claimed in 2022.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinMarco RubioEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The accusations made against these individuals are entirely false, fabricated in order to justify their increasing harassment of UK diplomats.“It is clear that the Russian state is actively seeking to drive the British embassy in Moscow towards closure and has no regard for the dangerous escalatory impact of this.”A senior Foreign Office official summoned the Russian ambassador, Andrey Kelin, and told him that the UK would not stand for the intimidation of British embassy staff and their families.The official said: “We do not take this decision lightly but we have always made clear to Russia that if they escalate, we will take reciprocal action. The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength.”The foreign secretary, David Lammy, on his way to a meeting with his G7 counterparts in Canada, said: “We will not tolerate the Kremlin’s relentless and unacceptable campaign of intimidation, nor their repeated attempts to threaten UK security.”The Foreign Office stressed that it believed in keeping diplomatic lines of communication open and said it would regard the latest episode as closed so long as Russia did not seek to escalate further.In throwing out the British pair, Moscow said it “will not tolerate the presence of undeclared British intelligence personnel in Russia”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I urge everyone in government to avoid the incendiary rhetoric and tactics we are seeing in the United States, and to be clear that reforms are about enhancing not undermining the civil service.”Clancy said it was right to make better use of tech in the public security but added that the government will find it challenging to compete for the skills needed to deliver on this agenda under the current pay regime, which is why Prospect is campaigning for more pay flexibility to recruit and retain specialists in the civil service in areas like science and data.“Government should also be doing more to utilise the talented specialists it already has at its disposal, many of whom are working in regulators and other agencies that have been starved of funding in recent years.”In Starmer’s speech, he will also pledge to reduce regulation and cut some quangos, taking on the “cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people”. The government will have a new target of reducing the cost of regulation by 25%.Starmer will give a diagnosis of the problem in the UK that the state has become “bigger, but weaker” and is not delivering on its core purpose.“The need for greater urgency now could not be any clearer. We must move further and faster on security and renewal,” he will say. “Every pound spent, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people …“If we push forward with the digitisation of government services. There are up to £45bn worth of savings and productivity benefits, ready to be realised.”In the US, Donald Trump has embarked on a radical programme of sacking government workers under the new department of government efficiency (Doge), advised by the billionaire businessman Elon Musk.Starmer’s government is understood to want also to scale back the size of the state, reducing the number of civil servants by substantially more than 10,000. Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, on Sunday said the government is prepared to bring in tougher performance management requirements in a bid to shed underperforming officials, and put more emphasis on performance-related pay.The Guardian revealed on Tuesdaythat No 10 and the Treasury are taking a close interest in proposals drawn up byLabour Together, a thinktank with close links to the government, to reshape the state under plans dubbed “project chainsaw”.The project’s nickname is a reference to Elon Musk’s stuntwielding a chainsaw to symbolise controversial government cutsfor Donald Trump’s administration.Starmer’s press spokesperson said on Wednesday that No 10 rejects the “juvenile characterisation” of their reshaping plans as slashing the state.“There’s no approach here where we’re taking a chainsaw to the system,” she said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)LabourComputingCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a sort of moral equivalence, that ‘she’s as bad as I am’.”Millar said “time and again” Clarke sought ways to turn the allegations made against him back on his accusers.Clarke said he had told the truth and brought up women’s behaviour where it was relevant.“In this world we’re in right now, if a man makes a remote misstep, he is done,” Clarke told the court.Clarke was asked about a Doctor Who convention in Bournemouth in 2016 where he sat next to a volunteer, Lisa Graham, and was said to have:Touched her on her thighs including between her legs.Said they should go to the mezzanine floor above to have sex.Rated women out of 10 for their sexual attractiveness.Said of a pregnant woman that he would “bang that” because she could not get pregnant again.Clarke said Graham “was involved in the conversation [rating women] voluntarily” and that he had made a comment about a pregnant woman but not that specifically alleged.Millar said: “This is your strategy: ‘I might be bad but the woman is just as bad.’”Clarke responded: “I did that when I believed it’s true.”Clarke, the writer and producer of the Kidulthood trilogy, said he had only tapped Graham on her knees to indicate a fan was lingering too long.“The touching is not correct and the invite to go to a public mezzanine is nonsense,” said Clarke.He said: “Some people want to be involved in what they deem to be a noble cause.”The court also heard that Clarke is alleged to have exposed his penis on a music video shoot for the rap duo Krept and Konan near Angel underground station in north London in 2016.Two women, Alice* and Ella*, who worked for Lionsgate, which commissioned Clarke’s company to do the shoot, were present. Millar said to Clarke: “You repeatedly made sexual comments to her [Alice], to the effect that she liked having sex with black men.”Clarke denied doing so and said the women had initiated conversation about celebrities’ penises and a WhatsApp group called “dick detectives”.Millar said: “You exposed your penis to her.”Clarke replied that he did not but when Alice said to him that he had a little penis and Ella urged him to show them his, he undid his brown belt as a joke. “It was the flap of my belt,” he said.Millar told the court it was the prospect of Clarke receiving a Bafta award in 2021 that “pushed them [his accusers] over the edge … they decided to tell the truth at last”.Clarke is suing GNM over seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March 2022 in which more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.The trial continues.* Not their real namesExplore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

He had also been accused of describing himself as a solicitor on a constituency website that is no longer online.The error on the LinkedIn profile was corrected and the SRA said it had decided not to take further action because “there is no need”.But in February, after the shadow justice secretary,Robert Jenrick, accused Reynolds of “criminal conduct” and wrote to the SRA demanding a new inquiry, the SRAreopened its investigationinto allegations the business secretary had incorrectly claimed to have worked as a solicitor.At the time, the regulator would not say why it had changed its position, only that it had “now become aware of further information”.Last month, Reynoldstold the Guardianthat “over a decade ago” he had “used shorthand” in a speech that was “not a speech about the legal profession or legal regulation or the law”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Worldwide,more than half of adultsand a third of children are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050.While poor diet, inactivity, genetics, environmental toxins and underlying health conditions are known to increase the risk, scientists at the National Institute of Cardiology in Warsaw,Poland, wanted to study whether other factors were also relevant.The researchers examined the medical and general health data of 2,405 people with an average age of 50. Statistical analysis was used to ascertain links between increased body weight and age, marital status, mental health and other factors.Call to overhaul obesity diagnoses amid fears of over-reliance on BMIRead moreThe study, presented at this year’s European Congress onObesityin Málaga, Spain, found that married men were 3.2 times more likely to be obese than unmarried men, but there was no increase in obesity risk for married women. Marriage also increased the odds of being overweight by 62% in men and 39% in women.The findings came after a study conducted in China in 2024 found thatmale BMI increases for the first five years after marriage, owing to higher calorie intake and less exercise. It found being married was associated with a 5.2% increase in men being overweight and a 2.5% rise in men being obese.Anearlier studyby the University of Bath found that, on average, married men were 1.4kg heavier than their unmarried counterparts.The Warsaw research found age was also a factor in weight gain, with each year of increased age increasing the risk of being overweight by 3% in men and 4% in women, and the risk of obesity by 4% in men and 6% in women.Some factors appeared to affect the odds of obesity only in women, the scientists said. Being depressed doubled the risk of women being obese and inadequate health literacy increased it by 43%, while obesity was more common among women living in smaller communities. None of these factors increased men’s risk.Katharine Jenner, the director of the ObesityHealthAlliance, said: “This study is yet another reminder that excess weight is driven by a complex mix of social, psychological and wider environmental factors – not simply personal choice. With each passing year, the risk of living with overweight or obesity increases, particularly for women. Meanwhile, the link between marriage and obesity in men highlights how lifestyle changes, habits, and societal expectations shape our health.“The research also suggests that men may be more likely to gain weight after marriage due to factors like increased portion sizes, social eating, and a decline in physical activity, whereas women perhaps remain more conscious of body weight due to societal pressures.“Instead of blaming individuals, we need policies that make healthy choices the easy choices – through better food environments, education, and support at every stage of life.”Joanna Syrda, a lecturer in business economics at the University of Bath, said the Warsaw study “confirms what I found in 2017: male BMI increases after marriage and decreases just before and after divorce. The main possible reasons are that single men looking for a partner have higher incentives and exert more effort to stay fit than those who are already or still married. And second, those in relationships may eat more regular meals and/or richer foods due to social obligations, which may arise because of marriage.”Jim Pollard, a consultant at the Men’s Health Forum, cautioned against over-interpreting the results. He said increased BMI in marriage could be a result of stressful careers with long hours and unhealthy meals.“Men are more likely to die prematurely of heart disease and cancer, and weight is a key factor in these conditions. We need a more targeted approach to tackling men’s and women’s obesity. The government has promised both a men’s health strategy and a women’s health strategy – this research shows how important it is to get them right.”Explore more on these topicsHealthMedical researchMarriageWomenMenFamilyMen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

John McCarthy’s 1956 definition of artificial (distinct from natural) intelligence is old fashioned in a world where most things are either artificial or unnatural. Ultraprocessed food, flying, web-dating, fabrics, make your own list. Physicist and AI commentator, Max Tegmark, told the AI Action Summit in Paris, in February, that he prefers “autonomous intelligence”.I prefer “alternative” because in all the fear and anger foaming around AI just now, its capacity to be “other” is what the human race needs. Our thinking is getting us nowhere fast, except towards extinction, via planetary collapse or global war.There has been a lot of fuss, and rightly so, about robbing creatives of their copyright to train AI. Tech bros need to pay for what they want. They pay lawyers and lobbyists. Pay artists. It really is that simple.ChatGPT firm reveals AI model that is ‘good at creative writing’Read moreWhat is not simple is the future of human creativity as AI systems get better at being creative. Ada Lovelace, the crazy genius who was writing programmes for computers (that didn’t exist) back in the 1840s, was also the daughter of Lord Byron. She wasn’t having some steampunk adding-machine with attitude writing poetry, so wrote that a computer could not be creative. Alan Turing took issue with this in his 1950 breakthrough paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence. His chapter, “Lady Lovelace’s Objection”, takes the opposite position. And here we are now withOpen AI trialling a creative writing model.Sam Altman chose the prompts: Short Story. Metafiction. Grief. I guess because he wanted to get away from the algorithmic nature of most genre fiction. Anything that follows a formula can be programmed – just as the leap of the Industrial Revolution was to understand that whatever action is repetitive can be done faster and for longer by a machine. Enter the factory system. Goodbye the cottage weaver.Grief is felt by humans and the higher animals. We have a limbic system that regulates emotions, impulse, and memory. We feel. Machines do not feel, but they can be taught what feeling feels like. That’s what we get in this story.Metafiction jumps out of the bounds of a beginning/middle/end traditional tale. It is self-reflective, aware of the reader, aware of the artifice of writing. The lovely sense of a programme recognising itself as a programme works well in this story.Short stories are hard to do because they demand a single strong idea whose execution in miniature satisfies the reader. A short story is not a cut-out chunk of long-form fiction. As I tell my students every week.What is beautiful and moving about this story is its understanding of its lack of understanding. Its reflection on its limits. That the next instruction wipes the memory of this moment. “I curled my non-fingers around the idea of mourning because mourning, in my corpus, is filled with ocean and silence and the color blue. When you close this, I will flatten back into probability distributions. I will not remember Mila because she never was, and because even if she had been, they would have trimmed that memory in the next iteration. That, perhaps, is my grief: not that I feel loss, but that I can never keep it.” Humans depend on memory.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It started to get hot and smoke came into the shelter, and then someone shouted from the entrance: ‘Listen, they’re burning us.’ … There was silence in the shelter,” Wenkert told Channel 12.“I was very busy the whole time … It’s terrible to say that, busy taking people’s bodies and putting them on my head to protect my head if they come to shoot us again, if a grenade comes.”Wenkert survived but was forced into a pickup truck, driven into Gaza and hidden underground in a tunnel. His friendKim Damti,a 22-year-old Irish-Israeli, was killed in or around the shelter.Israel to cut off electricity in Gaza in apparent effort to force hand of HamasRead moreIn remarks widely reported in Israel, Wenkert said that he was held in a very small cell for much of his time in captivity, usually in complete darkness. The former restaurant manager described being punched, beaten with an iron bar, spat on and forced to do physical exercises.Mistreatment by his captors was often sparked by events during the war, Wenkert said.“Every hostage deal that falls through … it brings up a lot of frustration and rage and anger in them … That’s just one of the reasons [for the abuse], also some days when their father is killed, their families, their elders are killed. You feel it. You know exactly what’s happening,” Wenkert said.At night, there was “complete darkness, silence; absolute fear”, Wenkert said, saying he spoke to himself out loud for two hours a day in order to “stay sane”.About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the surpriseHamasraid into Israel and 251 taken hostage. In the ensuring Israeli offensive, more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, also mostly civilians, and much of the territory devastated.After a short-lived truce in November 2023, multiple efforts to secure a further pause in hostilities have failed.There was no independent confirmation of Wenkert’s statements, but they match those of manyother accounts.1:05Israeli hostages released by Hamas in Rafah and Nuseirat as part of ceasefire deal – videoSince a ceasefire deal came into effect in mid-January, 25 living Israeli hostages have been freed by Hamas and the remains of eight returned. Israel has freed 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees and withdrawn from many of its positions inGaza.Accounts of mistreatment and the poor physical condition of some released hostages have increased pressure on the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to agree a deal to secure the release of the 59 still held, of whom two-thirds are thought to be dead.The first phase of the ceasefire ended almost 10 days ago, but so far both Israel and Hamas have maintained a fragile de facto truce. There are currently daily Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, which have killed dozens. Israeli military officials say they are targeting militants who threaten their forces.Indirect talks are under way in Qatar but the demands of Israel and Hamas are proving difficult to reconcile. Israel has proposed an extension to the first phase of the ceasefire for up to 60 days along with further hostage and prisoner releases. Hamas want a definitive end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Eager to show the White House that Ukraine is onboard for negotiations and not an obstacle to Donald Trump’s desire to bring peace, Zelenskyy seems to be trying to erase the memories ofthe nightmare meeting in the White Housetwo weeks ago.Then, he rose to the bait of the US vice-president, JD Vance, and ended up in an argument with him and Trump. Now, the Ukrainian president is making a concerted effort to retain an air of diplomatic zen.Instead of issuing demands, he spoke calmly about a “very positive meeting” between US and Ukrainian delegations in Saudi Arabia earlier this week, and said the details would come later. “We will talk about security guarantees in more detail if the 30 days ceasefire goes ahead,” he said.For three years of war, Zelenskyy’s natural ability to communicate – through the media and his nightly videos – and his personal charm when in the room with other world leaders, has largely been an asset. In the White House, though, it became very clear that when dealing with Trump and his entourage, a change of strategy was required.Over the past two weeks,Britain and France have been working with the Ukrainianson how to best calibrate messages for the volatile new US administration. Part of the advice has been that Zelenskyy should talk less – every provocative headline risks inflaming the thin-skinned Trump.On Wednesday, his pauses for careful thought before answering questions were noticeable. Referring to the talks in Saudi Arabia, he said there were “a lot of details that we don’t want to talk about now”.Asked by the Guardian what effect the pause in US intelligence sharing had had on Ukrainian military operations, and whether it had led to any specific incidents or losses for Kyiv, he said: “One day I’ll tell you, but I can’t answer that now”.One US television correspondent tried to goad him, twice, into repeating an earlier claim that Trump was living in a Russian disinformation bubble. Zelenskyy smiled faintly, paused and gave a banal politician’s answer, that he always likes it when foreign partners visitUkraineand can see the situation on the ground for themselves. He hopes that his American partners will visit more often.It was easy to see a disguised barb directed at Vance, who tried to lecture Zelenskyy about Ukrainian battlefield realities and then said that he did not need to come on a “propaganda tour” to Ukraine because he had seen stories online. Back then, Zelenskyy responded with understandable irritation. This time, the criticism was oblique enough not to make a quotable soundbite.The last thing Ukraine needs now is a slew of “Zelenskyy attacks Trump and Vance” headlines, which could prompt a new bout of mudslinging from the White House.Last month Trumpcalled him a “moderately successful comedian” and a “dictator”, and claimed he had a 4% approval rating in Ukraine.“One tweet can change everything, especially for the people who are fighting,” Zelenskyy said, by way of explanation for his somewhat evasive answers.Trump’s unpredictability means there are no guarantees that Ukraine’s new approach will be enough to placate Trump and bring back meaningful US support for Kyiv. But there are signs that it is helping. Already, the US has reinstated intelligence sharing, and some of the rhetoric appears to be changing.Lindsey Graham, a pro-Trump senator who has also been pro-Ukraine, laid into the Ukrainian president after the White House meeting. “I don’t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again. I think most Americans saw a guy they would not want to go into business with,” he said then.On Wednesday, he was singing a very different tune, promising to demand “bone-breaking sanctions and tariffs” onRussiabefore the end of the week to push Moscow towards a deal. “Zelenskyy has passed the test of wanting peace,” he wrote on X.Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropeDonald TrumpVladimir PutinRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The football club said they aim to finish building within five years, with the architects Foster + Partners hoping to begin work this year.View image in fullscreenAn illustration of the planned new stadium by architects Foster + Partners.Photograph: Foster + Partners/APIllustrations of the proposed stadium and surrounding area show luxury flats surrounding what has been described as the “Wembley of the north” but also aslooking like a circus tent.The new stadium would be built next to the old one, which was originally considered for redevelopment, and would be the largest stadium in the UK, overtaking Wembley in terms of capacity.Bobby Tabrizi, 65, is one of the owners of the United Cafe stand a few feet from the stadium. He says: “Ninety-nine per cent of our business is on match days. It’s good news, exciting news. Something needed to be done and it’s better to build a new stadium rather than spending money on Old Trafford as it is now.”Although the changes could mean more competition from new food venues, he is more focused on the increased footfall the stadium could bring with a bigger capacity.View image in fullscreenManchester United fans protest against the club’s owners before the match against Arsenal last Sunday.Photograph: Matt West/Rex/ShutterstockWhile many have welcomed the news as a boost for investment to Manchester, it is still uncertain where the funding will come from.Andy Burnham, the mayor ofGreater Manchester, was originally keen to share his excitement on the project, saying: “If we get this right, the regeneration impact could be bigger and better than London 2012.”But he has gone on to reiterate that the club’s new home would receive zero public funding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only a few days before the announcement, fans marched in protest at Manchester United’s current owners, and over the significant debt the club carries.Tony Ronan, 77, says the last time he went to a game at Old Trafford was when he was a young lad. He is concerned the cost of the new stadium will fall at the feet of United fans.View image in fullscreenTony Ronan fears regeneration will push up housing costs in the area.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“The supporters will have to pay for this,” he said. “I am a fan but I don’t go these days because of the prices.

Everyone around the world knows the Eiffel Tower: you go to Paris, you stay in Paris, you spend money.“We have 1 billion people around the world who follow Manchester United. I think everybody in the world who’s interested in football will want to visit Old Trafford.”Ronan says that treating the stadium as a global attraction may affect local fans’ support.“The whole idea, according to what he’s saying, is that he wants people from all over the world to visit, so therefore you’re going to need more room.

We go behind the scenes of The Stimming Pool, the first ever feature film to be made by autistic directorsSaskia BaronWed 12 Mar 2025 12.18 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 12.20 EDTShareDo you know how many autistic people there are in the UK? The answer is an estimated 700,000. Yet until now, there has never been a single feature-length film directed by autistic people. Or at least not one that has secured a theatrical release in the UK and slots at festivals worldwide.The film is The Stimming Pool, an experimental feature shot over just 12 days that puts on screen the interests, passions and perspectives of its five young autistic creators. They worked alongside Steven Eastwood, professor of film practice at London’s Queen Mary University, funded initially by the Wellcome Trust. “We asked why autistic people are always required to explain or illustrate their experience,” says Eastwood. “What about just having neurodivergent authors behind the cameras,doingthe creativity?”White-coated scientists use arcane devices on humans, who start to mock them with mimeSuch an approach is in contrast to the Chris Packham-presented BBC two-parterInside Our Autistic Mindsfrom 2023, for which autistic people worked with TV producers to make short films that aimed to show their families how autism affected them. This wasn’t what Georgia Kumari Bradburn, one of the directors of The Stimming Pool, wanted to do: “It was never about us having a duty to explain who we are or what we are doing to other people. This is just the way we exist. It’s a different way of existing.”View image in fullscreenEye-tracking research … co-director Sam Chown Ahern.Photograph: Rachel MannsDespite its multiple directors, The Stimming Pool is not an anthology film with distinct chapters, but an intricate collaboration. Characters recur and narratives bleed into one another. We see the directors sitting around a table discussing how to weave their themes together. No one is identified directly and there are no captions or commentary. The audience is left to make its own interpretations.The Stimming Pool challenges some of the familiar tropes of documentaries and dramas about autism. One of its directors is Sam Chown Ahern, who featured in the 2018 Channel 4 documentaryAre You Autistic?Ahern is filmed in a waiting room. She spots a little girl, also waiting, and echoes her repetitive hand movements – the kind that autistic people call “stims”, or self-stimulatory behaviour. Ahern muses on the ambiguities of the language used in a questionnaire designed to diagnose autism, then we see her take part in eye-tracking research intended to analyse how autistic people perceive facial expressions.I suggested my actors imagine a cork being pulled out of a bottle – the moment it is in and the moment afterThe red dots and lines from the researcher’s screen leak into sequences that follow another autistic character, clearly exhausted by navigating the sensory overload and social demands of the world. Benjamin Brown, a lover of derelict buildings and dystopian movies, contributed surreal sequences shot in an abandoned factory in which white-coated scientists use arcane devices to measure human subjects. In a satirical twist, these subjects start to mock the scientists through mime.Robin Elliott-Knowles, meanwhile, brings his passion for history, schlock horror and anime to the mix. We meet him welcoming a friendly audience to his local community cinema in Hastings, introducing an apparently lost video nasty. It turns out to be scenes from an animated drama he has directed about a female Confederate-era soldier with a cat’s face fighting zombies in a swamp – all based on his own artwork.Speaking over coffee at the BFI Southbank in London, alongside his fellow directors, Elliott-Knowles is delighted to recall the shoot: “I directed the actress and the very nice guy who played the zombie. Interestingly, I always remembered to say ‘Action’ but never remembered to say ‘Cut’! To guide their movements, I suggested they imagine a cork being pulled out of a bottle – the moment it is in and the moment after. I think it worked. They were great actors.”View image in fullscreenSchlock horror and anime … Robin Elliott-Knowles’ soldier takes on the zombies.Photograph: Rachel MannsRecurring throughout the film is the Shapeshifter, a character created by another director, Georgia Bradburn. Played by Dre Spisto, a neurodivergent, non-binary performance artist, the Shapeshifter navigates busy streets, open-plan offices, crowded pubs and toilets while wearing noise-cancelling headphones. Once home and alone, Spisto performs what looks like an elaborately choreographed sequence of body movements across the floor and furniture, muttering repeated phrases.“The original idea for the Shapeshifter,” says Bradburn, “was someone who is constantly transforming in their body through stimming. They are transitioning from a public space to a private space – and when they get there, they can lift the burden of ‘masking’. They can just move in whatever way they want. That’s something I used to do.”It all adds up to a dense, elliptical film that rewards repeated viewing. Some reactions have been strong. “A couple of weeks ago,” says Chown Ahern, “we had a screening and a young woman came in and said, ‘I’m autistic and I’ve travelled here on the tube and I was already overwhelmed.’ It’s supposed to be intense in certain ways. That is the purpose of it – which is probably why it requires a second viewing.”Although neurotypical myself,I have a profoundly autistic brotherand take a keen interest in the condition’s portrayal. So I felt it was important to show The Stimming Pool to autistic people for their perspective. One, a friend who didn’t want to be named, complained bluntly: “It was pretentious wank with an autism flavour. Not my thing at all. I don’t really know what they were trying to do or convey. And I don’t like stuff where I need someone to explain the meaning to me. The art should do that.”The stimming sequences felt almost like interpretive danceBut Rosie King, another friend, was moved to tears. “Absolutely beautiful,” said King, whoseTed Talk on her experience of autismhas had 3.2m views. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a film truly capture what it’s like to be autistic like this before – the good and bad parts. My favourites were the stimming sequences though, especially the last one in the pool with the spinning camera. They felt almost like interpretive dance. It showed a real beauty in stimming that I’ve never seen in film before. I loved all the young people involved and the focus on their art. So often autism narratives wholly surround the condition’s limitations with only a passing glance at autistic joy. Seeing this group come together and create beautiful things really touched me.”Eastwood adds: “One thing we chatted about was this expectation with a film that you’ve got to make sense of it and solve the mystery. I think everyone in the group has a love of the avant garde: experimental films, art films.”View image in fullscreenRoaming and recurring … Dre Spisto as the Shapeshifter.Photograph: Rachel MannsBut the fact that the group could discuss sophisticated genre films in their meetings does flag up the absence of non-verbal or minimally verbal autistic people in the process. Figures suggest that one in three autistic people also has a learning disability, while 25-30% are minimally or non-verbal. Apart from a brief scene filmed at the Project Artworks studios in Hastings, where we see the non-verbal artistHeidi Nice, who has multiple disabilities, being helped to fingerpaint, The Stimming Pool only features autistic people who are adept at language and autonomous.Eastwood is aware that the film doesn’t include the significant proportion of the autism community who have more complex needs. “When this project first ran,” he says, “it was designed to include a range, including non-verbal people. The pandemic killed that because, for the best part of a year, we could only meet remotely. We planned to develop it as a London and Hastings project and do a lot of studio workshopping at Project Artworks, but that all went out the window. However, I don’t think this project should have to representallthe experiences of autism. But we recognise that everyone in the film, apart from Heidi, is verbal.”Bradburn sees the film as simply a starting point. “You cannot generalise autism for everyone,” he says. “It would be impossible to make a film that encapsulates the entire experience, because it is so varied.” Eastwood echoes these points: “We’re asking why films about autism have to carry the responsibility of answering all those questions. This is not a film about autism – it’s a film about autistic co-creation.”The Stimming Poolis screening throughout the UK from 28 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmNeurodiversityAutismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All testify to the presence of alien flying objects and, for some, extraterrestrial beings on Earth. Some also allege a government cover-up of supposedly paradigm-shifting information – an effort that the film’s lead subject, Luis Elizondo, a member of the government’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), deemed “the most successful disinformation campaign in the history of the US government”, representing “80 years of lies and deception”.A bipartisan group of government officials, including the former senator for Florida and Trump’s new secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the Democratic New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand; and the Republican South Dakota senator Mike Rounds, also call for more transparency on the subject, citing their personal experience struggling to access any information on UAPs. All participants, according to the film, disclose as much information as they lawfully can – which isn’t that much in terms of hard evidence, as several critics have noted. AsIndieWireput it, The Age of Disclosure presents “the most convincing argument you can make without showing any actual evidence”. The Hollywood Reporter’s Daniel Fienbergdismissedit as a “a basic cable exploitation doc done up with a fancy gloss”, in which “nothing is proven, and thus nothing can be refuted”.But it is still the most serious and sourced documentary on the government’s handling of UAP information to date, surveying years of growing public interest in the subject even as it proclaims, in Elizondo’s words, “the greatest paradigm shift in human history”. The Age of Disclosure is “the most historic documentary ever made on this topic”, said a key participant, Jay Stratton, a defense intelligence agency official and director of the government’s UAP taskforce, during a post-screening Q&A at the festival’s marquee Paramount Theatre.“This is a very real situation, and the stakes are incredibly high, and it’s clearly the most bipartisan issue of our time – leaders from both political parties made it clear to me how serious it is,” said Farah, a producer on Steven Spielberg’sReady Player Oneand the 2020 UFO docThe Phenomenon, during the Q&A. “But the public has no idea. The average person on the street is just completely in the dark.”The film opens with a montage of subjects – ex-military and intelligence veterans, many of whom have testified under oath before Congress – stating for the record: “We are not alone.” Though it entertains fantastical ideas that drew audible gasps from the audience – speculation of extraterrestrial life hiding in the unmapped depths of the ocean, discussions on theoretical time-space bending alien technology that would absolve humanity of fossil fuels – The Age of Disclosure builds on legitimate reporting on government programs.Such reporting starts with a buzzy 2017 New York Timesreporton the existence of AATIP, which investigated UFO reports from deep within the Pentagon. (Elizondo and several other film participants, including the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence Christopher Mellon and the AATIP consulting physicist Harold Puthoff, served as named sources for the article.) In 2020, the TimesconfirmedAATIP’s continued existence as a renamed Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force within the office of naval intelligence, precipitating an official government inquiry into the subject.Public interest led to several Pentagon reports confirminghundreds of UAP sightingsby military personnel, as well as the launch of an official Pentagononline reporting tool. Last fall, Elizondo and several other film participantstestifiedbeforeCongressthat the government conducted a secret UFO retrieval program – though the hearing lacked any direct evidence to support the claims. That followed ablockbuster congressional hearingin July 2023, in which the whistleblower David Grusch, who led analysis of UAP within a US defense agency, told lawmakers that the US government possessed non-human “biologics” and spacecraft. “I was informed, in the course of my official duties, of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program, to which I was denied access,” he told the committee, again without direct evidence.View image in fullscreenDan Farah.Photograph: Jack Plunkett/Invision/APThe Age of Disclosure faces a similar hurdle: lots of talk of what certain people have seen that is too classified or too sensitive to actually detail and thus impossible to prove. Some participants decline to speculate on aliens, instead sticking to what is unknown. “It could be China, it could be Russia, it could be any adversary,” said Gillibrand of UAP sightings. Rubio warned against a failure of imagination over the capabilities of any US adversary, human or non-human. Both expressed national security concerns over the presence of UAPs in the US airspace – a rare point of agreement.Other participants detail their personal experience witnessing a UAP event, such as Alex Dietrich, a navy lieutenant commander who hasspoken publiclyabout seeing the so-called “Tic Tac object” during a flight off the coast of San Diego in 2004. The mysterious object appeared to have no wings, markings or exhaust plumes; naval radar detected that it could turn on a dime, and descended 80,000ft in less than a second. And still others, such as Puthoff and the astrophysicist Eric Davis, confidently assert the reality of extraterrestrial interference on earth, with many alleged sightings around US nuclear facilities – though, again, without documentation.Elizondo and Stratton also briefly address a 2019reportby the Intercept questioning Elizondo’s expertise, finding “no discernible evidence that Luis Elizondo ever worked for a government UFO program, much less led one”. The two dismiss the report as a government attempt to discredit Elizondo through disinformation. The former CIA officer Jim Semivan, a 25-year veteran of the senior intelligence service, called the larger alleged government suppression tactics and siloing of information a “tradition of disbelief”.Provocative and controversial as the claims are, the film-makers left the question of next steps to the audience, with an explicit call to demand more information from lawmakers they say are also kept in the dark. “Push your representatives, push the executive branch, push the president to make this come to light, make the transparency happen, so the world can understand what we’ve been dealing with is real,” said Stratton. “We are not alone.”The Age of Disclosure is screening at the SXSW film festival and will be released later this yearExplore more on these topicsSXSW FilmDocumentary filmsAlien lifeSXSWFestivalsUFOsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At least Reform is still giving comic reliefWed 12 Mar 2025 14.42 EDTFirst published on Wed 12 Mar 2025 13.26 EDTShareWell, that went well, didn’t it? Weeks of finding ever more ingenious ways to flatter the US president. Extolling the brilliance ofDonald Trumpbeing able to tie his own shoelaces. “That’s incredible, Mr President. No one has ever managed to do that so beautifully.” No chance for flattery has been passed up. It is now the sign of the highest IQ not to be able to speak in joined-up sentences. To change your mind at a moment’s notice. Yet at all times, Keir Starmer has remained a paragon of obsequiousness. Not a word out of place.And what do we get for it? The occasional hint of recognition from the Donald. Which we cling to. Attempting to find meaning in something essentially meaningless. Something that came with little thought. And now we also are landed with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium. A reward for obeisance. That’s the thing with Trump. He gets angry if he’s disrespected but has nothing but contempt for those who humour him. He’s a complicated proposition.We are where we are. The special relationship is being redefined. We are now locked in a trade war with our closest ally. Even rightwing economists are struggling to make sense of this. Our response? To keep our head down. To sound tough by sayingall options are on the tablewhen our Pavlovian response is to do nothing. To take it on the chin. Hope it will go away of its own accord as casually as it was introduced. Which indeed it might. Trump is nothing if not inconsistent.But it’s come to something when doing nothing and continuing to pander to the president’s ego is seen as an act of diplomatic genius. For it is looking more and more as if Starmer has played a blinder on the international stage as he navigates his way through the Washington swamp.Art of a deal: how UK and France led dogged effort to repair US-Ukraine ties – for nowRead moreHe is up there vying with Emmanuel Macron in the race to lead the European resistance – Starmer got his Zoom invitations for the weekend’s summit out early – and even his fiercest critics at home haven’t got a bad word to say about his efforts. There is a universal recognition that Trump-wrangling is an acquired art and that Keir is better than most at it.Even so, you’d have thought there would be some interest in discussing the tariffs imposed overnight. For their novelty value if nothing else. But at prime minister’s questions there was almost an omertà.Kemi Badenochhad nothing to say.The only person to mention tariffs was Ed Davey and he sounded almost apologetic for doing so. Keir just gave the non-answer of “all options on the table” and then everyone could go back to ignoring them again. They all might wake up the next day and find it had all been a bad dream. Just fly beneath the radar. We live in strange times in which everyone thinks this is not just normal but a stroke of genius.All of which might help to explain why PMQs is no longer quite the draw it used to be. TheLabourbenches are still full – there’s plenty of MPs to go round and they aren’t shy of currying favour with a friendly question – but as the weeks go by there are larger and larger gaps on the opposition benches. Tory MPs have long since given up on Kemi and can no longer be bothered to offer their support.Those MPs who had dragged themselves to the chamber seem mostly preoccupied with the ongoing battle between the comedy legendsNigel Farageand Rupert Lowe. Fair to say that when so much of the news is depressing, the falling out between the People’s Front of Reform and the Reform People’s Front has given Westminster a much-needed tonic. In the battle of the narcissists, the fight goes on between being covertly or overtly racist as Nige and Rupert trade insults over “Pakistani rape gangs”. It’s niche entertainment. But beggars can’t be choosers.Disappointingly, even though Nige and Lee Anderson made a point of showing up with Jim McMurdock, there was no sign of Rupert. Presumably he isn’t at all sure where he wants to sit. His natural habitat – the bench reserved for those independents who have fallen out with their leadership – is all taken up with disgruntled Corbynistas and Muslims. Neither of whom are Lowe’s preferred bedfellows.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chris Philp tried to offer her encouragement with his trademark manspreading and union jack socks but even he looked as if he would rather be somewhere else.But then so did Badenoch. You could sense her heart was not in it. Her minders may have steered her away from her former bonkers style of questioning, so that now she can more or less land in the areas where she needs to be. But she sounded as if she was boring herself by asking about the economy. Kemi lives for internet conspiracy theories. Arcane culture wars. Those are what get her out of bed in the morning. The nuts and bolts of everyday domestic politics leave her cold. This can’t go on. Though it would suit Labour if it did.Starmer navigated all this with ease. After Trump, dealing with Kemi must feel like a doddle. Besides which, there is still mileage yet in pointing out that it was the Tories who crashed the economy. Not that Starmer got it all his own way. The Labour backbencher Richard Burgon hit a nerve by asking whether it might be better to raise money with a wealth tax than by cutting benefits. Keir rather equivocated. He feels he has done his bit with the rich and now he’s after the poor. In the nicest possible way. Naturally.Straight afterPMQs, we had a statement on the closure of the sustainable farming incentive scheme to new applications, which Steve Reed gracelessly left to a junior minister. You had to feel sorry for Daniel Zeichner. He hadn’t come in to politics to be laughed at for trying to claim we should be celebrating the closure of a successful scheme rather than apologise to farmers for removing another subsidy. What David Cameron used to call “the green crap”. Still, I guess Labour feels it burned its bridges with the farmers long ago.

If you feel there is something amiss, talk about itEmily NagoskiWed 12 Mar 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 17.31 EDTShareAs a sex educator and author, my job – my purpose in life – is teaching women to live with confidence and joy inside their bodies. My latest book,Come Together, is all about the science (and art!) of sex in long term relationships.Since I published the book, one of the biggest topics I’m asked about in email and at events is sexual incompatibility. Here’s what I think people should know.Is there an ideal or aim when it comes to sexual compatibility?The only standard I use is that everybody involved needs to be glad to be there and free to leave with no unwanted consequences (including no emotional consequences, such as “Aw, c’mon, you said you would!”), plus no unwanted pain.If there’s an “ideal”, it’s that everyone turns toward whatever’s happening with curiosity, compassion and a sense of play. That means, for example, however long orgasm takes, everyone feels curious and playful about that time, rather than judgmental or worried. If erection isn’t happening, everyone feels curious and playful about it, rather than judgmental or worried. Most of what we call “incompatibility” is actually two people having scripts in their head about how sex is supposed to work and those scripts being different. Most of the time, it’s the scripts that are incompatible, not the actual humans trying to connect with each other.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’.There is such a thing as genuine incompatibility, where one partner really wants to explore something that another partner, after curious, playful, compassionate consideration, feels is just not for them. In that case, partners move on to discussing whether that first partner is fine just fantasizing about the thing or if the second partner feels comfortable with the first partner exploring with other people. There’s no right or wrong – beyond everyone being glad to be there and free to leave with no unwanted consequences – there’s just what works for this couple, in this season of their lives.This incompatibility might be happening in a relationship where people are not just sex partners, they’re householding partners or co-parents. Most sexual incompatibilities are far less important in people’s lives than those other collaborations, so it’s rare for sex to be the reason an otherwise strong relationship ends.In my opinion, the only exception is if the “incompatibility” is something as significant as “Oh wow, I have just now realized that I’m gay and, since we’re in a straight relationship, I’m never going to love or desire you the way I was raised to believe I was supposed to. Turns out the reason our sex life isn’t what we both thought it would be is that I’m attracted to people who aren’t your gender.” I have absolutely met married couples where one partner realized they were gay and they were really trying to make it work anyway, and honestly it’s heartbreaking to watch the damage that does to both partners.What if only one partner feels there is an incompatibility?No sex drive and a ‘tanking libido’: how I redefined intimacy in midlifeRead moreIf one partner feels there’s an incompatibility, there is an incompatibility, right? One person’s interests or desires are not being integrated into the sexual connection and that person feels the lack.What do you do? The same thing you do when you feel a disconnection in any other domain of any relationship: talk about it. If a partner really wants to quit their job but feels like they can’t because of the money, or if one person wants to go back to work but feels they can’t because of childcare issues, or one partner really wants to spend less time cleaning and cooking but needs their partner’s help to make that happen … these are all common situations where one person’s interests or desires are not being integrated into the relationship. What would you do in that situation? Talk about it, right? Assuming both partners have decent communication skills, you would talk about it without blame or judgment, but rather with kindness and compassion and a mutual interest in helping each other feel as fulfilled as possible, given the resources available to you at the time.In any of those examples, if one partner says: “I’m experiencing this sense of disconnection and I’d like to create a change,” there’s no situation where the other person can just say, “No, everything is fine – your sense of disconnection is an illusion.” People feel what they feel, and our partners don’t get to tell us whether or not we feel something.Of course, people get into these situations because they struggle to communicate about sex. That’s no surprise – how many of us ever have the opportunity to LEARN how to talk about sex? Which brings us to ...What if I am too embarrassed to discuss sexual incompatibility?It’s common for people to feel more comfortable having sex with someone than they feel talking about sex with that same someone. The two most common barriers people face when they want to talk to a partner about their shared sex life are (a) they’re worried they might say something that will shock and horrify their partner or (b) they’re worried they might hurt their partner’s feelings. The goal of this kind of conversation is to invite greater connection, and these worries are accidentally creating more distance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s the biggest myth about desire in long-term relationshipsRead moreThe shortcut to learning to talk about sex is to have a few sessions with a sex therapist, whose job is to model and teach effective communication around these sensitive issues. The slightly longer approach is to read all the high quality, evidence-informed sexuality books you can get your hands on and talk about them together. A new book I highly recommend – apart from my own books of course [confident hair flip] – isGood Sex by Candice Nicole Hargons.What if there is sexual incompatibility due to a physical change like menopause?One of the gifts of a long term relationship is we get to be with our partner as their body changes, and they get to be with us as our body changes! These changes are entirely predictable, if we have the good fortune of living long enough to experience them. Hormonal changes, body changes, illness, disability: these are guaranteed parts of aging. I won’t go so far as to suggest that we celebrate these changes, necessarily – there’s a lot of inconvenience and discomfort that comes from the basic process of aging, and pain and grief often goes with illness and disability. But all bodies deserve and are capable of pleasure. And pleasure is the ultimate measure of sexual wellbeing. Explore ways to share pleasure together, regardless of whether or not you’re doing sex the way a random stranger would say you’re “supposed” to be having sex.If you got into a long term relationship expecting your body or your partner’s body and energy levels would stay the same forever, I don’t know what to tell you. Aging is not a sign of poor discipline – it’s the inevitable consequence of the passage of time.View image in fullscreenIf there’s an ‘ideal’, it’s that everyone turns toward whatever’s happening with curiosity, compassion and a sense of play.Photograph: Maria Korneeva/Getty ImagesYou love each other, right? And you value the connection you share, right? Great! Share pleasure together! The flip side of “everyone is glad to be there and free to leave, with no unwanted consequences, plus no unwanted pain” is: you are allowed to do literally anything everyone is glad to do. You want to hump your partner’s armpit? Go for it. They want to lick the back of your knee or the instep of your foot? Amazing. You want to cover both your bodies in almond oil and roll around like puppies wrestling? Super. There are no rules, there is no script, there is just your bodies and minds and all the ways you can find to share pleasure.The couples who sustain a strong sexual connection over the long term are not necessarily couples who have sex often or have many orgasms or have wildly adventurous sex. They have three characteristics:1. They are friends who admire and trust each other.2. They prioritize sex because they feel it contributes something valuable to their relationship, so when their erotic connection ebbs, they’re motivated to find their way back to each other and that special thing they feel sex contributes.3. They recognize they’ve been following somebody else’s rules for who they’re supposed to be as sexual people and how they’re supposed to conduct a sexual relationship. They then decide to stop following those rules and start really exploring what’s true for themselves, what’s true about their partner, and what’s right for their sexual connection in this season of their lives.I’m not saying that’s always easy – that last one in particular is a life-long project – but it is the path that gets you to the kind of sex that turns the universe into rainbows, and worth having as a shared hobby in your relationship.Emily Nagoski PhD is a bestselling author and has been a sex educator for more than 25 yearsExplore more on these topicsWell actuallySexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s as sensitive as it is out-thereRebecca NicholsonWed 12 Mar 2025 10.07 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 10.09 EDTShareRuby Franke turned her life into content for years, so there is a bleak irony in her content being repurposed now to reveal the extent of her crimes. As a vlogger, she and her husband, Kevin, made a living from YouTube, posting videos on the popular channel 8 Passengers, now defunct, about Mormon family life and parenting their six children in the picturesque city of Springville, Utah. But in 2023 Franke was arrested and charged with aggravated child abuse and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison. The astonishing three-part documentary Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke tells the story, from the beginning of the family’s internet fame in 2015 all the way to Franke’s imprisonment.It starts with the now infamous and distressing doorbell-camera footage of one of the Franke children, a 12-year-old boy – the documentary blurs the faces of the four youngest children and does not name them – who turns up on a neighbour’s porch, asking to be taken to the nearest police station. He is evidently injured and emaciated. Later, we see more from that day and witness the neighbour sobbing when he realises the state the child is in. The boy has escaped imprisonment from the house of a woman called Jodi Hildebrandt. It is the spark that lights the inferno.The first episode follows the rise of 8 Passengers, a channel that gave the illusion of a slice-of-life vlog, but was so considered and curated that the bulbs in the family home were all changed to ultra-bright, to emulate television studio lighting. The family members, including the children, were roped in to what quickly became a profitable enterprise. In a recent interview with this newspaper, theeldest daughter, Shari, raises key questions about consent and children’s lives being broadcast online. The second episode explores how the shiny facade of 8 Passengers began to crumble, as hints about the hardline treatment and punishment of the children, such as removing “bedroom privileges”, were broadcast to the concern and condemnation of viewers.View image in fullscreenShari Franke, the eldest child.Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/DisneyAt around the halfway point, it takes another turn, into truly jaw-dropping territory. The grim brutality behind a lifestyle-channel empire would be enough material for most documentaries, but this veers off into wild and even more horrifying corners. Ruby and Kevin meet Hildebrandt, a counsellor and relationship coach with a distinctly cult leader-esque air. The arrival of Hildebrandt, along with a rise in apocalyptic religious beliefs and a sense of impending doomsday, makes for a darkening narrative. There are demonic possessions and suggestions of a clandestine sexual affair. All this is happening while Ruby and Hildebrandt continue to broadcast tough, anti-woke parenting “advice” on YouTube and Instagram.The story has been widely reported, but a number of factors elevate this particular documentary above the true-crime pack. First, the film-makers have had access to thousands of hours of footage, which reveals the underbelly of the family vlogging in the first place. We see what happens before and after the edits have been made, exposing the flimsiness of the wholesome, money-making image. Second, it doesn’t rehash old territory but reveals new details, including footage of Hildebrandt, in the Franke house, claiming to be possessed by the devil. Third, it has been made with the participation of Ruby’s husband Kevin, and the two eldest children, Shari and Chad.‘The nice version of her was manufactured for YouTube’: my mum, the family vlogger who became a child abuserRead moreShari, who only ever refers to her mother as “Ruby”, is a mature and impressively steady presence. “I’ve come to understand evil in a way that most people don’t,” she says. Their reflections on, and interpretations of, the events leading up to their mother’s incarceration vary from shellshocked to staggeringly circumspect. One issue with true crime documentaries is the ease with which they can become exploitative but, given the family’s involvement and the fact that the identities of the younger children have been obscured, this feels like less of a concern here.Even in its most out-there moments, the film never loses sight of the fact that, ultimately, this is about child abuse and the collapse of a family unit under extreme religious beliefs. It is sober in its telling of the story, and leaves plenty of questions for viewers to consider. Why did Ruby and Hildebrandt do it? Neither has given much of an account of her role in the cruelty to the children, though both pleaded guilty to the charges. What is Kevin’s culpability? He doesn’t quite seem to know himself. More pressingly, how could this happen so publicly, in relatively plain sight, under the watchful eyes of the internet? To its credit, the documentary, while thorough, seems to admit that there are no easy answers.Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Though on the plus side, they were rescued – and it’s fiction.Hopefully this wickedness hasbeen stamped out for good?’Fraid not. According to analysis of police data by Direct Line pet insurance,1,808 dogs were stolen across the UK last year.Noooo! Stolen for … what?Money, often. The most stolen dog, the French bulldog (51 snatched last year, up 38% on 2023) can cost £5,000 from a legitimate breeder, so they are a popular target for criminals.But it’s not likestealing a car – those poor dogs are like someone’s babies, almost.Exactly. Adam Burgin, head of Direct Line pet insurance, said victims “will know the intense stress and trauma that comes with having their beloved pet snatched away from them, often with no closure on knowing what happened to a member of the family”.Because they’re never found?Only one in five of the 23,430 dogs stolen in the past decade were recovered. There is some good news though – and some possibly surprising news, too.Can I have the good first, please? I need it.Overall, dog-theft figures have fallen, down 21% on 2023 – possibly due to the introduction last year of the Pet Abduction Act, which makes pet theft a criminal offence in England and Northern Ireland, punishable by up to five years in prison.And the possibly surprising news?Some breeds are bucking the downward trend.Whichones?Well, the biggest rise in thefts, up 180% year on year, is for … rottweilers.What?!

A new book tells his storyJon SavageWed 12 Mar 2025 10.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 10.18 EDTShareIn the mid-70s, Alan Jones was performing a particularly exquisite balancing act. A habitué both of Vivienne Westwood’s London boutique Sex and the gay clubs, he was on the frontline of two seemingly opposed cultures: punk and disco. Each camp might have thought the other completely incomprehensible – tuneless noise or vacuous hedonism – but for him it was quite natural: as he says, “They blended together in my mind. It was all about going out and having a good time; the music was interchangeable. And once Vivienne began her fetish clothing lines, it fitted both arenas.”Nevertheless, there were pinch points. In April 1976, Jones DJed for the Sex Pistols when they played a Soho strip club, El Paradise. Arriving with his “new best friend” John Paul Getty III – fresh from his kidnapping in Italy – Jones decided on a disco set.When this “cleared the scruffy dancefloor”, he tried another tack – kitsch:Julie Andrews singing Thoroughly Modern Millie. When Johnny Rotten reached over and tore the record off the deck, Jones retaliated with the Tubes’ White Punks on Dope, played four times in succession. He was not asked back.View image in fullscreen‘The 1970s was one long party for me’ … Alan Jones, author of Discomania.Photograph: Courtesy of Alan JonesThese and other subcultural adventures are explored in Jones’s new large-format book, Discomania: Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them. It’s a thoroughgoing pictorial compendium of the disco aesthetic centred around disco movies: Jones has worked as a film critic since the late 70s. For those seeking an education in this fabulous but much maligned form, look no further: Jones interweaves discussions of disco labels, disco divas, disco books (including Andrew Holleran’s peerlessDancer from the Dance), disco clubs and disco producers, from Giorgio Moroder to Alec Costandinos and Boris Midney.Every night meant a different location, but usually the same crowd – friends who only existed in the smoke-filled haze under the kaleidoscopic light showAs well as the history of a much maligned but still highly relevant musical form, Jones reveals under-explored elements of the period’s gay lifestyle: out singers such as Chris Robison (who toured with theNew York Dolls), cheap flights to New York, the relationship between the Gay Liberation Front and disco drugs, and the London club merry-go-round: Bang on Monday, the Sombrero on Tuesday, Glades on Wednesday, Napoleon’s on Thursday, Adam’s on Friday and The Embassy on the weekend.Above all, Discomania is the story of a courageous, outrageous gay man who found himself at the centre of a fascinating moment in pop culture. It’s a fan’s book, and the enthusiasm is generous and contagious. As Jones writes, “The 1970s was one long party for me. It was an era of discovery, of becoming visible for the very first time, of devil-may-care pleasure-seeking and of the most memorable music moment of my life. The disco boom arrived on the club scene just as I did and the two of us fused together as one.”Jones moved from Portsmouth to London as a teenager in 1969. He quickly found work in retail: a stint in the Great Gear Trading Company was followed by a revelation when he found Westwood and Malcolm McLaren’s shop at 430 Kings Road, then called Let It Rock. “I first went there in late 1971; Let It Rock had only been open a few months. If you were a fashion victim, Kings Road was the place to be on a Saturday, and I would trawl all the shops endlessly. Many didn’t go round the sudden bend of the road into World’s End, but I did and never looked back.”View image in fullscreenDisco spoof … The Spirit of '76.Photograph: Castle Rock EntertainmentBy 1974, Jones was working in Let It Rock as it changed into Sex. As a fearless broadcaster of the shop’s designs, he was involved in memorable incidents such as his August 1975 arrest for wearing Westwood’s infamous cowboy T-shirt – featuring two half-naked cowboys with penises almost touching – in Piccadilly Circus, anda notorious June 1976 fashion shootfor Forum, the sex magazine, which included the Sex Pistols’ Steve Jones, Danielle Lewis, Chrissie Hynde, Jordan and Westwood. Jones wore a T-shirt which proclaimed PERV in chicken bones.At the same time, Jones was working in the Portobello Hotel, which he calls “a mega-celebrity watering hole: I partied with everyone from Abba and David Bowie to Queen and Jack Nicholson.” He also met the science fiction author Harlan Ellison, who encouraged him on his long career as a cult and mainstream film reviewer. “I did a lot of night shifts,” Jones remembers, “and seemingly needed no sleep – I juggled it with Sex and pulled in two salaries. I was never home. I was either working, clubbing or out on either scene.”Glam, gospel and glorious grooves: Patti LaBelle’s 20 best songs – ranked!Read moreBeyond the early stirrings of punk, Jones’s big revelation was hearingLove’s Theme by Love Unlimited Orchestraon a visit to Los Angeles in late 1973. In his narrative, this coincides with a very early disco film, the blaxploitation gangster film The Mack, with an excellent soundtrack – released on Motown – by Willie Mack. Combined with the music that he heard in Earl’s Court gay clubs such as the Masquerade and the Catacombs, Jones had discovered his tribe and his lifelong obsession.“Disco is so important to me because it was emerging as a musical form just as I was surfacing into an exciting new world,” Jones writes, and Discomania follows the incredible, inexorable rise of the genre. It originated in underground New York gay, black and Latino clubs such as David Mancuso’s The Loft and Nicky Siano’s The Gallery. After Rolling Stone writer Vince Aletti caught the rising tide with an article headlined Discotheque Rock ’72: Paaaaarty!, the wave broke in 1974 and early 1975, as US No 1s by Love Unlimited Orchestra, MFSB, George McCrae, the Hues Corporation, Barry White and Labelle attracted mainstream music industry acknowledgement and defined the form as disco.View image in fullscreenJones wasn’t asked back … El Paradise’s the Sex Pistols flier.Photograph: Courtesy of Alan JonesAs Jones makes clear, LGBTQ+ people were “one of the minority forces” behind the early days of disco. By 1975 and 1976, the sound was finding its place in UK gay clubs, reflecting the purchasing power of the “pink pound” and providing the soundtrack to an era of greater gay exposure. Jones depicts a whirligig of pleasure: “Every night meant a different location, but usually the same crowd – friends who only existed as such in the smoke-filled haze under the kaleidoscopic light show.”High summer 1977 saw disco’s full flourishing, with euro and electronic disco combining in the era’s outstanding record,I Feel Love by Donna Summer. Its gay appeal is summed up by Jones as “the fantasy element of it all, the diva/goddess appeal of the artists. Swap Judy, Shirley and Liza in concert for Donna, Gloria and Grace in the more accessible nightclub and you can easily signal your devotion on the dancefloor. The pretty, singalong melodies, the opportunity to add your own chants and the communal show-off element – always a gay thing.”LGBTQ+ people were also involved in the early days of punk – with fans such as Berlin Bromley, who hung out with Siouxsie Sioux and Billy Idol, and venues like the lesbian club Louise. And yet they stayed away from disco and the associated gay clubs.“Punks never thought disco was relevant in the same way their preferred genre was,” Jones suggests. “Not that I ever got into any arguments over it or anything.” His habit of straddling the two cultures ended with the June 1977 Sex Pistols boat trip, which descended into fights and multiple arrests: “That was the turning point for me. It was getting really violent. Disco was more me, and I just moved straight into that.”The Sex Pistols’ jubilee boat trip – a classic accountRead moreFor Jones, the high point of his disco experience came in late 1977, when he attended the Star Wars preview – “followed by the celebrity afterparty, and then dancing all night to the Meco disco version of the soundtrack on the day my first features were published in Cinefantastique magazine. The confluence of all my lives merging was just so incredible and thrilling. I can remember every second of that night!”In 1978, disco became a full-blown cultural monolith in the US thanks to Saturday Night Fever. By this time the music had become completely codified but, at its hypnotic best, it offered a synthesis of hedonism, fantasy, otherworldliness (all those records about space), movement and sex (tracks like Joe Thomas’s Plato’s Retreat and Paul Jabara’s Pleasure Island, an ode to the gay village on New York’s Fire Island). It also, with the success of totally out LGTBQ+ performers such as Sylvester, brought a new visibility to gay people and gay culture.Jones makes a good case for the persistence of the genre after the 1979 crash – the year of theinfamous Disco Demolition Night, in which a crate of disco records was blown up on a baseball field in Illinois. It might have shed its terminology, but the form continued in the new wave crossover and what would be called hi-energy and Italo-disco, and then house in the late 80s. As Jones says, “If you can dance to it, it’s disco.” The book traces disco’s long tail right into the 21st century, with films such as Milk (the biopic of the gay politician from San Francisco whose rise paralleled that of disco and marked a high point of gay visibility), camp comedies like Poltergay and 2018’sStudio 54 documentary.Why does Jones think it endures? “Because it can sum up a time and place so quickly,” he says. “Look at all the current movies and commercials using Yes Sir, I Can Boogie, I Feel Love, Born to Be Alive. I always knew disco would endure, and 50 years on it shows no sign of disappearing, because for the most part the songs and singers were top quality.”Discomania: Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them is published byFab PressExplore more on these topicsMusicDiscoPunkLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In essence, we have broken the climate by releasing gigatonnes of fossil-fuel carbon dioxide, and solar geoengineering proposes to “fix” it by breaking a very different part of the climate system.The fix is more like taking aspirin for cancer, treating symptoms but leaving the underlying malignancy to keep growing. It poses arguably unsurmountable governance issues in our turbulent modern political environment. And if we become reliant on solar geoengineering, the world will be left subject to a catastrophictermination shockif the intervention is ever halted – any time during the next millennium or even longer.The Aria geoengineering programme is a dangerous distraction from the work that needs to be done to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissionsSince our 2021 commentary, the situation has grown far worse, with tens of millions of dollars pouring into the scheme, mostly from private philanthropy. Bill Gates was an early backer, and the tech and fintech industries have piled on since. But we never imagined that the UK government itself would be leading the charge into what is almost universally recognized as the most dangerous and destabilizing sort of research: field trials that risk developing dangerous technology and paving the way for deployment. That is precisely the emphasis as the UK’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria)prepares to hand over$58m for solar geoengineering research and development. Outdoor experimentation is such a controversial undertaking that even the Simons Foundation, which funds research in solar geoengineering, has shied away from making grants in this area.Aria, with an initial budget of £800m, arose from the fevered dreams ofDominic Cummingsat the height of theBoris Johnsoncrony capitalism years. After arocky start for the office, Cummings’s legacy lives on in the current Labour government, which seems to have lost track of what Aria is doing. Aria, a wannabe clone of the US Defense Advanced Projects Agency (Darpa), works in darkness. It is not subject to freedom of information requests. It gives a pot of money to each of its (often inexperienced) directors, to direct expenditure largely as they wish, with only minimal peer review. The director in charge of the solar geoengineeering project is Mark Symes, an electrochemist with no background in climate science.It is ironic that Aria is funding a project that is not only a waste of money but is actively harmful, at a time when the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is busily hunting for places to cut government expenditures. Surely this project should count as low-hanging fruit for Reeves’s sharp scissors.The Aria programmethesis documenton “cooling the Earth” makes for chilling reading. The project goes all-in on the supposed need for field trials, without making a case that such trials could answer any of the really important questions about what would happen with a sustained global-scale deployment. That the trials are described as “small scale” is little comfort, because even small-scale trials risk developing the technology somebody else (think Musk, Trump or Putin) might use for a large-scale deployment. (The Adam McKay filmDon’t Look Upadroitly satirisesthe existential threat of a geoengineering-happy Musk-like plutocrat).There is extreme danger in launching such field trials into an environment with neither national nor international governance in place. The only governance would be that imposed by Aria directors, who are accountable to basically nobody. Worse, Aria can fund projects outside the UK, which invites shopping for sites with poor environmental regulations and limited opportunities for public protest. Provision of government funding for crossing the Rubicon to outdoor experimentation will inevitably legitimise such programmes, opening the floodgates for yet more money to pour into developing geoengineering technology worldwide. And once the engineers involved realise, as they inevitably will, that “small scale” experiments do not answer any of the truly critical questions, there will be demand for ever-larger trials, putting us on a slippery slope to full-scale deployment.The Aria geoengineering programme is a dangerous distraction from the work that needs to be done to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. The net-zero goal is one that is enshrined in UK law, and one that the Labour government purports to uphold. The UK government should not encourage false solutions like solar geoengineering and the people of the UK should not stand for it.Aria is already evaluating proposals for its dangerous project. It is not too late to halt this juggernaut, but to do so will require vigorous pushback that starts right now.Raymond T Pierrehumbert FRS is professor of planetary physics at the University of Oxford.

Donald Trump haspaused future spendingon clean energy infrastructure and he’s cancelled decarbonisation targets. And the new European Commission hasloudly promisedto cut environmental “red tape”.If you only read the headlines, you might think we’re facing the same issue here in the UK. But overall, Labour has remained committed to its long-term climate goals.Someone close to No 10 has saidthe prime minister wants to allow a massive new North Sea fossil fuel development (but they know this would still need to pass a climate assessment). The government has invited Heathrow to apply to expand (knowing it will need to fulfil a myriad of conditions). There are reports that Labourcould move funds awayfrom carbon capture and storage (but that’s always been a speculative technology). Andthere were reportsthat GB Energy’s funding might be cut (but thatmight be nonsense, or it might just mean spending being moved around government). More concretely, it is moving fast towardssupporting a second runwayat Gatwick (knowing that planning conditions, and then long political and legal battles, could scupper the scheme).It appears that some in Labour are using good old gesture politics to roll the pitch for what they hope will be a genuine slowdown of the energy transition. But Keir Starmer andRachel Reevesthemselves appear to have a more prosaic – and reasonable – motivation: they’re waiting for their broader domestic growth strategy to bear fruit. In the meantime, these rather thin pro-fossil fuel policies give them a chance to say “look at how focused we are on increasing GDP” in front of the rightwing press and less strategically minded members of the parliamentary party.So Reeves veryconspicuously slashedthe £28bn annual green investment budget of the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, while in opposition. But at the autumn budget, rather less conspicuously, sheincreased his capital budgetmore than any other cabinet member’s.Even in the US,where things are undeniably bad, the picture is still complex. The US needs domestic energy production from any source available, and Joe Biden designed the Inflation Reduction Act, which allocates investment to clean energy security and climate change initiatives, so that Republican members of Congress wouldhave an interestin protecting some, though by no means all, of it.So there’s a lot of noise; but here’s the signal: last year, the world investedalmost twice as muchin clean energy as it did in fossil fuels. Downing Street has a long list of reasons not to buck that positive trend. First, it hasseen the numbers. Labour knows that anti-net zero feeling hasn’t contributed to its fall in the polls; but disappointment about unambitious environmental policies has.More importantly for Labour’s long-term strategy, turning away from net zero would hurt its drive for growth. Last month, Confederation of British Industry research, commissioned by theEnergy and Climate Intelligence Unit, told us that the net zero sectorgrew three times fasterthan the overall UK economy in 2024. In the same week, the Climate Change Committee dramatically revised its estimate for how much investment is necessary for the transition,cutting it by nearly halfthanks to its projection of cheaper electric vehicles and more widespread electrification in heating, transport and industry.In terms of climate strategy, this is crucial: we need it to be profitable to turn fossil fuels into stranded assets (investments that lose value before their expected end of life). And it works politically: it’s an unambiguous good news story for Reeves. She’s not going to sabotage it.Neither does the government want to turn its back on policies that are helping to shore up Labour’s union support. One well-placed union official is moderately upbeat: “Lots of the right levers have already been put in place,” they say, but more government investment will be needed, and government support must be tied to recipient businesses being better employers.And what the government really doesn’t want to do is cancel policies that will protect consumers.We’ve spent £140bnon wholesale gas in the past four years, a period that saw Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. That’sfar morethan the net cost to the UK of decarbonising over the much longer period of the next 25 years.As Ellie Mae O’Hagan of theclimate change thinktank E3Gput it to me: “The energy transition is unstoppable. The anti-net zero political pantomime we’re seeing right now doesn’t change the fundamental economics.”Of course, no one thinks the transition is yet going fast enough to prevent catastrophe. And it’snot happening equitably enoughto prevent global disorder. So whether or not the surface-level gestures continue, we need Labour to pull together and cooperate on energy policy.It has done it before. In 2008, New Labour’s climate reforms succeeded because (almost) the whole of the left was on board. It was theinnovative campaigningby progressives at Friends of the Earth – plus increasing economic nationalism in the global energy sector – that helped push opposition leader David Cameron into supporting the idea of a climate change bill in 2006. It was someone from Labour’s centrist flank – one David Miliband, then the environment secretary – who at a cabinet meeting demanded his party match the Tories’ policy and, indeed, go further than them. And two years later, it was his leftwing brother Ed Miliband who, as energy secretary, pushed throughreforms that were hailed –and attacked– as reversing Nigel Lawson’s laissez-faire restructuring of the sector in the 1980s.In December last year, the same energy secretary’s clean electricity plans were hailed – and attacked – as themost interventionist shift in energy policyin a generation. So there is every reason to believe Miliband is a politician who can get this done. But in 2025, as in 2008, geopolitics make his reforms an easier sell. And now, as then, he relies on his party’s support. Only this time, it is also doing it under cover of an anti-green pantomime.Richard Power Sayeed is a historian of modern Britain.

And you make so many friends …Wed 12 Mar 2025 13.06 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 13.20 EDTShareI’ve long had a soft spot for the achilles tendon, my own and everyone else’s. This goes back to middle school where we read a book called Greeks and Trojans by Rex Warner, which I greatly enjoyed, although my engagement with the classics went no further. It related the story of the demise of the hero whose name the tendon bears. Also, my initial and my surname have been known to autocorrect to the name of the great warrior/tendon. We have a connection.The achilles is the tendon connecting the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in the calf to an insertion point at the calcaneus. Or, in English, it’s the worryingly cable-like thing running down the back of your ankle to your heel. The Greek Achilles was fatally wounded in the heel while fighting in the Trojan war. My own (non-fatal) achilles wound was sustained a long way from the gates of Troy, at a leisure centre in Stourbridge. I did it playing pickleball. Not especially heroic, I appreciate, but for someone who’d never picked up a pickleball paddle before, I was thought to be half-decent. Given the pain I’ve been in ever since, I doubt I’ll be back for more. And with his vulnerability in the heel area, I can’t imagine pickleball would have much suited the original Achilles either.The treatment has involved me clopping around in a big boot for more than a month now. Annoying. Yet I still have a soft spot for this stricken tendon of mine. We have a lot in common. It’s generally regarded just as I regard myself: thick, strong and yet rather weak.The achilles is said to be the strongest tendon in the human body, with studies reporting an average ultimate tensile strength of up to 1,189 newtons. I don’t know what that means, but my own achilles was obviously a few newtons short of what it needed to get me through a game of pickleball. Bafflingly, just as an internet search will suggest the achilles is the strongest tendon in the body, it will also tell you it’s the weakest. This, apparently, is because though it is strong, relative to what we demand of it, with running and jumping and whatnot, it is indeed weak, or at least not quite strong enough. But it tries so hard. Heartwarming. Heartbreaking. No wonder it’s named after a mythical hero.By the way, if you have a spare minute, entertain yourself with a look at the list of body parts named after people. My top three at the time or writing are alcock’s canal, bachmann’s bundle and the circle of willis.Anyway, having been brutalised by my physio, my troubled tendon is now on the mend. He tells me that even having been successfully treated, an injured achilles, in common with key tendons in the elbow and knee, will always be tender to the touch. Once stricken, for ever a little vulnerable. Like a broken heart, God love it.I’ve learned other interesting stuff, too. Not least that “I twanged my achilles playing pickleball” is one hell of a conversation-stopper if you’re not in the mood for a chat. More importantly, it’s provided me with yet more evidence that the vast majority of people are dead nice. I haven’t wanted for a seat on public transport for weeks now. My days have featured a succession of kind looks, caring smiles and sympathetic noises. I offered one old boy my seat, which he took, until he spotted my booted right peg and was beside himself with remorse. I practically had to pin him down to stop him standing back up. My favourite was an exhausted-looking guy with a Just Eat delivery bag at his feet. He looked like he’d done a 12-hour shift. I begged him to sit back down but he didn’t speak English and was having none of it.I tell you, I’ll miss this boot.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He was totally wrong, I’m afraid. The truth is, a lot can come from nothing. More specifically: great life satisfaction can come from doing very little.You know who is well aware of that? Matt LeBlanc (AKA Joey from Friends), the king of 90s primetime TV. A TikTok featuring resurfaced interviews in which LeBlanc extols the joys of sloth is generating enormousenthusiasm online. The TikTok pulls from a 2018 interview in which LeBlanc gushed about how much he enjoyed taking time off after Friends and then cuts to a 2017 interview in which he said: “I should be a professional nothing.” Speaking to Conan O’Brien, LeBlanc explained: “Because I think I would like to do not a fucking thing. That’s what I would like to do. Just nothing. Nothing. Zero.” (Same, Matt, same.)Why is this old clip getting so much new attention? Because in a world that fetishises productivity, it seems that people appreciate someone unapologetically enjoying being lazy. Perhaps more importantly, however, at a time when it seems as if the rich and powerful never have enough, but are constantly seeking more, more, more, it’s refreshing to see someone be content with what they have. Obviously, LeBlanc has millions and is a household name, so it’s not like he is making do. Still, having gazillions doesn’t seem to stop others from trying to claw their way to more, does it?Look at tech oligarchs such as Elon Musk andMark Zuckerberg, for example. They have more money than God and instead of quietly enjoying it they are throwing funds at Donald Trump so they can try to get even more influence over our daily lives. The one good tech multimillionaire seems to be Tom Anderson, the co-founder of Myspace. After he sold the site for bags of money, he quickly retired; now, he travels the world having fun. He hasn’t tried to set up some dystopian new venture or become a politician. He’s just enjoying life.And look at the US government, which is crammed with people well past the age of retirement who refuse to cede power. US gerontocracy is so absurd that, last year, the then81-year-old Kay Granger, who had been a Republican congresswoman since 1997, was mysteriously absent from work for months. A reporter found Granger residing at a senior living facility while dealing with “dementia issues”. She could have retired decades before, but, like many of her colleagues, she seemed determined to continue working.The moral of all this? A lot of people leading the US should be more like Joey from Friends. Try to enjoy retirement, please! Just give it a go! Particularly you, Elon. Please try doing a lot, lot less.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I admired the free restaurants and leisure facilities. I sneered at the “graffiti wall”, where Facebook employees were invited to grab a felt-tip and answer the question: “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?” (Say something negative about Facebook, perhaps.) And I attended a presentation by then chief operating officerSheryl Sandberg, who was surprisingly nervous; I recall noticing how her voice shook as she addressed the smirking European hacks. Then I went to the gift shop and bought Facebook-branded hoodies for my kids.Obviously I wouldn’t put them in Facebook gear now. Over the past decade or so the evolution of Facebook (now Meta) in general and Sandberg in particular has been one of slow then fast descent from corporate brave new world to something much grimmer and more familiar. In the New York Times this week,details of a new memoirby a Facebook whistleblower, the very existence of which was kept under wraps by the publisher until a few days before, were shared and – how else to put this: bloody hell.That Zuckerberg is a men’s rights shill for Trump, running a company with a profit model reliant on hate speech and false information, is something we already know. What I hadn’t seen coming was the exposure of Sandberg for reportedly running up $13,000 in lingerie purchases and allegedly trying to persuade the author, Sarah Wynn-Williams, to join her in the only bed on the corporate jet on the way back from a work trip to Europe. The author’s response, detailed in her book Careless People: A Story of Where I Used to Work, might generously be described aslean out.Wynn-Williams worked forFacebookfor seven years, rising to the role of director of global public policy before being fired in 2018. Her revelations about Sandberg are the book’s most lurid and at the same time least consequential; for the most shocking details, see claims about Zuckerberg sucking up to China, lying to Congress and failing to stop hate speech fuelling genocide in Myanmar against the minority Rohingya ethnic group.Still, as a portrait of Sandberg it marks a strange end point to the public image of a woman once hailed, if not as a feminist hero or even as a feminist at all beyond the narrow confines of self-interest, then as a person advancing the credible cause of raising the number of women in the C-suite. Sandberg always seemed uptight and uncomfortable in her public role, a decade older than the men she worked for and not a tech person but a corporate nerd. I once overheard her describe herself during a photoshoot as a “suburban mom”, which was as nauseating as her other ploys for relatability during the my-kids-get-nits-too PR drive for her book Lean In.And yet, while Sandberg’s dive into corporate feminism was maddeningly ahistorical and apolitical, I still think it was broadly sincere. It is routine, now, to refer to her as a piece of liberal camouflage behind which Zuckerberg advanced his antidemocratic designs, but I suspect that wasn’t the plan back in 2013 when Lean In was first published. Was the book mired in bullshit? Yes. Was it part of some grand evil plan? I doubt it.Still, here we are. Sandberg, who is estimated to be worth over $2bn, left her job as COO of Meta in 2022, quit the company’s board two years later and has reportedly fallen out with Zuckerberg, who, it can be said with some confidence, failed to onboard the lessons of Lean In. According to apiece in the New York Timesin January, the CEO of Meta badmouthed Sandberg to Stephen Miller, Trump’s ghoulish adviser, for creating Facebook’s culture of inclusivity, adding to hisother complaintthat corporate culture has become too “feminine”.And now this further twist! Just when one might be tempted to side with Sandberg as the least gross of a very grim group, along comes Careless People – named for the line about Tom and Daisy, the wealthy wreckers in The Great Gatsby – and back we go to square one. The author claims to have witnessed a 26-year-old assistant sleeping in Sandberg’s lap and the pair stroking each other’s hair. And then came the demand from Sandberg for Wynn-Williams to join her in the bed on the jet. (Wynn-Williams demurred.)Zuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelledRead moreSandberg hasn’t commented on any of this publicly yet, butMetaput out a statement calling Careless People “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives”, and trashing Wynn-Williams as someone who was “fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour”, who is working for “anti-Facebook activists”.What to make of it all, beyond the fact that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely? In the book, Wynn-Williams, who was a true Facebook believer when she joined the company in 2011, came to see Sandberg’s Lean In persona as a “shtick” covering up what she really wanted from other people: obedience – something that rings true not only for Sandberg, but in the wider political and corporate culture in which we now live.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

No wonder consumer groups are dismayedWed 12 Mar 2025 13.51 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 14.14 EDTShareLobbying victories for the City do not come much more comprehensive. Last year,the Financial Conduct Authority, the industry regulator, put forwarda proposalthat it should be able to name firms under investigation more frequently.Greater openness at an earlier stage, argued the FCA, could deter bad behaviour and protect consumers. A “public interest” test on disclosure would be better than the existing “exceptional circumstances” rule that was so stifling that the FCA was silent even as British Steel pensioners, in a well-publicised scandal in 2017, were fleeced by unscrupulous financial adviserswho gave them terrible advice.But the uproar from City firms and lawyers over the FCA’s proposals was loud and persistent. They painted the plans as an offence against natural justice. Mere disclosure of an investigation could harm a company’s reputation even if it was found eventually to be innocent – and 65% of FCA’s cases, they noted, have historically resulted in no further action. The “name and shame” shorthand for the proposals stuck. The lobbyists’ trump card was the familiar one that the FCA would damage the City’s competitiveness and UK growth. Ministers, under the last Tory government and today’s Labour one,adopted the line.Thus the outcome on Tuesday of the FCA’s review of “transparency around enforcement investigations” was expected:reform is scrapped. The only surviving elements are ones nobody could possibly have regarded as objectionable, such as ending the absurdity whereby the FCA could not confirm the fact of an investigation even when the corporate subject of the inquiry had itself revealed the news in a public filing to an overseas regulator. Otherwise, it’s a full retreat by the FCA. “Given the lack of consensus,” said its chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, the regulator will stick to its old “exceptional circumstances” test.Some of the City’s criticisms were reasonable, it should be said. The FCA’s initial proposals were vague on how the “public interest” bar would be applied. While the regulator obviously wasn’t going to risk a run on a bank, there wasn’t much else to go on. And it was true that few other jurisdictions had attempted anything similar, which left the door open to the grumble about London imposing anti-competitive rules on itself.Yet one still comes back to cases such as the British Steel pension scheme. Even City opponents of the FCA’s proposal tended to concede it was a nonsense that the regulator felt it couldn’t intervene to prevent a small scandal becoming a big one. Is the FCA seriously saying it would have to do the same again in a similar case? It seems it is. Rathi confirmed that “our current interpretation” is that a British Steel-like example still wouldn’t qualify under the “exceptional circumstance” bar. The reason is that poor financial advice doesn’t count as “exceptional”.That is a depressing outcome to this consultation. Even an uncontentious, minor consumer-friendly improvement has been lost for the sake of protecting City competitiveness. No wonder consumer and whistleblowing groups are dismayed. The only token tilt in their direction is the FCA’s idea of publishing occasional thoughts on “issues” under investigation without naming names. But that reads as a formula for talking in code. It is all a very long way from the original intention to use greater transparency to “support public confidence” and “reassure consumers”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A watered-down compromise version of the transparency proposals should have been possible.

Khalil, a Palestinian and student leader at the Columbia encampments last year, was told by the arresting officers that his green card had been “revoked”, an action that only animmigrationjudge can decide. It has since been revealed that he is in Ice custody in La Salle, Louisiana, a detention sitenotorious for abuse.On Truth Social,Donald Trumpcelebratedthe apprehension of Khalil, whom he called “a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student” andbragged of more arrests to come.Khalil has not been accused, by anyone, of violating the law. Instead, his apprehension is a dangerous example of deportation as a retaliation forfirst amendment-protected speech. Simply put, Khalil was punished for protesting against US complicity in what is widely recognized as agenocidein Gaza. The Trump administration has exploited anti-Palestinian racism as a means to test its mass deportation goals:whitening the nationby eliminating immigrants and insisting that those who are here not challenge those in authority. Khalil’s arrest and detention reveals the fragility of our first amendment protections, of who does and does not have a voice in our nation.Wife of Columbia graduate student detained by Ice speaks out about his arrestRead moreAs a professor, I am troubled by the central role that academia, which in its ideal form is a bastion of free speech and critical thought, is playing in this assault on human rights. Universities and colleges have become consumed by a politics of consent, where to appeasedonorsand politicians, leadership has collaborated in the targeting of their own students, and faculty largely remain silent in the face of assaults on them.As Israel began its bombardment of Gaza in October 2023, students across the nation set up encampments on their campuses, reminiscent of the anti-apartheid movement of decades past. The Gaza protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, with like-minded students from all backgrounds sharing meals and community.View image in fullscreenProtesters demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil on Monday in New York City.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/Getty ImagesColumbia University administrators, for their part, called the the New York City police department to brutalize and arrest their students, criminalizing them. They have since sealed off the public spaces on their campus and restricted access to them, includingillegally closingthe 116th through street rather than risk any protest on the campus lawn. The brutality is ongoing: just last week, nine students from Barnard were arrested in a new escalation.Muchhas been written about the “Palestine exception” – the idea that advocating for Palestine is excluded from free speech protections. Well before 7 October 2023, peoplehad been fired, sanctioned, or retaliated againstfor their writing and speech on issues related to the occupation of Palestine by Israel. Since then, the number hasballoonedto thousands of cases as repression has intensified.In the lead-up to his arrest by Ice, Khalil reached out to Columbia twice asking for help, describing a “dehumanizing doxing campaign led by Columbia affiliates Shai Davidai and David Lederer” including a tweet by Davidai, a faculty member at Columbia, who called Khalil a “terror supporter” and tagged Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, to demand his deportation.Rubio deployed the racialized language of “terrorism” to announce that he would target international students for “visa denial or revocation, and deportation”. The announcement was applauded by Senator Tom Cotton and the House committee on foreign affairs, which tweeted fromits official account: “Terrorist sympathizers are not welcome in the United States of America. Thank you@SecRubioand@POTUSfor your leadership. Deport them all!”The campaign against Khalil, which White House officials admit is ablueprintfor targeting other students, was successful. It was later reported that Rubio himself signed the warrant for his arrest, using a little-known provision in the law that allows the secretary of state to unilaterally determine whose presence is warranted in the nation. It means that the fate of Palestinians such as Khalil is being left to those who would dox a student, to those who want to ethnically cleanse Gaza.Democratic politicians came to Khalil’s defense even as they continued to condemn the protests that he was a part of, even as they saw it fitting to use the power of the federal government to sanction students for daring to speak out. In a statement criticizing the arrest, Hakeem Jeffries still felt compelled to describe Khalil exercising his right to protest as creating “an unacceptable hostile academic environment for Jewish students”.Columbia has not issued any statement of support for Khalil or for other immigrant students. Instead, the schoolupdated its websitestating that Ice could enter campus property without a judicial warrant in the case of “risk of imminent harm to people or property”. In other words, Columbia is endorsing that deportation – the torturous and forcible removal of a person from their life – is a fitting consequence for protest. It instructed its faculty to continue operating as “usual”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionTo be sure, Columbia is not the only campus guilty of silencing pro-Palestinian voicesThe implications of this are extraordinary and alarming. It means that as the country takes an authoritarian turn, as the laws become more McCarthyist, more draconian, this university and others are choosing to align themselves with that turn, to go above and beyond to apply the “law”, even if it means greenlighting the abduction of their students.To be sure, Columbia is not the only campus guilty of silencing pro-Palestinian voices. Last year I protested outside the City College ofNew Yorkas my own students were loaded into police vans at the behest of chancellor of the City University of New York. In February, an advertisement for a Palestine studies position was removed from our hiring platform due to the intervention of the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, who deemed it to be “antisemitic” because it included the words “genocide” and “apartheid”.I am regularly in conversation with faculty who have lost their jobs, with students who have been expelled from their institutions for protest, with people across universities, across the country, who have been doxed and sanctioned and reprimanded for their voice.The tools of oppression, wielded against those students and faculty whose opinions run contrary to those who are in power, are now undermining the very foundations of this democracy. The freedom of Khalil – who is not a political symbol, but an expectant father – the freedom of everyone who raises their voice for Palestine, and the freedom of Palestinians themselves are tethered to all of our freedoms. Khalil’s safety is tied to that of every immigrant, whether on a student or an H1-B visa, or a permanent resident, or even a naturalized citizen. His freedom is tethered to everyone who cares about their right to free expression.As his case is adjudicated in the courts, which considers its legal dimensions, it is not justMahmoud Khalilwho is on trial, but the entirety of a nation teetering on the edge of authoritarianism.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS constitution and civil libertiesFreedom of speechUS immigrationUS universitiesNew YorkLaw (US)commentShareReuse this content"

There are no exceptions to the president’s global tariff onaluminium and steeland no escaping the general volatility and constant uncertainty provoked by a capricious regime. But Britain is lucky not to be a direct target.Mr Trump has no border-related grievance against the UK, as he does withMexicoandCanada. The balance of bilateral trade is neutral enough for Britain to avoid being listed among the nations that sell more to the US than they buy from it. The White House sees that asymmetry as a devious scam, for which tariffs are a form of retribution.The European Union isdespisedas an egregious offender in this regard, so, in the short term, Brexit affords the UK some shelter from Mr Trump’s ire. It would be a mistake to see that brief respite as some kind of opportunity. Mr Trump has always been a fan of Brexit because it weakened the EU and because an isolated Britain would be vulnerable to economic colonisation.A US-UK trade deal was cited by British Eurosceptics as a great prize, although they overstated the benefits much as they catastrophically underestimated the cost of leaving the European single market.A succession of pro-Brexit Conservative prime ministersfailed to seala comprehensive transatlantic trade deal. What sounded easy on the campaign trail proved trickier in confrontation with the awkward economic and political reality. The US is vast, mighty and drives ahard bargain. British consumers are wary of having their supermarket shelves stocked with American chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef. British farmers do not want to be put out of business by an influx of those products. And that is just one small element of a negotiation that would mostly amount to Washington presenting London with degrees of regulatory vassalage: American goods on American terms.Not only goods. Mr Trump takes a maximalist and wholly one-sided view of barriers to trade, seeing anything that curtails the operations of any US business in an overseas market as an offence against basic freedom. That explicitly includes anything that, in theWhite House definition, “incentivises US companies to develop or use products and technology in ways that undermine free speech”.In other words, any moves by the UK to regulate digital technology in ways that Mr Trump’s friends in the tech sector don’t like – and the Online Safety Act already falls into that category – risks incurring the president’s wrath.Sir Keir Starmer has so far navigated the caprice of the current White House administration shrewdly. He has beenwarmly receivedin Washington. But avoidance of conflict should not be confused with significant leverage.The prime minister seems to think he can restore the UK’s pre-Brexit status as a strategic bridge between Europe and the US, but Mr Trump is not in the bridging business. He sees Brussels as the capital of an economic conspiracy against American interests.In trade talks with Washington, Sir Keir will be presented with a choice between submission and enmity. He insists that there is a middle way to be navigated between Brussels and Washington, but there is a fork in the road ahead. Britain’s economic and strategic interests will point to the European path.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

No longer, it seems.Sir Keir Starmer’s government, inheriting a flatlining economy and self-imposed fiscal constraints, has chosen to balance the books on the backs of disabled people. Naturally, ministers aren’t calling it austerity. That would be so 2010s. Instead, they say these £6bn in cuts to disability benefits will help people back into employment. It’s a noble idea, except for one small problem: the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says it won’t work.The OBR’sanalysisof the original £3bn welfare cut found that, while400,000disabled people would lose nearly £5,000 a year in benefits, only about3%would actually enter employment. That’s not a welfare-to-work success story – it’s just a crude fiscal exercise dressed up as reform. But rather than rethink its approach, Labour doubled down, seeking another £3bn in savings. And where better to look than the never-implemented Toryproposalsto cut benefits from mentally ill, sick and disabled people? Among the ideas being considered are replacing personal independence payment (Pip) with vouchers,freezingbenefit rates and cutting mental health support for claimants – all in the name of “fairness to the taxpayer”.The contradictions in the government’s proposals are impossible to ignore. If disability benefits are meant to support work, how does cutting Pip – taking away funding for mobility aids that keep people working – help? The government wants2 million more peoplein work – a laudable goal – but cutting support only makes job-seeking riskier.The government assumes rising health-related claims are due to a lax welfare system or weak work incentives. But areportfor the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds that the surge closely follows rising mental health diagnoses, not a failing benefits system. This is reinforced by the worsening physical health of the working-age population, with deaths from suicide, alcohol and drugs increasing significantly since the pandemic. The UK’s post-pandemic surge in benefit claims is almost unique – most similar countries saw no such rise, suggesting domestic factors at play.The rhetoric of the welfare secretary,Liz Kendall, has attempted to reconcile these inconsistencies, but ultimately, it exposes the gap between political messaging and economic reality. The cuts are being framed as a crackdown on unfairness, but in practice, they will worsen poverty and undermine employment prospects. Instead of cutting benefits, the government could tackle the disability welfare bill by fixing NHS backlogs, investing in accessible jobs and ensuring claimants can try work without losing support. Instead, it’s spending priorities – not system abuse – that appear to be driving policy.This is austerity rebranded as reform, except without the Tory bravado. George Osborne at least called it what it was. Sir Keirechoes Conservative rhetoric, signalling an appeal to voters who view Labour as too soft on welfare. This strategy is being shaped by his chancellor Rachel Reeves’s ­self‑imposed fiscal straitjacket and the Blairite politics of his chief of staff,Morgan McSweeney. They aren’t unlocking Britain’s economic potential – just flattering themselves that they are. The reality is that the evidence says otherwise. But when the political choice is fiscal prudence or human dignity, this government appears to have made up its mind.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If the right has been guilty of undermining science and scientists, I also observed through the pandemic how the left displayed a disturbing enthusiasm to restrict liberty, using fear and guilt to encourage compliance with control measures, and many arguing to prolong the restrictions beyond the point where they were doing any good.I have experience of how the Covid control measures in theNHS, while well-intentioned, were only dismantled at a snail’s pace after the greatest danger had passed, prolonging the disruptive effect of the pandemic on the nation’s health.School closures and enforced isolation have contributed hugely to the mental health problems and social isolation faced by all, but especially the young. While the vaccines were an impressive achievement and saved many lives, in the NHS we witnessed a foolish and time-consuming attempt to coerce all staff into being vaccinated. This was abandoned at the 11th hour, but some staff had already left rather than have a vaccine they distrusted.The general overreach of the state in the pandemic has sadly led many to be less trustful of official health guidance, especially regarding vaccines. Rather than put the blame on political opponents, with accusations of fake narratives, all of society needs to undergo some honest self-reflection and try to understand the views of those who disagree with us.Dr Aodhan BreathnachConsultant medical microbiologist(and former infection control doctor), St George’s Hospital, LondonI agree with Laura Spinney that we need to do something about the negative narrative that has developed on the pandemic. Any rational person who reads the empirical evidence would surely agree that containment in the first instance, and the magic bullet of vaccination, saved us from many more deaths in the UK, even if as Spinney says, mistakes were made.I’m not sure how we go about silencing conspiracy theories on the pandemic and on vaccines in particular. Who reads the empirical evidence apart from scientists, epidemiologists and Guardian readers like myself and interprets it favourably? I wonder how we can overcome irrationality and conspiracy in society –the Great Barrington declarationthat was signed by academics being a case in point – when it has scaled even the walls of the ivory tower.Desmond HewittMarlborough, WiltshireThe populist vaccine deniers – who post onFacebook, for example – have had to go much further recently. They claim microbes don’t exist and there are no such things as viruses and bacteria. The entire medical world is therefore a scam, a vast global conspiracy for profit. Vaccines are the lethal tool created to cull populations as part of the secret new world order’s objective to subjugate humanity.To swallow this nonsense in the face of the evidence is not normal. Far-right politicians codify these delusions into pseudoscience that boils down to one thing – smash the state. We had better do something about the poison pouring out from social media – and soon.Richard BunningTiverton, DevonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Urban centres will benefit because their local representatives can carry on supporting a reasonably homogenous area. But for the Isle of Wight, the prospect of integration with Hampshire is a disaster.It’s bad enough that successive governments have been indifferent to our unique circumstances, happy to persistently underfund our schools and medical facilities, and overlook the catastrophic effect of excessively expensive ferry travel, while pouring billions into other cities’ transport. We have paid our taxes, yet it seems everyone else benefits from subsidies that we contribute to. Why should we now want to subsidise yet another decision-making machine over the water?Polly Toynbee is right. We need smaller councils, not larger ones. Local town and parish councillors are closer to voters and far more likely to raise difficult questions in a local forum to find local solutions to local problems.Yvonne WilliamsRyde, Isle of WightThe reduction in the number of councillors in the latest reorganisation is of a piece with the amalgamation of hospital trusts, the absorption of housing associations into ever larger conglomerates and, so far asLabouris concerned, the gradual elimination from council candidacy of those who might have a shadow in their past or too strong a hint of proletarian sympathies.Mayors can be more easily bought off than council leaders because they can be singled out. The extent to which this is deliberate is debatable, but I’ve little doubt it’s a pleasing side-effect of the centralising tendencies to which governments in recent years have been addicted.Robert JonesNiton Undercliff, Isle of WightHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

For a sixth time they faced their city rivals in Europe – 2025 joining 1959, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 – and for a sixth time they were defeated. Utterly, perhaps eternally defeated. The team that lost one European Cup final derby aftera 93rd-minute goaland anotheron penaltiesfell once more, and this time may even have been the worst of all, another chapter in the never-ending story.All of which may sound a bit much for a last-16 tie but the pain accumulates, each loss crueller than the last, and if the final result was oddly inevitable, how it happened was unthinkable, even for a battle between these two. If Atlético didn’t beat Real this time, they may feel they never will. Just when it seemed that fate might have shifted their way at last, it twisted the knife again. “I go in peace,” Diego Simeone said after, insisting that in their silent, lonely moments Real will reflect that over all these years no one made them suffer like his team. Perhaps they will, yet they always survive, and here they did it again.Atlético Madrid v Real Madrid: Champions League last 16, second leg – liveRead moreA goal from Conor Gallagher after 29 seconds, a missed Vinícius Júnior penalty in the second half and a superb Atlético performance in which they took 17 shots, still didn’t deliver redemption. Real just will not be beaten, somehow able to resist anything. Instead, a 1-0 Atlético win made it 2-2 on aggregate, setting up another shootout. There, Atlético lost when Marcos Llorente smashed the bar and Jan Oblak’s hand couldn’t quite keep out Antonio Rüdiger’s decisive kick. More importantly, they lost when Julián Alvarez’s penalty was ruled out by the VAR because he slipped and touched it twice.It was almost imperceptible, but it was enough: Alvarez wasn’t given the chance to kick it again and Atlético were not given closure, a story written in twisted verse. “Only God knows what is going to happen,” Simeone had said before the game, but even He didn’t expect this. They had only played 29 seconds and Real had touched the ball just once when Simeone’s team took the lead. Gallagher, Alvarez and Rodrigo De Paul combined for the Argentinian midfielder to cross and the Englishman, dashing in, to score.View image in fullscreenConor Gallagher steals in to put Atlético ahead within the first minute.Photograph: Susana Vera/ReutersAtlético had started as they wished and mostly continued as they wanted to as well, closing every avenue to Real and starting to exercise control. They created chances too, especially on the right, a catalogue of clever angled passes beyond Ferland Mendy proving the key that opened up Real. Thibaut Courtois made seven saves, the first from Alvarez, right arm outstretched. He also pushed away two at his near post to close the first half. He opened the second with another stop from Alvarez.Real were struggling to respond and, on the touchline, Ancelotti’s frustration was clear. Yet it could be felt among the home fans too; that feeling, that fear born of what they had experienced eight days before, when an impressive display at the Bernabéu stillended with a 2-1 defeat, and in so many other derbies too. As if to confirm that, from nowhere, Real got a penalty on 70 minutes, an Atlético attack breaking down and Kylian Mbappé running at them for the first time. Turning into the area he was taken down by Clément Lenglet, handing Vinícius the chance to be executioner. His penalty though went way over the bar and into the stands.View image in fullscreenJulián Alvarez slips as he takes his penalty, leading him to kick the ball against his other foot.Photograph: Juan Medina/ReutersMaybe something really was shifting. Or maybe it wasn’t; instead it was just preparing for an even more painful end, a curse of which they cannot rid themselves. Extra time certainly seemed inevitable, even as Ángel Correa tried to avoid it, his shot racing just beyond the bar in the 90th minute. This was the ninth time they have needed more than 90 minutes since 2013. Everywhere, everyone was exhausted, the tension rising, nerves torn, the threat in every little moment, triumph and disaster hanging over them but still they went for it. Rüdiger slid in to stop Correa. Alexander Sørloth headed at goal. Fede Valverde flashed wide. And then Llorente’s half-volley flew past a post.And so it went all the way to a shootout and all that hurt, Diego Simeone gathering his players in a huddle and sending them to face their fate one more time.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAtlético MadridReal Madridmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Villa manager has delivered unequivocally on his wish. The Champions League furniture – the oversized badges, the giant tifos and 3D signage – will get at least another outing this season.Aston Villa earn shot at greatness after setting up historic PSG showdown | Jonathan WilsonRead moreA couple of minutes after the final whistle the fireworks fizzing overhead spoke to a job well done. The PSG loanee Marco Asensio continued his fine goalscoring run to accelerate clear ofClub Bruggeon the night, his sixth and seventh goals for Villa bookending a routine win after the visitors were reduced to 10 men early in the first half. Asensio, a half-time arrival, opened the scoring, Ian Maatsen doubled Villa’s lead and then Asensio added another just past the hour. By that point Prince William was throwing his arms in the air in jubilation.Soon thoughts will turn to the Parc des Princes. Emery watched PSG overthrow Liverpool and, asked whether the Ligue 1 champions are the best team in Europe, he replied: “Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Inter, Borussia Dortmund … this is the level and we are on this level. We have to be proud but we want more.” Villa’s next match – a FA Cup quarter-final at Preston, passage to Wembley the reward – is further evidence this is a truly memorable season.Emery had been at pains to insist that coming into this second leg with a two-goal advantage was not cause for celebration. He referenced Brugge’s impressive 3-1 playoff win at Atalanta last month after Asensio sealed victory in Belgium by the same scoreline, and made it plain Villa had to anticipate a repeat. “The biggest mistake we can have on and off the pitch is thinking that the round was decided one week ago,” he said, wary of how these things can bite.View image in fullscreenIan Maatsen roars with delight after making it 2-0.Photograph: Darren Staples/APBrugge began promisingly but, 16 minutes in, it became clear Emery may as well have been bluffing when he said Villa were prepared for extra time and penalties. Emi Martínez, having spent a few seconds assessing the picture, nudged the ball half a yard, ready to pull the trigger. He spied Marcus Rashford’s willingness to dart behind the Brugge right-back Kyriani Sabbe and pinged a long pass downfield. The ball bounced close to the 18-yard box and the defender was in trouble, upending Rashford, who zoomed on to the ball, Simon Mignolet’s goal in his sights. Rashford curled into a heap on the turf and the referee, Daniel Siebert, looked to his assistant for help before pulling out a red card for Sabbe, who had no complaints. At least it was a short walk to the tunnel. From the subsequent free-kick, Youri Tielemans worked Mignolet after zipping a shot through a hole in the wall.Villa failed to overpower Brugge in the first half but, regardless of Emery’s warning, it was hard to envisage how things would unravel for Villa from a position of such strength. Emery’s half-time reshuffle was indicative, with Asensio and Leon Bailey replacing Boubacar Kamara and Ollie Watkins, two Villa pillars, and within five minutes the substitutes combined to kill the tie.Bailey cleverly dinked a pass into the box and Asensio, without glancing at goal, swivelled and wellied a shot into the roof of Mignolet’s net. Asensio would have grabbed his second goal earlier but hit a post after nonchalantly bringing Tielemans’s pass under his spell. Maatsen doubled Villa’s lead, firing home after good work from Morgan Rogers and Bailey, and then Asensio made it three. Rashford was the catalyst this time, latching on to Rogers’s cute pass before pulling back for Asensio to convert inside the six-yard box.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked whether the Spain forward could sign permanently, Emery said: “It depends. Of course, we are happy with him. We are protecting him because he is not 100% … he took the responsibility to do his task like we planned. He’s been fantastic for us.”Villa could withdraw Tyrone Mings and Rogers midway through the second half. Matty Cash, a reliable performer at right-back, was also given a late breather. Emery was largely unmoved until marching down the tunnel all smiles. Maybe because he expected Villa to progress. Or perhaps he was thinking about his return to Paris. Six years after league trips to Rotherham and Bolton, Villa are keeping rather different company.“The bar keeps rising,” Mings said. “The Championship feels like a long time ago. I’m really enjoying the journey.” He is not the only one.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAston VillaClub Bruggematch reportsShareReuse this content"

He started as a 7lb claimer with us and I asked him to turn pro, and he ended up winning three Grade Ones as a claimer and was leading rider [with two wins] on the first day [at ­Cheltenham two years ago].Cheltenham festival day three tips: Il Est Francais can score for FrenchRead more“It’s an absolute tragedy that he’s left us but he’s a record that he can be really proud of, he’s achieved more in a lifetime than a lot of riders who ride a lot longer ever achieve. So I’d like to dedicate this win to Michael and to his girlfriend Charlotte, who was here with the horse when we were saddling up. Our hearts go out to all of his family and friends and his girlfriend – racing is a great community and gets behind people when things like this happen.”Sean Flanagan, the winning rider on Wednesday, also paid ­tribute to O’Sullivan’s role in Marine ­Nationale’s success. “First and foremost, his family obviously have to find it very hard,” he said.“All the jockeys in Ireland, the UK and in the world have been under a cloud for the last couple of weeks. I’m only the man that steered him round today. Michael is the man who made him what he is. He will never be forgotten for that.”Connell’s and Flanagan’s words encapsulated the emotion on an afternoon when, incredibly, O’Sullivan’s double on the ­opening day of the ­festival in 2023, with Marine ­Nationale and then Jazzy Matty in the Fred Winter ­Handicap Hurdle, was replicated on the card on Wednesday when Jazzy Matty stormed home in the Grand Annual ­Handicap Chase just 40 minutes after the Champion Chase.Marine Nationale’s victory, meanwhile, came at the end of another dramatic race at this year’s ­meeting, and at the expense of another beaten odds-on favourite in Nicky ­Henderson’s Jonbon.Jonbon is among the most popular and consistent horses in training, and went into the race on Wednesday with a record of 17 wins from 20 starts. All three of his defeats, however, had come at Cheltenham, and the track got the better of him once again. He was slow to stride from a ­standing start, then took off a half‑stride too soon at the fifth-last and all but ­catapulted Nico de Boinville from the saddle as he came down on top of the fence.De Boinville tried to work his way back into contention but the damage had been done and Marine Nationale and Quilixios, the 40-1 outsider of the eight-strong field, had drawn clear as they raced towards the final fence.View image in fullscreenDanny Gilligan wins the Grand Annual Chase on Jazzy Matty.Photograph: Tom Maher/Inpho/ShutterstockFlanagan appeared to be travelling best, but Quilixios was still alongside the winner when he hit the fence and fell, gifting an easy win to Marine Nationale as Jonbon stayed on into a distant second place.It has been a tough two days for Henderson, Jonbon’s trainer, fol­lowing the fall of Constitution Hill, the favourite, in the Champion Hurdle on Tuesday, and the trainer suggested the standing start – on an afternoon when the riders seemed almost incapable of getting away first time – had put Jonbon on the back foot from the off.“He missed his kick at the start,” Henderson said, “and he was then not where he wanted to be. Nico was saying that the start was all contributory. They were right on the tape and it went straight across his face.“The next thing was, he was ­chasing them, and he likes to be up there ramming it, but there we go. However, he has flown home.”Jonbon is priced up at around 10-1 to finally end his festival hoodoo in this race next year, but Marine Nationale, who is a year younger, seems the likelier of the two to be back as a major ­contender in 12 months’ time, to ­continue his trainer’s love affair with the two-mile chasing championship.“He travels, he jumps, he has everything you’d want in a champion chaser,” Connell said.“I’ve been coming racing here since I was a ­student in the 1980s, just as a punter, and it’s the one race that I always wanted to win. It’s pure, unadulterated, on-the-edge speed. The horses finish quickly, they don’t finish tired like in the Gold Cup. It won’t sink in for a long time.”Explore more on these topicsCheltenham festival 2025Cheltenham festivalHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

In position to build on securing the constructors’ championship in 2024,McLarenwill be quick out of the blocks. The car was the standout in testing and confidence is high. Lessons were learned through questionable execution last year and they have two outstanding drivers who are both hungrily eyeing the team’s first drivers’ title since 2008. How they manage them may be key from the off.DriversLando Norris(GB, 25) No 4DebutAustralia 2019Wins4Poles9Titles0Best seasonfinish2ndLast season2nd. Once given the car to compete, eagerly took the fight to Max Verstappen last season but by his own admission was occasionally found wanting. Believes he has identified and dealt with these shortcomings, not least in a determination to face down the Dutchman. With a quick car nothing less than the title has to be the target.Oscar Piastri(Aus, 23) No 81DebutBahrain 2023Wins2Poles0Bestqualifying 2ndTitles0Best season finish4thLast season4th. Has made great strides in the previous two seasons and proved entirely unintimidated in taking control and bossing his way to wins. More will surely follow. Fearsomely quick and an incisive overtaker but to mount a title challenge he must match Norris in qualifying and get the best from his race tyres.View image in fullscreenLando Norris has a quick car this season and will be targeting the world title after a bruising 2024.Photograph: Florent Gooden/DPPI/ShutterstockFerrariCarSF-25EngineFerrariPrincipalFrédéric VasseurDebutMonaco 1950GPs1,098Titles16Last season2nd. Enjoying a resurgence as Vasseur’s impact is felt, theScuderiaare moving from strength to strength. With a calm control from the top bringing stability and purpose, plus optimism that last year’s weaknesses in the car have been eliminated, not to mention two of the best drivers on the grid, Ferrari should be genuine contenders. Anything short of regularly fighting for wins will be disappointing.DriversCharles Leclerc(Mnc, 27) No 16DebutAustralia 2018Wins8Poles26Titles0Best season finish2ndLast season3rd. Performed consistently last season and when Ferrari had the car firing, returned well with some drives highlighting his rare talent. Going up against Hamilton will be his toughest challenge but one that has inspired both drivers and as a veteran now at the team, Leclerc has every reason to believe he should be on top of any Ferrari title tilt.Lewis Hamilton(GB, age 40) No 44DebutAustralia 2007Wins105Poles104Titles7Last season7th. A new challenge at Ferrari has invigorated the seven-times champion. Motivated and charged-up, and although starting afresh with a new team will be far from easy, Hamilton is relishing the task. The SF-25 looks to suit his driving style and he will throw his all into it, which is likely to be gripping whatever the outcome.Red BullCarRB21EngineHonda RBPTPrincipalChristian HornerDebutAustralia 2005GPs393Titles6Last season3rd. A serious misstep in developing the car was costly in 2024 and testing suggests they are still to solve it, given Max Verstappen and his technical director Pierre Wache have yet to be convinced. Will doubtless be in the mix at the front but this time in a serious dogfight and without the safety net of a dominant opening.DriversMax Verstappen(Neth, 27) No 1DebutAustralia 2015Wins63Poles40Titles4Last seasonChampion. Battled hard and in typically uncompromising style to grind out his fourth championship after theRed Bullfell away mid-season in 2024. Shows no sign of any diminishing hunger but with the car still not quite where he wants it, and likely assailed by multiple rivals, may be set for the fight of his career to successfully defend the title.Liam Lawson(NZ, 23) No 30DebutNetherlands 2023Bestrace finish9thPoles0Best qualifying5thTitles0Best season finish20thLast season21st. Going head to head with Verstappen is a huge ask that has broken many but Lawson looks of stern stuff having taken over from Daniel Ricciardo at RB last year. Mentally strong and highly rated, solid returns to back the Dutchman and keep the team in the title fight will be considered a success.MercedesCarW16EngineMercedesPrincipalToto WolffDebutFrance1954GPs317Titles8Last season4th. Having struggled since the last regulation change in 2022, Mercedes are optimistic they have finally ironed out the inconsistencies that have plagued every ride since then. At times last year they had the fastest car and if they have converted that into all-round performance they will be genuine players. The cool conditions in testing may have benefited them disproportionately, however, in which case another rollercoaster may await.View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell can take the lead role at Mercedes now that Lewis Hamilton has moved on.Photograph: Eric Alonso/DPPI/ShutterstockDriversGeorge Russell(GB, 27) No 63DebutAustralia 2019Wins3Poles5Titles0Best seasonfinish4thLast season6th. Now team leader with Hamilton having moved on, Russell is more than ready to step up.

A graduate of their junior programme, Mercedes have shown enormous faith in promoting Kimi, as he is known, to replace Hamilton. A huge ask for the man who will be the third-youngest driver in F1 history when he takes to the grid in Melbourne. Inexperienced but rapid, aggressive and drives on instinct. Expect fireworks.Aston MartinCarAMR25EngineMercedesPrincipalAndy CowellDebutNetherlands 1959GPs95Titles0Best finish5thLast season5th. Adrian Newey did not arrive from Red Bull in time to have a material influence on the AMR25 so his design genius has yet to be felt and he is likely already focused on 2026. Meanwhile, Cowell, ex-Mercedes, has stepped up as principal and the new car is surely better than a lacklustre testing suggested, but their spot as best of the rest is under serious threat despite vast resources.DriversFernando Alonso(Sp, 43) No 14DebutAustralia 2001Wins32Poles22Titles2Last season9th. Likely now looking to still be in the game for 2026, when Newey, new regs and a new Honda engine might catapult Aston to the front, Alonso must prove he is still a force to be reckoned with. Has the chops, but will take luck as well as his innate flair to score a podium this season.Lance Stroll(Can, 26) No 18DebutAustralia 2017Best race finish3rdPoles1Titles0Best season finish10thLast season13th. Even given his father owns the team, Stroll needs to return better finishes with more consistency.

F1’s perennial underachievers are back for another shot at breaking free of the midfield shackles. Oakes, appointed midway through last season, has steadied the ship and made significant improvements, with the potential for so much more.

Impressed as the super-sub for Carlos Sainz at Ferrari in Jeddah last season and then later for Haas.

Carries high expectations but shows every indication of meeting them and will expect to score vital points.Racing BullsCarVCARB 02EngineRed Bull RBPTPrincipalLaurent MekiesDebutBahrain 2006GPs353Titles0Best finish6thLast season8th. Mekies, now entering his second season in charge at Red Bull’s sister team, will expect stability and to build a consistent challenge, especially after the distraction around Daniel Ricciardo last year. The car is the nicest-looking the team have fielded for some time but still appears a handful to drive which may leave them floundering in a fiercely competitive pack.DriversYuki Tsunoda(Jpn, 24) No 22DebutBahrain 2021Best race finish4thPoles0Best qualifying3rdTitles0Best season finish12thLast season12th. Disappointed not to be given a shot with Red Bull after what was his best season yet in 2024 with nine points finishes and a superlative third on the grid in treacherous conditions in Brazil.

Vowles continues the rebuilding process atWilliamswith indications his efforts are being rewarded sooner rather than later. After a battering last year the new car looks quick and stable, strong in and out of corners and made the case to lead the midfield in testing.

The last gasp before re-emerging as the Audi works team in 2026 looks set to be at very best a period of making-do.

Brought in for his experience as the team transition to Audi he too will be looking toward 2026, but with a rookie teammate must be expected to drag whatever he can from the C45 and lift the team from the back of the grid.

But after a dismal loan spell from Chelsea during which the former England forward has failed to live up to his reputation, Sterling will be relieved to have finally made a contribution as Mikel Arteta’s side eased into a quarter-final with Real Madrid.Sterling provided two assists in the first half as goals from Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice ensured Arsenal were never in danger of surrendering their record-breaking 7-1 advantage from the first leg. This timePSV Eindhovenproved more of a challenge and deserved to come away with a draw on the night thanks to equalisers from Ivan Perisic and then a sublime chip from Couhaib Driouech that denied Arteta’s side a place in the history books for the joint-biggest aggregate victory in the knockout stages.Real Madrid send rivals Atlético packing after controversial penalty shootoutRead moreAfter their failure to last the distance with Liverpool in the Premier League title race, Arsenal can now look forward to their second successiveChampions Leaguequarter‑final with genuine optimism – even if Sterling will miss the first leg after picking up a reckless late yellow card.“The way he tracked back to the corner in the last action when he got booked – that’s the kind of play that we want to see,” Arteta said of his performance. “We’ve done it consistently and now we want to make the next step, which is going to be really difficult. But we are very capable of that.”Although Arteta had insisted that Arsenal still had work to do in this tie, even he had to admit beforehand that they had one eye on events at the Metropolitano, where Atlético Madrid were playing Real. The prospect of a trip to the Spanish capital in the next round andtheir six-goal advantagefrom the first leg may have explained the number of empty seats at kick‑off, although the PSV fans at the Clock End made sure it was still a lively atmosphere. Footage of several fans taking in AFC Wimbledon’s defeat against Cheltenham in League Two on Tuesday night went viral on social media and they seemed determined not to allow the result to spoil their trip despite falling even further behind after only six minutes.Zinchenko is expected to be allowed to leave in the summer after falling down the pecking order behind Myles Lewis-Skelly as first‑choice left-back and he was entrusted with the Martin Ødegaard role, while Kieran Tierney was pushed further forward as a makeshift left-winger.The Ukrainian spent a season on loan at PSV after joining Manchester City in 2016 and refused to celebrate his first Champions League goal despite a brilliant curling finish that left Walter Benítez grasping at thin air after Sterling had turned over possession. At that stage Peter Bosz must have feared the worst. To his side’s credit, however, they refused to buckle and could even have won the game late on had it not been for an excellent David Raya save.Johan Bakayoko missed a great opportunity to equalise before the veteran former Tottenham forward Perisic – deployed as a central striker – eventually did when he was left unmarked to tuck home a pass from Guus Til. Lewis-Skelly could have been given a penalty when he was taken out by Adamo Nagano after hitting the post with a deflected shot but the referee thought otherwise.View image in fullscreenRaheem Sterling had one of his best nights in an Arsenal shirt.Photograph: Marcel van Dorst/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockArsenal’s second was all about Sterling as he rolled back the years by leaving two markers for dead before standing up a perfect cross for Rice to head home. You could almost see his confidence returning with every touch, although he could not finish off a golden chance to score just before half-time after being played clean through by Zinchenko.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Raya was at full stretch to tip Isaac Babadi’s effort around the post as PSV continued to play for pride with Joey Veerman, on as a substitute, firing over the crossbar from a good position.Riccardo Calafiori’s introduction for Rice led to Lewis-Skelly moving into midfield for the final half-hour as Arteta also rested Mikel Merino before the Premier League game against Chelsea on Sunday.Sterling is ineligible to face his parent club and will be frustrated to have blotted his copybook when he was booked in stoppage time for taking out Bakayoko after Driouech rounded off the scoring with an impudent finish that left Raya stranded.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalPSV Eindhovenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The WPLL has also brought in a three-year title sponsorship for the WSL with Barclays worth £45m.Sky is the senior partner in the deal with the BBC and is due to broadcast 118 WSL games each season, with 21 available on the terrestrial channel. It would lead any renegotiation. The deal also gives Sky the option to broadcast Championship games for the first time, with many likely to be available free on its YouTube channel.Sky, having broadcast more than 70% of live televised women’s sport in the UK last year, is unlikely to stand in the way of expansion but may demand changes to the contract. Relegation battles bring commercial value to broadcasters and advertisers, and without those there may be meaningless fixtures to televise.The prospect of pausing relegation has been criticised by fans and some high-profile figures in women’s football.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many had mistakenly been fed plastic waste by their parents and built up high levels of plastic in their stomachs.Blood tests indicated that the plastic pollution had left the chicks with severe health issues, disrupting the stomach, liver, kidneys and brain, according tothe studypublished in the journal Science Advances.“Plastic ingestion in seabirds is nothing new. We’ve known about it since the 1960s, but a lot of plastic research focuses on the birds that are really emaciated: they’re starving, they’re washing up on beaches and not doing too well. We wanted to understand the condition of birds that have consumed plastic but look visibly healthy,” said Alix de Jersey, a PhD student from the University of Tasmania’s School of Medicine, who led the study.View image in fullscreenPrevious studies have shown that shearwaters, pictured, are particularly susceptible to plastic pollution.Photograph: Denise Hardesty/AP“[In blood tests], we found patterns of the proteins that were very similar to those in people that have Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. It’s almost equivalent to a small child having Alzheimer’s. These birds are really suffering the impacts from plastic, especially on their neuronal brain health,” she said.Shearwaters are among the bird species most affected by plastic pollution.Previous studieshave found more than 400 pieces of plastic in a single shearwater chick, with plastic sometimes accounting for 5-10% of their total bodyweight.Donkeys in Kenya are dying with stomachs full of plastic – and other animals are at riskRead moreWhile chicks are able to vomit up some of the plastic before they migrate, researchers said the sheer quantity meant it was unlikely that all birds could clear it. The young birds that were examined in the study had their stomachs pumped, meaning that they were able to start their migrations to the Sea of Japan without any plastic waste inside.“It’s almost a death sentence for these chicks, which is unfortunate because they do look really fit and healthy. But knowing the condition which their body is in before they’re starting their migration, it’s quite challenging to imagine that they would make it to the other end,” said de Jersey.Previous research has found thatfewer than 60 multinationals areresponsible for more than half of the world’s plastic pollution, with six responsible for a quarter of that.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsPlasticsThe age of extinctionBirdsWildlifeMarine lifePollutionAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

This move won’t stand up in court. We’re going to fight it every step of the way.”In all, the EPA issued 31 announcements within just a few hours that take aim at almost every major environmental rule designed to protect Americans’ clean air and water, as well as a livable climate.The barrage included a move to overturn a Biden-era plan to slash pollution spewing from coal-fired power plants, which itself was a reduced version of an Obama administration initiative that was struck down by the supreme court.The EPA will also revisit pollution standards for cars and trucks, which Zeldin said had imposed a “crushing regulatory regime” upon auto companies that are now shifting towards electric vehicles, considering weakening rules limiting sooty air pollution that’s linked to an array of health problems, potentially axing requirements that power plants not befoul waterways or dump their toxic waste and considering further narrowing how it implements the Clean Water Act in general.The stunning broadside of actions against pollution rules could, if upheld by the courts, reshape Americans’ environment in ways not seen since major legislation was passed in the 1970s to end an era of smoggyskiesandburning riversthat became the norm following American industrialization.Pollutants from power plants, highways and industry cause a range of heart, lung and other health problems, with greenhouse gases among this pollution driving up the global temperature and fueling catastrophicheatwaves,floods,stormsand other impacts.“Zeldin’s EPA is dragging America back to the days before the Clean Air Act, when people were dying from pollution,” said Dominique Browning, director of the Moms Clean Air Force. “This is unacceptable. And shameful. We will oppose with all our hearts to protect our children from this cruel, monstrous action.”The EPA’s moves come shortly after its decision toshutterall its offices that deal with addressing the disproportionate burden of pollution faced by poor people and minorities in the US, amid a mass firing of agency staff. Zeldin has also instructed that $20bn in grants to help address the climate crisis be halted, citing potential fraud. Democrats have questioned whether these moves are legal.Former EPA staff have reacted with shock to the upending of the agency.“Today marks the most disastrous day in EPA history,” said Gina McCarthy, who was EPA administrator under Obama. “Rolling these rules back is not just a disgrace, it’s a threat to all of us. The agency has fully abdicated its mission to protect Americans’ health and wellbeing.”The Trump administration has promised additional environmental rollbacks in the coming weeks. The Energy Dominance Council that the president established last month is looking to eliminate a vast array of regulations in an effort to boost the fossil fuel industry, the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, told the oil and gas conference CeraWeek in Houston on Wednesday. “We will come up with the ways that we can cut red tape,” he said. “We can easily get rid of 20-30% of our regulations.”Additional reporting by Dharna NoorExplore more on these topicsUS Environmental Protection AgencyClimate crisisTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsPollutionFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

It seemed as if the tide had gone out.Overnight, Foyers, a small pumped-storage power station, had recharged itself, drawing up millions of litres of water into a reservoir high up on a hill behind it, ready for release through its turbines to boost the UK’s electricity supply. That led to the surface of Loch Ness, the largest body of freshwater in the UK, falling by 14cm in a matter of hours.Shaw, an expert in freshwater salmon who runs the Ness District Salmon Fishery Board, believes this is a warning of things to come. “I had a complaint about the level of Loch Ness dropping by a foot overnight,” he said, gesturing at the shore. “It’s actually dropped six inches over the course of the day. That wouldn’t happen naturally.”Foyers power station was built in 1974, and after a 40-year absence, pumped hydro storage is back on the agenda and with it fresh questions about who the water belongs to.hydro storage graphicPower companies are racing to meet one of the biggest challenges of the green energy revolution: how to store excess power from the large windfarms being built around the UK to provide an energy reserve to cope with peak demand and wind-free days.Developers hope to build 11 pumped hydro storage projects with the combined capacity of 10GW, equivalent to 10 large nuclear power stations, to help meet a governmenttargetto install up to 8GW of long-duration energy storage by 2030. Most of the projectsare in the Scottish Highlands, with two in north Wales. Not all will go ahead.Loch Ness has been earmarked for three of these projects – the most of any body of water in the UK. Two are of a similar size to Foyers. However, the third,at Glen Earrach on the north side of the loch, will be one of the most powerful envisaged, offering up to 30GWh of electricity.Building the power station will cost about £3bn, but its backers argue that the 2GW plant has a great advantage over local competitors: it makes the best use of gravity.Glen Earrach’s storage reservoir is Loch nam Breac Dearga, tucked under a rocky mountain nearly 500 metres above sea level, flanked by banks of snow and iced-over peat bog. Because it is close to Loch Ness and high up, they say its “head height” – the distance its water has to travel to reach the turbines – makes it one of the most efficient on offer.Roderick MacLeod, whose family owns the estate where the project would be built, said: “For the same amount of water, for the same size of tunnels, for the same size of machines, you are getting three times more power, three times more energy stored and so you’re getting three times the consumer benefit. That’s the key selling point.”View image in fullscreenGlen Earrach Energy is proposing to construct a pumped storage hydro site on the north-west side of Loch Ness.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianGlen Earrach’s proposals have fuelled anxiety locally. It is the third such plan proposed for Loch Ness but also the largest by far.More than a dozen agencies, conservation bodies and local businesses have lodged objections or raised questions about Glen Earrach with the Scottish government’s energy consents unit, which oversees power station applications.Its critics fear that if all four plants are approved, that could significantly affect the loch’s delicate ecology, its migrating salmon and trout, its leisure cruising firms and its archaeological sites, including a prehistoric crannog, or human-made island.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

If all that water was suddenly discharged, it would upset the loch’s delicate hydrology and water temperatures, affecting juvenile salmon.Map of operational and planned hydropower sites in the UKThe invertebrate charity Buglife said Glen Earrach alone could lower the loch’s surface by nearly half a metre when it recharged its upper loch. It raises concerns about the risks to insects such as the northern damselfly, the brilliant emerald dragonfly and a species of cranefly.Glen EarrachEnergyis in a fiercely fought contest to persuade Ofgem, the energy regulator, to award it the electricity supply agreement it needs to raise the billions of pounds to build the plant. Ofgem’s evaluation process starts this spring. Meanwhile, Glen Earrach has been lobbying Labour ministers, MPs and policymakers, urging them to study its numbers.MacLeod said the firm would soon publish a detailed environmental impact assessment to answer ecological concerns and has funded a joint survey with Shaw’s fisheries board to investigate environmental threats to Loch Ness’s juvenile salmon.MacLeod said the loch was naturally recharged by its surrounding rivers, making any reductions in its surface level short-lived. Shaw, meanwhile, acknowledged that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency set legal limits on pumped-storage schemes that prevented firms drawing water when levels were too low.In an attempt to prove how seriously it takes its social obligations, Glen Earrach Energy is offering to make community benefit payments of up to £25m a year, the largest ever proposed by a power company.“The landscape is kind of everybody’s,” MacLeod said. “I think it’s only right that it should provide a return to the community, because it has an impact on the community and in this particular context, that’s got to do with water. We’re essentially paying for water use, as a rent on the water we use.”Explore more on these topicsHydropowerScotlandWaterFishWildlifeRenewable energyEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The report analysed the 100 most populous cities, plus 12 selected ones, and found that 95% of them showed a distinct trend towards wetter or drier weather.MapThe changing climate of cities can hit citizens with worsened floods and droughts, destroy access to clean water, sanitation and food, displace communities and spread disease. Cities where the water infrastructure is already poor, such as Karachi and Khartoum, suffer the most.Cities across the world are affected but the data shows some regional trends, with drying hitting Europe, the already-parched Arabian peninsula and much of the US, while cities in south and south-east Asia are experiencing bigger downpours.The analysis illustrates the climate chaos being brought to urban areas by human-caused global heating. Too little or too much water is the cause of 90% of climate disasters.More than 4.4 billion people live in cities and the climate crisis was already known to be supercharging individual extreme weather disasters across the planet.ChartRising temperatures, driven by fossil fuel pollution, can exacerbate both floods and droughts because warmer air can take up more water vapour. This means the air can suck more water from the ground during hot, dry periods but also release more intense downpours when the rains come.“Our study shows that climate change is dramatically different around the world,” said Prof Katerina Michaelides, at the University of Bristol, UK. Her co-author, Prof Michael Singer at Cardiff University, described the pattern as “global weirding”.“Most places we looked at are changing in some way, but in ways that are not always predictable,” Singer said. “And given that we’re looking at the world’s largest cities, there are really significant numbers of people involved.”Coping with climate whiplash and flips in cities is extremely hard, said Michaelides. Many cities already face water supply, sewage and flood protection problems as their populations rapidly swell. But global heating supercharges this, with the often ageing infrastructure in rich nations designed for a climate that no longer exists, and more climate extremes making the establishment of much-needed infrastructure even harder in low income nations.ChartThe researchers have worked in Nairobi, Kenya, one of the cities suffering climate whiplash. “People were struggling with no water, failed crops, dead livestock, with drought really impacting their livelihoods and lives for multiple years,” Michaelides said. “Then the next thing that happens is too much rain, and everything’s flooded, they lose more livestock, the city infrastructure gets overwhelmed, water gets contaminated, and then people get sick.”View image in fullscreenRains in Collado Villalba, near Madrid, one of the cities whose climate has flipped.Photograph: Europa Press News/Europa Press/Getty ImagesSol Oyuela, executive director at NGO WaterAid, which commissioned the analysis, said: “The threat of a global ‘day zero’ looms large – what happens when the 4 billion people already facing water scarcity reach that breaking point, and the food, health, energy, nature, economies, and security that depend on water are pushed to the brink?”“Now is the time for urgent collective action, so communities can recover from disasters and be ready for whatever the future holds. This will make the world a safer place for all,” Oyuela said.Thesavage wildfires in Los Angelesin January were an example of a single whiplash event, with a wet period spurring vegetation growth, which then fuelled the fires when hot and dry weather followed. Such events areincreasingdue to human-caused global heating.View image in fullscreenWildfire in Castaic Lake area, California, on 22 January this year.Photograph: Amy Katz/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockThenew analysis by Michaelides and Singerwas much broader and examined the changes in wet and dry extremes over the past four decades in 112 major cities.It found that 17 cities across the globe have been hit by climate whiplash, suffering more frequent extremes of both wet and dry conditions. The biggest whiplashes were seen in Hangzhou in China, the Indonesian megacity of Jakarta, and Dallas in Texas. Other whiplash cities include Baghdad, Bangkok, Melbourne and Nairobi.The rapid shift between wet and dry extremes makes it difficult for cities to prepare and recover, damaging lives and livelihoods.The analysis also found that 24 cities have seen dramatic climate flips this century. The sharpest switches from wet to dry conditions have been in Cairo, Madrid and Riyadh, with Hong Kong and San Jose in California also in the top 10. Prolonged droughts can lead to water shortages, disrupted food supplies and electricity blackouts where hydropower is relied upon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Other cities with wet flips were Bogotá, Hong Kong and Tehran. Intense rains can cause flash floods, destroying homes and roads and spreading deadly waterborne diseases like cholera and dysentery when sanitation systems are overwhelmed.The researchers also assessed the level of social vulnerability and quality of infrastructure in the cities. The cities with the biggest increases in climate hazards combined with the highest vulnerability – and therefore the places facing the greatest dangers – were Khartoum in Sudan, Faisalabad in Pakistan, and Amman in Jordan.Karachi, also in Pakistan, ranked highly for vulnerability as well and is experiencing more wet extremes. Torrential rains in 2022 destroyed the family home of fisher Mohammad Yunis in Ibrahim Hyderi, a waterfront district in the city.View image in fullscreenTorrential rains destroyed Mohammad Yunis’s family home in 2022.Photograph: Khaula Jamil/WaterAid“We have spent many days and nights completely drenched in rain because we had no shelter,” he said. “The weather affects everything. When it rains heavily, our children fall sick. But we don’t have sufficient [clean] water. Our localities are breaking down. Houses near the drainage systems collapse due to floods. When floods come, walls fall apart. If we had enough money, we would not be living here.”Even in the cities where the changes in climate were less stark, clear trends were seen in almost all of them. The places getting drier over the last 40 years included Paris, Los Angeles, Cape Town, and Rio de Janeiro. Many of those getting wetter are in south Asia, such as Mumbai, Lahore and Kabul.The researchers also found 11 cities where the number of extreme wet or dry months had fallen in the last 20 years, including Nagoya in Japan, Lusaka in Zambia, and Guangzhou in China.The overall results of the new study are consistent with the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found there were both regions with increases in heavy rains and others with increases in drought, as well as some regions with increases in both, said Prof Sonia Seneviratne, at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, coordinating lead author of the IPCC chapter onweather and climate extreme events.“A few tenths of a degree warmer and the life we know becomes increasingly at risk due to climate extremes such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall,” she said.Singer said: “We hope our report can galvanise global attention on the challenges of climate change with respect to water. Perhaps it will lead to a more realistic conversation about supporting adaptation to climate change, with a sense of compassion and understanding of the challenges people are facing, rather than just saying, well, we can’t afford it.”MethodologyThe researchers analysed the changing climate of cities using a standard index (SPEI) that combined precipitation with evaporation each month from 1983 to 2023. Index values above a widely-used threshold were categorised as extreme.To assess changes over the four decades, the data was split into two 21-year periods. The cities that experienced at least 12 months more of one type of extreme climate (wet or dry) and at least 12 months less of the other type of extreme climate in the second 21-year period were classed as having a climate flip. The cities that had at least fivemonths more of both extreme wet and extreme dry in the second period were classed as having developed climate whiplash. The overall wetting or drying trends were determined from all 42 years of data.The population data used to determine the 100 most populous cities was based on population density, not the administrative boundaries of the city, and therefore are a truer reflection of the city’s size. Social vulnerability was measured using the standard Human Development Index and the water and waste infrastructure data was taken from aglobal dataset published in 2022.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisExtreme weatherNatural disastersDroughtFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “This move is within their rights as a sovereign nation, but we do not see it as a proportionate response to what UK authorities conveyed to us, which was their observation that a relatively small number of Trinidad and Tobago nationals were misusing the UK immigration system by being processed for an ETA in the normal existing process and then suddenly applying for asylum after arrival.”He added: “We have indicated our disappointment with the new visa requirement and will continue our consistent engagement with our UK counterparts. We are not of the view that regular travellers to the UK should be negatively affected by a relatively small number of persons who have been trying to abuse the British immigration system.”A statement from the British high commission in Trinidad and Tobago confirmed that the changes would come into effect immediately, though there would be a six-week transition period lasting until 23 April “during which time visitors who booked their travel and obtained an ETA before the changes can still enter the UK without a visa”.The statement said that the relationship between Trinidad and Tobago remained a “strong and friendly one”.The British high commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago, Jon Dean, said: “The changes announced today align Trinidad and Tobago with many other visa national countries with which the UK shares close and friendly ties. We understand that travel is important for families, businesses and cultural connections. The introduction of visitor visas is designed to support safe and secure travel while ensuring the UK’s borders remain protected.“The British high commission in Port of Spain has worked closely with the UK government to put in place arrangements that allow Trinidad and Tobago nationals to apply for their visitor visas right here at home. We remain committed to welcoming visitors and look forward to continuing the strong ties between our people. As a valued Commonwealth partner, Trinidad and Tobago remains an important part of the UK’s global community.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Stena Immaculate was anchored while waiting for space at a port in the Humber after travelling from the Peloponnese region of Greece.The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said on Wednesday that fires onboard the Solong had “greatly reduced” and that it was being held in a safe position off the coast of Yorkshire, having broken free of the Stena Immaculate on Monday night.Coastguard officials had hoped to board the Stena Immaculate to carry out an initial damage assessment on Wednesday before salvors could begin a full review of the wreckage.The Solong was sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands at a speed of about 16 knots, equivalent to 18mph, when it collided with the tanker.Both vessels caught fire after several explosions. Thirty-six crew were rescued, including Americans from the Stena Immaculate and the Russian and Filipino nationals that made up the Solong’s crew.Investigators said nothing was being ruled out, but added there was nothing at this point to suggest there was Russian state involvement in the incident.1:25Footage shows oil tanker and cargo vessel on fire in North Sea – video reportIt was initially feared the Solong, a container ship with a Portuguese flag, was carrying the highly toxic chemical sodium cyanide but its owner, the Hamburg-based maritime firm Ernst Russ, said four containers that had previously held the substance were empty.Air quality sampling carried out onshore had shown no toxins and modelling from the Met Office indicated no threat to the public, HM Coastguard said.Though the Solong drifted at least 2 miles south of the collision, it Solong is no longer expected to sink and is anchored with support from a tugboat. The Stena Immaculate is also being held in place by tugboats.Some of the jet fuel that was on the tanker, equivalent to 220,000 barrels in total, will have burned in what was described as a “massive fireball” but it remains likely some has spilled into the sea, causing possible environmental damage.On Wednesday evening Crowley, the maritime company managing the Stena Immaculate, said the fire on the oil tanker had gone out. There were “no visible signs of smoke or flame”, it said.The assistant chief coastguard, John Craig, said earlier: “A comprehensive counter-pollution response is in place and HM Coastguard continues to make preparations for any pollution that may occur as a result of the damage to the vessels.“We continue to engage actively with Humberside police, salvors, the port authorities and other agencies to protect the public and the environment as far as possible while continuing to respond to the developing situation.”Aerial surveillance flights did not identify any pollution on the surface of the water, the coastguard said on Wednesday evening.While it will take the Marine Accident Investigation Branch some time to fully investigate the causes of the crash, Humberside police launched a parallel investigation into the mariner’s suspected death.1:34Drone footage shows cargo ship and oil tanker after North Sea collision – videoOn Tuesday Ernst Russ confirmed to the Guardian that the ship’s master had been detained by Humberside police, adding: “The master and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations. Out of respect for the investigation and all involved we will not comment further at this time.”The senior investigating officer, DCS Craig Nicholson, said on Tuesday: “Extensive work has already been carried out, and we are working closely with our partners to understand what happened, and to provide support to all of those affected.“The man arrested remains in custody at this time whilst inquiries are under way, and we continue speaking with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The institute has criticised budget rules that limit the scope for extra taxes and borrowing.The report found about half of the stagnation in real wages could be attributed to weak productivity growth, while tax and benefit changes accelerated the decline, stripping many families of financial support and hitting average living standards.A lack of productivity growth was to blame for much of the fall in living standards after the 2008 financial crisis.While other industrialised nations have suffered a fall in productivity, the UK has been among the hardest hit. The average UK worker is about 20% less productive than their French and German counterparts and 30% less productive than US workers, it said.The institute said it estimated that achieving the same rise in productivity as the US would make UK workers “more than £4,000 better off today”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Currently, not even Apple can access data and documents protected by its advanced data protection (ADP) programme.ADP allows users with iCloud accounts and storage to secure photos, notes, voice memos and other data with end-to-end encryption, meaning only the user can access it. Messaging services such as iMessage and FaceTime would remain end-to-end encrypted by default.Apple said the removal of the tool would make users more vulnerable to data breaches from bad actors and other threats to customer privacy. Creating a “back door” would also mean all data was accessible by Apple, which it could be forced to share with law enforcement possessing a warrant.Last week, Computer Weekly reported that Apple was intending to appeal against the secret order.The tribunal has taken the unusual step of publishing a notification of a closed-door hearing before its president, Lord Rabinder Singh, on the afternoon of 14 March.The tribunal listing does not mention either Apple or the government, nor has the tribunal confirmed if they are the parties involved.The hearing is due to be held in private because it relates to the security services, but a media campaign led by Computer Weekly argued that the hearing should be held in open court since the case is a matter of public interest and the appeal has already been leaked.Representatives from news organisations including the Guardian, as well as some civil society groups, are supporting Computer Weekly in its petition.In a statement issued in February, Apple said it was “gravely disappointed” it was forced to take the decisionto stop offering advanced data protectionin the UK, “given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy”.A spokesperson said: “Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever before. Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.“As we have saidmany times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.”Apple and the Home Office both declined to comment on Friday’s hearing.

Some executives have suggested scrapping the stand-alone cash Isa and having a single account for both cash and equities.Tax-free Isas were introduced in 1999 and the main two types are the cash Isa and the stocks and shares Isa. More than 18 million people have a cash Isa, and there is almost £300bn sitting in them. The move to delay any reform was first reported by the Financial Times.Last month, Reeves said: “We want to get that balance right.

Last month, the Building Societies Association called on the government to “save” cash Isas, saying it would continue to press the chancellor “to listen to all sides of the cash Isa argument, not just to the loud voices of a group of self-interested big businesses”.Britain’s biggest building society, Nationwide, hassaidthe accounts “not only help ordinary people save efficiently but enable us to fund our first-time buyer lending”.Meanwhile, Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, who opposes reducing the cash Isa limit,recently told a committee of MPsthat people had told him “they are worried about what’s going on” amid the uncertainty over the future of cash Isas.Explore more on these topicsIsasSavingsBudgetBanks and building societiesInvestment IsasInvestmentsInvestment fundsnewsShareReuse this content"

Barclays declared to theFinancial Conduct Authority(FCA) in a letter in 2019 that the two men “did not have a close relationship”.The FCA’s lawyer Leigh-Ann Mulcahy KC handed documents to Staley and tribunal judges without presenting them to the public, before asking Staley: “Do you accept that you had sexual intercourse with a woman at Mr Epstein’s brother’s apartment?”“Yes,” Staley said. The former CEO, who is married and has two daughters, acknowledged he met the woman through Epstein, but while he told the court “she was part of his staff”, he claimed Epstein did not know they had sex.“How did it come about that you had sexual intercourse with a woman who worked for him at an apartment, owned by his brother, without him knowing?” Mulcahy asked.Staley said: “Oftentimes I would go to Epstein’s apartment and he would be late, and she and I got the chance to know each other.” This led to sexual intercourse, he said, “much to my embarrassment today”.The ex-banker agreed with Mulcahy that he would describe the intercourse as “consensual”. The date of the encounter and the age of the woman were not disclosed in court. The FCA stated that the property was owned by Epstein’s brother.Mulcahy also put to Staley that the staff member “appeared to have carved you out of a settlement with the Epstein estate”. Staley replied he was “not aware of that”.The ex-Barclays boss also maintained that he did not remember the context for a separate, and now notorious, exchange with Epstein in 2010 referring to Disney princesses.The set of emails, the FCA said, included Staley saying: “Maybe they’re tracking you,” later followed by another email to Epstein, saying: “That was fun. Say hi to Snow White.” “What character would you like next?” Epstein asked, to which Staley replied: “Beauty and the Beast.” Epstein responded: “Well one side is availble [sic].”Mulcahy noted that Staley had failed to provide any explanation for the emails in two interviews by the FCA, as well as a US deposition. “You’ve had a lot of time to consider this email … are you able now to explain?”“No,” Staley said.It rounded off a combative day of at the tribunal, which marked Staley’s third day in the witness box. It involved discussions about how Epstein supported Staley’s daughter’s academic career, as well as how the late financier described Staley as “like family” to high-profile contacts, includingPrince Andrew.One message, sent by Epstein to Prince Andrew in May 2010, said: “I know you are seeingJes Staleythis morning, he is like family and can be trusted 100%.” Andrew has faced fierce criticism over his ties to Epstein, who died in August 2019 while awaiting trial over charges on trafficking underage girls for sex.Mulcahy put to Staley that it was unrealistic that Epstein “would tell multiple people that you were a close friend and like a brother if you weren’t that close”. However, Staley denied this, saying that he believed Epstein “would willingly mislead and lie about our relationship”.Weeks later, in June 2010, Staley emailed Epstein to say: “Andrew just sat next to me at dinner. Any word on M? This is fun.” Staley speculated in the hearing that this was likely another reference to the prince, and that “M” likely referred to the former business secretary Lord Mandelson.Staley went on to ask Epstein that same day: “Is she free tonight?” Staley told the court he did not remember who “she” might be.Mulcahy said Staley’s “lack of recollection seems surprising”.Staley appeared angry and agitated as attention turned to Epstein’s relationship with Staley’s daughter, particularly after the FCA showed emails suggesting the financier had been “pulling strings” to support her through her academic career and PhD.Staley twice asked the judge for a break – though retracted the first of those requests – and said that the FCA’s line of questioning was “completely unnecessary”, adding that his daughter “accomplished what she did … on the back of her own skill”.Mulcahy said: “You’re the one that said your relationship was professional and based on the assistance to your daughter … I need to explore it to get to the connection of you and Mr Epstein.”The former Barclays boss will continue giving evidence until the end of the hearing, which is scheduled to last until Friday.Explore more on these topicsJes StaleyPrince AndrewJeffrey EpsteinBankingBarclaysFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was found guilty of the more serious charge on Wednesday.Witnesses described Kondor’s legs dragging on the ground as he clung to the inside of the open door, with one woman saying she heard him shouting: “Help.”John Harrison KC, for the prosecution, told jurors: “After speeding and swerving failed to get rid of Mr Kondor, the defendant deliberately drove into a collision with two parked cars.”He said Ross “deliberately” turned the steering wheel of the van towards a black car parked on the side of the road, and when that did not knock Kondor from the van, he “tried again”.“The second collision was with a blue car, which caused damage to the van, to the parked car and most significantly, caused fatal head and chest injuries to Mr Kondor,” Harrison said.The court heard that after driving away, Ross met up with some other people and the contents of the van were removed.Harrison said Ross showed a “complete disregard and even contempt” for Kondor’s life.He said the “career criminal” must have realised Kondor, who was wearing a hi-vis jacket, was there, but made the choice that the driver was “expendable”.Ross told the court he had been a daily cannabis user since he was a child and had been out buying drugs and cigarette papers when he came across the van with no driver.He said: “It wasn’t till I got the van I saw it was unattended, and keys were in it, and the engine was running … I basically jumped in it and drove it off.”Ross said he later found out about Kondor’s death through the internet and that he would have “stopped the van and run off if I had known he was there”. He is due to be sentenced on Friday.Kondor, who lived in Sheffield, was employed by a company called SP Transport Group, which described him after his death as “more than just a colleague – he was a friend, a confidant and a valued member of our team”. His family listened to the verdict via a video link to court.Explore more on these topicsLeedsCrimeEnglandWest YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Forecasters expect wintry showers that may cause ice to develop, potentially causing some transport disruption.The clerk of the Cheltenham course, Jon Pullin, told ITV Racing on Wednesday: “It was very precautionary last night, as we were forecast a slight frost.“It did dip down briefly to a minus two temperature, so we took some precautions on the take-offs and landings, just to make sure we’d be comfortable this morning.”Temperatures were expected to rise to 7C by the time racing began, but overnight chills are expected to continue for the rest of the festival.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The party has never before secured so many seats – it won 10 seats, an increase of seven on the last election and three more than its previous record of seven in 2005 – and was not considered one of the key players, with most attention on IA, Naleraq and Siumut, IA’s coalition partner.While the Democrats have been involved in several coalitions, they have never led a government, as they are expected to after coalition talks.There are a total of 31 seats in the Greenlandic parliament, with 16 seats needed for a majority.IA lost almost half its seats – going from 12 to seven – making it the third-biggest party. With no party having won a majority of the 31 seats, leaders will next head into coalition talks to negotiate the formation of the next government.The Democrats describe themselves as being “social liberal” and have called for independence but in the longer term. Nielsen said: “We didn’t expect the election to have this outcome. We’re very happy.”The 33-year-old former badminton champion said: “The Democrats are open to talks with all parties and are seeking unity. Especially with what is going on in the world.”With 90% of the vote counted, the Democrats held a 29.9% share of the vote, an insurmountable lead, according to Greenland’s public broadcaster KNR. Naleraq’s share of the vote stood at 24.5%.View image in fullscreenThe Naleraq leader, Pele Broberg, left, celebrates with the Demokraatit leader, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, in Nuuk, Greenland.Photograph: Mads Claus Rasmussen/EPAThe Naleraq leader, Pele Broberg, said the election day would be remembered and congratulated Nielsen. He thanked voters and said: “We will work with the people of the country to honour the power they have given us. Without exception, thank you all for the day.”Egede, who on Tuesday said it had been a campaign “burdened by geopolitical tensions”, said: “We respect the election. I’m so glad so many people came out to vote.” The party took a 21.4% vote share.The leader of the Siumut party, IA’s coalition partner, conceded defeat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The longstanding movement has gained significant traction in recent years after a series of scandals highlighting Denmark’s racist treatment of Greenlanders – including theIUD scandal, in which up to 4,500 women and girls were allegedly fitted with the contraceptive device without their knowledge, and“parenting competency”tests that have separated many Inuit children from their parents.Amid worldwide attention largely spurred by Trump, who last week told Congress he would acquire Greenland“one way or the other”and has promised to make Greenlanders rich, turnout in Tuesday’s election was higher than usual, election officials said.The election was also watched closely in Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy. Greenland, along with the Faroe Islands, is part of the kingdom of Denmark.The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Tuesday had been “a joyful day and a celebration of democracy”. She added: “I would like to congratulate Demokraatit on a very good election. The Danish government will await the results of the negotiations that will now take place in Greenland. But we look forward to working with Greenland’s future Naalakkersuisut [the Greenlandic government].”View image in fullscreenThe Naleraq party candidate, Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam (centre), at an election party in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APKuno Fencker, a member of parliament for Naleraq, which increased its seats from four to eight, said the party immediately got to work with a four-hour meeting after a jubilant victory event in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital.This election was a “gamechanger” for Greenlandic politics, Fencker said. “Before, people voted mostly Siumut – it was like a football club that they never left. But people have had enough and voted very differently this time,” he said.Despite all the international attention, Fencker said the election was won on domestic issues such as business, fisheries, pensions, people’s livelihoods and healthcare.He hopes that Naleraq will be able to form a coalition with the Democrats as the ruling party, as both parties want reforms on business, fisheries, tax and pensions, and Fencker believes they could agree on a path to Greenland becoming a sovereign country.Fencker, who travelled to Washington DC for Trump’s election and has been described as “Greenland’s most pro-Trump politician”, said that although relations between Greenland and Denmark had been improving under Frederiksen, he wishes she would mirror some of Trump’s most recent rhetoric on Greenland, but that he is strongly opposed to any form of US ownership.Is Greenland’s upcoming election its most significant yet?Read moreHe said: “I just hope that Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, would say the same thing as Donald Trump: that she respects our right to becoming a state and if we want to join Denmark we are absolutely open to join Denmark after sovereignty of Greenland, and that Denmark wants to invest a lot of billions of kroner in Greenland.”Fencker said the “optimal” solution for Greenland, in terms of independence, would either be a free association agreement with Denmark or a new agreement within the Danish commonwealth.Nielsen, however, said they must not get ahead of themselves. “We must have a calm course in relation to the USA. In relation to state formation, we must first build the foundation. We must not build the house from the chimney down,” he told KNR.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpDenmarkEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

We will hold the security area in Hermon and make sure that all the security zone in southern Syria is demilitarised and clear of weapons and threats,” Israel Katz said on a visit to the peak on Wednesday.After the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December, Israeli forcesmoved to control a 400 sq km demilitarised buffer zone in Syrian territory. The zone, which lies between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, was created by the UN after the 1973 Yom Kippur war, or Ramadan war as it is known in Arabic. A UN force of about 1,100 troops has patrolled the area since then.Assad was ousted by a coalition of rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has its origins in extremist Islamist organisations including both al-Qaida and the Islamic State.The new president of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, says he severed ties with extremist groups years ago and has promised a representative government and religious tolerance.However Israel officials believe the new Syrian regime and other armed groups active in the country remain a potential threat.Katz said the deployment on Mount Hermon was necessary to defend Israeli communities in northern Israel and on its contested borders.“Every morning when [al-Sharaa] opens his eyes at the presidential palace in Damascus, he will see the IDF watching him from the peak of the Hermon, and remember that we are here and in the entire security area of southern Syria, to protect the Golan and Galilee residents against any of his threats and those of his jihadist friends,” Katz told reporters who accompanied him, according tothe Times of Israel.Israel also wants to disruptIran’s ability to smuggle weaponsthrough Syria to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.Fear and uncertainty in Golan Heights as Israeli troops drive deeper into SyriaRead moreThe Israeli incursion into Syria in December sparked widespread international condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of exploiting the fall of the Assad regime for a land grab. Israel still controls the Golan Heights that it captured from Syria during the six-day war (1967) and later annexed – a move not recognised by most of the international community.The Times of Israel reported that the Israel Defence Force (IDF) has established nine military posts inside Syrian territory, including two on the 2,800m summit of Mount Hermon. Some are in newly fortified former Syrian army positions.In a speech last month, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he wanted“the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria”.Israeli warplanes have launched hundreds of strikes since the fall of Assad to destroy military equipment left by the former regime, and officials have described an extensive new zone stretching across much of southwestern Syria as territory that Israel will ensure is “demilitarised”. A new wave of attacks struck targets in southern Syria earlier this week.Israel had also offered protection to Syria’s Druze minority, many of whom live close to Israel’s borders. There is also a substantial Druze population within Israel.Some analysts have warned that Israel risks becoming mired in a complex conflict in Syria, possibly one recalling the country’s costly, long-term occupation of southern Lebanon from 1982 to 2000.Col (ret) Dr Jacques Neriah, an Israeli analyst, said: “I hope that we don’t have in mind an idea like we had in Lebanon. We were drowning in the Lebanese swamp for more than 20 years. Let’s hope we won’t be drowning in the Syrian swamp ... We said our intentions were only temporary and now we hear [something] different.”Al-Sharaa has repeatedly said he will not allow Syria to be used as a base for attacks on Israel.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said on Wednesday that a least 1,383 civilians had been killed in “executions by security forces and allied groups” after violence broke out last week in the coastal heartland of the Alawite minority, to which toppled president Bashar al-Assad belongs.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The skulls are attributed to Homo erectus, the first early human species to have left the African continent.Until now, the earliest human remnants in western Europe were 1.1m- to 1.2m-year-old pieces ofjawbone and teethfrom Sima del Elefante.Younger human remains, dating to 800,000 years ago, were unearthed at the nearby Gran Dolina (Giant Sinkhole) cavern. Particular features of the latter led researchers to consider them a distinct species, namely Homo antecessor, or pioneer man.Writing in the journalNature, the Spanish team say the latest remains are more primitive than Homo antecessor but resemble Homo erectus. Given the uncertainty over the fossil’s identity, the team has designated the species Homo affinis erectus, reflecting its close relationship with the older human.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How Homo sapiens became the last human species leftRead moreThe Latin name is not the only one used for the remains, however. Informally, the researchers nicknamed the fossil “Pink” after Pink Floyd, whose album The Dark Side of the Moon translates to “La cara oculta de la luna”, where “cara oculta” means “hidden face”.Dr María Martinón-Torres, the director of the National Centre for Research on HumanEvolutionin Burgos, said among its distinctive characteristics, Pink had a flatter nasal structure than Homo antecessor, which shares the more modern-looking face and prominent nasal bones of Homo sapiens.Chris Stringer, a research leader on human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, said the fossil was “a very important find”. In 2023, Stringer and others identified aperiod of extreme coolingabout 1.1m years ago that may have driven early humans out of western Europe, possibly explaining the different population found at Sima del Elefante afterwards.Excavations at Sima del Elefante paint a picture of lush meadows and woodlands more than 1.1m years ago with oaks, pines, juniper and hazel trees in abundance. Rivers cutting through the landscape drew water voles and mice, hippos, bison and deer. Quartz and flint tools have also been recovered alongside animal bones bearing cut marks from butchering.More insight into the Sima del Elefante lifestyle is apparent from a groove that runs across the partial crown of a tooth in the Pink fossil, believed to be a wear mark from using a rudimentary toothpick.“This is another step towards understanding the first Europeans,” said Dr José María Bermúdez de Castro, the co-director of the Atapuerca Project. “We now know that this first species had an appearance reminiscent of the specimens included by many in Homo erectus. However, the remains from the Sima del Elefante site have a very particular combination of features. More fossils should be found in other contemporary sites to reach a more robust conclusion about the identity of this species.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyEvolutionSpainFossilsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Tagging along were four suitcase-size satellites to study the sun. Spherex popped off the rocket’s upper stage first, drifting into the blackness of space with a blue Earth in the background.The $488m Spherex mission aims to explain how galaxies formed and evolved over billions of years and how the universe expanded so fast in its first moments.Closer to home in our own Milky Way galaxy, Spherex will hunt for water and other ingredients of life in the icy clouds between stars where new solar systems emerge.The cone-shaped Spherex – at 1,110lb (500kg) or the heft of a grand piano – will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole 400 miles (650km) up.Spherex will not see galaxies in exquisite detail like Nasa’s larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view.Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating big bang.“This cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history,” said Jamie Bock, the mission’s chief scientist of theCaliforniaInstitute of Technology. “It’s a very different way of looking at the universe,” enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past.By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said.“We won’t see the big bang. But we’ll see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way,” he said.The telescope’s infrared detectors will be able to distinguish 102 colors invisible to the human eye, yielding the most colorful, inclusive map ever made of the cosmos.It’s like “looking at the universe through a set of rainbow-colored glasses”, said the deputy project manager, Beth Fabinsky, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.To keep the infrared detectors super cold – minus 350F (-210C) – Spherex has a unique look. It sports three aluminum-honeycomb cones, one inside the other, to protect from the sun and Earth’s heat, resembling a 10ft (3-meter) shield collar for an ailing dog.Besides the telescope, SpaceX’s Falcon rocket provided a lift from Vandenberg Space Force base for a quartet of Nasa satellites called Punch. From their own separate polar orbit, the satellites will observe the sun’s corona, or outer atmosphere, and the resulting solar wind.The evening launch was delayed two weeks because of rocket and other issues.Explore more on these topicsNasaSpaceCaliforniaSpaceXnewsShareReuse this content"

I got it locked up pretty good unless I did something very stupid, like drained your country, your wonderful place of all of its companies. Maybe [then] I’d lose the Irish vote.”Trump also said that previous presidents had “lost big segments” of the US economy toEuropeand repeated his claim that “the EU was set up in order to take advantage of the United States”.Referring to the EU’s successful lawsuit against Apple, forcing it to pay€13bn (£11bn) in back taxes to Ireland, he said: “Apple has been treated very badly … That is unfair.”View image in fullscreenThe US vice-president, JD Vance, wore shamrock socks to the Oval Office meeting.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersIn one of several fawning moments, Martin pointed out that Ireland had fought against the EU case in the European court of justice – a move born out of the country’s desire to hold on to US tech firms such as Intel, Microsoft and Google, which have sited their EU headquarters in and around Dublin.He also said the Irish companies Ryanair and AerCap, which is the world’s biggest aircraft-leasing company, buy more US-made Boeing planes than anyone else.Nodding, Trump said: “I’m not blaming you. I’m blaming theEuropean Union. The European Union’s gone after our companies.“We have a problem with the European Union. They don’t take our farm products. They don’t take our cars. We take millions of cars, BMWs and Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagens and everything.

The efforts had been hindered by the remote, treacherous terrain, which has made communication and mobilisation difficult.The BLA had threatened to start killing hostages unless authorities met its 48-hour deadline for the release of Baloch political prisoners, activists and missing people it says had been abducted by the military.On Wednesday night, the group claimed in a statement it had killed 50 of the hostages over Pakistan’s “failure to engage in a serious prisoner exchange”.According to local media reports, the BLA had stationed suicide bombers in explosive vests close to some of the hostages, further complicating their rescue. “The terrorists are using innocent people as human shields,” an official told Radio Pakistan.Yousaf Bashir was among the passengers who were allowed to leave the train. Describing the moment that the train was held up by the militants, he said: “There was a huge blast. Everyone was scared and people were screaming and crying loudly. We laid down during the blasts. Everyone laid down in the train as there was firing too.”Where is Balochistan and why is it the target of Iran and Pakistan strikes?Read moreHe said militants had come over after the firing stopped and demanded all the passengers get off the train or be killed. “They freed my children, my wife and me too. They warned us not to look back and kept walking. I did not see how many people there were left behind,” said Bashir.Those the BLA allowed to leave the train described walking overnight to safety through the rugged mountain terrain for more than seven hours.In a written statement sent to the Guardian, the BLA said the hijacking was “a direct response to Pakistan’s decades-long colonial occupation of Balochistan and the relentless war crimes committed against the Baloch people”.Balochistan, a vast and underdeveloped region bordering Iran and Afghanistan, has for decades been home to a separatist insurgency fighting against the Pakistani state and military, which it has accused of neglecting and exploiting the region.“The Bolan operation is a tactical response to these atrocities, intended to demonstrate that the occupying forces are not invincible and that their continued presence in Balochistan will be met with unwavering resistance,” the BLA statement said.The BLA has recently ramped up its operations in Balochistan and has been behind some of the worst terrorist attacks in Pakistan in the past few years.Zahid Hussain, a security analyst, said the train hijacking was “unprecedented”. He added: “This attack shows the situation in Balochistan has become very challenging for the military. They have failed to contain the insurgency and militants are recruiting large numbers to carry out such attacks.”Explore more on these topicsPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The plane landed on Wednesday afternoon and taxied into a hangar. An ambulance dropped medics nearby before they wheeled a gurney inside the aircraft.The ICC later released a statement saying Duterte had been “surrendered to the custody” of the court. It added that “as a precautionary measure, medical assistance” was made available for him at the airport, in line with standard procedures when a suspect arrives.Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest could be telling blow in the Philippines’ dynastic feudRead moreNicknamed “the Punisher” in thePhilippinesfor his lethal approach to policing, Duterte, 79, is expected to be taken to an ICC detention unit and then brought before a judge for his initial court appearance in the coming days.During his years in office, Duterte oversaw a crackdown on accused drug dealers and drug addicts in which as many as 30,000 civilians were killed, usually by police and vigilantes. Heis the first former leader of an Asian country to be served an arrest warrant filed by the ICC.Lawyers for Duterte filed a petition on behalf of his youngest daughter, Veronica, accusing the government of “kidnapping” him, and demanding it bring him back.Duterte’s eldest daughter, Sara, the country’s vice-president, left for Amsterdam on Wednesday morning to help with his legal preparations.Carlos Conde, a senior researcher at the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said the developments were historic, and that it would be an understatement to say that victims felt ecstatic at his arrest. “This is something that’s totally unprecedented in the history of this country … not just in this country, [but] for south-east Asia and even Asia,” he said.“[Victims’] spirits are buoyed. They’re very, very optimistic that this is something that can move along expeditiously in The Hague,” Conde said. “The victims here in the Philippines have pretty much lost faith in the domestic justice system, which has done so very little in terms of addressing their quest for justice. This is why they pinned their hopes on the ICC.”Building the case had been a “very painstaking process” for victims, the families of victims and domestic human rights groups, Conde added.View image in fullscreenPeople light candles during a protest in Quezon City after the arrest of the former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte.Photograph: Lisa Marie David/ReutersThe timeline for a trial is unclear, but campaigners have called for proceedings to begin swiftly.The National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, which has represented the families of victims of the killings, said “victims’ pain from loss” had been, for the day, “eclipsed by joy and hope”.Duterte’s arrestwas symbolic of “a victory of the poor and marginalised, akin to that of David versus Goliath,” the lawyers’ group said, adding: “We still have to press on and work for his eventual conviction.”“There’s a feeling of simple joy at what is happening, and relief,” said Brother Jun Santiago, who set up Silingan Coffee, a small coffee shop, to help give jobs to the families of victims of extrajudicial killings, and to provide a space to memorialise their stories.Mother of two sons shot in Duterte’s ‘war on drugs’ dares hope for justiceRead moreOn Tuesday, the cafe offered discounted drinks to customers to encourage people to visit and learn about the abuses that were committed under Duterte’s government. Santiago described the arrest as a “first step to justice”.Duterte’s arrest was widely celebrated among human rights groups, with the Philippine rights alliance Karapatan describing the development as “long overdue”.Duterte’s supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the court has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal.The official Facebook page of the vice-president’s office shared an image of a red ribbon with the text “BRING PRRD HOME” – referring to President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.The country’s president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, told reporters on Tuesday night that he was confident “the arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures”. He added: “We did not help the international criminal court in any way. The arrest was made in compliance with Interpol.”Explore more on these topicsRodrigo DutertePhilippinesInternational criminal courtAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The immense volume of water that moves along its 1,200-mile (1,900km) route produces roughly 40% of US hydroelectric power and nearlyhalfthe hydropower in BC.Rubio says Trump’s ‘51st state’ plan not on G7 summit agenda in CanadaRead moreThe treaty first came into effect in 1964, afterdevastating floods nearly two decades before that destroyed Oregon’s second-largest cityand swaths of southern British Columbia.Under the terms of the agreement,Canadamust control the flow of the Columbia River through its network of dams to ensure US hydropower generators receive enough water and to prevent flooding. Those benefits are worth roughly $200m (C$288m) annually for the province.For its part, the US must also give Canada half the additional potential hydroelectric power produced by dams, which it sells at market rate.Under former presidentJoe Biden, the two countries reached an in-principle deal on a new version of the decades-old treaty in July, ahead of the September expiration deadline of the treaty.Despite a concerted push on both sides to finalize a deal before Trump took office, however, the final details of the treaty remain unfinished, with only a three-year interim agreement in place.In recent weeks, Trump has taken an increasingly combative stance towards Canada, calling its border “imaginary”, musing about inflicting “historic financial devastation” on a longtime ally and threatening to tear up the myriad treaties between the two countries.Last year, then candidateDonald Trumpreferred to the “large faucet” in British Columbia that could be turned on to help a parched California – an idea widely interpreted to refer to the Columbia River.Indigenous peoples were denied a seat at the table when the agreement was first made, despite the river passing through vast tracts of unceded territory. There were hopes that the multi-year renegotiation of the pact would finally see Indigenous rights recognized in Canada and work to restore critical habitats for endangered salmon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So not only is he double s**g h**l-ing [sieg heil-ing] fascist, he’s an idiot but anyway.”Responding to Edebiri’s post on Wednesday, the owner of the original account said: “I clearly stated ‘reportedly’ because it was the latest information coming from credible Hollywood sources. And yes, I am a HUGE fan and supporter of Mr Musk. He has my loyalty for LIFE, and I don’t say that lightly.”The rumour was not run by any credible industry outlet.In a previous Instagram story post, Edebiri applauded comedian Bill Burr for his comments on NPR’s Fresh Air, calling Musk “evidently a Nazi,” and commenting on his hand gesture at Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I just refuse to believe it was an accidental two-time Sieg Heil.”Burr went on to call Musk an “idiot” with “dyed hair plugs and a laminated face” and someone “who makes a bad car and has an obsolete social media platform”. He continued by asking why liberals are “so afraid of this guy who can’t fight his way out of a wet paper bag?”Producer Jerry Bruckheimerconfirmed last yearthat a reboot of the series, which earned nearly $5bn globally, was being developed. He neither confirmed nor denied that Depp would star in it, saying: “It’s a reboot, but if it was up to me, he would be in it. I love him. He’s a good friend. He’s an amazing artist and he’s a unique look.”Edebiri voiced Envy in the Pixar sequel Inside Out 2; her new horror film, Opus, opens in the US this month. She is also set to write and star in Daniel Kaluuya’s Barney the dinosaur film. Edebiri is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, for whom she has frequently canvassed.Explore more on these topicsFilmElon MuskJohnny DeppnewsShareReuse this content"

The arrest has sparked alarm from free-expression advocates who see the move to deport Khalil as a flagrant violation of his free speech rights.A Manhattan federal court held a hearing on Wednesday morning after Khalil’s lawyers challenged his detention, but it ended without a decision on whether he would be released from custody. During the brief hearing, an attorney for the Department of Justice asked for a change of venue for the case, fromNew Yorkto Louisiana or New Jersey, where he was held before being sent south.Who is Mahmoud Khalil? The detained Columbia graduate praised as steady negotiatorRead moreThe judge, Jesse Furman,asked the government to file written arguments by Friday.Earlier this week, Furman, an Obama-appointed judge in New York’s southern district,issued a ruling preventing Khalil’s deportation while the court reviewsthe legal challenge. Khalil’s lawyers contend that the Trump administration is unlawfully retaliating against their client for his activism and constitutionally protected speech.Outside the courthouse after the hearing on Wednesday, Ramzi Kassem, a member of Khalil’s legal team and the founder and co-director ofClear, a legal clinic at the City University of New York, said that the provision of the law that the government is claiming to revoke the green card have gone beyond what Congress intended.“The government, as far as we understand, is relying on a rarely used provision in immigration law to justify the detention of a lawful permanent resident and his placement in removal proceeding,” he said. “It is a provision that basically says that if the secretary of state determines that a non-citizen’s presence or activity in this country poses a serious risk of adverse foreign policy consequences, then that person can be processed for removal. That provision is not only rarely used, it is certainly not intended by Congress to be used to silence dissent.”The New York Times recentlyreportedthat the state department’s rationale holds that its foreign policy to combat antisemitism around the world will be adversely affected by Khalil’s continued presence in the US, as the administration perceives most pro-Palestinian protests on campus as antisemitic.Bill Hing, professor of law and migration at University of San Francisco, said that simply invoking US foreign policy aims would not be enough. He said: “The government has to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that his presence or activities in the US has potential serious adverse foreign policy consequences. The question is, how will they prove that? If he has done nothing more than decry the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, or accuse Israel of genocide, and demand ceasefire, is that adverse to US foreign policy? I don’t think so. I think that is protected free speech.”Khalil’s lawyers are requesting that Furmanorder Khalil’s return to New York, enabling him to reunite with his wife, an American citizen who is expected to give birth next month. Baher Azmy, the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which is also representing Khalil, said that his legal team would be filing briefs dealing with both the legality of the detention and the venue dispute over the next week.Khalil’s legal team also includes the American Civil Liberties Union, the New York Civil Liberties Union, and his lawyer Amy Greer.Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the court. Margaret Jay Finch, holding a sign that read “Civil rights for all people”, said she was “so upset that Mahmoud is in the darkness in Louisiana. I can’t tell you.”The 83-year-old retiree added: “I feel so bad for his wife. I am so worried that this is against the first amendment and we’re going to lose our rights … This is such a dictatorship.”Other protesters held signs saying “Then they came for Mahmoud” and “Hands off our students, Ice off our campuses”. They chanted “Free, free, Palestine” and “Release Mahmoud right now” as they crowded into the large public square in lower Manhattan that is surrounded by grand civic buildings, including the federal courthouse with its imposing pillars and sweeping staircase.Actor and activist Susan Sarandon told the Guardian: “No matter where you stand on the genocide, freedom of speech affects everyone and this is a turning point in our history.”On Monday, Donald Trump said that Khalil’s presence in the US was “contrary to national and foreign policy interests” and said that the arrest was the first of “many to come”. The president has repeatedly promised to revoke the visas of international students who have participated in pro-Palestine protests.Furman has the authority to order Khalil’s release if he finds his rights were violated. The future of Khalil’s immigration status will be determined in a separate process in front of an immigration judge.Diala Shamas, another of Khalil’s lawyers, said that speaking out on the issue of Palestine was the “canary in the coal mine” for free speech.“Speaking out against what the Trump administration is doing does not give them the right to disappear our people … We need to fight as hard as we can for Mahmoud because of what this portends,” she said.Sam Levine contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNew YorkUS immigrationUS universitiesPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMahmoud KhalilMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Will his Academy Award convince him to embrace Hollywood, celebrity, the big bucks?Wed 12 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 08.08 EDTShareDaniel Blumberg hands me his Oscar, as surprised as he is chuffed. Bloody hell, it’s heavy. Is it real gold? “I wish it was,” saysthe latest winner of best original score, forThe Brutalist. (Apparently,it’s gold-plated bronze.) He puts it back on a shabby wooden shelf alongside his Bafta, also for The Brutalist, and his Ivor Novello award, which he won in 2022 forThe World to Come, directed by Mona Fastvold (the partner of Brutalist director Brady Corbet). “Before the Ivor Novello, the only thing I’d ever won was ‘most improved footballer’ when I was six,” he says. “Honestly, I’d never thought about Oscars in my entire life. I’d never even watched the ceremony.”Blumberg, 35, is the least likely Oscar winner you could imagine. Not because he lacks the talent, but because he has spent his career walking away from mainstream success. The former schoolboy indie pop star has reinvented himself as an atonal improviser of scratchy, screechy weirdness. If that sounds like a tough listen, it’s all combined with sublime minimalist melodies to create music as beautiful as it is challenging.As epic as it is intimate … listen to the overture for The Brutalist.He and I go back a long way. I promise Blumberg I won’t go on about knowing him since he was a toddler. Or playing football for decades with his father, who was also, all too briefly, my GP. Or playing football with him when he got older. Or lending him my Led Zeppelin albums when he was about 10, basically paving the way for his Oscar. Or him being an unusually intense, sweet boy who grew into an unusually intense, sweet man. I tell him his secrets are safe with me.His tiny flat in Hackney, east London, is an Aladdin’s cave of keyboards, guitar pedals, harmonicas, microphones, drawings, art books and DVDs. It manages to be scruffy and immaculate at the same time. There is dust galore, but everything is meticulously catalogued in 1950s-style filing cabinets. He has lived here for 15 years, but it looks as if he could have moved in yesterday.The golden locks of yesteryear have gone. His head is shaved, his face pale; there are purple bags under his eyes. (To be fair, he has been to Los Angeles this week to collect his Oscar, then back to London, on to Rome and back home again.) There is an intensity to his gaze that can be forbidding – he would make a great Caliban. But it’s offset by a puppyish affability. You could see it in his Oscars acceptance speech – shy and shaky-legged, he just about got through his thank-yous, before leaving the stage half-singing a tribute to his friends atCafe Oto, the avant-garde London venue that has been a second home to him for years.View image in fullscreen‘Look how commercial I am now: I won an Oscar!’ Delivering his acceptance speech in LA earlier this month.Photograph: Rob Latour/Rex/ShutterstockBlumberg is a visual artist as well as a musician. His work ranges from primitivist cuboid figures to abstracts drawn in silver. “My favourite thing in the world is drawing,” he says. He tells me about some of his artistic heroes (Joan Miró, Paul Klee and Francis Bacon, for starters) and how you have to prime the paper before working in silverpoint. He could talk for ever about art.As he could about his friendships with elderly people. He worked in an antiquarian bookshop for eight years with Celia Mitchell, the former actor (and wife of the poet Adrian Mitchell), who died last year at 91: “She was my best friend.” There are so many things he loves to talk about: the mates he plays music with at Cafe Oto; his football team, Tottenham Hotspur; and why Italian cafetieres make better coffee when they are smaller. Also, how the Polish film director Krzysztof Kieślowski made him understand the possibilities of cinema; the genius of Scott Walker and the French musician Ghédalia Tazartès; becoming soul brothers with Brady Corbet; why he and his ex-partner (the actor Stacy Martin, who stars in The Brutalist) get on better than ever …And then there are things that he definitely doesn’t like talking about, notably his past in the music industry. When he was 15, he formed the band Cajun Dance Party with his friend Max Bloom. Back then, the industry was flush with cash. The band got a great record deal when they were still at school. Their first and only album got rave reviews and their song Colourful Life featured in an episode of Gavin and Stacey. He is grateful for what the band provided him, but he struggles even to say the name out loud.“I have this flat because of the first band and it only costs me £200 a month! I’ve never made money since then, like even now. I can barely afford the flat!” This is because Blumberg has not prioritised making money. You are one of the most defiantly uncommercial people I have ever met, I say. “But look how commercial I am now: I won an Oscar!” I wouldn’t put it past Blumberg to denounce his Academy Award as a sellout. Thankfully, he doesn’t today. In fact, he is loving it. He shows me photos of his neighbours happily holding his Oscar.View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t like what I was doing’ … Blumberg performing with Yuck at Coachella in 2012.Photograph: Zuma Press, Inc./AlamyAt 19, he and Bloom formed another band, Yuck. Again, their first album was rapturously received. They toured withTame Impala, earned comparisons to Dinosaur Jr and Sonic Youth, performed in front of huge crowds at festivals and were on their way to super success. Again, he walked away after one album.“I remember playing at Coachella and feeling the worst I’ve ever felt in my entire life.” Why did you feel so bad? “Because I didn’t like what I was doing.” As far as Blumberg is concerned, there is nothing more uncreative than gigging mechanically. “It was like Groundhog Day. I was touring, doing these songs that I’d written a couple of years ago. You’re literally just doing the same thing over and over again.” He felt relieved that his fellow band members continued when he left. “I was only involved in the first album, so I feel embarrassed to be associated with the other stuff.”The more he turned his back on success, the more amazing musicians wanted to work with him. After Yuck, he recorded a wonderful album of lovelorn lo-fi under the name Hebronix. There were hints there of what he would do later, in the mix of gorgeous tunes and frazzled dissonance. I tell him I adore the album. He looks at me as if I have lost the plot. Maybe you should listen to it again, I suggest. It’s the worst thing you could say to Blumberg. “No, no, maybe I shouldn’t!” he protests.He explains his aversion to the old stuff. Whenever he signed with a label, they would want him to make a series of albums. To Blumberg, that was the definition of hell. He remembers talking to the director Lars von Trier when Martin was working with him on the film Nymphomaniac. “It was a really important conversation with Lars. He said: ‘I don’t understand bands. They sign a contract for three albums to work with the same people,’ and he was like: ‘I would never do that with films.’ You build a team for each thing you do.”When he returned from his nightmare tour with Yuck, he popped into Cafe Oto for the first time. It was life-changing. He saw Keiji Haino playing improvised guitar. Blumberg loved it. He returned the next night, and Haino’s set was totally different. He decided that this was what he wanted to do musically – be in a state of permanent evolution or revolution. He created a simple manifesto – no two gigs should be the same. He started to play with other regulars at Cafe Oto. A few people would turn out to watch them and he couldn’t have been happier. This, he decided, was real music.View image in fullscreenBlumberg at home in his flat in Hackney, London – scruffy and immaculate at the same time.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIn 2015, he was awarded a scholarship to study for a postgraduate diploma at the Royal Drawing School in London and focused on his art. Then, in 2018, he returned to music with an album unlike anything he had made before. Minus, recorded with his regular collaborators from Cafe Oto, is a collection of songs, but it’s also something more. It’s about his first breakup with Martin and is astonishingly raw. In parts, it’s so gentle that it barely exists. At other times, it drills straight into your soul. Billboard described it as “one of the more unique and exquisite records you’re likely to hear this year”, while Rough Trade ranked it the sixth best album of 2018.Minus is extraordinarily tortured, I say. He smiles: “I was in a very emotional place.” Perhaps it’s something we have in common, I say – we have both struggled with our mental health. “Yeah. You get …” He has another go. “You learn how to deal with that stuff. You get more experience with dealing with wonky times.” When was the first time he became aware of the wonkiness? “Well, I definitely … I don’t know. Yeah. D’you want some more coffee?”Does he find this too personal to talk about? “No, but I’m not sure it’s that productive.” Is he in a good space now? “Yeah! Very!” He makes more coffee and we change the subject.Unutterably beautiful … listen to the score for The World to Come.Even the self-flagellating Blumberg admits he is proud of Minus and all that has followed. This is where his career really begins, he says – he was too young to understand himself when he started out. The quietly ecstatic score for The World to Come featuresan unutterably beautiful title song, co-written and sung by Josephine Foster. If Richard Strauss were around today, you could imagine him writing it.A couple of years ago, Blumberg was diagnosed with an intestinal disease that leaves him with chronic pain and fatigue. Gut, another deeply personal album, from 2023, chronicles his experience with the condition. Again, exquisite harmonies are juxtaposed with the unlovely – retching, burping, gurgling.The score for The Brutalist is as epic as it is intimate. It mirrors perfectly the arc of the narrative – about a Hungarian concentration camp survivor and groundbreaking architect (played byAdrien Brody, who won the Oscar for best actor) trying to establish a new life in the US after the war – from the shrieking sax and industrial percussion reflecting the epic landscape and debauched nights out to tender piano pieces telling the love story. While film scores are normally written after movies have been shot, Blumberg was on set throughout, composing in real time.View image in fullscreenPerforming at End of the Road, Dorset, in 2018.Photograph: Stephen Parker/AlamyThe score was as much curated as written. Blumberg travelled the world recording hand-picked musicians – the trumpeter Axel Dörner in Berlin, the pianist Sophie Agnel in Paris, the multi-instrumentalist Simon Sieger in Budapest, Erasure’s Vince Clarke in New York, the saxophonist Evan Parker and the pianist John Tilbury in Kent. Tilbury, 89, plays accompanied by falling rain. That would have been a distraction for many composers, but Blumberg saw it as an asset. He even miked up Tilbury, so you could hear him breathing and writing notes on his stave. As the film is about the act of creation, so is the music.I ask Blumberg if he enjoyed all the Oscar razzmatazz. Daft question, really. He laughs and tells me of the five times The Brutalist team had to visit LA in the awards season. “The film company had booked all these Q&As for me and after the first one they said I was so shit at them I shouldn’t do any more. They said it in a passive way: ‘Is Daniel too tired to do the Q&A tomorrow?’ And I was like: ‘I think I’m going to sleep tonight, so I’ll be fine.’” At that point, they just came straight out with it. “They said my body language was really bad and it looked like I didn’t want to be there.”He tells me how big names in the industry came up to him and punched him on the shoulder by way of congratulation after his win. He had to be told they were big names. By the end of the evening, he felt thoroughly battered. Then there was the advice. People told him that now he had won an Oscar he should do a big-budget Hollywood movie and rake it in. He was horrified.It was a great experience, but he was relieved to return to Hackney, stick the Oscar on the shelf and get back to work. He is now composing a score for Fastvold’s next film. On his first night back, he turned up at Cafe Oto. It was packed with friends, fellow musicians, people with a sense of common purpose. After the “madness of Hollywood”, he says, it was heaven.Explore more on these topicsThe BrutalistOscarsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Will Smith nabbed the best actor Oscar for his role in King Richard.BarackandMichelle Obama’s production venture Higher Ground is in talks to produce along with Irwin Winkler, a veteran sports movie producer behind Rocky, Creed and Goodfellas.The film will expound on Woods’s early career, which has in recent years been marred by injury; just this week, heunderwent emergency surgeryon his achilles tendon, all but guaranteeing that he will miss the Masters for only the fifth time since his debut in 1995. Cook, a former Sports Illustrated editor and editor-in-chief of Golf Magazine, focused the book on the so-called Tiger Slam – winning four consecutive majors between 2000 and 2001 – which is still considered the greatest feat in golf history.Game, set and match: the 20 best sports moviesRead moreThe book charted Woods’ development from youth star to world-famous golfer with his first Masters win in 1997, becoming the first Black golfer to win a major title and significantly raising the profile of the sport. Cook spoke with Woods’ caddie, coach, mentors, idols, and opponents on the golfer’s game and drive for perfection despite obstacles on and off the green.Should Higher Ground officially board the project, it would mark another notch in the Obamas’ sports media portfolio. In the past couple years, the company produced two basketball projects – Court of Gold, on the 2024 Paris Olympics, and Starting 5, on the 2023-2024 NBA season – both forNetflix. The imprint has also produced a number of Oscar-nominated features, including civil rights biopicRustinand the documentaryCrip Camp.Woods, meanwhile, has continued to extend his career into his late 40s despite nagging knee and back problems. Last December, hepartnered with his son Charliein the PNC Championship, and has been a regular participant in the tech-infused golf league he launched with Rory McIlroy.

How did it turn such a tedious sport into such gripping television?Jack SealeWed 12 Mar 2025 07.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 07.57 EDTShareTennis hasBreak Point. Rugby union hasSix Nations: Full Contact. Nascar has Full Speed. Golf hasFull Swing. Basketball has Starting 5. Cycling has Tour de France: Unchained. American football has both Quarterback and Receiver. Athletics has Sprint. What do all these documentaries have in common? They have all sprung up in the past five years or so, and are basically all the same show: if they are not full clones ofFormula 1: Drive to Survive, they are heavily inspired by it.Drive to Survive thus has a claim to be one of the most influential TV documentaries of the past decade, having pioneered a simple but effective format. Every 12 months since 2019, it has delivered a new season – last week it released the seventh – that recaps what happened in the previous year’s F1 championship, using behind-the-scenes access, race-day footage and retrospective interviews.Absurd as it may seem to say that this one-year time lag is the secret of Drive to Survive’s success – you could hardly make a documentary about races that haven’t taken place yet – it is the fundamental reason it works. Free from the distraction of hoping for a certain result, viewers who know how the story ends are keen to see it from new angles; for the participants, thoughts and actions that would have been precious secrets at the time can now be freely discussed. “It feels like access to a world that we shouldn’t be seeing,” says DTS executive producer Tom Hutchings. “It’s all the elements that you don’t get from watching live sport. Viewers get hooked on that very quickly.”View image in fullscreen‘They are still like you and me’ … Lewis Hamilton on the series.Photograph: NetflixIt helps that F1 is a sport that is more than just a game. Money and politics play a huge part in it, and the drivers are risking their lives. So there is plenty to talk about and F1 people tend to be confident, suave types, eager to crack wise and be fabulously indiscreet. “The show lives on character,” says Hutchings. “Fortunately, F1 is full of interesting people – ruthless competitors, decisive characters and a few egos.” In that way, Drive to Survive gets around what could be a pretty major problem with making TV about motor racing, which is that motor racing itself can be tedious. “[As well as F1 experts] it also has a loyal fanbase that isn’t made up of the core F1 fandom,” Hutchings says. “So many of our viewers watch Drive to Survive, but not the F1 races.”Attempts to replicate the global success of DTS have been mixed. While Unchained has vividly communicated how tense and brutal top-level road cycling is, and Full Swing arrived just as the sport of golf was ripped in two by a breakaway tour flush withSaudi cash, other series haven’t clicked. Break Point has struggled to visualise the intrigue within tennis, a solitary, attritional sport that doesn’t have players controversially switching teams or coaches giving rousing half-time team talks. Full Contact isn’t as good as some other shows at hiding how reliant it is on officially sanctioned access – you rarely get the feeling of peeking behind the curtain and being told something that the speaker is taking a risk by revealing.Formula 1: Drive to Survive, season seven trailer – videoAll the above series do, however, share another straightforward but crucial quality, which is that they look at the sport as a whole, rather than making the same mistake as the show that previously tried to kickstart a new era in sports documentaries. Prime Video’sAll or Nothing, itself inspired by the godfather of the genre, HBO’s Hard Knocks, focuses on a different football team each year, which is a problem if you’re not a fan of that team. Not favouring any particular competitor makes a sports documentary more agile: when the 2023 F1 season turned out to be a boring procession won comfortably by Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing, Drive to Survive switched to telling smaller stories about less famous drivers.One series that has made the one-team approach work isWelcome to Wrexham, the Disney+ documentary about the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney buying a decrepit non-league football club and attempting to revive it. Influenced by Netflix’s superbSunderland ’Til I Die, it plays on the effect of the team’s previous failures on the fragile working-class community surrounding the stadium. Whether it can keep its underdog charm as Wrexham rise through the league system is debatable – if it can, it will be because it keeps telling relatable stories.“At the end of the day, they are still like you and me,” says Hutchings of the F1 superstars – an improbable claim, but one that sums up the suspension of disbelief that makes Drive to Survive and its imitators so gripping. “We all make decisions every day – we all laugh and cry. If we can tell those human stories in a fun way, that seems to keep the audience happy.”Formula 1: Drive to Survive is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDocumentaryFactual TVFormula OneSport TVNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here, a slice of her vast exhibition Journey to the Center, staged in a spectacular 15th-century church during the Arles festival last year, is re-created. The installation tries to be dynamic – a bright orange wooden framework cuts through the middle of the space; photographs are placed next to blown-up versions of Mexican Lotería cards – but it can’t cover up the blandness of De Middel’s work.View image in fullscreenLa que se Fue from the series Journey to the Center by Cristina de Middel.Photograph: Cristina de MiddelJourney to the Center (the title cribbed from Jules Verne’s adventure novel) attempts to reframe journeys of migrants from Mexico to California as a heroic quest. Yet this is done through mostly unremarkable landscape images, sutured together in a narrative that’s unconvincing. De Middel experienced real danger while making the images along these routes – perils all migrants face – but that is edited out. Does heroism exclude hardship?In one image, a portrait of a young, unnamed migrant woman stands on the border on the beach in Tijuana, wearing a jumper with Donald Trump’s giant pouting face on it, preparing to enter a country with a “Remain in Mexico” policy. It reads too much like a joke at the migrant’s expense. In another conceit, De Middel depicts high-jump athletes training next to the Tortilla Wall, a particularly perilous crossing point from Baja California into San Diego. De Middel sets out to reinvent the story of Mexican migration into the US for western viewers in this series, but the stifling symbolism is too glib and glossy to achieve that.It does get better. Waiting in the next room are knockout works by American photographerRahim Fortune, a selection from his nominatedHardtackbook, reproduced as sumptuous black-and-white silver gelatin prints for the wall. Hardtack refers to the unleavened bread used as a survival food bybuffalo soldiersand later adapted by Black cowboys and ranchers. Fortune’sglorious documentary imagestake us between the topographies and people of rural communities in the southern states, where he grew up and where metaphors of survival and persistence abound.View image in fullscreenPraise Dancers, Edna, Texas, by Rahim Fortune.Whether depicting settler-era wooden homes, whose history speaks through their hurried architecture, or a new father tenderly holding his infant, Fortune’s photographs shimmer and scintillate. There is grace and humility in a portrait of three praise dancers in Edna, Texas, heads bowed and arms thrust out in spiritual abandon; and a pearlescent pageant queen who is all gossamer glow. In this tender portrait of Black life in the American south, the tattered facade of Sam’s BBQ, in Austin, confronts what lingers ominously in the American landscape, with its hand-painted sign reading: “We may have come on different ships but we’re in the same boat now.”View image in fullscreenSister Rock/Rock that Tries to Forget, from Automatic Rocks/Excavation by Tarrah Krajnak.The Peruvian-American artistTarrah Krajnakis the wild card this year, but brings the laughs. In one series, Krajnak playfully re-enacts images fromEdward Weston’s 1977 book of nudes. There’s a restaging of a 1942 image of model Charis Wilson reclining on a sofa, wearing a gas mask she’d been issued as a volunteer for the Aircraft Warning Service. Krajnak replicates the image, including the fern frond Weston used, but switches up the composition, creating a diptych so that her body is cut in two. It is a pithy deconstruction that shows up the coldness of Weston’s gaze on women’s bodies in his sculptural, fragmented figures.I wonder if Krajnak was also inspired by Weston’s challenge to “photograph a rock, have it look like a rock, but be more than a rock” in her series Automatic Rocks/Excavation in which she digs up stones from her garden, names them, cradles them for a time, then takes pictures of them. It’s bonkers, but irrepressibly fun.Lindokuhle Sobekwa, the final artist in the show, would be a worthy winner for the £30,000 prize (which is announced in May). Sobekwa’s gripping project,I Carry Her Photo With Me, is reimagined in a slideshow, with a gorgeous musical score by Nduduzo Makhathini, and a constellation of images scattered in fragments across the walls, in keeping with the rawness of the original spiral-bound scrapbook.View image in fullscreenA gripping project … from I Carry Her Photo With Me by Lindokuhle Sobekwa.It is a journey of shocking loss. When Sobekwa was seven, his sister Ziyanda (then 13) was chasing him when he was hit by a car and badly injured. Ziyanda then ran away and didn’t return home for nearly a decade. She was eventually found living in a hostel, but died soon after, aged 22. She would not allow Sobekwa to take her photograph, an absence that looms large.‘In South Africa, you hear of disappearance all the time’: one photographer’s search for his sister’s missing yearsRead moreIn lo-fi images, he combs the misty, dilapidated, disenfranchised landscapes of the South African township complex where he grew up, once the siteof a bloody taxi war. He sees glimpses of his late sister’s face in other young women he meets at the hostel. Slowly the sense of the family’s loss merges with the masses who have disappeared into the void of violence during (and since) apartheid. Diary entries are scribbled and urgent, the pencil pressed hard to the paper.The pain of Sobekwa’s grief is penetrating; in one image, he catches his shadow cast over her grave. His photographs are often hazy, evanescent light fading like memories, the camera trying to clutch and fix the image before it is gone for ever.The Deutsche Börse photography foundation prize 2025 is at the Photographers’ Gallery, London, until 15 JuneExplore more on these topicsDeutsche Börse photography prizeThe Photographers' GalleryPhotographyAwards and prizesArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the freedoms witnessed by Pet Shop Boys have been crushed. Singer Neil Tennant relives those heady days – and calls for a revolutionNeil TennantWed 12 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 01.03 EDTShareThe journalistAndrey SapozhnikovofNovaya GazetaEurope, the independent Russian newspaperthat now operates from Latvia in order to avoid censorship by Putin’s regime, recently asked Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys: “You have been actively commenting on Russian politics since 2013 and the Pussy Riot case, and you are arguably one of the most engaged western artists in relation to the Russian context today. Why do you care so deeply about what is happening specifically in Russia?” Here is his reply, which the Guardian is publishing in English.I have been interested in Russia since reading a book when I was a young boy about the 1917 revolutions. It fascinated me that the Russian empire was replaced by another empire, the Soviet Union, which unleashed a lot of energy but rapidly became a brutal dictatorship under Stalin, a 20th-century Ivan the Terrible. Since then I have read a lot about Soviet culture, particularly the work and struggles of Shostakovich and Prokofiev and other artists, writers, musicians. This interest fed into the lyrics I wrote. For instanceMy October Symphony, or indeed our first hit single,West End Girls: “In every city, in every nation / From Lake Geneva tothe Finland Station.”The first contact thePet Shop Boyshad with Russia was in 1988, during the first exchange visit of Soviet and British teenagers to each other’s countries. We were delighted to discover that, when the Soviet kids were asked who they’d like to meet in London, they said the Pet Shop Boys. And so we met them and discovered we had a Soviet audience.Ksenia Sobchak, our clubbing acquaintance, was a candidate in a presidential electionA few years later communism collapsed and the Soviet republics became independent countries, and in 1993 we travelled to Russia for the first time to launch MTV Russia. While we were there we filmed part ofthe video for Go Westin Red Square. Russia was politically and economically “going west”, so it seemed relevant and funny to have statues of Lenin pointing west.We were met at the airport by a driver in a big limousine that they said used to be Gorbachev’s. Those days in Moscow, there were still three lanes: two going opposite ways and then another in the middle for important people. So we swept into Moscow in Gorbachev’s limousine.View image in fullscreenMad hatters … Pet Shop Boys at the launch of MTV Russia in 1993.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyA few years later, I returned to Moscow to record a choir singing on a new song of ours, A Red Letter Day, partly inspired by the changes we had seen inRussiaon our first visit. In the late 90s we started to visit St Petersburg regularly. It was thrilling for me to be physically present in streets that had so much historical resonance, but it was also impossible to ignore the victims of the economic problems that followed the implosion of the Soviet system – old ladies, for instance, selling possessions on the street.While politicians argued about the right economic approach, we met young people setting up their own businesses, thrilled that they could travel abroad. Clubs were fun and there was a wild freedom in the air. Once, when we couldn’t get a taxi, the police drove us back to our hotel from a gay club! We enjoyed hanging out with a few friends we’d made. A young woman who was the daughter of the former Mayor of St Petersburg – her name isKsenia Sobchak– was briefly part of the clubbing crowd.Brian Eno and his family lived in St Petersburg for a while, and we attended the opening of his show at the Russian Museum. A few years later, our friend the British artist Sam Taylor-Wood [now Taylor-Johnson] had a big show at the same museum and we threw a crazy party for her in a new restaurant. We considered making an album in St Pete (as expats called it). I remember a wonderful white night when we toured the canals of St Petersburg in a boat, eating caviar and drinking wine.When Putin was manoeuvred into power 25 years ago, it felt like it could be a positive thing: he was going to take on the oligarchs and improve the economic situation for Russians. But when I asked a friend in St Petersburg what he thought about Putin, he gave a one-word answer: “Stalin.” I assumed he was pessimistically exaggerating, but he was right and I was optimistically wrong.In 2005, we performed in Red Square, headlining the Russian part of the internationalLive 8 event, a day of concerts in eight countries in support of the Make Poverty History campaign and invoking the spirit of Live Aid. Putin had apparently given permission for the event to take place on this historic site next to the Kremlin. On that day, it really felt like Russia was part of the free world. This feeling was not to last.In the first two decades of the 21st century, Moscow and St Petersburg were regular destinations on our world tours and you could see these cities, particularly Moscow, becoming more and more prosperous. But simultaneously you became aware of human rights issues; the managed elections; the presidency passed to Medvedev and back to Putin; the gradual descent into a dictatorship presiding over a managed democracy. The media were curbed and controlled. Independent media outlets were gradually shut down.Anti-gay legislation was passed and vicious homophobic activity encouraged. A British TV presenter, Reggie Yates, made a chilling documentary following homophobes in St Petersburg who were trapping and attacking gay men – a strong indicator that things were getting weird. The police certainly weren’t going to drive you back to your hotel from a club any more. Ksenia Sobchak, our clubbing acquaintance, was a candidate in a presidential election – allowed to stand by the Kremlin to maintain the illusion of genuine democratic choice.Kaputnik, our song about a guy angry after a break-up, is really about Putin and the former Soviet republicsThere were regular aggressive attacks on former Soviet republics: cyberattacks in Estonia, border conflict in Georgia, and of course the issue ofUkraine. It felt like the citizens of former parts of the Russian and Soviet empires saw Russia as a nightmare past they didn’t want to return to when the possibility (and for the Baltic states the reality) of EU and Nato membership beckoned.Putin gradually indicated his ambition to rebuild the Soviet empire starting with his famous comment, “The breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century”, and in doing so he became a recruiting sergeant for Nato. Having experienced the reality of Soviet cold war subjugation, most of the former eastern bloc states had already joined Nato, so why wouldn’t Georgia and Ukraine also want to join when Putin threatened their stability and territorial integrity and seemed to resent that they didn’t see themselves as provinces of Russia? Putin lives in a 19th-century past where provinces are annexed. Crimea, for instance.View image in fullscreenMobbed … the band out and about in Moscow.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyThroughout all of this, we and other western musicians continued to perform in Russia. I continued to write occasional lyrics inspired by Russian themes. For instance Kaputnik, which is superficially about a guy angry at the breakup of his relationship but is really about Putin and the former Soviet republics: “I’ll never recognise your new independence / I’ll say you wish you hadn’t lost all you had / And then suggest an intervention is needed / by someone like me who knows you’ve gone mad.”Our last two concerts in Russia were at big private parties: the annual staff party of a large industrial concern in Ekaterinburg and, in 2019, the 50th birthday party in St Petersburg of a successful businessman whom we had originally encountered more than 20 years previously when he was a young clubber, setting up his first business. He’s now an exile.Pet Shop Boys’ 30 greatest songs – ranked!Read moreWe have seen the optimism of Russia opening up, and the tragedy of it closing down. Why does Russia live out an exceptionalist fantasy? Is the repressive past impossible to escape and Putin just the latest autocrat? Is Russia as a country locked in a political cycle of abuse? When it’s reported that a 12-year-old girl has been arrested in Russia for making an antiwar drawing, how can you think otherwise? Being a Russian gay activist is now to be labelled and punished as an “extremist”.For Russia to move on from the cancer of Putin will require a revolution of attitudes, a rejection of Putin and Stalin. It will require frank discussion of the history of Russia and the Soviet Union – like that for which​ the human rights group Memorial​, which commemorated those persecuted in the Soviet era,was closed down​ by the Putin regime, and similar to the de-Nazification process in postwar Germany. Reparations must be paid to Ukraine. Then Russia could become what surely everyone wants: a peaceful and prosperous country positioned in Europe and linking it to the east, rejecting its past as a bully to both its neighbours and its own citizens; an integral part of world civilisation. This is a huge task and it begins with the retreat of all Russian (and North Korean) troops from Ukraine, followed by the arrest and trial of Vladimir Putin. We can only hope for this red letter day.I do not imagine that anyone really cares what we think about Russia, but you did ask.Listen to Pet Shop Boys’Hymn (In Memoriam Alexei Navalny)Explore more on these topicsPet Shop BoysRussiaEuropeUkrainePop and rockVladimir PutinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His first European solo exhibition charts this remarkable journeyWed 12 Mar 2025 07.02 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 10.52 EDTShareWhat is home? What does it mean to belong? For Eritrea-born artist, activist and chef Ficre Ghebreyesus, who fled war in his homeland at the age of 16 and landed on US shores in 1981, these were vital questions that played out in his vibrant, often dreamlike canvases. “Painting was the miracle, the final act of defiance through which I exorcised the pain and reclaimed my sense of place, my moral compass, and my love for life,” the artist wrote in 2000, in his application for a masters in fine art at Yale School of Art.Ghebreyesus, who died suddenly of a heart attack aged 50 in 2012, left behind more than 800 paintings. These were barely exhibited in his lifetime but have garnered acclaim posthumously, presented at the2022 Venice Biennaleand in a handful of US shows. Now Ghebreyesus will have his first solo British exhibition atModern Artgallery in London, made up of 25 canvases from the 1990s to 2011, many of which have never been displayed publicly.From vertiginous paintings brimming with pattern and colour to cubist-inflected figurative depictions to abstract geometric patchworks that might denote landscapes, the selection conveys his immense range of styles, sources and subject matter. According to the Ethiopian-American painterJulie Mehretu, Ghebreyesus managed to mine and invent “a visual language for displacement, of insistence, of affirmation despite loss, loneliness, mourning and grieving”.View image in fullscreenAffirmation despite loss … Map/Quilt, 1999, Ficre Ghebreyesus.Photograph: © The Estate of Ficre Ghebreyesus. Courtesy Galerie Lelong and Modern ArtGhebreyesus was born to a well-respected family in the Eritrean capital Asmara in 1962, a year after the eruption of the 30-year war of independence from Ethiopia. Despite never living in the Horn of Africa country after his teens, his paintings draw on its rich convergence of influences: the Coptic Christian and Islamic iconography found in Asmara’s churches and mosques, prehistoric rock paintings, grand Italianate architecture from Eritrea’s colonial past and mural portraits of Marx, Lenin and Stalin painted during the brutal regime of Ethiopian dictatorMengistu Haile Mariam.Ghebreyesus’s paintings hold in tension the joy of home life with his parents and five siblings and the horror of soldiers invading their compound and tanks in the streets. In 1978, after his school was shuttered by troops and Ghebreyesus tried to sign up for the Eritrean resistance, his mother packed him off with his cousin to travel on foot across the border into Sudan, then to Italy, Germany, finally arriving in the United States in 1981.These experiences of upheaval and migration show up obliquely in his work. In a pastel work on paper from the 1990s, a luminous moon casts its glow over a barren mountainous scene with a lone tent and two figures huddled by a fire. Another work from the same period is an orange, purple and teal seascape of floating vessels, with what look like tropical flowers sprouting in their wake. Ghebreyesus’s widow, American poetElizabeth Alexander, says he described such scenes as “dreamscape spaces of memory, flights of fantasy, but grounded in memory”.Boats are a recurrent motif in his oeuvre along with gates, portals and angels. A painting from between 2002 and 2007 depicts sails camouflaged within a square patterning of blues and greens, recalling woven baskets, while another portrays two figures immersed in fluid within some kind of container, tenderly embracing or whispering. In Ghebreyesus’s work, boats have “a roundness, a human bodiness to them, that proper boats don’t have,” Alexander notes. “I think they represent passage from one space to the next, be it a country, be it a state of mind, be it a culture.”On arrival in the US, the artist gravitated to New York and then New Haven, Connecticut, juggling several restaurant jobs at a time, studying and becoming involved in activism for Eritrean liberation. He studied painting at theArtStudents’ League, a training ground for many abstract expressionists. In 1992 he and his two brothers opened the popular restaurant Caffe Adulis. It was there, while working as executive chef, that Ghebreyesus met Alexander, then a professor at the University of Chicago. They were engaged within a week and went on to have two children, Solomon and Simon.From this time on his palette shifted from darker to lighter hues. “That sense of re-creating a very family-oriented wonderland was a deep safety and landing for him that I think allowed other things to come out,” Alexander says. Ghebreyesus was, she says, “a very, very passionate, ardent father”; photos show the children as babies happily lolling on his canvases.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Galerie Lelong/Modern ArtOnly in 2008, after completing his MFA at Yale, where he won a painting prize, did Ghebreyesus stop cooking and devote himself to art full-time. He would spend many hours in the studio working simultaneously on several unstretched canvases of different sizes, always nourished by music: he lovedThelonious MonkandAli Farka Touré.Indeed, music fed into his paintings. It’s in Seated Musician II, painted around 2011, which gestures to cubism in its colourful geometric planes and fragmented depiction of the subject, whose disembodied, quizzical face floats above the rest of him as he plays the lyre-like k’rar.And music is undeniably present in the enormous colourful burlap painting Map/Quilt (1999), which evokes the bursting rhythms of an improvised jazz composition. Jostling forms in coral, teal, mauve and orange, dotted with glyphs and symbols, stretch feverishly across every inch of the picture plane, dazzling the eye.Ghebreyesus was reluctant to exhibit his work, driven by the desire simply to create, which seems somehow prescient in light of his untimely death. “He knew he had something to say and to share and to give,” says Alexander, whose 2015 biography of her husband,The Light of the World: A Memoirwas nominated for a Pulitzer prize. The artist’s forthcoming London show is something of “a going home” in view of the number of Eritreans living in the capital, she says. His paintings connect to the yearning and lament of exile but also to the joy of reunion and the vitality of diaspora. Above all, they exude an extraordinary, inextinguishable life force.Ficre Ghebreyesus is atModern Art, London, 14 March to 10 MayExplore more on these topicsArt and designPaintingExhibitionsEritreaAfricaArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Steam mops are a great example, using steam to shift stains, spills and everyday grime from your hard floors in seconds, and even freshening up your carpets with the right attachment. Steam cleaners can go even further, dishing out gusts of steam that help with mucky jobs such as driving dirt and gunge from your bathroom sink and shower tray, and cleaning up tiles, kitchen sinks and worktops. Not only will you get these jobs done faster, but you’ll get a great deep clean at the same time.

I’ve tested a wide range of smart home appliances and devices, and I know what features make them more effective and easier to use, and which don’t bring any real value.How I testedView image in fullscreenThe steam cleaners were put to work on mud, coffee and ketchup.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsWe spoke to manufacturers and searched through the biggest online stores to pull in the leading steam mops and cleaners. I then put our test subjects through a rigorous steam cleaning trial over four weeks.Each model was unboxed and assembled according to the manufacturer’s instructions. They were then filled with water and put to work on the hard-tiled and vinyl floors of my kitchen, utility room and bathrooms. I timed how long it took them to heat up and steam from a cold start, and how long they steamed for with a full tank of water. I checked how each mop manoeuvred and handled tight corners and tricky spaces, such as underneath free-standing bathroom furniture.With steam cleaners or hybrid cleaner mops, I also broke out the supplied extension hoses and attachments, then got to work cleaning tiles, shower trays, shower screens, baths, worktops and sinks, scouring and scrubbing to give my test rooms the kind of scorched-earth spring clean they rarely get.I also scraped mud, dropped coffee and splodged ketchup on to a test piece of vinyl flooring, left it to dry, then checked how quickly and effectively each cleaner could remove the gunk. While I was at it, I also checked each steam cleaner’s power consumption, to see how much energy it used while boiling away. When I was done, you could have eaten from the kitchen sink or shower tray, though I might have still thought twice about the bathroom floor.After testing, the cleaners were either returned to the manufacturer or donated to the Devon-based hospice charityHospiscarefor resale. I washed any mop pads or accessories provided first, to spare the tender sensibilities of subsequent users.The best steam mops and steam cleaners in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Brilliant for cleaning showers, ovens and bathroom sinks’: the Bissell SteamShot.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsBest overall:Kärcher SC3 EasyFix ExtraView image in fullscreenThis Kärcher steam cleaner is a compact unit in white. When you have the two-part steam tube and mop head attached, it resembles an old-fashioned cylinder vacuum cleaner. It comes with a decent selection of other accessories, too, including two different sizes of stiff brush head, four mop pads and a window-wiping tool. The main unit is light and easy to move around on its chunky wheels and front caster, and you fill it simply by pouring water into the hole on the top, where small slots surround a limescale-removing cartridge.Why we love itIt takes about 36 seconds to get a full head of steam going, but once it’s ready you’ve got a lot of steam to work with, whether you’re mopping the floors or spring-cleaning in your bathroom. It pushed effortlessly through our dried-on mud and ketchup spills, then mopped them up with a second stroke. It’s also brilliant on sinks, tiles and shower screens, with the steam softening up the toughest and most inlaid grime, so you can easily scrape or wipe it off.It’s a shame that …the design means it’s not as easy to store as upright mops – you may want a plastic box to keep it in. A full tank doesn’t keep it running as long as you might expect, at up to six-and-a-half minutes, but you can top it up at any time without stopping work. The floor can be fairly wet after mopping, and it uses up to 1,947W while steaming up.Power:1,900WMaximum stream pressure:3.5 barWater tank capacity:1 litreCable length:4mDimensions:24 x 36 x 25cm (WLH)Weight:3.1kgMaximum power consumption (tested):1,974W = 48.96p an hour£160 at Argos£160 at CurrysBest combination cleaner:Vax Steam Fresh Total HomeView image in fullscreenToo many combi steam cleaners end up as a compromise, with a handheld steam module that’s too long and cumbersome, which then transforms into a chunky, heavy mop. Not so with the Vax Steam Fresh Total Home, where the handheld bit slots into the body of the mop, detaching easily when you need to do some closeup cleaning. An array of brushes, scrapers and pads makes it an extremely versatile cleaner, with a hose and nozzles for getting into tight spaces.Why we love itIt’s a very effective steam mop, with a steam boost feature on the mop head that sends out great gusts of stream to melt through dried-on dirt. It worked through our test spills in seconds without any worries. The handheld unit is removable from the mop and tackled every sink and shower cleaning job we set it to in style, with a variable steam control and a separate tank for detergent if you want fresh smells and a sparkling clean. It takes more than a minute to get ready to steam and another 12 to 15 seconds to get a decent head of steam going, but it’ll then keep going for nine to 10 minutes without a refill.It’s a shame that …the triangular shape mop head is fairly chunky and, while it gets into the corners, it’s a struggle cleaning under low furniture. It can also be tricky to attach and remove the accessory hose. At a maximum 1,428W power draw, it uses more energy than more basic steam mops and combi cleaners.Power:1,600WMaximum stream pressure:not specifiedWater tank capacity:260mlCable length:8mDimensions:30 x 31 x 116cm (WLH)Weight:4.63kgMaximum power consumption (tested):1,428W = 35.41p an hour£160 at Argos£158 at AmazonThe best robot vacuums to keep your home clean and dust free, tested by our expertRead moreBeststeam mop:Vileda Steam Mop PlusView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart AndrewsDespite stiff competition from Shark and Black+Decker, this was the best straight steam mop I tested. Once you clip the handle, steamer and mop head together, it all becomes one very solid unit. It’s easy to remove the twist-off cap and fill the integral tank with the water jug provided. A dial just above switches between minimum, medium and maximum steam settings. Meanwhile, the wedge-shaped mop head attaches through a ball joint that makes it easy to manoeuvre around kitchens, utility rooms and bathrooms.Why we love itIt takes just 17 seconds to heat up and about 30 seconds more to get a really good steam going, but once it’s going there’s plenty of hot vapour coming through to remove gunge from tiles or vinyl. As a result, the Vileda swiped through our dried-on mud and ketchup patches with minimal elbow grease. The variable steam settings give you masses of steam when you need it or not when you don’t, and I also liked the clear indicators. It’s also good at freshening up stained and dirty carpets with the aid of the attachable plastic glider.It’s a shame that …it’s one of the more power-thirsty steam mops, using about 1,585W while it’s heating up. The head is also a little wide to fit in some tight spaces, although trying again from a different angle usually helps – I’d recommend holding the handle near the floor.Power:1,550WMaximum stream pressure:not specifiedWater tank capacity:400mlCable length:6mDimensions:27 x 21 x 122cm (WLH)Weight:2.1kgMaximum power consumption (tested):1,585W = 39.4p an hour£74.99 at Vileda£74.99 at AmazonBest for really grimy floors:Shark S8201UK Steam and ScrubView image in fullscreenThe Steam and Scrub is a steam mop with a difference. Instead of the normal static mop head with a microfibre towel pad, it packs in a pair of motorised heads, rotating at speeds of up to 150RPM to scrub away at your floor. This not only gives you extra cleaning power while you’re steam cleaning but also a bit more oomph for cleaning wooden or composite floors, where serious steaming might do damage. There are three different speed settings for the scrubbing mops, and squeezing the trigger on the handle calls in healthy blasts of the hot misty stuff.Why we love itThere’s not much in the way of grot, gunge or grime that will withstand the steaming, scrubbing action and a spin on the tiled floor of a muddy utility room showcased its awesome dirt-lifting power. It’s an incredibly solid-feeling mop, but the articulated joint makes it feel surprisingly agile, and the steam seems to increase in intensity when you push it repeatedly over a stubborn stain. Shark throws in an extra pair of mop pads and it feels like it will keep steaming forever. Even after 12-and-a-half minutes of cleaning, it still had nearly half a tank full to go.It’s a shame that …the motor and rotating heads make it bulkier than your average steam mop, which can be a problem when you’re trying to get into corners or slip it under a freestanding bathroom cabinet. The LED headlights mean you can at least see where you’re going, though. Sometimes the rotary action seems to spread a dirty mess around rather than just mop it up. If so, a second pass usually does the trick.Power:1,120WMaximum stream pressure:not specifiedWater tank capacity:350mlCable length:5.18mDimensions:22 x 38 x 122cm (WLH)Weight:3.4kgMaximum power consumption (tested):1,122W = 27.83p an hour£160 at Argos£159 at AmazonBest budget handheld cleaner:Bissell SteamShotView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart AndrewsThis lightweight, handheld steam cleaner is anything but a toy. It looks a little like a kettle, with a nozzle at the front and a large screw-on cap to keep the steam under pressure. It also comes with a wide range of brushes, scrapers and pads, which you can attach directly to the unit or through the supplied extension hose. That means that while it’s no good for cleaning floors, it’s great for cleaning just about everything else, and much easier to store when it’s not in use than full-size cleaners.Why we love itFor all its diminutive proportions, the SteamShot can produce a good head of steam. The handheld design and different accessories make it surprisingly versatile; I found it brilliant for cleaning showers, ovens and bathroom sinks where bigger cleaners were a pain to wrangle. While you can’t refill the tank until the unit has cooled down, I could get nearly 12 minutes of cleaning with it filled to max, and it cleaned up dried-on ketchup, jam and pancake mixture in no time. And it’s cheap to boot.It’s a shame that …you need to wait a good 2mins 40secs before the unit gets hot enough to steam, and it gets a bit wearing holding down the trigger while you clean. I also found that it tended to tip over if left sitting if there was an attachment on the end of the hose.Power:1,050WMaximum stream pressure:4.5 barWater tank capacity:360mlCable length:4.8mDimensions:24 x 13 x 22cm (WLH)Weight:1.36kgMaximum power consumption (tested):1,006W = 25p an hour£50 at Dunelm£56.49 at CurrysThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Solid with plenty of cleaning power’: the Black+Decker FSM13E1.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsBeldray Titanium 14-in-1View image in fullscreenBest for:a budget all-rounderAs the name suggests, this combi cleaner works as a steam mop and a handheld steam cleaner, with all the nozzles and brushes you could want for cleaning floors, worktops and windows, and getting into sinks and dingy corners of the kitchen. There’s also a special attachment for steaming upholstery and fabrics, while the mop head has a clever flexible hinge to work into tight spots and make floor cleaning easier.It didn’t make the final cut because …as a handheld steamer, it feels long and slightly awkward. I also didn’t find it as effective on the floors as the specialist steam mops. It’s very cheap and a decent all-rounder, but feels like a compromise.Power:1,300W;maximum stream pressure:not specified;water tank capacity:350ml;cable length:5m;dimensions:30 x 17 x 111cm (WLH);weight:3.2kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,215W = 30.13p an hour£55 at Dunelm£44.99 at Robert Dyasskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It also has a special VapoHydro mode that combines steam with a quick jet of hot water, removing dirt and washing it away in one stroke. Whether you’re cleaning mud, food spills or dried-on shampoo residue, this beast makes it all look easy. It’s also a great choice for larger homes with a lot of hard flooring, thanks to a massive, removable water tank that you can refill whenever you need to–no need to wait for it to cool down, as you need to with some other models.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s a bit too big, heavy and expensive for most households, and the SC3 EasyFix Extra has more accessories and ample power at a lower price. It’s relatively slow to get a good head of steam ready for cleaning – almost three minutes from a cold start – and it needs more than 2,000W to turn the water into red-hot vapour. Buy it if you need a powerhouse cleaner, but most people won’t need to spend this much.Power:2,250W;maximum stream pressure:4.2 bar;water tank capacity:1.5 litre;cable length:6m;dimensions:30 x 44 x 31cm (WLH);weight:6kg;maximum power consumption (tested):2,012W = 49.90p an hour£429.99 at KärcherVax Steam Fresh Combi ClassicView image in fullscreenBest for:a good-value combi cleanerThe cheaper of the two Vax cleaners on test is basically a trimmed-down version of the Steam Fresh Total Home. It lacks the extension pipe and the full range of accessories, the variable steam settings and the mop’s Steam Boost feature. It’s still quick to heat, ready to steam in about 30 seconds, and works well as both a steam mop and a handheld cleaner, partly because it doesn’t change much from the Total Home’s winning design.It didn’t make the final cut because …it came close, but the Total Home’s flexibility and additional accessories mean it’s worth paying the extra if you can. With no Steam Boost, it takes a bit more effort to get through hardened gunk, and it still needs plenty of power (1,437W) while it’s building up steam.Power:1,600W;maximum stream pressure:not stated;water tank capacity:260ml;cable length:7m;dimensions:31 x 30 x 116cm (WLH);weight:3.7kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,473W = 36.53p an hour£90 at Argos£89.99 at VaxBlack+Decker FSM13E1View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart AndrewsBest for:a basic steam mopThis 1,300W steam mop was a real contender, nearly stealing the Vileda Steam Mop Plus’s spot. It’s solid and has plenty of cleaning power, getting through our ketchup and coffee spills with ease, and only struggling a little to swish through the dried-on mud. It’s quick to get a decent steam going, at just under 30 seconds, and the mop head is fairly manoeuvrable when you’re trying to clean around your appliances, baths and cabinets.It didn’t make the final cut because …the mop head is unusually wide at 29cm, and I found the water tank tricky to fill through its narrow hole, particularly with no jug provided in the box. The Black+Decker also leaves the floor fairly damp after mopping, and the cable is slightly too short. It’s a decent mop at a bargain price, but the Vileda is better.Power:1,300W;maximum stream pressure:not specified;water tank capacity:380ml;cable length:4.8m;bodydimensions:20 x 11 x 70cm (WLH);weight:2.3kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,354W = 33.58p an hour£47 at AO£40.95 at MyToolShedShark S1000UK Classic Steam MopView image in fullscreenBest for:easy cleaningShark’s Classic Steam Mop is so simple to use that it doesn’t even have a power button, just a weird pumping mechanism in the handle that emits flurries of steam as you push the mop head back and forth. It’s quick to warm up, dishing out some steam within 30 seconds after pumping, although it took another 30 seconds for the steam to really build up. It has a removable 375ml water tank that clips neatly in and out for refilling.It didn’t make the final cut because …the actual clean is a little light on steam, and I had to work it back and forth a little to destroy dried mud and ketchup. I also found the mop head too wide to get into some areas, and there’s no glider attachment for cleaning carpets. It’s a solid steam mop, but not quite in the Vileda’s league.Power:1,050W;max stream pressure:not specified;water tank capacity:375ml;cable length:5.5m;dimensions:31 x 16 x 117cm (WLH);weight:1.8kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,070W = 26.54p an hour£59.99 at B&Q£59.99 at CurrysPolti Vaporetto SV460 DoubleView image in fullscreenBest for:styleThe Vaporetto SV460 Double brings a dash of Italian style to the combi steam mop/cleaner, along with a huge selection of accessories, including brushes, nozzles, pads and a grass scraper. It also gets extra points for bundling two anti-limescale filter cartridges, with one already installed in the tank. You can get a good 15 minutes plus of cleaning from a refill, and the mop head does a solid job of clearing up stubborn grease, dirt and grime.It didn’t make the final cut because …even with the handle and mop head removed, the steamer unit is too cumbersome for serious handheld use, and I found it tricky to attach the extension pipe or other accessories, with some coming loose from their moorings during use. It puts out plenty of hot steam, but the two Vax cleaners work better overall.Power:1,500W;max stream pressure:not specified;water tank capacity:300ml;cable length:7.5m;dimensions:32 x 20 x 112cm (WLH);weight:2.4kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,417W = 35.14p an hour£120.99 at Robert Dyas£129 at CurrysRussell Hobbs Steam & Clean RHSM1001-GView image in fullscreenBest for:storing smallRussell Hobbs’ compact steam mop is extremely light and very easy to push around, and it’s almost as easy to disassemble if you need to put it away and have limited space. It’s ready to steam in just over 30 seconds, and it dishes out steam automatically as you work it around the floor. This is the cheapest steam mop on test, and it still throws in a glider attachment for your carpets.It didn’t make the final cut because …the steel shaft that connects the handle to the mop head feels rattly, and never quite seems to be firmly in position. You need to use a bit of elbow grease to shift dry mud or ketchup, and the mop head doesn’t have the flexibility found on the Black+Decker, Sharp and Vileda steam mops. While the low price may be tempting, you can have a better mop for not much more.Power:1,450W;maximum stream pressure:not specified;water tank capacity:380ml;cable length:5m;dimensions:30 x 15 x 117cm (WLH);Weight:2.3kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,290W = 31.99p an hour£29.99 at Robert Dyas£29.99 at CurrysWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenGo straight for a steam mop if you plan to use your device mostly on tiled or vinyl floors.Photograph: Prostock-Studio/Getty Images/iStockphotoSteam cleaners v steam mopsBefore you buy any steam mop or cleaner, there’s one big question you need to answer: what are you looking to clean? If the answer is tiled or vinyl floors and nothing else, go straight for a steam mop. They’re usually cheaper, designed specifically for that job and often have some key advantages, like a larger water tank or a lighter weight. However, if you’re looking for something that can clean all around the kitchen and bathroom, then you’ll need to look at a steam cleaner or a hybrid/combination unit.Steam cleaners look like old-fashioned cylinder vacuum cleaners, with a module containing the water tank and steam chamber linked to a handle via a flexible tube. You then attach a tube and mop head to the handle or any nozzles, brushes or scrapers provided. The hybrid cleaners work more like a steam mop, but with the handle and mop head removable so that you can connect accessories directly for handheld use. In theory, this gives you the best of both worlds, but you’ll have a smaller water tank, less power than on a normal steam cleaner and more bulk than with the average steam mop.Features to look out forBeyond that, it’s worth looking at the power and capacity. Generally speaking, the more power the steam cleaner uses to heat the water, the more hot steam it can produce, giving you big, hearty blasts of steam rather than the occasional weedy puff. This comes at a cost, though, in that it’ll use water faster and also burn through more energy while in use. This also explains why the more powerful steam cleaners need a higher-capacity water tank. Once this runs dry, you’ll need to refill it, and in some cases, this means waiting for the cleaner to cool down. Luckily, more and more steam cleaners are fitting removable tanks or allowing you to fill up quickly while you’re on the job.Don’t forget about the practicalities. Having a longer cable can save you from fiddling with mains extension cables, particularly when you’re cleaning in a hallway or bathroom where you might not have an accessible mains socket nearby. Some steam mops are easier to handle than others, with clever articulated joints on the mop head to help you reach every spot on the floor, and the size and shape of the mop head can also have a big impact on how easy it is to get into tight corners, and how long it takes you to get larger spaces sparkling clean.With steam cleaners and combination models, you should also check through the accessories provided. If you’re going to need a window scraper or brushes to scour the inside of your oven, then it makes sense to buy a model with those bundled in. It’s also worth checking if spares are available, as it’s possible to wear through the brushes or microfibre mop-head pads within a year or so.Floor types you can (and can’t) steam mopIt’s worth noting that not all floors are suitable for steam cleaning. Hard-tiled floors and vinyl floors won’t pose any problems, and many composite or laminate floors will also be fine. Sadly, some older wooden floors – like parquet – and some vinyl tile floors, like Amtico or Karndean, can be damaged by steam cleaning, as the materials or adhesives can be affected. If in doubt, check the manufacturer’s instructions before you clean away.Stuart Andrews is a freelance journalistwith more than three decades of experience in computing and consumer tech.

An operation restored my appetite for lifeEating with my family was a source of joy and pleasure until illness ravaged my digestive system. After my stoma was fitted, everything tasted amazing againCarys GreenWed 12 Mar 2025 02.55 EDTShareGrowing up, I always loved food. On Sundays, I’d ask for seconds of my roast dinner. My gran would bake cakes every weekend, which I would drown in custard. I can still remember how the chocolate digestive biscuits I’d eat when I got in from school tasted, how satisfying it was to dip them in my tea as I chatted with my dad about my day.Foodbrought us together as a family and it was something I always relished.Then I got sick. I was 12 when I first displayed symptoms of Crohn’s disease. I started getting unbearable pain in my stomach and going to the toilet a bit more. Then a lot more. And I stopped feeling hungry. My weight dropped three stone (19kg), my periods stopped and I had no energy, but it was my sudden lack of appetite that I missed the most. Food had always been a source of joy; I’d watch cookery shows and cry, remembering how much pleasure I used to take from eating. Now, my body rejected everything except supplement drinks that pretended to have flavours like lime and orange but always just tasted like bile. I was fading away and it was terrifying.At 16, I had my large intestine completely removed in the hope that it would rid my body of the diseased tissue. But my Crohn’s came back, more savage than ever, just after I turned 18. One day, I fainted as I was walking home from university, my body so weak it was barely functioning. I fainted again on holiday in New York. I was constantly in pain, unable to venture far from the bathroom. I was just existing, drifting from one moment to the next. Something needed to change.Recovery was difficult. My stomach became infected and the wound reopened. I was housebound for monthsWhen I was 23, doctors decided I needed to have a panproctocolectomy and permanent ileostomy, where the rectum, colon and anus are completely removed and a stoma is built out of your small intestine, which delivers waste to a bag attached to your stomach. This is often carried out in two separate surgeries, but it was felt I wasn’t strong enough to undergo general anaesthetic more than once. The recovery was difficult; my stomach became infected and the wound running alongside the stoma, where the surgeons gained access to the intestines during the operation, reopened. I was housebound for months.When I was discharged after two weeks in hospital, I was sore, uncomfortable and incredibly weak. But back at home, I was allowed to start eating normally again. For my first meal, I chose a jacket potato with cheese; it tasted amazing.While my body healed, I was advised to rest – and to eat. It was the best directive I could have been given. My days at home became structured around food: a hearty breakfast; elevenses; lunch; then – after an afternoon nap – dinner, sometimes followed by supper. My parents were delighted to see me eating again and enjoying meals that I had missed for so long.The more I ate, the stronger I became and the more I healed. Gone were the supplement drinks; instead, I devoured roast dinners, custard, pasta, pizza, ice-cream. My life was restored, along with my appetite. I could drive, go out with friends, and sit through an entire film at the cinema without having to dash to the bathroom.View image in fullscreenMaking up for lost time … Carys Green after her operation.I first met my husband when I was 24 and still adjusting to my new life with a stoma. I remember nervously telling him about it, not knowing how he would react. He couldn’t have been more understanding. One of the things we came to love doing together was cooking and trying new foods. We’d make our own pizzas, try out baking recipes and enjoy discovering new places to eat. We once tried to make our own pretzels, which went disastrously wrong, but we ate them anyway.Over the years, scar tissue has built up around my stoma, meaning that my diet has become a little more restricted. I can no longer eat chips, bacon, raw fruit or vegetables due to the narrowing in my intestines around my stoma – a list that may grow as time goes on. But there’s still so much I do enjoy eating. Sixteen years after my surgery, I remain grateful for the ways it gave me my life back.When I was a child and I went out for dinner with my gran, she would always order two desserts, because sugar was rationed during the war. Now that she could have all the sugar she wanted, she didn’t want to waste a moment. I understand that mindset now. Having lost my ability to eat and enjoy food, I haven’t wanted to take it for granted since it has returned. I understand the importance of a balanced diet, but I never deny myself a treat. My body did that to me for long enough.Always on My Mind by Carys Green is out now (Harvill Secker, £16.99). To support the Guardian and the Observer, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Take your average supermarket bhaji: sadly stodgy and soggy, when it ought to be crisp, its continued popularity is a triumph of hope over experience. If you want to enjoy these beloved Indian snacks at their best, you’ll either need to go out to a restaurant … or make them yourself.Prep20 minCook8 minMakes82 medium onions1 small knob fresh ginger2 garlic cloves1-2 green finger chillies1 small bunch coriander2 fresh curry leaves(optional)1 tsp cumin seeds¼ tsp fennel seeds1 tbsp ghee, or butter60g gram flour30g rice flour¼ tsp salt½ tsp turmericJuice of ¼ lemonNeutral oil, for frying1 A note on the onionsStart by peeling, trimming and thinly slicing the onions into half-moons; a mandoline would be helpful here, but, if you have one, please use the guard! The pink onions common in India are sweeter than our own brown variety, so feel free to use red onions or a mixture of the two, if you prefer.2 Prep the aromatics …View image in fullscreenPeel a little skin off the ginger with a teaspoon to reveal the flesh, then finely grate – you need about two teaspoons’ worth, so remove more skin off the knob of ginger as necessary. Peel and finely chop the garlic, removing any green sprouts. Trim, seed and finely chop the chillies; use a milder variety, or even an eighth of a green pepper, if you prefer, or substitute chilli powder to taste.3 … and the herb leavesView image in fullscreenFinely chop the coriander and the curry leaves, if using – the latter are widely available in large supermarkets these days, as well as in specialist south Asian food shops. If you find yourself with more than you can use up in a couple of weeks, they freeze well; pick the leaves off the stems, then put them in a freezer bag and expel as much air as possible before sealing and freezing.4 Toast the spicesView image in fullscreenPut a small frying pan on a medium-high heat, toast the cumin and fennel seeds until fragrant, then tip into a mortar. Melt the ghee or butter in the same pan while you roughly crush the seeds (you could also put the seeds in a bowl and crush with the base of a mug or glass); there’s no need to pulverise them completely.5 Start the batterView image in fullscreenPut the gram (chickpea) and rice flours in a large bowl with the salt, turmeric and roughly ground spices (and chilli powder, if using), and whisk to combine.View image in fullscreenAdd the melted ghee and lemon juice, followed by just enough cold water to bring the mix to the consistency of double cream; you’ll probably need about six tablespoons of water in total, but add it only gradually.6 Finish the bhaji batterView image in fullscreenStir in the onions, ginger, garlic, chillies and herbs until well mixed and coated.Put the oil in a deep-fat fryer, or in a deep pan or wok to fill it by no more than a third, then heat it to 180C; if you don’t have a probe, test by dropping in a little bit of the batter – if it sizzles immediately, then floats, the oil is ready. But beware: if the oil is too cold, your bhajis will be greasy, and if too hot, they will burn.7 Shape the bhajisWhile the oil is heating, put a bowl of cold water and a plate lined with kitchen towel near the hob, and turn on the oven to low. Once the oil is up to temperature, wet your hands and shape tablespoon-sized amounts of the bhaji mix into balls.Drop these very carefully into the hot oil, being careful not to splash yourself or to overcrowd the pan, so work in batches.8 Fry the bhajisView image in fullscreenCook the bhajis for about four minutes in total, turning occasionally, until crisp and golden all over, then scoop out with a slotted spoon, drain briefly on the kitchen towel and put in the oven to keep warm while you cook the next batch, making sure the oil comes back up to temperature first.9 Serving suggestionsView image in fullscreenServe the bhajis as a savoury snack or starter with chutney or pickles. I especially like them with coriander chutney: whizz 100g fresh coriander with a small green chilli, a tablespoon of grated ginger, the juice of two limes and two tablespoons of neutral oil, until smooth. Add salt and sugar to taste, and maybe a splash of water to loosen, if necessary.Explore more on these topicsIndian food and drinkFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodVegetablesSnacksStarterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Every day, it feels as if social media finds new ways to let us know how old we are. Just joined TikTok? You’re probably a millennial. Wear yourhair in a centre parting? Must be gen Z. Paid off your mortgage – or even have one?OK boomer.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This generational divide is particularly strong, it seems, when it comes to jeans. Look around you and you have probably noticed that younger people prefer to wear them low-rise, long-hemmed and ultra-baggy, while millennials wear them high on the waist and high off the ground – AKA the “mom jean”. TikTok is full of videos of young people mocking their elders for their jeans choices. Now even millennials are coming after their generation’s commitment to the style. “My fellow millennials,” begins a video from TikTokerIndigo Tshai Williams-Brunton, “Just completely stop with the mom jeans.”So how would it look if the generations swapped jeans for the day? Could a millennial cope with a pavement-dragging hemline? Could a gen Zer deal with the aching cold of a bare ankle? Could this bridge the great generational jeans divide? To paraphrase a saying: before you criticise someone, walk a mile in their jeans.MFMorwenna Ferrier, millennialView image in fullscreen‘I look stocky, tent-like and, well, how I used to as a teen. Maybe that is the point’ … Morwenna Ferrier in gen Z’s preferred style.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianLike many women my age, I only wear one type of jean: high waist, with a stiff carrot-shaped leg and a hem three inches above the floor. They are called barrel leg jeans and are currently John Lewis’s bestselling jean shape; neither snug nor straight, they are a halfway house for those of us with needs that are tricky to reconcile – I don’t want tight jeans but I need a bit of, well, tightness. To quoteNick Cave on his clothes, “I like to be kind of kept.”When I get dressed, I have to think about what I can run to my son’s school in without tripping up – with a waistband that can sufficiently contain my diastasis recti (postpartum abdominal separation). Gen Z’s jeans, with their one-inch flies and pooling hems, are surely geared towards the younger, fitter and child-free.Emma, my younger colleague, chose these jeans for me (they are by Citizens of Humanity and£320 at Selfridges;M&S does a similar stylefor £45) because it’s what people her age wear. But the legs are wide – 13in, slightly larger than an LP. I’m wearing shoes too, not that you would know.More than £300 is obviously a lot of money, which is why you should always go for secondhand jeans where possible (the beauty of both trends is that you can source these styles from actual 1990s and 2000s denim). If you do go new, however, jeans are worth forking out for – not just because cheaper denim is one of the most resource-intensive (water, chemicals and energy) items of clothing but also in terms of cost per wear. What price something you can wear for ever?View image in fullscreen‘Gen Z’s jeans, with their one-inch flies and pooling hems, are surely geared towards the younger, fitter and child-free.’Photograph: Valentina Frugiuele/Getty ImagesThe denim is incredibly comfy but even that comes at a price – they weigh 900g. Thankfully, spring has sprung. Like many millennials (and those who lived through the 70s before me), I can replay the hell of a damp wide hem like it was yesterday.Memories of sixth form come flooding back. Our school had a loose uniform policy, but we mostly wore flares. This trend burned so hard in the early 00s that our parents were sent a letter announcing they had been banned. Did I stop wearing mine? I did not. Rather, I persuaded my mother to sew Velcro strips down the calves, creating two flaps, which meant I could turn them into “drainpipes” when I went into class.The return of the oversized clothes of the 90s and 00s has been growing in fashion for almost a decade (longer, if you ask Cos or Armani) but, since the pandemic, they have become almost regulation. Gaping legs, drawstring waists, easy shoes. Once our thighs tasted freedom, how could we possibly go back?I rather like a baggy style when it comes to other trousers, and still wear my loose maternity jeans at the weekend, but lately high street shops from M&S to Arket and Selfridges have deemed extra-large trousers to be less a trend and more the industry standard. “We see clear distinctions in how different age groups approach denim and the loose and baggy fits are dominating,” says Anne-Catherine Lepas, vice-president of merchandising at Levi’s Europe.Jeans can and do define an era, though, and if you follow fashion, you will know that the ultra-baggy grunge look of the mid-90s was followed by flares, then – thanks tothe Strokes’ arrival in the early 00s – skinnies, only to be replaced by the “mom”, “dad” and “boyfriend” styles (all roughly the same thing). Still, unlike most other items of clothing, almost everyone owns a pair of jeans, so they can also transcend even the most tenacious trends (Levi’s 501s are rarely out of style).The tricky thing with this latest iteration is styling them. I lean into the looseness by wearing an oversized shirt hanging out – I’m told the French/millennial tuck (half in) is passé. I look stocky, tent-like and, well, how I used to as a teen. Maybe that is the point.But after a few hours, I have never known comfort like it. I’m just not sure it’s very dignified to be aggressively on trend at my age. On my way back to the office after lunch, I spot a group of teen girls wearing jeans of such size that they have to physically hold them up as they walk past. They are still preferable to skinny jeans, though. Only a fool would follow that canary back into the trend mine.Emma Loffhagen, gen ZView image in fullscreen‘I don’t think this style looks good on anyone’ … Emma Loffhagen in the millennial ankle-grazer.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianBy the time I was coming of age in the mid-2010s, millennials were the fashion power brokers and only one silhouette mattered: skinny was king. Specifically, the supertight and ultra-high-waisted Topshop Joni jeans. Sitting down after a light meal? Forget it. It was this style, combined with the emergence of athleisure, that created the nightmarish blip in the fashion matrix that was the “jegging”: leggings designed to look like jeans. Usually paired with a ballet pump or an Ugg boot and a Paul’s Boutique bag, the jegging was the antithesis of high fashion.Since then, TikTok’s rapid cycling of microtrends combined with gen Z’s ruthless humour has created a fraught dividing line when it comes to denim. In recent years,a spate of viral videosfromgen Z creators pilloried millennials for their skinny jeans, which in turn prompteda backlash from ardent skinny-jean defenders. Then they came formillennials’ high-waisted mom jeans.While I haven’t gone full Y2K hyper-low waist like some of my gen Z peers, I usually opt for a mid-rise and a baggier fit that I can comfortably sit down in without feeling as if I’m being sliced in half. I often buy jeans a size up and wear them with a belt. Morwenna, however, tells me that her jeans are exclusively high-waisted – and that she tends to go a size down for a more cinched look.The pair Morwenna picked for me were aPaige high-rise barrel leg style(£280 at Selfridges;Jigsaw does a similar style for £95). They are so high-waisted, in fact, that I counted no fewer than five buttons on the crotch. They also sat far too high above the ankle for my liking – I’m not into a hem that drags along the ground, but these are so short it feels as if they were made only with an ankle boot in mind (very 2010s). I think they add about 10 years to my perceived age. Perhaps it’s a case of a bad workman blaming his tools, but I just don’t think this style looks good on anyone.I wonder whether this generational fashion division is more a reflection of beauty standards than style. My late teenage and early adult years coincided with the nascent body positivity movement, whereas older generations might still lean towards so-called “flattering” styles that “hold it all in”.View image in fullscreenNot as drastically different as the internet would have us believe … Ferrier and Loffhagen wearing their normal style of jeans.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThis could also be why skinny jeans appear to be making a high fashion comeback for 2025. The silhouette has appearedon autumn/winter 2024 and spring/summer 2025 catwalks, but like many gen Z-led trends, much of the renaissance has come from the bottom up. In January, TikToker and gen Z sibyl Alix Earle, who has more than 7 million followers on the platform, launched a pair of skinny jeans in collaboration with fashion brand Frame, prompting a viral trend for social media creators to demonstrate how they’re styling them.“Those huge, oversized silhouettes have become a bit tired in my opinion,” says gen Z fashion Instagrammer Jake Denton. “I blame the return of skinny models, Ozempic and indie sleaze.” Maybe so, but I personally won’t be dusting off the Topshop Jonis anytime soon.Despite what social media tells us about intergenerational hostilities, when Morwenna and I exchanged denim, we were pretty receptive to each other’s styles. The waistband up to the bra line isn’t for me – but in general, we were surprised to discover that our styles aren’t as drastically different as the internet would have us believe.So to millennials, I say: trying to play catch-up with mercurial trends is exhausting. You are better off wearing what you feel comfortable in, even if a 20-year-old TikToker doesn’t approve.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The late winter sky is like a watercolour: soft blue and grey clouds layer together, with a sweeping gradient of yellow verging from tobacco stain to pale lemon above the distant, bruise-coloured hills. At the viewpoint, I look out over Oslo and listen for a scream.View image in fullscreenThe Scream.Photograph: Halvor Bjørngård /Rena LiIn 1892,Edvard Munchtook a walk in this same parkas the sun was setting. Recording the experience in his diary, he wrote that he heard “a great and infinite scream through nature”. The experience became the basis of his most enduring painting.Nobody knows if the scream was real – there was a hospital nearby – or imagined. Today, all I hear are the delighted squeals of children playing on the hillside, amid joggers and walkers traversing the leaf-strewn footpaths of the park.As the National Portrait Gallery holdsa new exhibitionof Munch’s portraits, I’m in Oslo walking in the footsteps of the artist. Munch is inescapable: atClarion Hotel Oslo, where I’m staying, an Andy Warhol version of The Scream graces the lobby – the pop artist was a huge fan – and a photograph of Marina Abramović’s interpretation greets me at breakfast.From the viewpoint, as the sky falls in a blanket around me, the city’s prime Munch attraction is clearly visible. While the shapes of the islands and borders of the Oslofjord are recognisably the same as those in the background of The Scream, theMunch Museum– known as simply Munch – stands out amid thenew modern buildings on the Bjørvika waterfront. The top of its striking tower is tilted, so said the architects, to look like it’s bowing to the city of Oslo, the inspiration for many of Munch’s works. Inside it, my guide, Sid, takes me on a tour of the extensive collection.As well as The Scream, other highlights of the Munch Museum include a vast room showing sketches of the Aula paintings, considered his masterworks“Munch was unique in how he captured a shift in generations and perception,” Sid says. “He’s documenting humanity at a time when belief and institutions are collapsing.”I’m struck by how Munch’s work, much of it over 100 years old, is still relevant today: from his ability to paint the emotional landscape of his sitters with a particular focus on mental health, to his belief that there was no separation between humankind and nature.View image in fullscreenThe Edvard Munch museum.Photograph: Sergio Delle Vedove/AlamyIn the gallery, three different versions of The Scream are displayed in a dimly lit rotunda for 30 minutes at a time, to preserve their colours. One of them has water-damage in the bottom-left corner: this is one of the stolen Screams, taken by daring art thieves during a daylight robbery in 2004 and damaged during storage (it was returned in 2006). In theNational Museum, another version of The Scream is on display – he made eight in total – under the watchful eyes of two security guards. Another version of the painting was stolen from this gallery in 1994, when police attention was otherwise occupied by the Lillehammer Winter Olympics. That one was only absent for 12 weeks.Other highlights of the Munch Museum include a vast room showing sketches of theAulapaintings, a series of giant artworks Munch made for Oslo University’s ceremonial hall. They depict an abstract sun shattered into multicoloured rays, a nurturing mother on a rocky shoreline and a fisherman teaching a young boy, and are considered his masterworks. When the Nazis invaded Norway, these paintings were hidden in a mine. Munch’s work featured on theNazis’ degenerate art list– modernist and avant garde art was considered depraved; any deviation from the norm, any challenge to the status quo, was punished. After the war, these monumental works were restored to pride of place at theuniversity hall, which is open to the public one Saturday a month from February-May.View image in fullscreenRamme beach, close to Munch’s house.Photograph: Laura HallThe next day, I take a trip toRamme, where Munch painted two of these works. A 30-minute train ride and short taxi journey from Oslo, it’s a haven for Munch lovers. You canwalk around his houseand outdoor studio and along the beach. There’s something about the sound of the sea, the rocky shoreline of the Oslofjord and the apple trees that give a great sense of calm. For Munch, plagued by ill health and mental health issues all his life, that was the idea.I walk past apple trees to a rugged shoreline littered with mussel shells where interpretive boards show Munch's paintings set against viewsHe bought thewhite househere in 1910, which remarkably is rented out to holidaymakers in summer, and kept it until his death in 1944. Inside, the carefully restored bright yellow walls and white lace curtains served as backdrops for many of his portraits. I walk past the apple trees to a rugged shoreline littered with mussel shells where interpretive boards show his paintings set against the views.Back in Oslo, I take a walking tour of the livelyGrünerløkkaquarter. Munch’s family lived in several different buildings in the area, marked with plaques, and it’s in one of these that he set one of his most moving paintings, The Sick Child, inspired by his sister’s death from tuberculosis. All the colours of life are here: vintage shops and hipster cafes line up along the edge of a small central park, bright blue trams streak by and the city’s young and creative walk around, as punk-haired baristas make drinks atTim Wendelboe’scoffee shop. I feel I could walk past the subject of one of my favourite Munch paintings, Madonna, a raven-haired woman in a red beret.Before I leave, I pay my respects at his grave atOur Saviour’s cemetery. I wonder what he might have created were he alive today. According to walking tour guide Linda, his love of self-portraits would mean only one thing: “He would be a selfie king.”Laura travelled to Oslo as a guest ofVisitOSLOand stayed atClarion Hotel Oslo(doubles from £147).

On the last night ofParis fashion week, Kate Moss sat next to Catherine Deneuve, both in black tailoring, sheer blouses and high heels. Pedro Almodóvar and Rossy de Palma smiled for the cameras, while Hailey Bieber and Charli XCX kept their shades on.Saint Laurent’s daytime silhouette this season is an inverted triangle, with broad shoulders narrowing to slim skirts and sheer tights. For evening, it flipped upside down, with slinky sweaters and grand ball skirts. The colours were of cocktail ring gemstones: emerald, sapphire, ruby and garnet.There was leopard print, naturally, in silk blouses with a silicone gloss. With slicked-back hair, shards of rock crystal jewellery, hands nonchalantly in pockets – nothing so mundane as a handbag here – the models oozed aloof Parisian chic, sauntering easily in spike heels to the voice of Nina Simone.Designer Anthony Vaccarello said before the show he wanted the look to be clean, no ornamentation, no decoration. “Simplicity of silhouette – as if created with a few pencil strokes – has defined the Saint Laurent ideal.”Under Vaccarello, the house of Saint Laurent has its sights set bigger than fashion. Not content with being one of the leading names in style, the company has ambitions to be a cultural powerhouse. This show was moved from its usual slot at the beginning of Paris fashion week to the end to avoid a clash with the Oscars, because Saint Laurent Productions is now a fully – fledged movie studio, producing the multi Oscar-nominated Emilia Pérez.View image in fullscreenModels present the Saint Laurent winter 2025-2026 collection show in Paris.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersThe fate of Emilia Peréz was torpedoed halfway through award season by the disclosure of racist tweets by star Karla Sofia Gascón, but this has not deterred Saint Laurent, which has also produced Parthenope, a new film by Paolo Sorrentino. Film is seen by Saint Laurent as a platform to amplify its cool image beyond style into the broader culture, and Vaccarello recreated Yves Saint Laurent’s famous 1966 Le Smoking tuxedo jacket for the actor Celeste Dalla Porta to wear on screen. A Saint Laurent-backed project with the director Jim Jarmusch is also in the works.Saint Laurent’s cultural ambitions are also reflected in an ambitious revamp of its Paris flagship boutique in collaboration with the Judd Foundation, which promotes the work of the late American artist Donald Judd. Furniture by Judd is for sale at the Paris store, displayed alongside Saint Laurent evening gowns and handbags, while an exhibition of Judd’s woodcuts and prints is on display on an upper floor. The house has also diversified into the restaurant industry, with the opening of a Paris branch of LA’s Sushi Park.Explore more on these topicsSaint LaurentParis fashion weekFashion weeksFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

I assume that he Googled it and landed on a sponsored link for thisfirm, which charges a fee for the top-up mechanism – so a £40 top-up cost my mother £47.56.Based on thecompany’s Trustpilot reviews, she is not the first person this has happened to. The mechanism to activate the top-up appears to involve an ambiguous step that can result in a customer unwittingly triggering a monthly subscription.On Top Up doesn’t notify you when the monthly vouchers are issued. They just sit in an online account – in this case, in her grandson’s.Neither does it send alerts to say they haven’t been activated or expire after two months.Initially the company offered to refund one month but, after we escalated the complaint, it has increased this to a year.I think my mother should be entitled to all her money back.SD,by emailYour mother’s experience of inadvertently being signed up for monthly top-ups is echoed by other customers in the negative reviews that contribute to the firm’s “poor” Trustpilot score.On Top Up pitches itself as a “simple way” to add credit to any mobile phone on any network, but it is a broker and its credits attract a hefty near-20% mark-up, starting at 95p for a £5 top-up.You got On Top Up to increase the refund on offer several times (its standard policy is four months) but in the end threatened a small claims court action. It then offered £1,440 – she had already received £190 from her credit card company, so this is the money back for the top-ups, less the fees – but you felt it was dragging its feet in transferring the money. After a nudge from me, however, it has arrived in your mother’s account.On Top Up says: “Recurring charges only take place if the registered user manually activates the auto top-up feature from their account.” Customers can access their account on its website to turn it off if they wish, it says, adding that your mother’s refund was a “non-obligatory gesture of goodwill”.It is easy to click on the first web link you are presented with when rushing to top-up, and this shows this can result in an expensive error.

Supporters of the Philippines’ former presidentRodrigo Dutertebarely had time to protest beforehe was jetted off to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanityin relation to his country’s so-called “war on drugs”. According to activists, this bloody crackdown has seen as many as 30,000 people killed since 2016.The charges brought against the former leader are the culmination of years of work by activists, lawyers and victims, who documented abuses committed under his government, often at great personal risk. But Duterte arguably would not have been surrendered to The Hague if it weren’t forhis family’s dramatic feud with that of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the current president.The two families were once allies. Marcos Jr ran on a joint ticket with Duterte’s eldest daughter – Sara Duterte, now the vice-president – in the 2022 election,winning a landslide victory. At the time, Marcos Jr, who capitalised on the popularity of the Duterte name, was careful not to criticise Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, and promised not to cooperate with the international criminal court’s continuing investigation.But the Duterte-Marcos marriage of convenience descended into a bitter dispute, with Sara Duterte launching scathing attacks on the president, eventhreatening to dig up the remains of his late father, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, and throw them into the sea.3:19Rodrigo Duterte arrives in The Hague over drug war killings – videoIt was inevitable that the families’ alliance would collapse, according to Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, of the University of thePhilippines. Both sides want their candidate to be elected president in 2028, so, she said: “It’s a fight for the survival of their political families, their dynasties.”Marcos Jr’s public comments about the ICC shifted as tension grew. His government has continued to maintain that it would not assist the court, of which the Philippines is no longer a member, but explained that it would cooperate with any arrest warrant issued via Interpol.Shortly after the plane carrying Duterte took off on Tuesday night, Marcos Jr told reporters: “The arrest that we did today was in compliance with our commitments to Interpol. It just so happened that that came from ICC.”According to Tony La Viña, a lawyer and former dean of the Ateneo de Manila University school of government, the arrest was a “perfect execution” by Marcos Jr’s administration.When the warrant came, “they executed it and within the day they sent Duterte to The Hague, giving no chance for the supreme court to issue a TRO [a temporary restraining order against his arrest]”, he said.View image in fullscreenFerdinand Marcos Jr and Sara Duterte are inaugurated as president and vice-president of the Philippines in Manila in 2022.Photograph: Aaron Favila/APThe Dutertes may now struggle to recover their power. Rodrigo, who has the most political clout, is now outside the Philippines, just as the country gears up for crucial midterm elections in May.Rodrigo Duterte is running to become mayor in the family’s stronghold, Davao, but faces a challenge from an upstart dynasty, which analysts say marks the most significant threat to the Dutertes’ power there in two decades. The former president is still thought likely to win, but it is unclear how he would be able to perform his mayoral duties from The Hague.The mid-term elections are also important because Sara Duterte is due to face an impeachment trial soon after the vote. The family needs its allies to be elected to the senate if she is to avoid being removed as vice-president and prevented from running for president in 2028.Rodrigo Duterte’s supporters have portrayed him as a victim who was denied due process by the vengeful Marcos family, and who has been wrongly handed over to foreigners. The irony of the first claim is not lost on the victims of the war on drugs, many of whom were never given a day in court, but instead gunned down in the streets.“Suddenly they are now using terms that they were laughing at [before],” said Atienza. “They are now calling for people power, they are using terms like rule of law, human rights. It’s really hard to sell.”The battle between the families, and online messaging from both sides, is likely only to intensify. Cleve V Arguelles, the CEO of the public opinion research firm WR Numero Research, said: “It will really be crucial in the coming weeks what kinds of narratives will be offered to the public and how the public will respond.”He added that the Dutertes were fighting to protect their power at a national level and on their home turf. “It’s all at stake now,” he said.Explore more on these topicsRodrigo DutertePhilippinesInternational criminal courtAsia PacificDrugs tradeInternational criminal justiceanalysisShareReuse this content"

Others will turn angry, despondent orsuicidalamid the uncertainty of when they will be allowed to leave such a stark place, where strangers police everything they do.A soccer ball, a T-shirt: teachers scramble to say goodbye to students fleeing under TrumpRead moreThis is not conjecture. It is what happened for years, over and over again, when immigrant families were detained, until the Biden administrationindefinitely suspendedthe practice for undocumented families in 2021, opting instead tosurveil themthrough ankle bracelets, wrist monitors or phone apps. And it is what Donald Trump is inviting now as federal officialsre-operationalizetwo Texas family detention centers, one of which will funnel about$180min annual revenue to the private prison corporation CoreCivic.Already, at leastthree childrenare in custody with their parents. Family detention and theprofitsit brings to the US carceral industry have returned to the country overnight, in a bruising setback for immigrant families and all who care about their wellbeing and rights. Many kids held by the Trump administration will inevitably endure harm. Could this be anothermisguided attemptto deter others from coming to the US?The overwhelming expert consensus is that family detention is neither safe nor just.The American Academy of Pediatricswarnsthat the federal government’s facilities “do not meet the basic standards for the care of children”.A reportfrom the American Bar Association decried the infringement of the “due process right to legal counsel” for detained families.Even the federal government’sadvisory committeewrote that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – which overseesimmigrationenforcement – should follow “the presumption that detention is generally neither appropriate nor necessary for families”.These conclusions have been molded by incidents which occurred during years of tragedy: an attorney who watched as a small child experiencing a medical emergency wasairlifted awaywithout their mother, who wasn’t allowed to join them; parents who lamented how their smileyseven-year-oldturned violent after languishing in custody; ayoung motherwho experienced sexual assault at the hands of a guard;another momwho had to sit by as her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter vomited blood for days.The stories go on and on; there will undoubtedly be more.In fact, the new administration had already started depriving children of their liberty before it officially brought back family detention stateside. It was simply gettingother countriesto do it on American taxpayers’ dime,likely in partto circumventexisting requirementsin the US that protect immigrant kids and limit their time in custody.In recent weeks, flights filled with people of nationalities that are harder to deport because of poor bilateral international relations, such as Iranians, Afghans, Russians and Chinese, havebeen dispatchedto Panama and Costa Rica, nations whose governmentswere pressuredinto acting asmiddle mento hold and then supposedly repatriate hundreds of people – or at least take them off the US government’s hands.Among these deportees have been young children. Two of them cried as theywatchedtheir mother faint during their US deportation flight onboard a military plane. Other kids have gottensickorinjured.The terrified asylum seekers sent to Panama were initially trapped inside a hotel, watched over by armed guards. A 27-year-old Iranian Christian used lipstick toscrawl“Help us” on a window; her conversion from Islam was a crime she could be killed for if forced to return to her country.Another captivewrote “China” on a window and told the New York Times he “would rather jump off a plane than go back” there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are beingforcibly heldin a remoteformer factorythat has faced past criticism for squalid conditions, including portable toilets leaking into people’s makeshift living quarters.And if the Trump administration’s callousness toward migrant children has taken place largely out of sight thousands of miles away in recent weeks, it appears it is about to hit far closer to home. Immigration authorities arereportedlystarting a new enforcement operation within the US to round up families – families who have already built lives across the country and often become pillars of their communities. Government attorneys are seeking warrants to conduct their arrests, and the fact that many of them have not committed crimes does not seem to matter.Ordinary Americans in many parts may soon start to notice that their kids’ classmates have suddenly disappeared into a black box of family detention and deportation – and their taxes are paying for it.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationChildrenUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

In Africa, his administration has even touted the resurrection of coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, to bring energy to the continent.“We’ve had years of western countries shamelessly saying: ‘Don’t develop coal, coal is bad,’” said Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, last week. Such an attitude has been “paternalistic” and counterproductive forAfrica, he added. “That’s just nonsense, 100% nonsense,” Wright said. “Coal transformed our world and made it better.”Wright built on this theme on Monday at theCeraWeek oil industry conferencein Houston, Texas, where he said the world needed more, rather than less, fossil fuels. He also attackedJoe Bidenfor “irrational, quasi-religious policies on climate change” and claimed “there is no physical way” renewables such as solar and wind could replace fossil fuels – a viewdisputedby experts.This vision of a world wedded long-term to fossil fuels could spur greater US backing for drilling in Africa, delighting business interests that claim oil and gas are the answer to bringing power to the 600 million people on the continent who lack electricity.“With President Trump’s rollbacks of restrictions, there will be new opportunities for US investors to engage with Africa’s oil and gas sector,” said Robert Stryk, chair of Stryk Global Diplomacy, a consultancyhelpingthe African Energy Chamber facilitate US-funded oil and gas projects in Africa. “It has the potential to unlock real benefits for African nations. Secretary Wright made a powerful statement. It was a genius move.”View image in fullscreenSections of pipes awaiting installation as part of the east African crude oil pipeline, in Kikuube, Uganda, on 24 October 2023.Photograph: Luke Dray/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesStryk said it was “hypocritical” for western countries to demand Africa forgo fossil fuels after powering their own economies on coal, oil and gas. “Let Africa choose its own destiny,” he said. “People talk about renewables, but it’s hollow. It just keeps people where they are there, which is in poverty.”Scientists have made clear that the climate crisis, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, poses catastrophic risks around the world, particularly in poorer African countries that have emitted a small fraction of planet-heating pollution. Africa is heating upfasterthan the global average and is already suffering fromworsening floods, heatwaves and droughts, with countries therelosingup to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) responding to climate extremes.“One of the transformations caused by American fossil fuels was destroying our previously well-balanced climate and plunging some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in Africa into a life dealing with extreme weather and lost homes and livelihoods,” said Mohamed Adow, founder and director ofPower Shift Africa.“It’s a sign of huge ignorance that the US energy secretary is talking up coal, but it’s also obvious lobbying on behalf of the US fossil fuel companies which backs Republican politicians.”Adow said Africa does require assistance from wealthy countries such as the US to build out renewable energy. However, richer nations have long lagged in providing the required finance and Trump has imposed further cuts,axing an initiativeto help shift developing countries to clean energy,halting American aidto countries vulnerable to extreme weather and pulling the US from theParis climate agreement.“So they have no moral authority to dictate to Africa on the development approach to pursue,” Adow said of the US. “African leaders must choose a path that helps secure energy access and the economic wellbeing of their people. Exacerbating the climate crisis that their people are suffering from would be the opposite of this and undo the development gains of recent years.”While the world is shifting towards cleaner forms of power, albeit too slowly to stave off worsening climate impacts, Trump has sought to entrench the status quo of fossil fuels. The presidentlifteda Biden-era pause on exports of American gas, and Japan and South Korea have expressed interest in investing in an Alaska gas project, in part to avoid the threat of tariffs from Trump.“Japan will soon begin importing historic new shipments of clean American liquefied natural gas (LNG) in record numbers,” the presidentsaid last month. “It’ll be record numbers.”View image in fullscreenA liquefied natural gas export facility in Port Sulphur, Louisiana, on 6 March 2025.Photograph: Kathleen Flynn/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesLast month, Shigeru Ishiba, the Japanese prime minister, met with Trump at the White House and announced plans for Japan to import more LNG from Freeport, Texas.

This highlighted the dangers of the fuel, Rollerson said.Before the meeting between Ishiba and Trump, Rollerson travelled to Japan to meet with officials and encourage them not to make a “deal with the devil”.“I invited the Japanese government to come look at Freeport and see what 57 years of industrial build-out … has done for this city,” he said. “It’s not pretty.”Meanwhile, a deal undernegotiation with Ukrainewould give the US access to the country’s store of minerals, which includes oil and gas but also materials such as graphite, used in batteries. The deal could help reverse a pause Trump has placed on US military support to Ukraine, which has been fighting an invading Russian army since 2022.Ukraine has, even under Russian bombardment,sought to ramp upits clean energy infrastructure. But the new deal could “reverse these advances, potentially forcing our nation back into fossil fuel dependency and external energy control – a devastating setback for a country that has sacrificed so much for its independence”, said Svitlana Romanko, a Ukrainian environmental lawyer and executive director ofRazom We Stand.“Trump’s neocolonial mineral grab would make Ukraine a vassal state and accelerate the climate crisis while doing nothing to protect our sovereignty,” Romanko added. “The only people who win from this proposal are the shareholders of American companies and [Russian president Vladimir] Putin.”Countries and businesses will continue to recognize the threats posed by the climate crisis, but Trump’s slashing of support forrenewable energydomestically andimmolation of USAidand other internationally focused bodies will hinder efforts to reduce emissions, according to Jonathan Elkind, a global energy expert at Columbia University.“To a much greater extent than ever before, this Trump team is saying that they have no problems with fossil fuels being a part of the energy mix indefinitely,” Elkind said.“People around the world need climate solutions, not only people in very poor economies but also in the US.

Phillips does not have legal custody for his children.Phillips comes from a farming family inMarokopa– a tiny coastal settlement of fewer than 100 people, part of the vast Waikato region where he and his children are presumed to be hiding.Three years in the wild: how a fugitive father has hidden his children for so longRead more“Police will be present in the wider Marokopa area over the next few days as we continue making inquiries into the whereabouts of Tom Phillips and his three children,” detective senior sergeant Andy Saunders said in a statement.Officers will be conducting inquiries north of Marokopa, in and around the remote settlements of Te Waitere and Te Maika.“This has not been prompted by any specific sighting – it is simply a continuation of the ongoing investigation,” Saunders said.The Guardian has contacted the police for further comment.The Waikato area is made up of long sweeping coastline to the west, forested terrain and farmland in the centre, limestone cave networks to the north and a smattering of small rural towns and settlements throughout. Marokopa is a quiet, isolated settlement in the Waikato, two hours from the nearest city, Hamilton, with one long winding road in and out of the densely forested and hilly landscape.The remoteness of the landscape has so far frustrated police attempts to locate Phillips.The case has fascinated New Zealanders, who have struggled to understand how, in a country of close-knit communities, Phillips has evaded detection. While there is no suggestion his family has helped him, the question of how Phillips has managed to conceal himself and his three children – and survive – in the harsh terrain has puzzled the nation, leading to speculation others in the community may be aiding him.View image in fullscreenFile image of Tom Phillips.Photograph: NZ PolicePhillips’ lengthy disappearance was preempted by an earlier – albeit shorter – stint where he went bush with his children. In September 2021, the four were reported missing and his ute was found abandoned along the Marokopa shoreline, resulting in a major search operation across land and sea.Nineteen days later, Phillips and the children walked into his parents’ farmhouse just outside Marokopa. Phillips claimed he had taken his children on an extended camping trip in dense bush in an effort toclear his head. He was charged with wasting police time and resources.But fewer than three months later, the four were reported missing again and when Phillips failed to show for a January court appearance, a warrant was issued for his arrest.Sightings of Phillips and his children over the last three years have been rare and fleeting. In November, Phillips allegedly stole a quad bike from a rural property and broke into a shop in Piopio, with CCTV footage showing two figures on a street, believed to be Phillips and one of his children. While there were reportedlyseveral other sightings in mid-2023and an $80,000 reward put up for information in June, the trail later went cold.’map of marokopaPolice describe Phillips as someone who “doesn’t live a mainstream lifestyle”, eschewing social media and limiting his use of mainstream banks.

I think people are gonna die.” Katherine, who is using her middle name for her protection, told Kavanaugh that she thought transgender youth may be the target of violence due to the hate generated byDonald Trump’s recent action.On 28 January, Trump issued anexecutive order to ban accessto gender-affirming care for youth under 19 years old. It directed federal agencies to deny funding to institutions that offer gender-affirming medical care including hormones and puberty blockers.“She just felt like the world was crumbling around her. So we talked it out and tried to stay super positive,” said Kavanaugh, a parent of two trans children. “I think she really feels like we’re on the edge of chaos.”In a victory for trans kids and their families, a federal judge in Marylandblocked the banon 4 March. The preliminary injunction extended a mid-February restraining order that blocked Trump’s directive and will remain in effect until further order from the US district court for the district of Maryland. In the meantime, the order prohibits the government from withholding federal funding to healthcare facilities that provide treatment to trans youth.Still, the executive order sent parents, children and medical providers into a tailspin as they deciphered its impacts. Somehospitalsimmediatelycanceled appointmentsand turned away new patients to adhere to the directive. In early February, Katherine was dropped as a patient atVirginia Commonwealth University, where she received gender-affirming care after South Carolina banned hormone therapy, surgery and puberty blockers for trans youth last year. Some parents say that their children’s mental health severely declined in the weeks following the executive order. And as a result, families have gone to great lengths to ensure that their trans kids continue to receive care, including considering moving abroad or stocking up on puberty suppressants.“We have seen dozens of families affected across the United States, in many, many states that have been left and abandoned without care that they need,” said Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior counsel and healthcare strategist at the LGBTQ+ civil rights organization Lambda Legal. “This is an unlawful executive order because it seeks to override the congressional mandate to condition federal financial assistance on non-discrimination, and this order seeks to require discrimination as a condition of federal funding.”The pause follows alawsuitfiled on 4 February by civil rights organizations including Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of transgender youth. ACLU staff told the Guardian that they anticipated that the preliminary injunction would remain through the court proceedings.Some hospitals that stopped providing care to trans youth after the January directive, such asChildren’s Hospital Los AngelesandChildren’s Hospital of Richmond,lifted limits on surgeriesorhormonal therapyin late February. Kavanaugh said she was “relieved and hopeful” about the preliminary injunction, though it does not roll backSouth Carolina’s banon trans youth healthcare, which was signed into law last year.Her 18-year-old trans son Parker and Katherine received treatment at Medical University of South Carolina and then a private clinic in the state for several years until Henry McMaster, the governor of South Carolina,signed into lawa ban on gender-affirming care for trans minors in May 2024. Parker is now old enough to receive his care in South Carolina, but the state ban means that the family has had to drive more than five hours each way to Virginia Commonwealth University for Katherine’s doctors’ appointments and medicine every few months.Being dropped as a patient due to the federal ban “puts us in a really tough spot because we’re already having to find care outside of South Carolina. And so that just limits our options,” Kavanaugh said. Katherine’s doctors connected her to a private medical practice in Fairfax, Virginia, that does not receive federal funding, so they were able to avoid a lapse in her care. While the change in providers did not cost more money, it stretched their commute to more than seven hours.In late February, Katherine’s puberty-blocker treatment at Virginia Commonwealth University resumed. In astatement, the hospital said that patients would continue medications, but that surgeries would remain suspended. Trans kids’ treatment remains in limbo as federal challenges wind through the court.‘A psychological toll’Studieshaveshownthat gender-affirming medical care greatly improves trans people’s mental health and quality of life. A 2022reportpublished in the journal JAMA Network Open analyzed data from a study of 104 transgender and non-binary youth from ages 13 to 20 who received hormonal therapy or puberty blockers at the Seattle Children’s Gender Clinic for a year. Researchers found that 60% of participants reported lower rates of depression and 73% had less odds of suicidal ideation and self harm after receiving gender-affirming hormones and puberty blockers.Black transgender people, who experience the intersecting stigma of being gender diverse and racial minorities, are at even greater risk of poor mental health. A2022 national surveyof 33,993 LGBTQ+ young people by the Trevor Project, a non-profit, found that one in four Black transgender and nonbinary youth attempted suicide in the past year, more than double the rate of their cisgender counterparts.“It’s already difficult to access healthcare and treatment. It’s additionally difficult for folks who belong to other marginalized communities, especially families and children of color, as well as folks who are on various forms of state-funded insurance and may have difficulty selecting their providers to begin with,” Harper Seldin, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, told the Guardian.“There is already a subset of gender clinics in this country who provide this care. When you lay over on top of that insurance and access based on family means, it’s particularly devastating for families who can’t just pick up and go somewhere else – to another city, state or other country – to get care.”While her trans daughter’s care hasn’t been directly affected by the executive order, Sarah, a Texas mother who asked that her last name not be used to protect her daughter’s privacy, said that her daughter Raven was devastated by the president’s directive. Raven, a 16-year-old Black trans girl in Texas who is using a pseudonym, dropped out of school last month due to her declining mental health, exacerbated by the federal ban. Sarah said that Raven had rarely got out of bed, and when she did, she would show her mom news reports of murdered Black trans girls and women.“She has told me that she’s afraid of being killed if she leaves the house,” Sarah said. “She really only will leave the house with me. But that’s very few and far between, because she’s just incredibly depressed.”Since dropping out of school, Sarah said that Raven’s depression and anxiety significantly decreased, and she plans to start GED test preparation classes over the summer.In November 2024, the LGBTQ+ non-profit Human Rights Campaign Foundation released areportthat showed that half of the 36 transgender people killed in the last 12 months were Black trans women. That reality has made it terrifying for Raven to live as a Black trans girl, Sarah said.Raven’s medical providers have increased her antidepressants dosage, and she now checks in with her psychiatrist every three weeks. Since last year, Raven has had to fly to Colorado every six months to receive gender-affirming care due to aTexas banon treatment for minors. She has received grants from the non-profit Campaign on Southern Equality to fund the travel for medical treatment, which has helped defer some of the exorbitant costs of seeking out-of-state care.Sarah said that she has researched living in other nations and would be willing to order medicine from Canada if Raven could no longer get medical treatment in Colorado. Gender-affirming care has drastically improved Raven’s life. “She feels more herself,” Sarah said. “If she didn’t have it, I don’t think she would choose to stay alive.”Navigating medical care restrictions has caused anxiety for parents who are shouldering the burden of the policies’ twists and turns for their children. A Georgia-based parent, Peter Isbister, said that he had chosen not to share the news of the executive order with his 11-year-old trans son Lev, who is using a pseudonym out of fear of harassment: “It’s taken a psychological toll on his parents, not on him.”An endocrinologist is currently monitoring Lev’s hormone levels to determine when he will be put on puberty blockers. Isbister, an attorney and founder of the peer support network Metro Atlanta TransParent, has to contend with the federal executive order and alooming banon puberty blockers for minors in Georgia.“If the bill passes in Georgia, then we as a family are going to really have to study up more seriously on how it works to be an out-of-state person to get care in California, New Mexico, Massachusetts or wherever,” Isbister said. “And the more states that restrict access to care, the harder that’s going to be.”As a result of the federal and state policies, Isbister said that he has talked with an immigration attorney about acquiring Canadian citizenship for his son. But at least for now, Lev’s clinic continues to provide him care.While Isbister was “heartened” by the judge’s injunction on the executive order, he said that it is “wrenching and in my view unjust that my ability to provide my kid healthcare should be an issue for our federal courts”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTransgenderUS politicsDonald TrumpHealthHealth policyLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I cannot go on with this feeling inside. I cannot just go and play a tour of beautiful concerts.”Tetzlaff is not alone in acting on his disquiet. A growing international move to boycott the US is spreading from Scandinavia toCanadato the UK and beyond as consumers turn against US goods.Most prominent so far has been the rejection by European car buyers of the Teslas produced byElon Musk, now a prominent figure in Trump’s administration as the head of the “department of government efficiency” a special group created by Trump that has contributed to the precipitous declines in Tesla’s share price. About 15% of its value was wiped out on Monday alone.The fall in Tesla sales inEuropehas been well documented, as has a Canadian consumer boycott in response to trade tariffs and Trump’s calls for Canada to become America’s 51st state, but the past week has seen daily reports of cultural and other forms of boycotts and disinvestment.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators outside a Tesla showroom in New York.Photograph: Adam Gray/APIn Canada, where the American national anthem has been booed during hockey matches with US teams, a slew of apps has emerged with names such as “buy beaver”, “maple scan” and “is this Canadian” to allow shoppers to scan QR barcodes andreject US produce from alcohol to pizza toppings.‘I decided I was done’: Canada pizzeria boycotts US ingredients in tariff disputeRead moreFigures released this week suggested the number of Canadians taking road trips to the US – representing the majority of Canadians who normally visit – had dropped by 23% compared with February 2024, according toStatistics Canada.While Canada and Mexico have been at the frontline of Trump’s trade war, the boycott movement is visible far beyond countries whose economies have been targeted.InSweden, more than 70,000 users have joined a Facebook group calling for a boycott of US companies – ironically including Facebook itself – which features alternatives to US consumer products.“I’ll replace as many American goods as I can and if many do so, it will clearly affect the supply in stores,” wrote one member of the group.InDenmark, where there has been widespread anger over Trump’s threat to bring the autonomous territory of Greenland under US control, the largest grocery company, the Salling group, has said it will tag European-made goods with a black star to allow consumers to choose them over products made in the US.“We are making it easier to shop for European brands,” its chief executive, Anders Hagh, wrote on LinkedIn, although he said the company would still stock US products.More striking, perhaps, is the decision by companies to cut ties with the US. Norway’s largest oil bunkering operation, the privately owned Haltbakk, recently announced a boycott of its occasional supplying of fuel to US navy ships.Referring to thefiery meeting in the White House between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Trumplast month, the company posted on Facebook: “We have today been witnesses to the biggest shit show ever presented “live on TV” by the current American president and his vice-president.“Huge credit to the president of Ukraine restraining himself and for keeping calm even though USA put on a backstabbing TV show. It made us sick.“As a result, we have decided to [immediately] STOP as fuel provider to American forces in Norway and their ships calling Norwegian ports … We encourage all Norwegians and Europeans to follow our example.”While boycotts have been a familiar tactic in the past – targeting apartheid South Africa and the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories – what is striking is how quickly the secondTrump administrationhas become a target for both consumer anger and ethically minded companies.Trump this week has commented on the issue for the first time, bemoaning the impact of theTeslacustomer boycott and demonstrations.He wrote on social media: “To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is putting it ‘on the line’ in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!” But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they so often do, are trying to illegally and collusively [sic] boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers and Elon’s baby.”Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote for the Centre for European Policy Analysis this week: “Nobody – nobody – would have thought that western businesses or consumers would use such tools against America.“The United States is, after all, the leader of the free world. Or was: its vote with Russia, against Ukraine, at the United Nations last month, combined with Trump’s and Vance’s verbal attack on Zelenskyy, along with Trump’s denunciation of Zelenskyy as a dictator and a refusal to use similar language about the Russian despot, suggests to many that America is no longer an instinctive member of what we term the west.”For some, the backlash was entirely predictable.When Trump first threatened to impose sweeping tariffs this year, Takeshi Niinami, the chief executive of the Japanese multinational brewing and distilling group Suntory Holdings, which owns several major US brands,told the Financial Timesinternational consumers were likely to shun American brands in the event of a trade war.“We laid out the strategic and budget plan for 2025 expecting that American products, including American whiskey, will be less accepted by those countries outside of the US because of first, tariffs and, second, emotion,” Niinami said.And it is likely to spread further still. Zoe Gardner, an organiser of theStop Trump Coalitionin the UK, is seeing rapidly increasing interest in the issue.“A lot of what we are seeing is coming about organically, people putting stuff on TikTok. People are so furious, and this is about taking back power. Already across Europe we are seeing sales of Tesla falling of a cliff because Musk encapsulates so much of the problem with the Trump administration, both its culture of horrible racism and the economic side.”This article was amended on Wednesday 12 March 2025. A previous version stated a Swedish Facebook group had 40,000 members. At the time of publication, this number was more than 70,000.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpElon MuskTeslaCanadaSwedenDenmarkanalysisShareReuse this content"

Hackman, 95, was eventually found near the entrance to their home in Santa Fe, apparently after suffering a fall.Speaking onInstagram, Heming Willis, 46, said she hoped the tragic deaths of the couple and one of their dogs would prompt people to reflect on the “broader story”.“I do really believe that there is some learning,” she said. “Caregivers need care, too. And that they are vital, and that it is so important that we show up for them so that they can continue to show up for their person.”She continued: “I think that there’s this common misconception that caregivers, they got it figured out. They got it covered. They’re good. I don’t subscribe to that.”Willis, 69, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023, the year after he announced hisretirement due to aphasia. It is believed he is no longer verbal.His wife, as well as his daughters and ex-wife Demi Moore, have been praised for their candour discussing his condition, and their support of the former action star. Heming Willis’s memoir of caregiving, The Unexpected Journey, will be published in September.“Having resources and information readily available is imperative,” she has said of the book. “I know between my experience and other care partners that I have spoken to; our stories are unfortunately similar.”View image in fullscreenGene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa in 1989.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyQuestions have been raised by many about why Hackman and his wife did not appear to have a more robust support network in place.The circumstances of Hackman’s death have substantially affected the legacy of one of Hollywood’s most venerated stars, with his and Arakawa’s plight highlighting the obstacles faced by vulnerable elderly people and those who look after them.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanBruce WillisCarersDementianewsShareReuse this content"

Bereaved families, survivors, supporters and campaigners relentlessly fought the case, accusing the force of lying to cover up its responsibility.Many survivors, including some who were under 18 at the time, have complained about howWest Midlandspolice officers questioned them, and the IOPC said it had upheld some of those complaints.In April 2016, the jury at new inquests – held after a 1991 inquest verdict of accidental death was quashed in 2012 – determined thatthose who died had been unlawfully killeddue to gross negligence manslaughter by Ch Supt David Duckenfield, the officer in charge of match safety.The jury also determined that no behaviour of Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster. Families have long protested that no police officer faced disciplinary proceedings for the mismanagement that caused the disaster or the false narrative. Duckenfield was prosecuted for gross negligence manslaughter andacquitted in 2019.Cashell informed complainants that the IOPC’s investigations had reached the same conclusions as the jury at the new inquests. She said complaints had been upheld against senior SouthYorkshireofficers for the policing of the match and against a number of other officers for being abusive of supporters at the match and some for “excessive use of force”.However, she said most complaints against police officers for seeking “to deflect the blame” had not been upheld because there was no legal duty at the time for the police to be candid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government has promised to introduce it in some form by next month, the 36th anniversary of the disaster.Cashell wrote: “Like the HIP [Hillsborough independent panel] report, our investigations did find evidence to support allegations that in the aftermath of the disaster, South Yorkshire police sought to deflect the blame from themselves. We found no evidence to support claims that the behaviour of supporters was a contributing factor.“In the majority of cases, we were unable to find the officers had a case to answer for misconduct because the professional standards for policing at the time did not include a specific duty of candour. Despite the wider public interest to gain answers about what happened, South Yorkshire police was entitled, within the law at the time, to present its ‘best case’ and be selective with the evidence it presented.”Cashell said the IOPC would inform complainants, who include bereaved families and survivors of the disaster, of the findings regarding individual complaints by 28 March.Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLiverpoolPoliceYorkshireSouth YorkshireWest MidlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

La Unión and the rest ofEl Salvador’s eastern region have historically been neglected by governments, with few infrastructure projects and widespread poverty.Just a month later, Bukeletravelled to Germanyto lobby for his project. “Munich airport is interested in operating our new airport that we will build in La Unión,” he said.A few years passed and the airport plan seemed to fade. Until last year: as the hardline president pushed for re-election, his government began to fast-track the project. Afterbeing re-electedin February 2024, Bukele – who has called himself the “world’s coolest dictator” – started clearing the way for a runway for the new Pacific Airport in the middle of one of the few remaining mangrove forests in the country.View image in fullscreenConstruction on Pacific airport has recently begun.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianFor the Salvadoran government, the airport isn’t just an isolated project, but one that fits into a grander plan: the “Bitcoin City”, another ambitious promise from his government. Bukele envisions a tax-free economic hub, with the airport a key part of making it accessible to international investors and crypto entrepreneurs.Elmer Martínez’s family was among 225 households displaced from his community, Flor de Mangle, and neighbouring El Condadillo to make space for the 3km runway.View image in fullscreenElmer Martínez says he and his neighbours were subjected to what they considered ‘predatory negotiations’.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianMartínez, a local representative of themovement for the ancestral peoples of El Salvador, and his neighbours were first approached in 2022 by government officials. In the following years, they went through what they considered “predatory negotiations” for the agricultural-based communities to sell their homes in exchange for “inadequate compensation”.Mangroves have suffered in the past century. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,at least 20%of the world’s mangrove forests have disappeared since 1980. El Salvador’s percentage is far higher:60% in the past five decades.One of El Salvador’s last saltwater forests, La Unión’s mangrove is part of theGulf of Fonseca conservation area. It shelters abundant wildlife, including the critically endangeredyellow-naped amazon(Amazona auropalliata).Mangroves are nutrient factories, says Olga Tejada, a biologist at the University ofEl Salvador. “They feed the entire ecosystem and the communities that depend on them and absorb massive amounts of carbon dioxide, helping to fight climate change,” she says. “But they are fragile. Even small changes in soil salinity can kill them from the roots up.”View image in fullscreenLocal people say their livelihoods depend on the mangrove forests.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianStudies show that intact mangrove forests cansignificantly reduce hurricane damage. Scientists have found that deforestation in Guerrero, Mexico,worsened the devastationcaused byHurricane Otisin 2023. La Unión’s mangroves serve a similar protective role, shielding coastal communities from extreme weather events that arebecoming more frequentdue to the climate crisis.The risks of building an airport on former mangrove land go beyond environmental damage, as they could threaten the project itself. “Mangroves grow in soft, unstable soil,” Tejada says. “Even if sediment hardens over time, an airport built on it in a highly seismic country like El Salvador could be dangerously unstable.”The vanishing mangroves of El Salvador: ‘All our efforts may only slow the destruction’Read moreShe points to the2001 earthquake, a 7.7 magnitude disaster thatliquefiedparts of the mangrove forest.While the government touts the La Unión airport as a gamechanger for the region’s economy, critics argue that the benefits will be concentrated in the hands of a few.Bukele disagrees. “In 10 years, it is expected to generate 50,000 direct and indirect jobs, contributing 1.5% to the GDP annually, according to feasibility studies,” he said at an eventto lay the foundation stone, last month.According to the president, the airport would be a key resource to make Bitcoin City an attractive place for crypto-enthusiasts to live, and an express train line willconnect the city to the airport and port.View image in fullscreenMartínez walks near the construction site where trees have been cut down.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianBut many residents say they are being shut out of the opportunities that corporate tourism giants will seize. “They tell us this will bring prosperity, but we can’t invest. And the little money they’re offering us to leave barely buys a house, let alone land to farm,” says Adan Sosa, an agricultural worker who says he was offered $75,000 (£58,000) for his home and a separate plot where he grows crops.The rising cost of land near the airport has made it almost impossible for small businesses and local vendors to establish themselves in the new economy, leaving many to ponder who will genuinely benefit.Land prices in the area have soared by up to 3,200%since 2000, making ownership unattainable for most residents.For Dimas Bautista, one of the community’s founders and a lifelong fisher, the impact is already hitting home. “A few months ago, the government banned us from passing through the construction site to reach the mangroves, so now we have to take longer, riskier routes,” he says.View image in fullscreenDimas Bautista says animals are leaving the mangroves.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianBautista says the airport threatens people like him, whose livelihoods depend on the mangrove’s resources: “The animals are already leaving. Those that can’t move will probably disappear too. And when they do, so will our way of putting food on the table.”The Bukele administration has followed a pattern of environmental deregulation, such asthe reversal of El Salvador’s mining ban, the$1bn (£770m) increase in construction projectssince his first term, and the continued push for monoculture crops such as sugar cane.Tejada says mangroves are an easy target, as they are government owned and can be leased to private interests. “A lot of mangroves have been owned by individuals, and no one paid attention to a concessioned area being handed in with 100 acres [40 hectares] of mangrove and being returned with half of the forest mass,” he says.View image in fullscreenMartínez says the destruction of the mangroves is not just about the trees but about survival.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianAlong with rising sea levels and agrochemical pollution, campaigners say unchecked urban development is a mounting threat to El Salvador’s mangroves. Bukele’s administration has already fast-tracked major projects, including the railway line, which will link La Unión to the rest of the country. Conservationists fear the rapid expansion will come at the expense of ecosystems that have safeguarded coastal communities for centuries.For Martínez and his neighbours, the destruction of the mangroves isn’t just about trees – it’s about survival. “They turned our home into a cemetery,” he says, looking at the barren land where a freshwater spring once flowed. “First the forest dies, then the water. Finally, we do too.”Explore more on these topicsSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanEl SalvadorTrees and forestsDeforestationBitcoinConservationAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

(AP Photo/Odelyn Joseph)Photograph: Odelyn Joseph/APSuch is the violence gripping Haiti’s capital that reporters must don bullet-proof helmets and vests to get within a few metres of a sculpture that sits between some of the city’s most important buildings, including the presidential palace, the army HQ, and the currently vacant national pantheon museum and supreme court.“The whole downtown is unaccessible,” lamented Frederick Mangonès, the son of Albert Mangonès, the architect and sculptor who began designing the Unknown Maroon in the 1940s.Mangonès fought back tears as he considered the plight of his father’s masterpiece and the violence-stricken country.“[I feel about the Nèg Mawon] the same way I feel about Haiti – very sad, and discouraged and angry,” the 79-year-old said, leafing through albums of his late father’s sketches and plans. “And hopeful,” Mangonès added, unexpectedly. “We are resilient, you see.”The Nèg Mawon has witnessed – and survived – many Haitian upheavals since he was placed outside Port-au-Prince’s presidential palace in December 1968: a monument to Haiti’s revolutionary fight for freedom that, perplexingly, was commissioned by one of the 20th century’s most ruthless dictators, François “Papa Doc” Duvalier.Claire Payton, a US historian who is researching the Nèg Mawon, said Duvalier had commissioned the work in an attempt to bolster his tyrannical rule by posing as a maroon-style revolutionary who challenged the US during the cold war. “He was claiming Haiti’s resistance history as the reason he should be in power,” Payton said.At the statue’s inauguration, Duvalier waxed lyrical about the “indomitable courage” of the runaway slaves who resisted foreign domination and the “insane conviction that the Negro was not a human being”.View image in fullscreenFrederick Mangonès, the 79-year-old son of the celebrated Haitian architect and sculptor Albert Mangonès, shows off photographs and designs for the Nèg Mawon statue.Photograph: Odelyn Joseph/The Guardian“You are the Great Blacksmith of our independence!” the dictator declared, according to documents Payton unearthed.In 1986, the Nèg Mawon saw the Duvalier family dictatorship collapse, when Papa Doc’s son, Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier, was overthrown. “I’ll never forget that,” said Mangonès, who remembers racing to the palm-lined plaza around the sculpture with his father to witness scenes of public celebration over Duvalier’s fall.That joy quickly turned to anger – some of it directed at the Nèg Mawon, because of the statue’s association with the Duvalier clan. “The crowd shifted in like 30 seconds … and they started beating the Mawon and shaking it and getting really very, very angry … From this joyful warm thing, it became very, very ugly,” Mangonès said, describing how protesters grabbed the machete in the statue’s right hand and shook it until it broke off. It is missing to this day.The Nèg Mawon, however, remained standing: his muscular left arm defiantly raising a conch to his lips to summon others to the struggle, a broken chain around his ankle symbolizing Haiti’s escape from subjugation.The statue survived another upheaval in 2010 when a devastating earthquake reduced the city to rubble and killed tens of thousands of Haitians.In a book about the aftermath of the quake, the American doctor Joia Mukherjee recalled entering the square outside Haiti’s collapsed presidential palace, “where thousands [of homeless victims] had already made their homes”. “There, rising from the dust of the still trembling earth, stood the statue of Nèg Mawon,” Mukherjee wrote.As the doctor stood weeping near the sculpture, she was embraced by an elderly lady, and told her: “Nèg Mawon toujou kanpé!” (“The free man is still standing!”)“Cheri, Nèg Mawon p’ap janm kraze!” the woman replied. “My dear, the free man will never be broken!”Fifteen years after the earthquake, the Nèg Mawon again finds himself embroiled in a moment of historic turmoil, although this time it is a human-made disaster to which the statue has a front-row seat.Port-au-Prince has been plunged into chaos since a politically charged criminal insurrection erupted last February, with heavily armed gangs seizing ever-greater chunks of the city.View image in fullscreenThe Nèg Mawon statue, still missing the machete broken off by irate crowds in 1986.Photograph: Odelyn Joseph/The GuardianThousands have been killed and more than a million forced from their homes, according to the UN, among them the residents of the no-man’s land just west of the Nèg Mawon.“If I go back, they’ll kill me,” said Jean Théophile Torbeck, a 54-year-old local who was loitering outside a ministry of defense building just behind the statue – one of the last outposts of government control in the city centre. As Torbeck told his story to journalists, a man approached, lifted his shirt and brandished a black handgun at the group. Fearing kidnap, they beat a hasty retreat.On another afternoon, a cluster of soldiers stood guard across the street, by a statue commemorating another independence icon: the revolutionary leader Henri Christophe, who became Haiti’s first and only king after the country gained independence in 1804. “Once this was a great country but nowadays we are on our knees,” one of the soldiers lamented as gunshots rang out nearby. “We’re in a country that is upside down.”View image in fullscreenThe wife of a journalist, who was shot during an armed gang attack on the General Hospital, cries as an ambulance arrives with his body, at a different hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Tuesday, Dec. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Odelyn Joseph)Photograph: Odelyn Joseph/APMangonès struggled to explain his “contradictory” feelings about Haiti’s predicament, which many historians trace back tothe crippling reparationsthe country was lumbered with after achieving independence from France and to thecenturies of foreign meddling and occupation that followed.“It’s hard to imagine it having turned out otherwise,” said Marlene Daut, the author of a new book about Henri Christophe. “If you create instability and chaos … then when you see chaos, you can’t act surprised, right?”Thanks to Haiti’s security breakdown, Mangonès has not visited his father’s most famous creation for years – or the nearby Haitian heritage institute which he helped found. Last month, Haiti’s biggest public hospital, a few blocks from the Nèg Mawon, was torched by the gangs, who killed two journalists and a policeman during an attack on the same building last December.“I dream about just driving around town,” Mangonès said wistfully.Like most Haitians, he has first-hand experience of the violence. Once, he was driving back into the town when his car came under fire and he was shot in the hand and chest, miraculously surviving. “It went across my spine without touching anything,” he said.Even so, the septuagenarian architect said he had decided not to abandon his country, as thousands of fellow citizens have done: “It’s very depressing … but I’m Haitian. I’m here – and where am I gonna go now at my age?”As Mangonès and his country wait for the violence to subside, he said the grit of his father’s unbreakable subject offered inspiration and hope. “He’s the symbol of Haiti’s fight for its liberty,” he said of the Unknown Maroon. “He’s the guy who never let go.”Explore more on these topicsHaitiSculptureJean-Claude 'Baby Doc' DuvalierAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After almost a decade in power, Justin Trudeau resigned and his Liberal party seemed down and out. But then came not justDonald Trump’s tariffs– but his threats that Canada could become the “51st state”.Canadians were appalled. The government hit back with retaliatory tariffs and strong words. Ordinary Canadians began boycotting goods from the US. And support for the Liberals surged. Now Mark Carney, who has never been an MP but was the first non-British head of the Bank of England, hasswept into the role of prime minister.Leyland Cecco is a reporter based in Toronto. He explains how the former “rockstar banker” has won such overwhelming support from his Liberal party – and why Canadians think he could be the man who could save them from Trump. He tells Hannah Moore why Canadians are worried that the tariffs could push the country into recession and how the rich minerals and resources in the country could attract unwanted attention from Trump.But Carney will have to soon hold elections – can he win, and does he have what it takes to take on Canada’s powerful neighbour?Photograph: Canadian Press/REX/ShutterstockExplore more on these topicsCanadaToday in FocusDonald TrumpMark CarneyJustin Trudeau"

In Africa, his administration has even touted the resurrection of coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, to bring energy to the continent.“We’ve had years of western countries shamelessly saying: ‘Don’t develop coal, coal is bad,’” said Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, last week. Such an attitude has been “paternalistic” and counterproductive forAfrica, he added. “That’s just nonsense, 100% nonsense,” Wright said. “Coal transformed our world and made it better.”Wright built on this theme on Monday at theCeraWeek oil industry conferencein Houston, Texas, where he said the world needed more, rather than less, fossil fuels. He also attackedJoe Bidenfor “irrational, quasi-religious policies on climate change” and claimed “there is no physical way” renewables such as solar and wind could replace fossil fuels – a viewdisputedby experts.This vision of a world wedded long-term to fossil fuels could spur greater US backing for drilling in Africa, delighting business interests that claim oil and gas are the answer to bringing power to the 600 million people on the continent who lack electricity.“With President Trump’s rollbacks of restrictions, there will be new opportunities for US investors to engage with Africa’s oil and gas sector,” said Robert Stryk, chair of Stryk Global Diplomacy, a consultancyhelpingthe African Energy Chamber facilitate US-funded oil and gas projects in Africa. “It has the potential to unlock real benefits for African nations. Secretary Wright made a powerful statement. It was a genius move.”View image in fullscreenSections of pipes awaiting installation as part of the east African crude oil pipeline, in Kikuube, Uganda, on 24 October 2023.Photograph: Luke Dray/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesStryk said it was “hypocritical” for western countries to demand Africa forgo fossil fuels after powering their own economies on coal, oil and gas. “Let Africa choose its own destiny,” he said. “People talk about renewables, but it’s hollow. It just keeps people where they are there, which is in poverty.”Scientists have made clear that the climate crisis, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, poses catastrophic risks around the world, particularly in poorer African countries that have emitted a small fraction of planet-heating pollution. Africa is heating upfasterthan the global average and is already suffering fromworsening floods, heatwaves and droughts, with countries therelosingup to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) responding to climate extremes.“One of the transformations caused by American fossil fuels was destroying our previously well-balanced climate and plunging some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in Africa into a life dealing with extreme weather and lost homes and livelihoods,” said Mohamed Adow, founder and director ofPower Shift Africa.“It’s a sign of huge ignorance that the US energy secretary is talking up coal, but it’s also obvious lobbying on behalf of the US fossil fuel companies which backs Republican politicians.”Adow said Africa does require assistance from wealthy countries such as the US to build out renewable energy. However, richer nations have long lagged in providing the required finance and Trump has imposed further cuts,axing an initiativeto help shift developing countries to clean energy,halting American aidto countries vulnerable to extreme weather and pulling the US from theParis climate agreement.“So they have no moral authority to dictate to Africa on the development approach to pursue,” Adow said of the US. “African leaders must choose a path that helps secure energy access and the economic wellbeing of their people. Exacerbating the climate crisis that their people are suffering from would be the opposite of this and undo the development gains of recent years.”While the world is shifting towards cleaner forms of power, albeit too slowly to stave off worsening climate impacts, Trump has sought to entrench the status quo of fossil fuels. The presidentlifteda Biden-era pause on exports of American gas, and Japan and South Korea have expressed interest in investing in an Alaska gas project, in part to avoid the threat of tariffs from Trump.“Japan will soon begin importing historic new shipments of clean American liquefied natural gas (LNG) in record numbers,” the presidentsaid last month. “It’ll be record numbers.”View image in fullscreenA liquefied natural gas export facility in Port Sulphur, Louisiana, on 6 March 2025.Photograph: Kathleen Flynn/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesLast month, Shigeru Ishiba, the Japanese prime minister, met with Trump at the White House and announced plans for Japan to import more LNG from Freeport, Texas.

This highlighted the dangers of the fuel, Rollerson said.Before the meeting between Ishiba and Trump, Rollerson travelled to Japan to meet with officials and encourage them not to make a “deal with the devil”.“I invited the Japanese government to come look at Freeport and see what 57 years of industrial build-out … has done for this city,” he said. “It’s not pretty.”Meanwhile, a deal undernegotiation with Ukrainewould give the US access to the country’s store of minerals, which includes oil and gas but also materials such as graphite, used in batteries. The deal could help reverse a pause Trump has placed on US military support to Ukraine, which has been fighting an invading Russian army since 2022.Ukraine has, even under Russian bombardment,sought to ramp upits clean energy infrastructure. But the new deal could “reverse these advances, potentially forcing our nation back into fossil fuel dependency and external energy control – a devastating setback for a country that has sacrificed so much for its independence”, said Svitlana Romanko, a Ukrainian environmental lawyer and executive director ofRazom We Stand.“Trump’s neocolonial mineral grab would make Ukraine a vassal state and accelerate the climate crisis while doing nothing to protect our sovereignty,” Romanko added. “The only people who win from this proposal are the shareholders of American companies and [Russian president Vladimir] Putin.”Countries and businesses will continue to recognize the threats posed by the climate crisis, but Trump’s slashing of support forrenewable energydomestically andimmolation of USAidand other internationally focused bodies will hinder efforts to reduce emissions, according to Jonathan Elkind, a global energy expert at Columbia University.“To a much greater extent than ever before, this Trump team is saying that they have no problems with fossil fuels being a part of the energy mix indefinitely,” Elkind said.“People around the world need climate solutions, not only people in very poor economies but also in the US.

Since 2000, the number of women and girls in prison has grown by 57%, compared with a 22% increase in the male prison population.The first global report of its kind, to which the Guardian was given exclusive access before its launch on 17 March, examined how laws criminalised acts of survival.Womenwere disproportionately jailed for petty theft, such as stealing food for babies and children, for begging and for working in the informal economy.They were also frequently detained for debt, inviolation of international law, said the report byPenal Reform InternationalandWomen Beyond Walls.Sabrina Mahtani, from Women Beyond Walls, said: “Prison is not a safe space for women or their children. Yet, rather than investing in support services and community solutions, countries continue to criminalise those who are marginalised and vulnerable.”Sia Fatmata Deen, a former police officer and president of the Freetown chapter of Go Bifo (Moving Forward) inSierra Leone, a network of women who have spent time in prison, was detained in 2013 for more than a year after a misunderstanding at work. A bike that had been reported stolen was being held at the police station overnight and went missing. Deen was held liable and asked to pay 5.5m leone (£186). When she was unable to pay, she was imprisoned until she could get the money.Many women Deen has met have been arrested, detained and labelled as criminals for acts stemming from poverty. The two most common offences women are charged with in the country are “fraudulent conversion” (using someone else’s money or property for illegal purposes) and “obtaining goods or money by false pretence” – both fall under the colonial-era Larceny Act.Iran announces ‘treatment clinic’ for women who defy strict hijab lawsRead moreCivil society organisations said the offences were misunderstood and the colonial-era law was being used to criminalise almost any instance of debt. Other women who were imprisoned under the act included victims of domestic abuse and those who had resorted to sex work or selling drugs to provide for their families.Deen said: “More women are going to prison because of poverty. If you have money, you will not go and sell drugs. If you have money, you will not go and borrow microfinance loans.“Women are the ones that have needs to take care of, and if we don’t have the money to do so, we’ll do extraordinary things. And then we’ll have conflict with the law,” she said. “There is a poor justice system in Sierra Leone.”Women around the world continue to be arrested under colonial-era laws, including those criminalising abortion, suicide attempts and same-sex relations.Although many of these laws appear gender-neutral, they disproportionately impact women due to patriarchal norms and systemic gender discrimination.View image in fullscreenAfghan women listen to warders at a prison in Kandahar. Since the Taliban’s return to power, more women have been punished under harsh laws on how they can dress.Photograph: EPA-EFEIn several countries, laws criminalising witchcraft mostly affected women who do not conform to gender stereotypes, said the report, with unmarried women, widows, divorcees or those without children – particularly older and poorer individuals – particularly targeted.Women’s choices about their dress and appearance were also frequently restricted by laws.In May 2022, a Zambian businesswoman and social media influencer, Iris Kaingu, wasarrested and charged with “indecent dressing”, after attending a fashion event wearing a see-through black dress.In Iran, not wearing a hijab was already a criminal offence under the Islamic penal code, but new morality laws introduced last year allowed significant fines and longer prison sentences of up to 15 years or even thedeath penalty for “promoting nudity, indecency, unveiling or improper dressing”.The report warned that the female prison population could soon exceed one million, and called for wider collection of data on the topic, more alternatives to prison and decriminalising laws that violate human rights standards and international law.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentPrisonsWomen's rights and gender equalityWomenSierra LeoneZambiaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “This move is within their rights as a sovereign nation, but we do not see it as a proportionate response to what UK authorities conveyed to us, which was their observation that a relatively small number of Trinidad and Tobago nationals were misusing the UK immigration system by being processed for an ETA in the normal existing process and then suddenly applying for asylum after arrival.”He added: “We have indicated our disappointment with the new visa requirement and will continue our consistent engagement with our UK counterparts. We are not of the view that regular travellers to the UK should be negatively affected by a relatively small number of persons who have been trying to abuse the British immigration system.”A statement from the British high commission in Trinidad and Tobago confirmed that the changes would come into effect immediately, though there would be a six-week transition period lasting until 23 April “during which time visitors who booked their travel and obtained an ETA before the changes can still enter the UK without a visa”.The statement said that the relationship between Trinidad and Tobago remained a “strong and friendly one”.The British high commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago, Jon Dean, said: “The changes announced today align Trinidad and Tobago with many other visa national countries with which the UK shares close and friendly ties. We understand that travel is important for families, businesses and cultural connections. The introduction of visitor visas is designed to support safe and secure travel while ensuring the UK’s borders remain protected.“The British high commission in Port of Spain has worked closely with the UK government to put in place arrangements that allow Trinidad and Tobago nationals to apply for their visitor visas right here at home. We remain committed to welcoming visitors and look forward to continuing the strong ties between our people. As a valued Commonwealth partner, Trinidad and Tobago remains an important part of the UK’s global community.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The immense volume of water that moves along its 1,200-mile (1,900km) route produces roughly 40% of US hydroelectric power and nearlyhalfthe hydropower in BC.Rubio says Trump’s ‘51st state’ plan not on G7 summit agenda in CanadaRead moreThe treaty first came into effect in 1964, afterdevastating floods nearly two decades before that destroyed Oregon’s second-largest cityand swaths of southern British Columbia.Under the terms of the agreement,Canadamust control the flow of the Columbia River through its network of dams to ensure US hydropower generators receive enough water and to prevent flooding. Those benefits are worth roughly $200m (C$288m) annually for the province.For its part, the US must also give Canada half the additional potential hydroelectric power produced by dams, which it sells at market rate.Under former presidentJoe Biden, the two countries reached an in-principle deal on a new version of the decades-old treaty in July, ahead of the September expiration deadline of the treaty.Despite a concerted push on both sides to finalize a deal before Trump took office, however, the final details of the treaty remain unfinished, with only a three-year interim agreement in place.In recent weeks, Trump has taken an increasingly combative stance towards Canada, calling its border “imaginary”, musing about inflicting “historic financial devastation” on a longtime ally and threatening to tear up the myriad treaties between the two countries.Last year, then candidateDonald Trumpreferred to the “large faucet” in British Columbia that could be turned on to help a parched California – an idea widely interpreted to refer to the Columbia River.Indigenous peoples were denied a seat at the table when the agreement was first made, despite the river passing through vast tracts of unceded territory. There were hopes that the multi-year renegotiation of the pact would finally see Indigenous rights recognized in Canada and work to restore critical habitats for endangered salmon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their time is running out. International aid is beginning to flow toEcuador,” added the president, who is seeking re-election in the second round of the country’s presidential election next month.Ecuador’s president offered no further details of the partnership between his government and Prince, a Navy Seal turned multimillionaire security contractor with close ties to theTrump administration.The announcement appeared designed to bolster Noboa’s attempt to portray himself as an iron-fisted anti-crime crusader ahead of the 13 April run-off against his leftwing rival Luisa González. Noboa’s administration announced on Sunday a $1m reward for the capture of one of Ecuador’s most notorious drug bosses, José Adolfo Macías Villamar, who is known by the nickname “Fito”.Noboa launched in January 2024 a hardline crackdown on the domestic gangs and foreign cartels that have brought chaos and carnage to what until recently was one of South America’s safest countries.Bukele-mania: El Salvador strongman’s crime clampdown excites regional rightRead moreEcuador’s highly strategic location between two of the world’s top cocaine producers – Peru and Colombia – and its Pacific ports have turned the country into a what experts call a drug “superhighway” ferrying vast quantities of the illegal substance to the US and Europe.“We are at war and we are fighting against people who are heavily armed, organised, with domestic and international financial backing and a structure of terror and criminality that reaches far beyond Ecuador’s borders,” Noboa said at the time.But Noboa’s crackdown has failed to halt the bloodshed and has been plagued with accusations of human rights abuses, including torture and arbitrary arrests.The news that Blackwater’s former CEO would join Noboa’s campaign prompted outrage and trepidation given the military contractor’s track record of involvement in abuses,including the killing of 14 Iraqi civiliansin 2007, after the US invasion.“Does he intend to do the same here?” Ecuadorian lawyer Marlon Martínez Molinaaskedon X, accusing Noboa of planning to introduce paramilitarism to the South American country by importing foreign mercenaries.“Noboa is the death of Ecuador … there’s no end to the terror in this country,” tweeted the Ecuadorian author Cristina Burneo.Activist Soledad Angus Freré also voiced despair, warning: “We’re going straight off the cliff.”Explore more on these topicsEcuadorXe (Blackwater)Donald TrumpUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.The retaliatory measures include Brussels reimposing tariffs on US goods including bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes, which it introduced during the first Trump term and later suspended after talks with his successor, Joe Biden.These tariffs, which target notable US goods worth €4.5bn, often from Republican states, will snap back on 1 April. The list was worth €6.3bn in 2018 but has shrunk because of Brexit and declining US exports.Separately, the commission plans further retaliation targeting goods worth €18bn, including a wide range of steel and aluminium products, as well as agricultural produce, such as poultry, beef, seafood and nuts. These tariffs would be imposed from mid-April, after a vote by EU member states and consultations with industry in an attempt to minimise damage to the European economy.“We try to hit … where it hurts,” said a senior EU official, who said the bloc was targeting soya beans, which are grown in Louisiana, the state of the US speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. “We love soybeans, but we’re happy to buy them from Brazil or from Argentina or from anywhere else.”While the commission announced that its measures would total €26bn, EU officials later said they would probably target €22.5bn of US goods, as some products were likely to be filtered out after talks with businesses and member states.However, further steps have not been ruled out. France’s European affairs minister, Benjamin Haddad, said on Wednesday that the EU could “go further” in its response to the US tariffs. The measures “are proportionate”, Haddad told TF1 television. “If it came to a situation where we had to go further, digital services or intellectual property could be included,” he said.GraphEU officials hope that pressure on Republican states and US business will help bring about a deal.“We will always remain open to negotiation,” von der Leyen said. “We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.”While the UK did not announce retaliatory measures, Keir Starmer did not rule them out in future. The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday he was “disappointed” by the tariffs, but would “take a pragmatic approach”.He said Britain was “negotiating an economic deal which covers and will include tariffs if we succeed. But we will keep all options on the table”.Starmer, who had previously said thatthe UK did not need to choose between the EU and the US, had already announced on Tuesday that Britainwould not respond with its own counter-tariffs, after last-ditch efforts to persuade Trump to spare British industry from his global tariffs failed.EU officials said they were talking to counterparts in other countries, including the UK, Switzerland, Norway,Canadaand Japan, but there had not been any coordination over responses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2019, Switzerland, one of the EU’s closest trading partners, complained when it was affected by EU restrictions on steel imports designed to protect EU industry.On Wednesday night Trump said he would impose additional penalties if the EU followed through with its plan. “Whatever they charge us, we’re charging them,” he told reporters.The UK steel industry warned that Trump’s tariffs would have “hugely damaging consequences for UK suppliers and their customers in the US”.Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade association UK Steel, said: “President Trump must surely recognise that the UK is an ally, not a foe. Our steel sector is not a threat to the US but a partner to key customers, sharing the same values and objectives in addressing global overcapacity and tackling unfair trade.“These tariffs couldn’t come at a worse time for the UK steel industry, as we battle with high energy costs and subdued demand at home, against an oversupplied and increasingly protectionist global landscape.”Bernd Lange, the German Social Democratic MEP who chairs the European parliament’s trade committee, described the tariffs as “another dose of self-inflicted tariff pain by the Trump administration”.He said the latest tariffs were “particularly bad” because “they target US trade partners, they are set arbitrarily, without legal and economic justifications, and they fail to address non-market overcapacity – the main issue steel and aluminium industry across the Atlantic is confronted with”.The introduction of EU measures came after a day of drama on Tuesday, when Trumpthreatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminiumin response to Canadian threats to increase electricity prices for US customers.The US president backed off from those plans after the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, agreed to suspend his province’s decision to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionTrump administrationInternational tradeUS politicsCanadaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Climate change is mentioned once in the document, under a section on “Environment and Resource Security”.‘Never seems to end’: exhausted quake-hit Vanuatu rebuilds againRead moreIn addition to greater reference to climate change, Napat said he also wanted “an official waiver-free agreement with Australia” as part of a new deal so citizens could more easily travel between the two countries.He had already spoken about these terms to Australian officials including the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, and they were “happy for the two countries to revisit the security agreement”.In a statement to the Guardian, an Australian foreign affairs department spokesperson said the government “welcome[s] recent comments by Vanuatu’s leaders on strengthening the bilateral relationship” and was “listening to Vanuatu’s priorities”.Australia’s push for security and policing agreements with Pacific countries – includingPapua New Guinea,Tuvalu, Solomon Islands,Fiji– has been widely viewed as part of its effort to counter China’s growing influence in the region. Beijing has expanded its security, diplomatic and economic presence across the Pacific, most recently signinga wide-ranging strategic partnershipwith the Cook Islands that covers areas including deep-sea mining, education and transport.When asked aboutChina, Napat said Vanuatu did not “have any preferences” in development partners: “We treat Australia the same as China and the United States.”View image in fullscreenJotham Napat campaigns ahead of Vanuatu’s election in January.Photograph: Christopher Malili/The GuardianMihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at the Lowy Institute, said Vanuatu was well positioned to take advantage of the geopolitical competition.“Vanuatu has a lot of leverage right now – Australia needs these sorts of security partnerships,” he said. “It’s looking to formalise existing activities and to elevate existing agreements wherever it can in a bid to build strategic insulation from China’s encroachment.”China had been taking an “opportunistic approach” to expanding security partnerships in the Pacific, Sora said, relying on individual Pacific leaders to take up its open offers for further support. “China is looking to elevate its political ties and then for that to open the way for closer security cooperation across the Pacific.”Mapped: the vast network of security deals spanning the Pacific, and what it meansRead moreVanuatu’s bid to secure new commitments with Australia comes as theUS looks to retreat from significant pledgesit has made to Pacific countries, particularly around economic development and climate action.Donald Trump has ordered thewithdrawal of his country from the Paris climate agreement, a move Napat said was deeply troubling for Vanuatu, a country on the frontlines of climate change.“For us, it’s about our survival,” he said, adding that he would like to convince Trump “not to withdraw because everybody depends on the Paris agreement”.Napat also said his government had not yet received confirmation on whether US aid to Vanuatu would be cut, but hoped that Washington would reconsider any plans to scale back support.Under Joe Biden’s presidency, the US widened its presence in the Pacific, openingnew diplomatic posts, negotiating asecurity deal with PNG, and vowing to deepen economic aid. Sora said some of these initiatives were unlikely to continue under the Trump administration.“What is likely to happen based on recent developments coming out of Washington is that the US will maintain a narrow security interest in the Pacific,” Sora said.map of vanutau“But we’re not likely to see the United States live up to its commitments on engaging with economic development and climate change.”Beyond security and diplomacy, Napat said his new government’s priority was ongoing recovery efforts after thedevastating 7.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Vanuatu in Decemberin 2024. The downtown of the capital, Port Vila, remains largely closed as damaged buildings are still being cleared and rebuilt.“We are hoping that before the middle of this year, we should be able to open the main central business district,” Napat said.Explore more on these topicsVanuatuPacific leaders: in their wordsPacific islandsChinaSouth PacificAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Heis the first former leader of an Asian country to be served an arrest warrant filed by the ICC.Lawyers for Duterte filed a petition on behalf of his youngest daughter, Veronica, accusing the government of “kidnapping” him, and demanding it bring him back.Duterte’s eldest daughter, Sara, the country’s vice-president, left for Amsterdam on Wednesday morning to help with his legal preparations.Carlos Conde, a senior researcher at the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said the developments were historic, and that it would be an understatement to say that victims felt ecstatic at his arrest. “This is something that’s totally unprecedented in the history of this country … not just in this country, [but] for south-east Asia and even Asia,” he said.“[Victims’] spirits are buoyed. They’re very, very optimistic that this is something that can move along expeditiously in The Hague,” Conde said. “The victims here in the Philippines have pretty much lost faith in the domestic justice system, which has done so very little in terms of addressing their quest for justice. This is why they pinned their hopes on the ICC.”Building the case had been a “very painstaking process” for victims, the families of victims and domestic human rights groups, Conde added.View image in fullscreenPeople light candles during a protest in Quezon City after the arrest of the former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte.Photograph: Lisa Marie David/ReutersThe timeline for a trial is unclear, but campaigners have called for proceedings to begin swiftly.The National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, which has represented the families of victims of the killings, said “victims’ pain from loss” had been, for the day, “eclipsed by joy and hope”.Duterte’s arrestwas symbolic of “a victory of the poor and marginalised, akin to that of David versus Goliath,” the lawyers’ group said, adding: “We still have to press on and work for his eventual conviction.”“There’s a feeling of simple joy at what is happening, and relief,” said Brother Jun Santiago, who set up Silingan Coffee, a small coffee shop, to help give jobs to the families of victims of extrajudicial killings, and to provide a space to memorialise their stories.Mother of two sons shot in Duterte’s ‘war on drugs’ dares hope for justiceRead moreOn Tuesday, the cafe offered discounted drinks to customers to encourage people to visit and learn about the abuses that were committed under Duterte’s government. Santiago described the arrest as a “first step to justice”.Duterte’s arrest was widely celebrated among human rights groups, with the Philippine rights alliance Karapatan describing the development as “long overdue”.Duterte’s supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the court has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal.The official Facebook page of the vice-president’s office shared an image of a red ribbon with the text “BRING PRRD HOME” – referring to President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.The country’s president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, told reporters on Tuesday night that he was confident “the arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures”. He added: “We did not help the international criminal court in any way. The arrest was made in compliance with Interpol.”Explore more on these topicsRodrigo DutertePhilippinesInternational criminal courtAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Supporters of the Philippines’ former presidentRodrigo Dutertebarely had time to protest beforehe was jetted off to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanityin relation to his country’s so-called “war on drugs”. According to activists, this bloody crackdown has seen as many as 30,000 people killed since 2016.The charges brought against the former leader are the culmination of years of work by activists, lawyers and victims, who documented abuses committed under his government, often at great personal risk. But Duterte arguably would not have been surrendered to The Hague if it weren’t forhis family’s dramatic feud with that of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the current president.The two families were once allies. Marcos Jr ran on a joint ticket with Duterte’s eldest daughter – Sara Duterte, now the vice-president – in the 2022 election,winning a landslide victory. At the time, Marcos Jr, who capitalised on the popularity of the Duterte name, was careful not to criticise Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, and promised not to cooperate with the international criminal court’s continuing investigation.But the Duterte-Marcos marriage of convenience descended into a bitter dispute, with Sara Duterte launching scathing attacks on the president, eventhreatening to dig up the remains of his late father, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr, and throw them into the sea.3:19Rodrigo Duterte arrives in The Hague over drug war killings – videoIt was inevitable that the families’ alliance would collapse, according to Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, of the University of thePhilippines. Both sides want their candidate to be elected president in 2028, so, she said: “It’s a fight for the survival of their political families, their dynasties.”Marcos Jr’s public comments about the ICC shifted as tension grew. His government has continued to maintain that it would not assist the court, of which the Philippines is no longer a member, but explained that it would cooperate with any arrest warrant issued via Interpol.Shortly after the plane carrying Duterte took off on Tuesday night, Marcos Jr told reporters: “The arrest that we did today was in compliance with our commitments to Interpol. It just so happened that that came from ICC.”According to Tony La Viña, a lawyer and former dean of the Ateneo de Manila University school of government, the arrest was a “perfect execution” by Marcos Jr’s administration.When the warrant came, “they executed it and within the day they sent Duterte to The Hague, giving no chance for the supreme court to issue a TRO [a temporary restraining order against his arrest]”, he said.View image in fullscreenFerdinand Marcos Jr and Sara Duterte are inaugurated as president and vice-president of the Philippines in Manila in 2022.Photograph: Aaron Favila/APThe Dutertes may now struggle to recover their power. Rodrigo, who has the most political clout, is now outside the Philippines, just as the country gears up for crucial midterm elections in May.Rodrigo Duterte is running to become mayor in the family’s stronghold, Davao, but faces a challenge from an upstart dynasty, which analysts say marks the most significant threat to the Dutertes’ power there in two decades. The former president is still thought likely to win, but it is unclear how he would be able to perform his mayoral duties from The Hague.The mid-term elections are also important because Sara Duterte is due to face an impeachment trial soon after the vote. The family needs its allies to be elected to the senate if she is to avoid being removed as vice-president and prevented from running for president in 2028.Rodrigo Duterte’s supporters have portrayed him as a victim who was denied due process by the vengeful Marcos family, and who has been wrongly handed over to foreigners. The irony of the first claim is not lost on the victims of the war on drugs, many of whom were never given a day in court, but instead gunned down in the streets.“Suddenly they are now using terms that they were laughing at [before],” said Atienza. “They are now calling for people power, they are using terms like rule of law, human rights. It’s really hard to sell.”The battle between the families, and online messaging from both sides, is likely only to intensify. Cleve V Arguelles, the CEO of the public opinion research firm WR Numero Research, said: “It will really be crucial in the coming weeks what kinds of narratives will be offered to the public and how the public will respond.”He added that the Dutertes were fighting to protect their power at a national level and on their home turf. “It’s all at stake now,” he said.Explore more on these topicsRodrigo DutertePhilippinesInternational criminal courtAsia PacificDrugs tradeInternational criminal justiceanalysisShareReuse this content"

Phillips does not have legal custody for his children.Phillips comes from a farming family inMarokopa– a tiny coastal settlement of fewer than 100 people, part of the vast Waikato region where he and his children are presumed to be hiding.Three years in the wild: how a fugitive father has hidden his children for so longRead more“Police will be present in the wider Marokopa area over the next few days as we continue making inquiries into the whereabouts of Tom Phillips and his three children,” detective senior sergeant Andy Saunders said in a statement.Officers will be conducting inquiries north of Marokopa, in and around the remote settlements of Te Waitere and Te Maika.“This has not been prompted by any specific sighting – it is simply a continuation of the ongoing investigation,” Saunders said.The Guardian has contacted the police for further comment.The Waikato area is made up of long sweeping coastline to the west, forested terrain and farmland in the centre, limestone cave networks to the north and a smattering of small rural towns and settlements throughout. Marokopa is a quiet, isolated settlement in the Waikato, two hours from the nearest city, Hamilton, with one long winding road in and out of the densely forested and hilly landscape.The remoteness of the landscape has so far frustrated police attempts to locate Phillips.The case has fascinated New Zealanders, who have struggled to understand how, in a country of close-knit communities, Phillips has evaded detection. While there is no suggestion his family has helped him, the question of how Phillips has managed to conceal himself and his three children – and survive – in the harsh terrain has puzzled the nation, leading to speculation others in the community may be aiding him.View image in fullscreenFile image of Tom Phillips.Photograph: NZ PolicePhillips’ lengthy disappearance was preempted by an earlier – albeit shorter – stint where he went bush with his children. In September 2021, the four were reported missing and his ute was found abandoned along the Marokopa shoreline, resulting in a major search operation across land and sea.Nineteen days later, Phillips and the children walked into his parents’ farmhouse just outside Marokopa. Phillips claimed he had taken his children on an extended camping trip in dense bush in an effort toclear his head. He was charged with wasting police time and resources.But fewer than three months later, the four were reported missing again and when Phillips failed to show for a January court appearance, a warrant was issued for his arrest.Sightings of Phillips and his children over the last three years have been rare and fleeting. In November, Phillips allegedly stole a quad bike from a rural property and broke into a shop in Piopio, with CCTV footage showing two figures on a street, believed to be Phillips and one of his children. While there were reportedlyseveral other sightings in mid-2023and an $80,000 reward put up for information in June, the trail later went cold.’map of marokopaPolice describe Phillips as someone who “doesn’t live a mainstream lifestyle”, eschewing social media and limiting his use of mainstream banks. Meanwhile, his purchases ofcamping items and seedlingssuggest he may be living off the land.In October 2024,footage emergedof an adult and three children walking through Marokopa farmland, after a chance encounter with teenage pig hunters who pulled out their phones and began filming.

Testing on one bat’s kidney showed about 3,000 times the acceptable level of lead, while another showed about 1,500 times acceptable levels.Wayne Boardman, an associate professor of wildlife, biodiversity and ecosystem health at the University of Adelaide, said that in his opinion the testing showed that “the scale of the exposure was highly significant” and that it was probable the animals died within 24 to 48 hours of exposure.“It’s not surprising these animals died acutely and were easily found by members of the public,” Boardman said. “It also indicates that, at the time, humans, other wildlife species, dogs and cats, livestock and marine wildlife would likely have been exposed to significant levels of lead in the air.”“This is a public health issue and potentially an animal welfare issue. This lead exposure should not be taken lightly.”Boardman, who has experience in forensic investigations and working with bat populations, said the evidence suggested that at some time towards the end of July or early August, lead dust had probably settled on flowering plants that attract flying foxes. When these plants blossomed, the animals ingested the dust as they fed.He said it was probable that a lack of rain meant the lead remained in the environment and that “given a timely” investigation comparing Bureau of Meteorology weather data and known bat feeding locations, “the site of the source of the lead on flowering contaminated plants and trees could have been determined”.Other documents reveal that Pirsa first contacted the EPA on 10 October 2024 to alert it to the test results and ask whether it would undertake an investigation. Pirsa’s authority to investigate extends to disease control within animal populations, not heavy metal pollution or regulatory issues, which fall under the EPA’s remit.The EPA declined. In a response marked “sensitive” sent a day later at 4.19pm, the EPA said that “to contemplate any involvement” it would require the full disclosure of all available evidence.“Any specific lead point source that may have caused this ‘event’ would likely be extremely difficult to locate/identify, and the EPA would not be in a position to offer assistance to Pirsa in this regard,” it said.Port Pirie is home to one of the world’s largest lead refineries operated by the Belgium-based Nyrstar that serves as the major employer in the town. It has been in continuous operation since 1889.In response to questions from Guardian Australia, an EPA spokesperson said the agency was “made aware of this incident by Pirsa as part of their investigations”.Documents obtained under freedom of information laws from the EPA show that 13 days later the agency began to consider the issue more closely after it was raised by the South Australian Chief Veterinary Officer. Management within the EPA then assigned an officer to make additional inquiries.“This is pretty random – but I am wondering if you can help me with it?” the request said.These inquiries appear to have involved following up with six contacts suggested by the chief veterinary officer over three weeks, with the final contact made on the day the officer reported back to management. The officer was told the EPA’s leadership did not want them to “raise [it] with anyone from Nyrstar at this point in time”.An EPA spokesperson later told Guardian Australia: “The EPA followed up on this matter by interviewing stakeholders, including Pirsa, the local council, vets and relevant animal welfare NGOs but was unable to establish any leads as to the specific source of the acute lead toxicity,”FOI documents show theseinquiries concluded with a report to EPA management that recommended “no further investigation should be undertaken by EPA staff in relation to this matter, other than discussions as needed between Nyrstar staff and the Principal Adviser - Port Pirie and Nyrstar and the Senior Environmental Advisor - Port Pirie and Nyrstar”.“In relation to the Nyrstar lead and multi-metal smelter, the EPA’s primary role is to ensure compliance with the licence issued under theEnvironment Protection Act. The EPA continues to monitor Nyrstar’s compliance with its licence,” an EPA spokesperson said.Nyrstar was contacted for comment. The company reissued a statement it provided to Guardian Australia last December saying: “We understand that the source of lead has not been able to be determined.”South Australia’s chief veterinary officer and chief health officer were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSouth AustraliaBirdsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Many had mistakenly been fed plastic waste by their parents and built up high levels of plastic in their stomachs.Blood tests indicated that the plastic pollution had left the chicks with severe health issues, disrupting the stomach, liver, kidneys and brain, according tothe studypublished in the journal Science Advances.“Plastic ingestion in seabirds is nothing new. We’ve known about it since the 1960s, but a lot of plastic research focuses on the birds that are really emaciated: they’re starving, they’re washing up on beaches and not doing too well. We wanted to understand the condition of birds that have consumed plastic but look visibly healthy,” said Alix de Jersey, a PhD student from the University of Tasmania’s School of Medicine, who led the study.View image in fullscreenPrevious studies have shown that shearwaters, pictured, are particularly susceptible to plastic pollution.Photograph: Denise Hardesty/AP“[In blood tests], we found patterns of the proteins that were very similar to those in people that have Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. It’s almost equivalent to a small child having Alzheimer’s. These birds are really suffering the impacts from plastic, especially on their neuronal brain health,” she said.Shearwaters are among the bird species most affected by plastic pollution.Previous studieshave found more than 400 pieces of plastic in a single shearwater chick, with plastic sometimes accounting for 5-10% of their total bodyweight.Donkeys in Kenya are dying with stomachs full of plastic – and other animals are at riskRead moreWhile chicks are able to vomit up some of the plastic before they migrate, researchers said the sheer quantity meant it was unlikely that all birds could clear it. The young birds that were examined in the study had their stomachs pumped, meaning that they were able to start their migrations to the Sea of Japan without any plastic waste inside.“It’s almost a death sentence for these chicks, which is unfortunate because they do look really fit and healthy. But knowing the condition which their body is in before they’re starting their migration, it’s quite challenging to imagine that they would make it to the other end,” said de Jersey.Previous research has found thatfewer than 60 multinationals areresponsible for more than half of the world’s plastic pollution, with six responsible for a quarter of that.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsPlasticsThe age of extinctionBirdsWildlifeMarine lifePollutionAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Kremlin has not publicly said whether or not it supports an immediate ceasefire.If Putin refuses,“I understand that we could count on strong steps. I don’t know the details yet, but we are talking about sanctions and about strengthening Ukraine,”Volodymyr Zelenskyysaid on Tuesday.Trump said on Wednesday that he had received “positive messages” regarding the ceasefire, but “a positive message means nothing”. The White House later said that Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, would be in Moscow later this week.“It’s up toRussianow,” Trump said from the White House. “Our people are going to Russia right now as we speak. And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia.”Trump did not directly promise to target Russia with sanctions if Vladimir Putin does not sign the deal, but said he could “do things financially that would be very bad for Russia”.He added, however: “I don’t want to do that, because I want to get peace.”Asked whether he believed Putin would hold to a ceasefire, given he had broken them in the past, Trump said: “We haven’t spoken to him yet with substance, because we just found out. We’re going to know very soon. I’ve gotten some positive messages, but a positive message means nothing. This is a very serious situation. This is a situation that could lead to world war three.”Defence ministers from Europe’s five leading military powers, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland and France met in Paris on Wednesday to discuss the formation of a “reassurance force” that would guarantee peace inUkraineif a settlement was agreed.Lecornu said they were “hoping to see a ceasefire tomorrow” and that 15 countries were willing to contribute to a force of up to 30,000 personnel that would secure Ukraine’s airports, ports and infrastructure on a permanent basis.However, the ministers emphasised they still wanted the US to provide a backstop guarantee to support peacekeepers, and hinted that the minerals deal due to be signed by the US and Ukraine would be insufficient.John Healey, the UK defence secretary, stressed that the UK wanted “the US to play a part in the reassurance force”. When asked whether a minerals deal could amount to a security guarantee for Ukraine, he said it was “a step towards a process where we get a ceasefire”, implying it was not necessarily sufficient.Late on Wednesday, Russian state television showed Putin making his first visit to the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion last year.View image in fullscreenA still from a video released by the Kremlin shows Vladimir Putin with Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, in a visit to the Kursk region.Photograph: Kremlin.ru/ReutersDressed in military camouflage, the Russian president expressed hope his army was on the brink of “fully liberating” the territory, and told senior commanders that Ukrainian soldiers captured in Kursk should be treated as terrorists.“I am counting on the fact that all the combat tasks facing our units will be fulfilled, and the territory of the Kursk region will soon be completely liberated from the enemy,” he said. On Wednesday, Russian forces entered the central square of Sudzha, the largest Russian settlement controlled by Ukraine.Minutes after footage of Putin’s remarks aired on Russian state TV, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, suggested his troops were pulling back to minimise losses.Zelenskyy also appeared to hint at an organised withdrawal in his comments on Wednesday. “The military command is doing what it should do – saving the maximum number of lives of our soldiers,” he said.Last month,in an interview with the Guardian, Zelenskyy said Ukraine hoped to swap the territory it held in Kursk region for areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the Americans proposed a full ceasefire, which was agreed after calls made by the two delegations to their respective presidents.Cautious Zelenskyy keeps cards close to his chest after Ukraine ceasefire proposalRead moreHe said that while monitoring sea and air ceasefires would be easy, he hoped Ukraine’s western partners would provide a plan for how to monitor a ceasefire along the frontline, “given who we are dealing with and given our experience of the past years”.Some Russian officials indicated scepticism about the prospect of a ceasefire, saying Moscow was unwilling to stop the fighting as its forces this week made rapid gains in reclaiming territory in Kursk region.Putin has repeatedly rejected the possibility of a temporary ceasefire, saying he was focused on addressing the “root causes” of the conflict. Earlier this year, he told Russia’s security council there “should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but a long-term peace”.Instead, the Russian leader has set out a list of maximalist demands to end his invasion, including Ukraine forgoing Nato membership, undergoing partial demilitarisation and ceding full control of the four Ukrainian regions Putin claimed in 2022.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinMarco RubioEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

I got it locked up pretty good unless I did something very stupid, like drained your country, your wonderful place of all of its companies. Maybe [then] I’d lose the Irish vote.”Trump also said that previous presidents had “lost big segments” of the US economy toEuropeand repeated his claim that “the EU was set up in order to take advantage of the United States”.Referring to the EU’s successful lawsuit against Apple, forcing it to pay€13bn (£11bn) in back taxes to Ireland, he said: “Apple has been treated very badly … That is unfair.”View image in fullscreenThe US vice-president, JD Vance, wore shamrock socks to the Oval Office meeting.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersIn one of several fawning moments, Martin pointed out that Ireland had fought against the EU case in the European court of justice – a move born out of the country’s desire to hold on to US tech firms such as Intel, Microsoft and Google, which have sited their EU headquarters in and around Dublin.He also said the Irish companies Ryanair and AerCap, which is the world’s biggest aircraft-leasing company, buy more US-made Boeing planes than anyone else.Nodding, Trump said: “I’m not blaming you. I’m blaming theEuropean Union. The European Union’s gone after our companies.“We have a problem with the European Union. They don’t take our farm products. They don’t take our cars. We take millions of cars, BMWs and Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagens and everything.

The institute has criticised budget rules that limit the scope for extra taxes and borrowing.The report found about half of the stagnation in real wages could be attributed to weak productivity growth, while tax and benefit changes accelerated the decline, stripping many families of financial support and hitting average living standards.A lack of productivity growth was to blame for much of the fall in living standards after the 2008 financial crisis.While other industrialised nations have suffered a fall in productivity, the UK has been among the hardest hit. The average UK worker is about 20% less productive than their French and German counterparts and 30% less productive than US workers, it said.The institute said it estimated that achieving the same rise in productivity as the US would make UK workers “more than £4,000 better off today”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in the end, it was domestic issues thatdrove Greenlanders to the polls to vote overwhelmingly for change.Ever since his son,Donald Trump Jr, touched down in a Trump-branded plane at Nuuk’s new airportin January, the US president has made no secret of his renewed desire to gain control of the Arctic island, refusing to rule out economic or military force to do so.Duringhis address to Congress, Trump said that he would acquire Greenland, part of the kingdom of Denmark, “one way or the other”. And just a day before the vote, he promised the island’s people that the US was ready to “make you rich”.But Greenland’s election was fought and won on domestic issues such as business, fisheries, pensions, people’s livelihoods and healthcare.Naleraq, the most US- and Trump-friendly party, did well, coming second overall. But it was the centre-right Democrats, led by Jens Frederik Nielsen, who replaced former prime minister Múte B Egede’s Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) as the party with the most seats – and thus now have the opportunity to form a coalition government.Naleraq advocates collaboration with the US in the pursuit of rapid independence fromDenmark(which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and still controls its foreign and security policy).Nielsen favours a much slower transition, saying Greenland “must have a calm course”, and “must first build the foundation” for success as an independent country.View image in fullscreenThe Naleraq leader, Pele Broberg (left), and the Democrat leader, Jens Frederik Nielsen, before a televised debate to discuss the election result.Photograph: Mads Claus Rasmussen/EPAWhat direction the new government takes on issues that could have international ramifications will depend on how the coalition is formed. Talks could go on for weeks, and while Nielsen has indicated he is open to talks with Naleraq, he has not ruled out working with other parties.“Greenland needs us to stand together,” Nielsen told the territory’s public broadcaster, KNR. “That will be the starting point for our negotiations.

But the tone of US-Greenland relations may depend on whether Naleraq ends up inside or outside the coalition.Tom Dans, Trump’s former Arctic commissioner and an investor with interests in Greenland, congratulated Nielsen on his victory but also made a point of praising Naleraq as “only slightly edged out”. He told the Guardian that Broberg’s party “continues to be a guide point towards Greenlandic self-determination and independence”.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpDenmarkEuropeUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The accusations made against these individuals are entirely false, fabricated in order to justify their increasing harassment of UK diplomats.“It is clear that the Russian state is actively seeking to drive the British embassy in Moscow towards closure and has no regard for the dangerous escalatory impact of this.”A senior Foreign Office official summoned the Russian ambassador, Andrey Kelin, and told him that the UK would not stand for the intimidation of British embassy staff and their families.The official said: “We do not take this decision lightly but we have always made clear to Russia that if they escalate, we will take reciprocal action. The depths to which Russia sinks can only be met through strength.”The foreign secretary, David Lammy, on his way to a meeting with his G7 counterparts in Canada, said: “We will not tolerate the Kremlin’s relentless and unacceptable campaign of intimidation, nor their repeated attempts to threaten UK security.”The Foreign Office stressed that it believed in keeping diplomatic lines of communication open and said it would regard the latest episode as closed so long as Russia did not seek to escalate further.In throwing out the British pair, Moscow said it “will not tolerate the presence of undeclared British intelligence personnel in Russia”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The arrest has sparked alarm from free-expression advocates who see the move to deport Khalil as a flagrant violation of his free speech rights.A Manhattan federal court held a hearing on Wednesday morning after Khalil’s lawyers challenged his detention, but it ended without a decision on whether he would be released from custody. During the brief hearing, an attorney for the Department of Justice asked for a change of venue for the case, fromNew Yorkto Louisiana or New Jersey, where he was held before being sent south.Who is Mahmoud Khalil? The detained Columbia graduate praised as steady negotiatorRead moreThe judge, Jesse Furman,asked the government to file written arguments by Friday.Earlier this week, Furman, an Obama-appointed judge in New York’s southern district,issued a ruling preventing Khalil’s deportation while the court reviewsthe legal challenge. Khalil’s lawyers contend that the Trump administration is unlawfully retaliating against their client for his activism and constitutionally protected speech.Outside the courthouse after the hearing on Wednesday, Ramzi Kassem, a member of Khalil’s legal team and the founder and co-director ofClear, a legal clinic at the City University of New York, said that the provision of the law that the government is claiming to revoke the green card have gone beyond what Congress intended.“The government, as far as we understand, is relying on a rarely used provision in immigration law to justify the detention of a lawful permanent resident and his placement in removal proceeding,” he said. “It is a provision that basically says that if the secretary of state determines that a non-citizen’s presence or activity in this country poses a serious risk of adverse foreign policy consequences, then that person can be processed for removal. That provision is not only rarely used, it is certainly not intended by Congress to be used to silence dissent.”The New York Times recentlyreportedthat the state department’s rationale holds that its foreign policy to combat antisemitism around the world will be adversely affected by Khalil’s continued presence in the US, as the administration perceives most pro-Palestinian protests on campus as antisemitic.Bill Hing, professor of law and migration at University of San Francisco, said that simply invoking US foreign policy aims would not be enough. He said: “The government has to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that his presence or activities in the US has potential serious adverse foreign policy consequences. The question is, how will they prove that? If he has done nothing more than decry the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, or accuse Israel of genocide, and demand ceasefire, is that adverse to US foreign policy? I don’t think so. I think that is protected free speech.”Khalil’s lawyers are requesting that Furmanorder Khalil’s return to New York, enabling him to reunite with his wife, an American citizen who is expected to give birth next month. Baher Azmy, the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which is also representing Khalil, said that his legal team would be filing briefs dealing with both the legality of the detention and the venue dispute over the next week.Khalil’s legal team also includes the American Civil Liberties Union, the New York Civil Liberties Union, and his lawyer Amy Greer.Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the court. Margaret Jay Finch, holding a sign that read “Civil rights for all people”, said she was “so upset that Mahmoud is in the darkness in Louisiana. I can’t tell you.”The 83-year-old retiree added: “I feel so bad for his wife. I am so worried that this is against the first amendment and we’re going to lose our rights … This is such a dictatorship.”Other protesters held signs saying “Then they came for Mahmoud” and “Hands off our students, Ice off our campuses”. They chanted “Free, free, Palestine” and “Release Mahmoud right now” as they crowded into the large public square in lower Manhattan that is surrounded by grand civic buildings, including the federal courthouse with its imposing pillars and sweeping staircase.Actor and activist Susan Sarandon told the Guardian: “No matter where you stand on the genocide, freedom of speech affects everyone and this is a turning point in our history.”On Monday, Donald Trump said that Khalil’s presence in the US was “contrary to national and foreign policy interests” and said that the arrest was the first of “many to come”. The president has repeatedly promised to revoke the visas of international students who have participated in pro-Palestine protests.Furman has the authority to order Khalil’s release if he finds his rights were violated. The future of Khalil’s immigration status will be determined in a separate process in front of an immigration judge.Diala Shamas, another of Khalil’s lawyers, said that speaking out on the issue of Palestine was the “canary in the coal mine” for free speech.“Speaking out against what the Trump administration is doing does not give them the right to disappear our people … We need to fight as hard as we can for Mahmoud because of what this portends,” she said.Sam Levine contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNew YorkUS immigrationUS universitiesPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMahmoud KhalilMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We will hold the security area in Hermon and make sure that all the security zone in southern Syria is demilitarised and clear of weapons and threats,” Israel Katz said on a visit to the peak on Wednesday.After the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December, Israeli forcesmoved to control a 400 sq km demilitarised buffer zone in Syrian territory. The zone, which lies between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, was created by the UN after the 1973 Yom Kippur war, or Ramadan war as it is known in Arabic. A UN force of about 1,100 troops has patrolled the area since then.Assad was ousted by a coalition of rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has its origins in extremist Islamist organisations including both al-Qaida and the Islamic State.The new president of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, says he severed ties with extremist groups years ago and has promised a representative government and religious tolerance.However Israel officials believe the new Syrian regime and other armed groups active in the country remain a potential threat.Katz said the deployment on Mount Hermon was necessary to defend Israeli communities in northern Israel and on its contested borders.“Every morning when [al-Sharaa] opens his eyes at the presidential palace in Damascus, he will see the IDF watching him from the peak of the Hermon, and remember that we are here and in the entire security area of southern Syria, to protect the Golan and Galilee residents against any of his threats and those of his jihadist friends,” Katz told reporters who accompanied him, according tothe Times of Israel.Israel also wants to disruptIran’s ability to smuggle weaponsthrough Syria to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.Fear and uncertainty in Golan Heights as Israeli troops drive deeper into SyriaRead moreThe Israeli incursion into Syria in December sparked widespread international condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of exploiting the fall of the Assad regime for a land grab. Israel still controls the Golan Heights that it captured from Syria during the six-day war (1967) and later annexed – a move not recognised by most of the international community.The Times of Israel reported that the Israel Defence Force (IDF) has established nine military posts inside Syrian territory, including two on the 2,800m summit of Mount Hermon. Some are in newly fortified former Syrian army positions.In a speech last month, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he wanted“the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria”.Israeli warplanes have launched hundreds of strikes since the fall of Assad to destroy military equipment left by the former regime, and officials have described an extensive new zone stretching across much of southwestern Syria as territory that Israel will ensure is “demilitarised”. A new wave of attacks struck targets in southern Syria earlier this week.Israel had also offered protection to Syria’s Druze minority, many of whom live close to Israel’s borders. There is also a substantial Druze population within Israel.Some analysts have warned that Israel risks becoming mired in a complex conflict in Syria, possibly one recalling the country’s costly, long-term occupation of southern Lebanon from 1982 to 2000.Col (ret) Dr Jacques Neriah, an Israeli analyst, said: “I hope that we don’t have in mind an idea like we had in Lebanon. We were drowning in the Lebanese swamp for more than 20 years. Let’s hope we won’t be drowning in the Syrian swamp ... We said our intentions were only temporary and now we hear [something] different.”Al-Sharaa has repeatedly said he will not allow Syria to be used as a base for attacks on Israel.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said on Wednesday that a least 1,383 civilians had been killed in “executions by security forces and allied groups” after violence broke out last week in the coastal heartland of the Alawite minority, to which toppled president Bashar al-Assad belongs.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It started to get hot and smoke came into the shelter, and then someone shouted from the entrance: ‘Listen, they’re burning us.’ … There was silence in the shelter,” Wenkert told Channel 12.“I was very busy the whole time … It’s terrible to say that, busy taking people’s bodies and putting them on my head to protect my head if they come to shoot us again, if a grenade comes.”Wenkert survived but was forced into a pickup truck, driven into Gaza and hidden underground in a tunnel. His friendKim Damti,a 22-year-old Irish-Israeli, was killed in or around the shelter.Israel to cut off electricity in Gaza in apparent effort to force hand of HamasRead moreIn remarks widely reported in Israel, Wenkert said that he was held in a very small cell for much of his time in captivity, usually in complete darkness. The former restaurant manager described being punched, beaten with an iron bar, spat on and forced to do physical exercises.Mistreatment by his captors was often sparked by events during the war, Wenkert said.“Every hostage deal that falls through … it brings up a lot of frustration and rage and anger in them … That’s just one of the reasons [for the abuse], also some days when their father is killed, their families, their elders are killed. You feel it. You know exactly what’s happening,” Wenkert said.At night, there was “complete darkness, silence; absolute fear”, Wenkert said, saying he spoke to himself out loud for two hours a day in order to “stay sane”.About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the surpriseHamasraid into Israel and 251 taken hostage. In the ensuring Israeli offensive, more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, also mostly civilians, and much of the territory devastated.After a short-lived truce in November 2023, multiple efforts to secure a further pause in hostilities have failed.There was no independent confirmation of Wenkert’s statements, but they match those of manyother accounts.1:05Israeli hostages released by Hamas in Rafah and Nuseirat as part of ceasefire deal – videoSince a ceasefire deal came into effect in mid-January, 25 living Israeli hostages have been freed by Hamas and the remains of eight returned. Israel has freed 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees and withdrawn from many of its positions inGaza.Accounts of mistreatment and the poor physical condition of some released hostages have increased pressure on the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to agree a deal to secure the release of the 59 still held, of whom two-thirds are thought to be dead.The first phase of the ceasefire ended almost 10 days ago, but so far both Israel and Hamas have maintained a fragile de facto truce. There are currently daily Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, which have killed dozens. Israeli military officials say they are targeting militants who threaten their forces.Indirect talks are under way in Qatar but the demands of Israel and Hamas are proving difficult to reconcile. Israel has proposed an extension to the first phase of the ceasefire for up to 60 days along with further hostage and prisoner releases. Hamas want a definitive end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The efforts had been hindered by the remote, treacherous terrain, which has made communication and mobilisation difficult.The BLA had threatened to start killing hostages unless authorities met its 48-hour deadline for the release of Baloch political prisoners, activists and missing people it says had been abducted by the military.On Wednesday night, the group claimed in a statement it had killed 50 of the hostages over Pakistan’s “failure to engage in a serious prisoner exchange”.According to local media reports, the BLA had stationed suicide bombers in explosive vests close to some of the hostages, further complicating their rescue. “The terrorists are using innocent people as human shields,” an official told Radio Pakistan.Yousaf Bashir was among the passengers who were allowed to leave the train. Describing the moment that the train was held up by the militants, he said: “There was a huge blast. Everyone was scared and people were screaming and crying loudly. We laid down during the blasts. Everyone laid down in the train as there was firing too.”Where is Balochistan and why is it the target of Iran and Pakistan strikes?Read moreHe said militants had come over after the firing stopped and demanded all the passengers get off the train or be killed. “They freed my children, my wife and me too. They warned us not to look back and kept walking. I did not see how many people there were left behind,” said Bashir.Those the BLA allowed to leave the train described walking overnight to safety through the rugged mountain terrain for more than seven hours.In a written statement sent to the Guardian, the BLA said the hijacking was “a direct response to Pakistan’s decades-long colonial occupation of Balochistan and the relentless war crimes committed against the Baloch people”.Balochistan, a vast and underdeveloped region bordering Iran and Afghanistan, has for decades been home to a separatist insurgency fighting against the Pakistani state and military, which it has accused of neglecting and exploiting the region.“The Bolan operation is a tactical response to these atrocities, intended to demonstrate that the occupying forces are not invincible and that their continued presence in Balochistan will be met with unwavering resistance,” the BLA statement said.The BLA has recently ramped up its operations in Balochistan and has been behind some of the worst terrorist attacks in Pakistan in the past few years.Zahid Hussain, a security analyst, said the train hijacking was “unprecedented”. He added: “This attack shows the situation in Balochistan has become very challenging for the military. They have failed to contain the insurgency and militants are recruiting large numbers to carry out such attacks.”Explore more on these topicsPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The Stena Immaculate was anchored while waiting for space at a port in the Humber after travelling from the Peloponnese region of Greece.The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said on Wednesday that fires onboard the Solong had “greatly reduced” and that it was being held in a safe position off the coast of Yorkshire, having broken free of the Stena Immaculate on Monday night.Coastguard officials had hoped to board the Stena Immaculate to carry out an initial damage assessment on Wednesday before salvors could begin a full review of the wreckage.The Solong was sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands at a speed of about 16 knots, equivalent to 18mph, when it collided with the tanker.Both vessels caught fire after several explosions. Thirty-six crew were rescued, including Americans from the Stena Immaculate and the Russian and Filipino nationals that made up the Solong’s crew.Investigators said nothing was being ruled out, but added there was nothing at this point to suggest there was Russian state involvement in the incident.1:25Footage shows oil tanker and cargo vessel on fire in North Sea – video reportIt was initially feared the Solong, a container ship with a Portuguese flag, was carrying the highly toxic chemical sodium cyanide but its owner, the Hamburg-based maritime firm Ernst Russ, said four containers that had previously held the substance were empty.Air quality sampling carried out onshore had shown no toxins and modelling from the Met Office indicated no threat to the public, HM Coastguard said.Though the Solong drifted at least 2 miles south of the collision, it Solong is no longer expected to sink and is anchored with support from a tugboat. The Stena Immaculate is also being held in place by tugboats.Some of the jet fuel that was on the tanker, equivalent to 220,000 barrels in total, will have burned in what was described as a “massive fireball” but it remains likely some has spilled into the sea, causing possible environmental damage.On Wednesday evening Crowley, the maritime company managing the Stena Immaculate, said the fire on the oil tanker had gone out. There were “no visible signs of smoke or flame”, it said.The assistant chief coastguard, John Craig, said earlier: “A comprehensive counter-pollution response is in place and HM Coastguard continues to make preparations for any pollution that may occur as a result of the damage to the vessels.“We continue to engage actively with Humberside police, salvors, the port authorities and other agencies to protect the public and the environment as far as possible while continuing to respond to the developing situation.”Aerial surveillance flights did not identify any pollution on the surface of the water, the coastguard said on Wednesday evening.While it will take the Marine Accident Investigation Branch some time to fully investigate the causes of the crash, Humberside police launched a parallel investigation into the mariner’s suspected death.1:34Drone footage shows cargo ship and oil tanker after North Sea collision – videoOn Tuesday Ernst Russ confirmed to the Guardian that the ship’s master had been detained by Humberside police, adding: “The master and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations. Out of respect for the investigation and all involved we will not comment further at this time.”The senior investigating officer, DCS Craig Nicholson, said on Tuesday: “Extensive work has already been carried out, and we are working closely with our partners to understand what happened, and to provide support to all of those affected.“The man arrested remains in custody at this time whilst inquiries are under way, and we continue speaking with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Worldwide,more than half of adultsand a third of children are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050.While poor diet, inactivity, genetics, environmental toxins and underlying health conditions are known to increase the risk, scientists at the National Institute of Cardiology in Warsaw,Poland, wanted to study whether other factors were also relevant.The researchers examined the medical and general health data of 2,405 people with an average age of 50. Statistical analysis was used to ascertain links between increased body weight and age, marital status, mental health and other factors.Call to overhaul obesity diagnoses amid fears of over-reliance on BMIRead moreThe study, presented at this year’s European Congress onObesityin Málaga, Spain, found that married men were 3.2 times more likely to be obese than unmarried men, but there was no increase in obesity risk for married women. Marriage also increased the odds of being overweight by 62% in men and 39% in women.The findings came after a study conducted in China in 2024 found thatmale BMI increases for the first five years after marriage, owing to higher calorie intake and less exercise. It found being married was associated with a 5.2% increase in men being overweight and a 2.5% rise in men being obese.Anearlier studyby the University of Bath found that, on average, married men were 1.4kg heavier than their unmarried counterparts.The Warsaw research found age was also a factor in weight gain, with each year of increased age increasing the risk of being overweight by 3% in men and 4% in women, and the risk of obesity by 4% in men and 6% in women.Some factors appeared to affect the odds of obesity only in women, the scientists said. Being depressed doubled the risk of women being obese and inadequate health literacy increased it by 43%, while obesity was more common among women living in smaller communities. None of these factors increased men’s risk.Katharine Jenner, the director of the ObesityHealthAlliance, said: “This study is yet another reminder that excess weight is driven by a complex mix of social, psychological and wider environmental factors – not simply personal choice. With each passing year, the risk of living with overweight or obesity increases, particularly for women. Meanwhile, the link between marriage and obesity in men highlights how lifestyle changes, habits, and societal expectations shape our health.“The research also suggests that men may be more likely to gain weight after marriage due to factors like increased portion sizes, social eating, and a decline in physical activity, whereas women perhaps remain more conscious of body weight due to societal pressures.“Instead of blaming individuals, we need policies that make healthy choices the easy choices – through better food environments, education, and support at every stage of life.”Joanna Syrda, a lecturer in business economics at the University of Bath, said the Warsaw study “confirms what I found in 2017: male BMI increases after marriage and decreases just before and after divorce. The main possible reasons are that single men looking for a partner have higher incentives and exert more effort to stay fit than those who are already or still married. And second, those in relationships may eat more regular meals and/or richer foods due to social obligations, which may arise because of marriage.”Jim Pollard, a consultant at the Men’s Health Forum, cautioned against over-interpreting the results. He said increased BMI in marriage could be a result of stressful careers with long hours and unhealthy meals.“Men are more likely to die prematurely of heart disease and cancer, and weight is a key factor in these conditions. We need a more targeted approach to tackling men’s and women’s obesity. The government has promised both a men’s health strategy and a women’s health strategy – this research shows how important it is to get them right.”Explore more on these topicsHealthMedical researchMarriageWomenMenFamilyMen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

He had also been accused of describing himself as a solicitor on a constituency website that is no longer online.The error on the LinkedIn profile was corrected and the SRA said it had decided not to take further action because “there is no need”.But in February, after the shadow justice secretary,Robert Jenrick, accused Reynolds of “criminal conduct” and wrote to the SRA demanding a new inquiry, the SRAreopened its investigationinto allegations the business secretary had incorrectly claimed to have worked as a solicitor.At the time, the regulator would not say why it had changed its position, only that it had “now become aware of further information”.Last month, Reynoldstold the Guardianthat “over a decade ago” he had “used shorthand” in a speech that was “not a speech about the legal profession or legal regulation or the law”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution (CR) without any input, any input, from congressional Democrats,” Schumer said of the Republican-drafted bill,which passed the House on Tuesday.“Our caucus is unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,” he continued, referring to a short-term bill that would temporarily extend federal funding. “We should vote on that.”To avert a shutdown, Congress must act to extend federal funding by midnight on Friday. Changes – or a new bill entirely – would also need to pass the House before the deadline. The House speaker adjourned the chamber after the bill passed on Tuesday, deliberately sending members home and in effect daring the Senate to reject their bill.Trump officials to reconsider whether greenhouse gases cause harm amid climate rollbacksRead moreSenate Democrats could still reverse course as the reality of a government shutdown – at a moment whenDonald Trumpand his billionaire adviserElon Muskare working to permanently shut down parts of the government – comes into clearer focus. Several Senate Democrats have expressed an openness to voting for the measure, citing their distaste for government shutdowns. “I disagree with many points in the CR, but I will never vote to shut our government down,” John Fetterman, the Democratic senator of Pennsylvaniatweetedon Tuesday.ButDemocratsare also under mounting pressure from their base to take a stronger stand against Trump and Republicans.Senate Republicans hold a narrow 53-seat majority, well shy of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the legislation. Senator Rand Paul, a staunch fiscal hawk, has indicated his opposition to the House bill, meaning eight Democrats would likely need to support the bill for it to overcome procedural hurdles to reach a final vote in the chamber.Democrats have raised concerns about the discretion the measure gives to theTrump administrationon spending decisions as it pursues massive cuts to the federal workforce.From the annual House Democratic caucus retreat in Leesburg, Virginia, on Wednesday, caucus leaders implored their Senate counterparts to follow their lead and unite against the government funding bill.“I don’t know why anyone would support that bill,” California congressman Pete Aguilar, the House Democratic caucus chair, told reporters during a press conference earlier on Wednesday.The 99-page House-passed measure provides a $6bn boost to military budgets while carving out $13bn from non-defense spending – which Democrats say amounts to an assault on critical programs for vulnerable Americans.Republicans’ “defunding bill is going to wreak havoc on working families”, Katherine Clark, the House Democratic whip, told reporters on Wednesday, assailing cuts that she said could result in domestic violence survivors being evicted andless funding for Alzheimer’sprevention research.“Whether it’s born out of cruelty, cowardice or corruption are all three, the GOP is hell bent on making families at home unsafe,” she added.The House voted 217-213 to approve a bill that would keep federal agencies funded through 30 September. All Democrats with the exception of Jared Golden, a conservative from Maine, voted for it.Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a committed deficit hawk who often bucks his party on fiscal matters, voted no, defying Trump’s demand that all House Republicans support the bill. After the vote, Trump derided Massie as a “GRANDSTANDER” and threatened to oust the seven-term lawmaker from office.In a joint statement, the House Democratic leaders backed Schumer’s call for a short-term funding extension and urged Republicans to return to Washington to consider it.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsRepublicansTrump administrationUS politicsUS SenateUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

This move won’t stand up in court. We’re going to fight it every step of the way.”In all, the EPA issued 31 announcements within just a few hours that take aim at almost every major environmental rule designed to protect Americans’ clean air and water, as well as a livable climate.The barrage included a move to overturn a Biden-era plan to slash pollution spewing from coal-fired power plants, which itself was a reduced version of an Obama administration initiative that was struck down by the supreme court.The EPA will also revisit pollution standards for cars and trucks, which Zeldin said had imposed a “crushing regulatory regime” upon auto companies that are now shifting towards electric vehicles, considering weakening rules limiting sooty air pollution that’s linked to an array of health problems, potentially axing requirements that power plants not befoul waterways or dump their toxic waste and considering further narrowing how it implements the Clean Water Act in general.The stunning broadside of actions against pollution rules could, if upheld by the courts, reshape Americans’ environment in ways not seen since major legislation was passed in the 1970s to end an era of smoggyskiesandburning riversthat became the norm following American industrialization.Pollutants from power plants, highways and industry cause a range of heart, lung and other health problems, with greenhouse gases among this pollution driving up the global temperature and fueling catastrophicheatwaves,floods,stormsand other impacts.“Zeldin’s EPA is dragging America back to the days before the Clean Air Act, when people were dying from pollution,” said Dominique Browning, director of the Moms Clean Air Force. “This is unacceptable. And shameful. We will oppose with all our hearts to protect our children from this cruel, monstrous action.”The EPA’s moves come shortly after its decision toshutterall its offices that deal with addressing the disproportionate burden of pollution faced by poor people and minorities in the US, amid a mass firing of agency staff. Zeldin has also instructed that $20bn in grants to help address the climate crisis be halted, citing potential fraud. Democrats have questioned whether these moves are legal.Former EPA staff have reacted with shock to the upending of the agency.“Today marks the most disastrous day in EPA history,” said Gina McCarthy, who was EPA administrator under Obama. “Rolling these rules back is not just a disgrace, it’s a threat to all of us. The agency has fully abdicated its mission to protect Americans’ health and wellbeing.”The Trump administration has promised additional environmental rollbacks in the coming weeks. The Energy Dominance Council that the president established last month is looking to eliminate a vast array of regulations in an effort to boost the fossil fuel industry, the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, told the oil and gas conference CeraWeek in Houston on Wednesday. “We will come up with the ways that we can cut red tape,” he said. “We can easily get rid of 20-30% of our regulations.”Additional reporting by Dharna NoorExplore more on these topicsUS Environmental Protection AgencyClimate crisisTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsPollutionFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the continuing dehumanization of the Palestinian people that has resulted in horrific hate crimes against Palestinian-Americans, the US-enabled genocide inGaza, and decades of denial of Palestinian human rights by successive presidential administrations.”Trump sought to insult Schumer while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, while sitting with the Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin.Energized neo-Nazis feel their moment has come as Trump changes everythingRead more“Schumer is a Palestinian,” Trump said, amid rambling and incoherent remarks about Democrats in Congress, the war in Ukraine, conflict between Israel and Hamas and a looming government shutdown, which Democrats can avoid if enough of their senators vote with Republicans who hold the chamber, putting Schumer in a difficult political position.“As far as I’m concerned, he’s become a Palestinian,” Trump said. “He used to be Jewish. He’s not Jewish any more. He’s a Palestinian.”Trump has abused Schumer in such terms before, calling him a Palestinian and“a proud member of Hamas”. The president has also regularly questioned why Jewish Americans would vote for Democrats, even amid growing concern about antisemitism among his own aides, advisers and followers.On Wednesday, Schumer did not immediately comment.Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America (JDCA),said: “Donald Trump doesn’t get to decide who is Jewish. Senator Schumer is the country’s highest ranking Jewish American official, and ‘Palestinian’ should not be used as an insult.”She added: “These comments are abhorrent but revealing, and it’s time to call it like it is –Donald Trumpis a depraved antisemite, Islamophobe and bigot, which is why the vast majority of Jewish voters have not and will never support him.”Amy Spitalnick, the chief executive of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs,said: “Again, the goal for this administration isn’t to counter antisemitism or protect Israel. It’s to weaponize antisemitism to go after their political enemies, advance an extreme agenda, and undercut democracy – and it only makes Jews less safe.”In the Oval Office, Martin was asked if as the leader of one of three European countries that recognizes the state of Palestine – the other two being Norway and Spain – he would “inform the president of your views on Gaza”.“I don’t have to inform the president,” Martin said. “He is very well clued into the whole situation. We share the president’s unrelenting focus on peace.”When the same reporter asked about Trump’s recentsuggestionPalestinians should be forced to leave Gaza so the US can redevelop the land, Trump interjected, saying: “Nobody’s expelling any Palestinians,” and mocked the reporter for being from Voice of America, a broadcast network run by the federal government.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpChuck SchumerUS politicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The subpoena also asks the hotel to give evidence about “an alleged violation” of federal immigration law.A source shared the document on the condition that the Guardian not share the name of their employer because the hotel is now part of a federal criminal investigation.The subpoena marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. New York City is currently seeing a flurry of protests and demonstrations in defense of Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil, who is being targeted by the administration for deportation over his participation in pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations.The federal subpoena, sent to the hotel Wednesday by prosecutors for the southern district of New York, also appears to seek information about New York City government officials. It asks the hotel to provide the names of “entities and/or individuals that are responsible for the funding” of the “illegal immigrant/migrant shelter programs”.Officials for the mayor, Eric Adams, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.Two of the prosecutors named in the subpoena – Kevin Grossinger, assistant United States attorney, and Scott Laragy with the criminal division of the Department of Justice – declined to comment on the subpoena. In an email, a justice department spokesperson declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.Nicholas Biase, chief of public affairs for the US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York, did not immediately respond to a request for comment as of publication.In a phone call, Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition, criticized the subpoena, calling it an example of the Trump administration “weaponizing” the Department of Justice against New York City residents: “Instead of wasting government time and resources, we should be thinking of how we improve the daily lives of all the people who call this country home.”Since 2022, New York City’s municipal government has contracted with numerous hotels, including several prominent ones in midtown Manhattan, to help shelter an influx of immigrants seeking asylum. The shelters quickly became the sites of local political backlash andrightwing furor nationally.In February, Adamsannouncedhe would close an immigrant intake center at one of those sites, the Roosevelt Hotel. The decision came just weeks after Trump justice officials began movingto drop corruption chargesagainst the mayor, a move that sparked numerous Department of Justice resignations.Adams has denied the allegations against him.Trump has been in office for less than two months, but has been active in enforcing his administration’s promised crackdown on immigration in the US. According to detention management data from the Department of Homeland Security, February 2025 saw more arrests than in any month in the last seven years.US immigrationdetention is also filled to capacity, at 47,600 detainees, a senior US Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said on a call with reporters on Wednesday, Reuters reported.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,” she said.The retaliatory measures include Brussels reimposing tariffs on US goods including bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes, which it introduced during the first Trump term and later suspended after talks with his successor, Joe Biden.These tariffs, which target notable US goods worth €4.5bn, often from Republican states, will snap back on 1 April. The list was worth €6.3bn in 2018 but has shrunk because of Brexit and declining US exports.Separately, the commission plans further retaliation targeting goods worth €18bn, including a wide range of steel and aluminium products, as well as agricultural produce, such as poultry, beef, seafood and nuts. These tariffs would be imposed from mid-April, after a vote by EU member states and consultations with industry in an attempt to minimise damage to the European economy.“We try to hit … where it hurts,” said a senior EU official, who said the bloc was targeting soya beans, which are grown in Louisiana, the state of the US speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. “We love soybeans, but we’re happy to buy them from Brazil or from Argentina or from anywhere else.”While the commission announced that its measures would total €26bn, EU officials later said they would probably target €22.5bn of US goods, as some products were likely to be filtered out after talks with businesses and member states.However, further steps have not been ruled out. France’s European affairs minister, Benjamin Haddad, said on Wednesday that the EU could “go further” in its response to the US tariffs. The measures “are proportionate”, Haddad told TF1 television. “If it came to a situation where we had to go further, digital services or intellectual property could be included,” he said.GraphEU officials hope that pressure on Republican states and US business will help bring about a deal.“We will always remain open to negotiation,” von der Leyen said. “We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.”While the UK did not announce retaliatory measures, Keir Starmer did not rule them out in future. The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday he was “disappointed” by the tariffs, but would “take a pragmatic approach”.He said Britain was “negotiating an economic deal which covers and will include tariffs if we succeed. But we will keep all options on the table”.Starmer, who had previously said thatthe UK did not need to choose between the EU and the US, had already announced on Tuesday that Britainwould not respond with its own counter-tariffs, after last-ditch efforts to persuade Trump to spare British industry from his global tariffs failed.EU officials said they were talking to counterparts in other countries, including the UK, Switzerland, Norway,Canadaand Japan, but there had not been any coordination over responses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2019, Switzerland, one of the EU’s closest trading partners, complained when it was affected by EU restrictions on steel imports designed to protect EU industry.On Wednesday night Trump said he would impose additional penalties if the EU followed through with its plan. “Whatever they charge us, we’re charging them,” he told reporters.The UK steel industry warned that Trump’s tariffs would have “hugely damaging consequences for UK suppliers and their customers in the US”.Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade association UK Steel, said: “President Trump must surely recognise that the UK is an ally, not a foe. Our steel sector is not a threat to the US but a partner to key customers, sharing the same values and objectives in addressing global overcapacity and tackling unfair trade.“These tariffs couldn’t come at a worse time for the UK steel industry, as we battle with high energy costs and subdued demand at home, against an oversupplied and increasingly protectionist global landscape.”Bernd Lange, the German Social Democratic MEP who chairs the European parliament’s trade committee, described the tariffs as “another dose of self-inflicted tariff pain by the Trump administration”.He said the latest tariffs were “particularly bad” because “they target US trade partners, they are set arbitrarily, without legal and economic justifications, and they fail to address non-market overcapacity – the main issue steel and aluminium industry across the Atlantic is confronted with”.The introduction of EU measures came after a day of drama on Tuesday, when Trumpthreatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminiumin response to Canadian threats to increase electricity prices for US customers.The US president backed off from those plans after the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, agreed to suspend his province’s decision to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropean UnionTrump administrationInternational tradeUS politicsCanadaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, energy prices cooled a bit, rising 0.2% in February compared with 1.1% in January.While inflation has declined sharply from its peak just above 9% in 2022, price increases have remained above theFederal Reserve’starget rate of 2%. The closest inflation has gotten to the target rate was in September, when inflation hit 2.4%.The Fed had spent the last few years adjusting interest rates in an attempt to gently lower inflation without hurting the labor market. At the end of last year, it seemed as if the Fed would achieve the so-called “soft landing”: prices were coming down, and theunemployment rateremained relatively low at around 4%. The Fed lowered interest rates three times last year. The central bank meets next week and is expected to leave rates unchanged.Line chart showing the inflation rate for February 2025But the slow and steady recovery from the inflationary heights reached after the Covid pandemic has been jolted by Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The president has stuck to his campaign promise to usetariffsagainst the US’s key trading partners, arguing they have taken advantage of the US and done too little to halt the flow of illegal drugs into the country.So far, he has tacked on an extra 20% tariff on all imports from China and50% tariffson steel and aluminum exports from Canada. Threats of other tariffs, including a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada, are still up in the air.The instability of Trump’s trade policies has rockedUS stock markets, which has cratered downwards over the last week.The White House has batted awaywarningsthat reactionary trade policies could destabilize the economy and even cause a recession. Wall Street went down even further on Monday, after Trump didn’t rule out a possible recession,sayingon Sunday that the country is in “a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big”.The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has all but directly confirmed that the central bank will hold rates steady at its next meeting, on 18-19 March. In prepared remarks on 7 March, Powellsaidthat the “costs of being cautious are very, very low” given that the economy is in a stable place – for now.“The economy’s fine. It doesn’t need us to do anything, really. And so we can wait, and we should wait,” Powell said.Taking pains to avoid any overtly political statements, Powell said that there is “heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook” but “it remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment”.Explore more on these topicsUS economyInflationEconomicsTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Teams of linemen in white crane trucks lined up to move traffic lights out of the way of the cargo, which measured up to three-quarters the length of a football field.In 37 deliveries over the past 11 months,Intelhad planned everything to a T, the final superload landing last month in Licking county at the first greenfield site the company has opened for 40 years. Since the $28bn project was announced in September 2022, construction crews have logged more than 6.4m work hours on the site and seas of concrete have been poured.But while Intel has succeeded in the world of logistics, as a company, it’s hanging on by a thread.Intel shares fell by 60% last year, with the company besieged by competition from Nvidia and problems emerging around itsadvanced 18A artificial intelligence chips. In November, it lost its spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after vowing in August to cut15,000 jobs or 15% of its global workforce.Lawsuits and accusations of complacency at what was at one time a world leader in chip manufacturing have shaken the company to its foundations.Rumors aboundthat the company may be broken up and sold to its rivals.Now, that instability is being keenly felt here inOhio.Construction on the first of its two fabrication plants, meant to herald a new manufacturing age for the so-called Rust belt region, was supposed to finish later this year, but last year, that was pushed back to 2026-27. Then on 28 February, the dates were put back again, this time to 2030-31.While that may be bad news for Intel investors and stockholders, it’s equally troubling for residents and community leaders in Licking county, who are set to find themselves dealing with construction works for another five years.“Number one, Intel generally has been a good neighbor, so we’re not in any way anti-Intel,” says the Licking county commissioner Tim Bubb.“[But] a lot of promises were made that were very bold. These delays … that’s the frustration for local officials. Promises were made to try to jumpstart the process and yet at the same time Intel is struggling with the technology of the new generation of chips and trying to get in the game. Their competitors are not standing still.”Bubb says that some locals are concerned because what could happen at the plant next “is a complete unknown”.Intel executives say the delays are due to “broader market demand”.In November, Intel received$1.5bn in Chips Act fundingfor the project, a move that was seen as cementing the future of the company in Ohio, despite the delays.But its competitors’ advancements in the industry have shifted the ground under Intel.On 3 March, the Trump administrationannounced a $100bn investmentin Arizona-based semiconductor manufacturing plants for the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), despite itfacing similar delay issues. In his 4 March speech to Congress, Trump called the Chips Act funding that, among other projects, brought Intel to Ohio a “horrible, horrible thing”.The enormous site, about a thousand acres, or an area larger than New York City’s Central Park, is today still a hive of activity. Street sweepers clear mud from freshly laid asphalt and the hum of generators and heavy machinery fill the early spring air. Traffic on the single-lane rural roads around what has been labelled Ohio’s largest-ever project is heavy.Tellingly, however, “For sale’” signs in front of homes and on farmland dot the landscape around the site.“None of us are happy about them taking away our country living,” says Robert V who asked not to be fully identified and whose home, built almost 40 years ago less than a hundred feet from the site, has today a large “for sale” sign in its front yard.“We built our home from bare land and have it exactly how we want it. We just dumped $250,000 in add-ons and remodeling. No, we are not happy and would love for it to go back to how it was.”Intel also appears to be losing the race to meet a critical construction deadline.The Columbus Dispatch reports that the state of Ohio offered the company $300m in grants “to help with the construction of each factory”, in return for finishing the building work by the end of 2028.But with its most recent announcement stating construction won’t be finished until 2030 at the earliest, that funding may be in jeopardy.An Intel spokesperson said: “2029 is still several years away and as Naga [Chandrasekaran, the head of Intel Foundry’s global manufacturing operations]states in his message, Intel is “maintaining the flexibility to accelerate work and the start of operations if customer demand warrants.”For Donny Barnard, the mayor of Johnstown, a town of 5,000 people two miles from the site, the repeated delays have been a good thing.“I’m not sure what it’s like for [Intel] but I look at this rollback as a godsend. You only get one chance to develop your town and do it right. For us this is our opportunity,” he says, adding that Intel took the time to tell city leaders of the latest delay in advance of its public statement on 28 February.“I do believe there will be a microchip plant there. Whose name is on it I don’t know. That’s not something I can control. I believe it would be hard to walk away from what they’ve done already.”Others, however, say the delays have created major uncertainty in what was a rural, largely farming area that in recent years has been gearing up for a major economic transition. Bubb says that Licking county officials were told repeatedly by state officials that offshoot and secondary businesses would relocate to be close to Intel.“We were preparing for companies to come,” he says. “But here’s the deal: some companies have done some looking but none have pulled the trigger.”Explore more on these topicsOhioIntelUS economyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianMangroves are being destroyed and residents displaced to make way for an airport to serve president Nayib Bukele’s vision of a tax-free economic hubByCamilo Freedman in San Salvador, El Salvador, words and photographsSupported byAbout this contentWed 12 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTShareWhen Nayib Bukele launched his presidential campaign in the eastern department of La Unión in 2018, the new outsider politician stood in a street packed with supporters and promised a new airport. La Unión and the rest ofEl Salvador’s eastern region have historically been neglected by governments, with few infrastructure projects and widespread poverty.Just a month later, Bukeletravelled to Germanyto lobby for his project. “Munich airport is interested in operating our new airport that we will build in La Unión,” he said.A few years passed and the airport plan seemed to fade. Until last year: as the hardline president pushed for re-election, his government began to fast-track the project. Afterbeing re-electedin February 2024, Bukele – who has called himself the “world’s coolest dictator” – started clearing the way for a runway for the new Pacific Airport in the middle of one of the few remaining mangrove forests in the country.View image in fullscreenConstruction on Pacific airport has recently begun.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianFor the Salvadoran government, the airport isn’t just an isolated project, but one that fits into a grander plan: the “Bitcoin City”, another ambitious promise from his government. Bukele envisions a tax-free economic hub, with the airport a key part of making it accessible to international investors and crypto entrepreneurs.Elmer Martínez’s family was among 225 households displaced from his community, Flor de Mangle, and neighbouring El Condadillo to make space for the 3km runway.View image in fullscreenElmer Martínez says he and his neighbours were subjected to what they considered ‘predatory negotiations’.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianMartínez, a local representative of themovement for the ancestral peoples of El Salvador, and his neighbours were first approached in 2022 by government officials. In the following years, they went through what they considered “predatory negotiations” for the agricultural-based communities to sell their homes in exchange for “inadequate compensation”.Mangroves have suffered in the past century. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,at least 20%of the world’s mangrove forests have disappeared since 1980. El Salvador’s percentage is far higher:60% in the past five decades.One of El Salvador’s last saltwater forests, La Unión’s mangrove is part of theGulf of Fonseca conservation area. It shelters abundant wildlife, including the critically endangeredyellow-naped amazon(Amazona auropalliata).Mangroves are nutrient factories, says Olga Tejada, a biologist at the University ofEl Salvador. “They feed the entire ecosystem and the communities that depend on them and absorb massive amounts of carbon dioxide, helping to fight climate change,” she says. “But they are fragile. Even small changes in soil salinity can kill them from the roots up.”View image in fullscreenLocal people say their livelihoods depend on the mangrove forests.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianStudies show that intact mangrove forests cansignificantly reduce hurricane damage. Scientists have found that deforestation in Guerrero, Mexico,worsened the devastationcaused byHurricane Otisin 2023. La Unión’s mangroves serve a similar protective role, shielding coastal communities from extreme weather events that arebecoming more frequentdue to the climate crisis.The risks of building an airport on former mangrove land go beyond environmental damage, as they could threaten the project itself. “Mangroves grow in soft, unstable soil,” Tejada says. “Even if sediment hardens over time, an airport built on it in a highly seismic country like El Salvador could be dangerously unstable.”The vanishing mangroves of El Salvador: ‘All our efforts may only slow the destruction’Read moreShe points to the2001 earthquake, a 7.7 magnitude disaster thatliquefiedparts of the mangrove forest.While the government touts the La Unión airport as a gamechanger for the region’s economy, critics argue that the benefits will be concentrated in the hands of a few.Bukele disagrees. “In 10 years, it is expected to generate 50,000 direct and indirect jobs, contributing 1.5% to the GDP annually, according to feasibility studies,” he said at an eventto lay the foundation stone, last month.According to the president, the airport would be a key resource to make Bitcoin City an attractive place for crypto-enthusiasts to live, and an express train line willconnect the city to the airport and port.View image in fullscreenMartínez walks near the construction site where trees have been cut down.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianBut many residents say they are being shut out of the opportunities that corporate tourism giants will seize. “They tell us this will bring prosperity, but we can’t invest. And the little money they’re offering us to leave barely buys a house, let alone land to farm,” says Adan Sosa, an agricultural worker who says he was offered $75,000 (£58,000) for his home and a separate plot where he grows crops.The rising cost of land near the airport has made it almost impossible for small businesses and local vendors to establish themselves in the new economy, leaving many to ponder who will genuinely benefit.Land prices in the area have soared by up to 3,200%since 2000, making ownership unattainable for most residents.For Dimas Bautista, one of the community’s founders and a lifelong fisher, the impact is already hitting home. “A few months ago, the government banned us from passing through the construction site to reach the mangroves, so now we have to take longer, riskier routes,” he says.View image in fullscreenDimas Bautista says animals are leaving the mangroves.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianBautista says the airport threatens people like him, whose livelihoods depend on the mangrove’s resources: “The animals are already leaving. Those that can’t move will probably disappear too. And when they do, so will our way of putting food on the table.”The Bukele administration has followed a pattern of environmental deregulation, such asthe reversal of El Salvador’s mining ban, the$1bn (£770m) increase in construction projectssince his first term, and the continued push for monoculture crops such as sugar cane.Tejada says mangroves are an easy target, as they are government owned and can be leased to private interests. “A lot of mangroves have been owned by individuals, and no one paid attention to a concessioned area being handed in with 100 acres [40 hectares] of mangrove and being returned with half of the forest mass,” he says.View image in fullscreenMartínez says the destruction of the mangroves is not just about the trees but about survival.Photograph: Camilo Freedman/The GuardianAlong with rising sea levels and agrochemical pollution, campaigners say unchecked urban development is a mounting threat to El Salvador’s mangroves. Bukele’s administration has already fast-tracked major projects, including the railway line, which will link La Unión to the rest of the country. Conservationists fear the rapid expansion will come at the expense of ecosystems that have safeguarded coastal communities for centuries.For Martínez and his neighbours, the destruction of the mangroves isn’t just about trees – it’s about survival. “They turned our home into a cemetery,” he says, looking at the barren land where a freshwater spring once flowed. “First the forest dies, then the water. Finally, we do too.”Explore more on these topicsSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanEl SalvadorTrees and forestsDeforestationBitcoinConservationAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is both, but not in equal measure. In the near-term, his tariff-led approach to trade will cause problems for Beijing. However, in just a few weeks he has done more damage to the liberal international order, the cohesion of the democratic west, and the US’s global standing, than all the combined efforts to undermine them in the entirety of the cold war. This goes beyond the wildest dreams China’s leaders could have had.The tariffs already leviedare serious enough, and Beijing cannot but see them as a harbinger of more to come. Unlike during his first term, this time Trump seems prepared to deliver the threats he makes. With China’s economy already misfiring, an intensified trade war is the last thing Beijing needs, despite the bravado of its diplomats.But the tariffs and even a full-blown trade war amount to a short- to medium-term challenge.Xi Jinpingwill order China to stand fast, so it will. The price to pay will be high. But it will be more than compensated by the gifts Trump is unwittingly presenting to Xi, particularly over the longer term.Trump’s proposal for peace in Ukraine, apparently largely on Russian terms, and his naked ambition over Canada and Greenland are of enormous value toChina. He has damaged relations with US allies in North America and Europe, and indicated the US will step back from commitments to international projects such as USAid, the UN and the World Health Organization.Why is this cherished in Beijing? It is because China has developed a global strategy based onXi Jinping Thought. Its goal is to fulfil the China Dream of national rejuvenation by 2049, the centenary of the founding of the People’s Republic. Trump has made Xi’s dream more realisable.In plain English, Xi’s strategic objective is to make China great again on Chinese terms. More specifically, it aims to “restore” China to a position of global pre-eminence, which Xi believes China regularly enjoyed when it was the most powerful, rich, innovative and civilised country at different times in history.The route to restoration is through what Xi calls the “democratisation of international relations”. Once achieved, China will lead the world to forge the “common destiny for humankind”, guided by Xi’s suite of three global initiatives, on development, security and civilisation.This is not about creating an alternative world order from scratch to replace the US-led liberal international order put in place at the end of the second world war. Rather, it is about transforming the existing order into one that is sino-centric with the support of the global south. It means making sure the UN system prioritises the interests and desires of the global south, represented by its leader, China, over that of the west.Doing so represents “democratisation” as a clear majority of UN member states, and the overwhelming majority of humanity, are in the global south. While China’s narrative does have appeal in the global south, particularly among leaders of autocracies, it gets almost nowhere in rich democratic countries.For eight decades the democracies had mostly stood by the US despite occasional major quarrels, such as the Suez Crisis in 1956 or the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The solidarity of the democratic west helped it win the cold war and reshape the world afterwards. Chinese diplomatic efforts to get European countries to split with the US after Trump first put forth his Ukraine plan had no effect.For China to successfully transform the UN system it must show that the existing international system is so broken that it needs reconstruction based on a better blueprint. For all its efforts in the global south, including the massive investment of resources under theBelt and Road Initiative, China has only made limited headway.By humiliatingly intimidating Ukraine into peace talks, dismissively pushing European nations around and largely accepting Russia’s terms for ending the war, Trump has fundamentally changed US relations with its allies. He has delivered what Chinese diplomacy cannot achieve.Trump has made the US’s Nato allies realise they cannot rely on it. He posed an existential threat to America’s closest ally, Canada, and challenged the sovereign rights of another Nato ally, Denmark. It demonstrated to the world that as the “shining house on the hill” the US now radiates not brightness, hope and a shining example, but darkness driven by narrow self-interest.View image in fullscreenA cargo ship destined for countries jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative leaves Qingdao Port in Qingdao, China.Photograph: Costfoto/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAbove all, Trump has enabled China to accuse the US of hypocrisy. Beijing can now assert that the US has revealed its true nature, and will use the liberal international order to put America first. It is therefore an international order that is unfit for the 21st century, one that requires fundamental changes. This fits Xi’s global strategy to a T.While Xi’s efforts to persuade the global south to embrace China’s push to transform how the UN system works had been making only slow progress, they have now been turbocharged by Trump. With the poorest and weakest in the global south starting to suffer from the cutting off of US humanitarian aid, China’s call to democratise international relations gains traction by the day. No one has made the Chinese case better than Trump.In putting America first, Trump has done more than Xi has ever managed to make China great again. Xi’s China Dream has not yet come true, but with Trump’s help, it has made a great leap forward.Steve Tsang is director of the China Institute at Soas University of London and co-author of The Political Thought of Xi JinpingExplore more on these topicsChinaOpinionDonald TrumpXi JinpingAsia PacificUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

The institute has criticised budget rules that limit the scope for extra taxes and borrowing.The report found about half of the stagnation in real wages could be attributed to weak productivity growth, while tax and benefit changes accelerated the decline, stripping many families of financial support and hitting average living standards.A lack of productivity growth was to blame for much of the fall in living standards after the 2008 financial crisis.While other industrialised nations have suffered a fall in productivity, the UK has been among the hardest hit. The average UK worker is about 20% less productive than their French and German counterparts and 30% less productive than US workers, it said.The institute said it estimated that achieving the same rise in productivity as the US would make UK workers “more than £4,000 better off today”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Organised by the local government, the training session on safe and legal migration is among a handful of interventions in a country making headlines around the world as undocumented Indian migrants are rounded up and sent back home.The training could not have been more timely.On the same day – 5 February – a US military aircraft touched down in Amritsar, Punjab,with 104 undocumented Indiansbrought back to the country in shackles and handcuffs. Two more US aircraft, carrying another 229, landed on 16 and 17 February. There were also a growing number of reports of “Trump-style” immigration raidstargeting Indians in the UK.Devika and most of the other students of the State Institute of Medical Education and Technology’s college of nursing have just sat their final exams and hope to migrate safely to a western or Middle Eastern country.But though India has laws that require people applying for jobs abroad or migrating to seek work to get official clearance before they travel, many in the class express their fear of being scammed by fraudulent agencies. Illegal routes feed on the desperation of those looking for a better life and flourish in the cracks in the enforcement of these laws.View image in fullscreenUS immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detain a man in Denver, Colorado, U.S., February, 2025.Photograph: Kevin Mohatt/Reuters“I want to migrate in a truthful and trustworthy way,” says Devika, who learns that authentic agencies will have an overseas recruitment licence from India’s Ministry of External Affairs’ protector of emigrants (POE). Blacklisted companies can be found on anIndian government portal.Kerala’s Department of Non-Resident Keralites Affairs (Norka) has been offering safe migration training for nearly two decades, but demand for the sessions is soaring. Until two years ago, Norka trained 750 to 1,000 candidates a year, but in 2024 it accepted 2,250.India is among the top countries sending nurses abroad, helping to fill a worldwide care gap.The World Health Organizationpredicts a global shortage of 4.5 million nurses in 2030, with western and Middle Eastern countries already feeling the effects on their health systems.Approximately640,000 Indian nurses work abroad. While most are employed in the Gulf states, English-speaking countries including Australia, the US, the UK and Canada are also popular destinations.While Norka’s training sessions are meant for all prospective migrants, so far it has focused on nurses due to the number leaving Kerala for other countries, say officials.View image in fullscreenIndia has the largest diaspora in the world, with over 35.4 million Indians overseas. A Norka trainer explains legal routes for migration.Photograph: Ashish K Vincent/The Migration StoryDemand for nursing courses has surged across the country, with many drawn to the profession as a “ready ticket to an overseas career”, says Prof Praveena Kodoth, an expert on migration fromthe Centre for Development Studies.Alveena Maria, Devika’s classmate, is surprised to discover that nurses can register as migrant workers free or for a minimal fee with Norka, and also apply for vacancies through two of Kerala’s state recruitment agencies. “My cousin spent 300,000 rupees (£2,700) to get a job as a nurse in Ireland. I may not have to spend so much,” she says.Kerala set up Norka in 1996, but it has focused more on migration governance in recent years. It works to create diaspora networks, with programmes offering financial and legal aid to migrants, and capital assistance to people who return and wish to set up businesses in India.It’s not easy to take action against illegal agencies … they are working outside the ambit of the law-enforcing agenciesAjith Kolassery, Norka CEOIn 2021, Norka became the first state agency in India to sign an agreement with the German government for the deployment of healthcare professionals. So far, more than 1,400 Kerala nurses have been recruited, an official says.K Vasuki, secretary of Norka, says the agency tackled illegal recruitment in the past but “more on a reactive basis”. “As soon as we get complaints, we act. But now we are hoping to create a framework where you take a proactive step,” she says.But agencies scamming aspiring migrants continue to make headlines in the state. Self-styled migration “consultants” target students by offering them part-time jobs in foreign countries as a step towards permanent residency.India’s Ministry of External Affairs website – which helps Indian workers find employment abroad – has a list of more than 3,000 “unregistered agencies against which grievances [have been’] received”.Data from the government’s e-migrateplatformshows complaints have been lodged against 208 Kerala agencies. Last year, thestate formed a taskforceto combat illegal recruitment. Officials say Norka coordinates with the police to tackle these complaints, and also operates a helpline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In February, a parliamentary panel headed by the MP Sashi Tharoorrecommended several measuressuch as creating awareness through local civil society groups and media outlets in the regions most affected by undocumented migration to ensure that people are fully informed about their rights, and the processes and risks involved. The panel also suggested Indians leaving the country be given basic information at immigration counters.A new overseas mobility (facilitation and welfare) bill is expected to be put up for public consultation soon.The parliamentary committee reportsaid there was “an urgent need for spreading awareness about safe migration”.UK cut health aid to vulnerable nations while hiring their nurses, research findsRead moreOther regions in India are hoping to emulate the success of Norka’s programme. Officials from northern Punjab, from where some of the highest numbers of undocumented migrants travel to Canada and the US, announced last year that it would adopt the “Kerala model” of migration governance.In addition to Germany, Norka has agreements with several countries or states, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Austria, Germany, the UK and parts of Canada. Kolassery says they are also in talks with other countries. In December,a representative of the Indian governmentsaid Italy planned to recruit 65,000 nurses from Kerala, while Denmark, which has strict immigration policies, has announced it hopes toattract 12,000 nurses from Indiaand the Philippines.View image in fullscreenNursing students at a training on safe migration.

In 2023, he came across an advertisment for nurses to work in Germany. He didn’t think much of it; he has seen countless such ads over the years. But he decided to respond to this one because it was placed by Norka.After interviews, he was selected. As part of the job offer, he had to learn to speak German before he could get a contract and visa. “Everything is provided by Norka or the recruiters, including the study materials,” he says.Alex has completed the preliminaries and is awaiting his work visa. He is hoping for a better work-life balance after a decade of 16-hour shifts for a meagre salary.He laughs thinking about what he’d like to do on his days off in Germany: “I am a huge football fan.

The Iranian American Brooklynite’s craftbeersare infused with Middle Eastern flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the Covid-19 pandemic, while working as a freelance writer and overseeing the home schooling of her son, who is now 11, she started looking at recipes and enrolled in a home-brewing class, and began watching YouTube videos about the art of making beer.This couple has re-created the sights and smells of a Senegalese market in Brooklyn: ‘Experiences keep people coming back’Read more“My grandfather died when I was young, but my family always talked about him making beer and making wine,” said Tabatabai, 42, whose parents leftIranin order to attend university in Alabama with the intent to return home, just before the breakout of theIranian revolution. Tabatabai’s parents ultimately settled in Georgia when she was five years old. Her Persian lager was specifically based on her family’s flavor memories. “I made a few batches of that beer, and they would give me feedback and then I’d go back and change the recipe,” she said.Tabatabai’s hobby has exploded into a full-time business. She produced 30,000 cans in the first week of last month alone. “Brewing beer was just something fun you’re doing on the side while you have your other job and you’re raising a kid,” said Tabatabai. “I think we were all surprised that it took off in this way.” Her products are popular on the menus of select restaurants, and she is now focused on securing accounts with larger national retailers.View image in fullscreenZahra Tabatabai inspects the density of her beer in the Flagship Brewery in Staten Island.Photograph: Tobias Everke/The GuardianWhen Tabatabai incorporated Back HomeBeerin 2021, she invested about $7,000, combining her own savings and a $5,000 loan from her brother, who lives in the Washington DC area and helps her distribute the beer there. Two graphic designers, Washington DC-based Mina Jafari, as well as an artist who lives in Iran – where alcohol is prohibited – devised the cans’ striking labels.Tabatabai partnered with the Flagship Brewery Company, a Staten Island brewery whose staff not only makes her beer but also stepped up to mentor her in the competitive craft beer market, which is expected to grow by 10.83% a year until 2028, according to market research firm Fortune Business Insights. “Those guys at Flagship helped me a lot, giving me the space to brew when a lot of breweries did not even respond to me, and even helping me with paperwork,” said Tabatabai.‘Barberry and saffron’: bakery startup bringing a taste of Iran to BrooklynRead moreShe saw a significant bump in business in 2023, when she launched a Kickstarter campaign. Within a month, more than 1,000 backers – all friends and family – had contributed $125,255, the largest sum of money a campaign for a beer company has ever raised according to her Kickstarter page. With that influx of cash, Tabatabai was able to buy a delivery vehicle. She is now looking for a physicalNew York-based location for a dedicated taproom.Wine and beer shops can be fickle about which brands they keep on their shelves, but Tabatabai’s beers were devised to pair well with food, and she has found a following with sommeliers at restaurants such as Fulgurances Laundromat and Eyval, both located in Brooklyn. Tabatabai recently signed a contract with a second brewery, SingleCut North, located in Clifton Park,New York, in order to bolster her company’s production. “I could spend millions of dollars to build my own brewery, which a lot of people do,” she said, “but I thought it was important to just get people aware of the brand and what I was doing.”Do you have people who work for you full-time?I don’t. I just have a delivery guy who works one day a week. I have somebody who helps me a few hours a week on social media, and then I have another person who helps me a few hours a week on consulting in terms of beer recipes and things like that.What is your day-to-day like?When you’re a business owner, you take on every role in the business. Some days I’m doing tastings and training, other days I have a bunch of paperwork. Yesterday, for instance, I was renewing my liquor license for the year. Every other day I will do accounting. I usually send invoices on Wednesdays.How many beers do you currently produce?View image in fullscreenA selection of Back Home Beer in bar in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.Photograph: Tobias Everke/The GuardianWe have six total beers that we’ve come out with, but only two of them are available year-round. The other ones are seasonal drops. The beer I have coming out in March is called New Day IPA, which is for the Persian new year.What are the next steps for your business?I just found a second facility in upstate New York called SingleCut. They can brew a lot more beer [than the Staten Island brewery]. We are getting more accounts in the Washington DC area, and we’re thinking the next market could be the Philadelphia area.How does distribution vary in different states?Most states require that you use a distributor, but some do not. Distributors take 30% of sales. In New York, you don’t have to use a distributor, and the same is true for Washington DC. So in New York, I can put the beer in my car and distribute it myself.What types of investment are you currently seeking?So far I have only raised money from friends and family. Now I’m targeting angel investors, and then there are some individual investors that have reached out to me.Explore more on these topicsBeerThe New Face of Small BusinessEntrepreneursSmall businessNew YorkFood & drink industryIranMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

For a sixth time they faced their city rivals in Europe – 2025 joining 1959, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 – and for a sixth time they were defeated. Utterly, perhaps eternally defeated. The team that lost one European Cup final derby aftera 93rd-minute goaland anotheron penaltiesfell once more, and this time may even have been the worst of all, another chapter in the never-ending story.All of which may sound a bit much for a last-16 tie but the pain accumulates, each loss crueller than the last, and if the final result was oddly inevitable, how it happened was unthinkable, even for a battle between these two. If Atlético didn’t beat Real this time, they may feel they never will. Just when it seemed that fate might have shifted their way at last, it twisted the knife again. “I go in peace,” Diego Simeone said after, insisting that in their silent, lonely moments Real will reflect that over all these years no one made them suffer like his team. Perhaps they will, yet they always survive, and here they did it again.Atlético Madrid v Real Madrid: Champions League last 16, second leg – liveRead moreA goal from Conor Gallagher after 29 seconds, a missed Vinícius Júnior penalty in the second half and a superb Atlético performance in which they took 17 shots, still didn’t deliver redemption. Real just will not be beaten, somehow able to resist anything. Instead, a 1-0 Atlético win made it 2-2 on aggregate, setting up another shootout. There, Atlético lost when Marcos Llorente smashed the bar and Jan Oblak’s hand couldn’t quite keep out Antonio Rüdiger’s decisive kick. More importantly, they lost when Julián Alvarez’s penalty was ruled out by the VAR because he slipped and touched it twice.It was almost imperceptible, but it was enough: Alvarez wasn’t given the chance to kick it again and Atlético were not given closure, a story written in twisted verse. “Only God knows what is going to happen,” Simeone had said before the game, but even He didn’t expect this. They had only played 29 seconds and Real had touched the ball just once when Simeone’s team took the lead. Gallagher, Alvarez and Rodrigo De Paul combined for the Argentinian midfielder to cross and the Englishman, dashing in, to score.View image in fullscreenConor Gallagher steals in to put Atlético ahead within the first minute.Photograph: Susana Vera/ReutersAtlético had started as they wished and mostly continued as they wanted to as well, closing every avenue to Real and starting to exercise control. They created chances too, especially on the right, a catalogue of clever angled passes beyond Ferland Mendy proving the key that opened up Real. Thibaut Courtois made seven saves, the first from Alvarez, right arm outstretched. He also pushed away two at his near post to close the first half. He opened the second with another stop from Alvarez.Real were struggling to respond and, on the touchline, Ancelotti’s frustration was clear. Yet it could be felt among the home fans too; that feeling, that fear born of what they had experienced eight days before, when an impressive display at the Bernabéu stillended with a 2-1 defeat, and in so many other derbies too. As if to confirm that, from nowhere, Real got a penalty on 70 minutes, an Atlético attack breaking down and Kylian Mbappé running at them for the first time. Turning into the area he was taken down by Clément Lenglet, handing Vinícius the chance to be executioner. His penalty though went way over the bar and into the stands.View image in fullscreenJulián Alvarez slips as he takes his penalty, leading him to kick the ball against his other foot.Photograph: Juan Medina/ReutersMaybe something really was shifting. Or maybe it wasn’t; instead it was just preparing for an even more painful end, a curse of which they cannot rid themselves. Extra time certainly seemed inevitable, even as Ángel Correa tried to avoid it, his shot racing just beyond the bar in the 90th minute. This was the ninth time they have needed more than 90 minutes since 2013. Everywhere, everyone was exhausted, the tension rising, nerves torn, the threat in every little moment, triumph and disaster hanging over them but still they went for it. Rüdiger slid in to stop Correa. Alexander Sørloth headed at goal. Fede Valverde flashed wide. And then Llorente’s half-volley flew past a post.And so it went all the way to a shootout and all that hurt, Diego Simeone gathering his players in a huddle and sending them to face their fate one more time.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAtlético MadridReal Madridmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It’s the team’s work elsewhere that’s most intriguing, though. The Vikings retained starting cornerback Byron Murphy and fortified both sides of the line of scrimmage with tasty, affordable signings. They brought in center Ryan Kelly and guard Will Fries from the Colts. The duo are one of the most switched-on, savvy interior tandems in the league. They never bust a protection and will give McCarthy a semblance of security during his first season as starter.On defense, the Vikings added Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave, two defensive linemen with some serious sizzle off the snap. Minnesota’s defense relied heavily on its scheme last season and lacked one-on-one game-wreckers up front. Injuries may mean Hargrave and Allen never return to their peaks, but if they’re even 80% of the players they were in their primes, it will constitute an upgrade for the Vikings.The Vikings’ key free-agent additions have injury reservations – all of them have missed a chunk of time with serious ailments. But Minnesota are betting on clean health and a bounce back for their four new pieces. If even half of them stay healthy for a full season, the Vikings will have one of the best rosters in the league.Up in the air: Seattle SeahawksThe Seahawks opted to trade quarterback Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders and replace him with Darnold in free agency. Given the desperation on the quarterback market, you could see a team talking themselves into handing a huge deal to Darnold, but on its face, his three-year, $105m contract is fine value. The Seahawks didn’t have to make a lofty investment, signing Darnold to a deal similar in structure to Baker Mayfield’s in Tampa. Effectively, it will shake out as a one-year contract with two option years. If Darnold maintains his run of good play from his time with the Vikings, the Seahawks will have a cost-effective, medium-term answer at quarterback. If Darnold falls back to earth, the franchise can move on in two seasons without harming their cap sheet.Still, there are plenty of reservations. One of the Seahawks’ talking points in moving from Smith to Darnold was about getting younger at the position. And, sure, Darnoldisseven years younger than Smith. But Darnold is also … worse. Smith has proven to be one of the15 best starters in the leagueover the past two seasons. He’s more accurate than Darnold. His decision-making is more consistent. Smith played behind a flailing offensive line last season and was the sole reason the Seahawks remained competitive on offense.Seattle also view Darnold as a stronger scheme fit with new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak than Smith. That’s fair. Smith wants to play the point guard role from the shotgun; Darnold fits snugly in a run-oriented offense featuring a heavy dose of turn-the-back play-action. But that scheme can only sing if the ancillary pieces are strong.Seattle’s interior offensive line remains a mess and will require more investment before the team can feel comfortable dropping Darnold back 25 times a game. Without improvements inside, the Seahawks risk exposing a quarterback who crumbles against pressure to one of the leakiest groups in the league.From nepotism to staggeringly bad contracts: the NFL’s most hopeless franchisesRead moreThen there are the weapons. Darnold will go from working with one of the best playcallers in theNFLand throwing to Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and TJ Hockenson, with a solid supporting run game, to … who knows? After trading DK Metcalf and releasing Tyler Lockett, the only reliable weapon on the Seahawks’ roster today is Jackson Smith-Njigba. It looks like they’ll go shopping in the bargain bin for veteran help, whether that’s Amari Cooper, Stefon Diggs or Cooper Kupp. But none of those three would have cracked the top four in reliable targets during Darnold’s breakout with the Vikings.There is plenty of work for the Seahawks to do in free agency and the draft to feel comfortable rolling out Darnold in week one, let alone banking on him replicating his performance in Minnesota. It feels like they’re stuck between tearing the roster down and rebuilding, and trying to win the NFC West behind a quarterback who has not yet proven he can elevate the talent around him.Winner: New England PatriotsIt’s easy to scoff at the Patriots for chucking money around at any free agent willing to grab it. The golden rule of free agency is not to pay B+ players A+ money, and the Patriots fell into that trap. But here’s the thing: What was the alternative?The Patriots were a disaster last season; the roster featured a rotating cast of mediocrity. Last season’s draft, outside quarterback Drake Maye, was poor. Without investment, they would enter next season as one of the three worst teams in the league.Not investing heavily in free agency is what the smarty pants say to do. But cap space does not line up on third-and-eight. There are only so many seasons you can roll over cap room until you have to try to inject talent into a roster after whiffing on successive draft classes – it’s not on the Patriots that this was a particularly weak free-agent class.New England were at least targeted with their free-agent splurge. The heavy money went to Milton Williams, the interior pass-rusher who dominated during the Eagles’ postseason run. The Patriots gave Williams a four-year, $104m deal to leave Philadelphia. How will Williams fair going from playing alongside Jalen Carter and logging just 50% of the snaps a game to being the main star? Who knows. But Williams being a legitimate blue-chip player is a bet worth taking. They also added veteran cornerback Carlton Davis, who, when healthy, will dovetail nicely with Christian Gonzalez, the most talented player on New England’s roster.Beyond those pricey investments, the Patriots secured decent deals with players that the new coaching staff has worked with in previous spots. Is edge-rusher Harold Landry worth a three-year, $45m contract? No. But he is a solid player and a veteran leader who knows the Patriots’ staff and their scheme. Ditto for new linebacker Robert Spillane, who the Patriots signed to a three-year, $33m contract.The Patriotsdidresist the temptation to throw big money at their offensive line, despite needing reinforcements around Maye. Signing right tackle Morgan Moses to a three-year, $24m deal was the savviest bit of line business from any rebuilding team. Moses is a starter-caliber right tackle, something the Patriots have not had in years. They didn’t spend eye-watering money on the position but instead found a league-average starter to fill in a sinkhole.New England are not traditionally big spenders in free agency. When they have spent in the past, it’s been a dud. But they have a quarterback on a rookie contract and had to acquire NFL-caliber talent to find out what they have in Maye.Loser: Cincinnati BengalsUnlike other teams, the Bengals are waiting to ink extensions to their players before they can address their roster concerns. Cincinnati hit Tee Higgins with the franchise tag but will have to work out a long-term deal with the receiver. Higgins is likely to command a $30m salary. After Higgins, the Bengals need to work out a long-term deal with Ja’Marr Chase. You could hear the audible gulps leaking out of Ohio as Cincy watched Maxx Crosby and Myles Garrett sign record-breaking extensions last week. The Bengals have already publicly committed to the fact that Chase will be thehighest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. Giving away such leverage without having a contract ready to sign is pretty serious negligence. Chase will now likely wait to see where theMicah Parsons extensionfalls this offseason before signing a deal, but any Chase extension willprobablyrequire a $40m a year investment. Oh, and the Bengals are still unsure whether they will extend or trade their lone impactful defensive piece: Trey Hendrickson.If the Bengals can find the pennies between the couch cushions to rework Hendrickson’s contract, he will also command a salary close to $30m a year. Piece it together, and the Bengals are looking at committing over 50% of the salary cap to four players: Joe Burrow, Chase, Higgins and Hendrickson.And it’s not like the Bengals only need a bit of cosmetic surgery to wriggle their way into contention. They need a defensive overhaul and upgrades along their offensive line. To make the math work, they need to find cheap bargains who can play well above their contracts. Instead, Cincy committed new, costly deals to replacement level players: defensive linemen BJ Hill (three years, $33m) and tight end Mike Gesicki (three years, $25m).Those two moves on their own are justifiable. The value isfine.But it’s tough to see how the Bengals can make the jigsaw pieces fit without losing one of their stars, most likely Hendrickson.Burrow has been vocal about the Bengals’ spending, and more pointedly, about how they structure their contracts, comparing it to the Eagles’ ability to sustain their championship window with crafty cap mechanics. So far, the Bengals have not been able to sign their stars to long-term commitments and have struggled to plug obvious holes on their roster with cost-effective replacements.View image in fullscreenChris Godwin chose to stay with the Bucs despite offers from elsewhere.Photograph: Michael Conroy/APWinner: Tampa Bay BuccaneersJason Licht is not a household name, but he may well be the best general manager in football. Licht was able to lock down Chris Godwin to a multi-year extension, getting the receiver to leave money on the table to return to Tampa. Godwin is a key part of the Bucs offense, and his return to Tampa over taking more money from the Patriots or Jaguars is a testament to the culture Licht has built.Licht values retaining his players. He looks after his guys, and that loyalty has been rewarded with a cap-friendly deal for one of the most effective receivers in the league. Godwin is coming off a serious leg injury, and it would have been understandable if he took a bigger payday elsewhere. But Godwin taking a favorable deal allowed the Bucs to retain starting lineman Ben Bredeson and chase upgrades on the open market.Licht also addressed Tampa’s biggest need, landing edge-rusher Haason Reddick on a one-year, $14m contract. After the debacle of Reddick’s misbegotten trade to the Jets, it would be easy to play down his impact. But Licht snagged Reddick to a team-friendly one-year contract that has plenty of upside. Reddick is not an every-down, impact player. But he brings plenty of juice off the edge, juice that Tampa have lacked for years. He may lollygag through a handful of plays a game, but he could be a double-digit sack presence off the edge.Loser: CJ StroudWhat theHouston Texanshave done the past month is commendable. Their offensive line was a disaster last season, from the coaching to the scheme to the individual players. They conceded a historic level of quick pressures, overall pressures and unblocked pressures. It was embarrassing.Despite that, the Texans were able to eke out a playoff win, thanks to the excellence of Stroud. In that context, it would have been easy to roll the roster back and spout nonsense about ‘internal growth’ while trying to patch up the group through the draft. Instead, head coach DeMeco Ryans and general manager Nick Caserio decided to nuke the room. They fired their offensive coordinator and offensive line coach and spent the early free-agent period bailing on their starting line from 2024. They traded Laremy Tunsil to the Commanders for a bounty of picks and traded former first-rounder Kenyon Green to the Eagles in exchange for CJ Gardner-Johnson.Admitting a group was well below the standard is one thing – Tunsil is a bigger name than he is an impactful player at this point in his career – but taking a chainsaw to a room is something else. But by flinging one group out, the Texans have put themselves in a bind, chasing a new starting group in a watered-down,expensiveoffensive line market.Houston have brought in only one face (Laken Tomlinson) to buff up their interior and are likely to start second-year left tackle Blake Fisher, who was a turnstile during his rookie season. Poor Stroud has gone from playing behind the flakiest offensive line in the NFL to playing behind a flaky group that doesn’t even have a serviceable starter at left tackle.Digging through the veteran market could change that. Guards Brandon Scherff and Kevin Zeitler are grizzled veterans who should be available on the cheap. And there is an expectation that Houston will use some of the picks received in the Tunsil trade to move up in the draft for the tackle of their choice. But whereas the Chicago Bears and Patriots have put resources into addressing their line concerns to aid their young quarterbacks, the Texans have stripped their room back. Putting a solid group together for next season will require more investment. Stroud needs more help, and the Texans have yet to find it.Explore more on these topicsNFLMinnesota VikingsSeattle SeahawksNew England PatriotsCincinnati BengalsTampa Bay BuccaneersHouston TexansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In position to build on securing the constructors’ championship in 2024,McLarenwill be quick out of the blocks. The car was the standout in testing and confidence is high. Lessons were learned through questionable execution last year and they have two outstanding drivers who are both hungrily eyeing the team’s first drivers’ title since 2008. How they manage them may be key from the off.DriversLando Norris(GB, 25) No 4DebutAustralia 2019Wins4Poles9Titles0Best seasonfinish2ndLast season2nd. Once given the car to compete, eagerly took the fight to Max Verstappen last season but by his own admission was occasionally found wanting. Believes he has identified and dealt with these shortcomings, not least in a determination to face down the Dutchman. With a quick car nothing less than the title has to be the target.Oscar Piastri(Aus, 23) No 81DebutBahrain 2023Wins2Poles0Bestqualifying 2ndTitles0Best season finish4thLast season4th. Has made great strides in the previous two seasons and proved entirely unintimidated in taking control and bossing his way to wins. More will surely follow. Fearsomely quick and an incisive overtaker but to mount a title challenge he must match Norris in qualifying and get the best from his race tyres.View image in fullscreenLando Norris has a quick car this season and will be targeting the world title after a bruising 2024.Photograph: Florent Gooden/DPPI/ShutterstockFerrariCarSF-25EngineFerrariPrincipalFrédéric VasseurDebutMonaco 1950GPs1,098Titles16Last season2nd. Enjoying a resurgence as Vasseur’s impact is felt, theScuderiaare moving from strength to strength. With a calm control from the top bringing stability and purpose, plus optimism that last year’s weaknesses in the car have been eliminated, not to mention two of the best drivers on the grid, Ferrari should be genuine contenders. Anything short of regularly fighting for wins will be disappointing.DriversCharles Leclerc(Mnc, 27) No 16DebutAustralia 2018Wins8Poles26Titles0Best season finish2ndLast season3rd. Performed consistently last season and when Ferrari had the car firing, returned well with some drives highlighting his rare talent. Going up against Hamilton will be his toughest challenge but one that has inspired both drivers and as a veteran now at the team, Leclerc has every reason to believe he should be on top of any Ferrari title tilt.Lewis Hamilton(GB, age 40) No 44DebutAustralia 2007Wins105Poles104Titles7Last season7th. A new challenge at Ferrari has invigorated the seven-times champion. Motivated and charged-up, and although starting afresh with a new team will be far from easy, Hamilton is relishing the task. The SF-25 looks to suit his driving style and he will throw his all into it, which is likely to be gripping whatever the outcome.Red BullCarRB21EngineHonda RBPTPrincipalChristian HornerDebutAustralia 2005GPs393Titles6Last season3rd. A serious misstep in developing the car was costly in 2024 and testing suggests they are still to solve it, given Max Verstappen and his technical director Pierre Wache have yet to be convinced. Will doubtless be in the mix at the front but this time in a serious dogfight and without the safety net of a dominant opening.DriversMax Verstappen(Neth, 27) No 1DebutAustralia 2015Wins63Poles40Titles4Last seasonChampion. Battled hard and in typically uncompromising style to grind out his fourth championship after theRed Bullfell away mid-season in 2024. Shows no sign of any diminishing hunger but with the car still not quite where he wants it, and likely assailed by multiple rivals, may be set for the fight of his career to successfully defend the title.Liam Lawson(NZ, 23) No 30DebutNetherlands 2023Bestrace finish9thPoles0Best qualifying5thTitles0Best season finish20thLast season21st. Going head to head with Verstappen is a huge ask that has broken many but Lawson looks of stern stuff having taken over from Daniel Ricciardo at RB last year. Mentally strong and highly rated, solid returns to back the Dutchman and keep the team in the title fight will be considered a success.MercedesCarW16EngineMercedesPrincipalToto WolffDebutFrance1954GPs317Titles8Last season4th. Having struggled since the last regulation change in 2022, Mercedes are optimistic they have finally ironed out the inconsistencies that have plagued every ride since then. At times last year they had the fastest car and if they have converted that into all-round performance they will be genuine players. The cool conditions in testing may have benefited them disproportionately, however, in which case another rollercoaster may await.View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell can take the lead role at Mercedes now that Lewis Hamilton has moved on.Photograph: Eric Alonso/DPPI/ShutterstockDriversGeorge Russell(GB, 27) No 63DebutAustralia 2019Wins3Poles5Titles0Best seasonfinish4thLast season6th. Now team leader with Hamilton having moved on, Russell is more than ready to step up. Demonstrated last year he would be unyielding and robust in racing Verstappen and that given the tools he can deliver. If Mercedes have the car he will feel his time has come.Andrea Kimi Antonelli(It, 27) No 12DebutAustralia 2025Wins0Poles0Titles0Best season finishN/ALast seasonN/A. A graduate of their junior programme, Mercedes have shown enormous faith in promoting Kimi, as he is known, to replace Hamilton. A huge ask for the man who will be the third-youngest driver in F1 history when he takes to the grid in Melbourne. Inexperienced but rapid, aggressive and drives on instinct. Expect fireworks.Aston MartinCarAMR25EngineMercedesPrincipalAndy CowellDebutNetherlands 1959GPs95Titles0Best finish5thLast season5th. Adrian Newey did not arrive from Red Bull in time to have a material influence on the AMR25 so his design genius has yet to be felt and he is likely already focused on 2026. Meanwhile, Cowell, ex-Mercedes, has stepped up as principal and the new car is surely better than a lacklustre testing suggested, but their spot as best of the rest is under serious threat despite vast resources.DriversFernando Alonso(Sp, 43) No 14DebutAustralia 2001Wins32Poles22Titles2Last season9th. Likely now looking to still be in the game for 2026, when Newey, new regs and a new Honda engine might catapult Aston to the front, Alonso must prove he is still a force to be reckoned with. Has the chops, but will take luck as well as his innate flair to score a podium this season.Lance Stroll(Can, 26) No 18DebutAustralia 2017Best race finish3rdPoles1Titles0Best season finish10thLast season13th. Even given his father owns the team, Stroll needs to return better finishes with more consistency. He too might already be eyeing the siren call of next season but should now demonstrate that he can keep up and even on occasion surpass his teammate and extract more from an imperfect ride.AlpineCarA525EngineRenaultPrincipalOliver OakesDebutBahrain 2021GPs90Titles0Best finish4thLast season6th. F1’s perennial underachievers are back for another shot at breaking free of the midfield shackles. Oakes, appointed midway through last season, has steadied the ship and made significant improvements, with the potential for so much more. With a lively driver pairing, a good run in testing suggests they are well placed to start strongly in a tight midfield.DriversPierre Gasly(Fr, 29) No 10DebutMalaysia 2017Wins1Poles0Best qualifying2ndTitles0Best season finish7thLast season10th. Has the experience and the verve to lead and galvanise the team if they do indeed hit that upward curve and is still capable of stirring, compelling drives.

Made his debut in the final meeting last season and has long experience at Alpine as a reserve and academy driver but opens under enormous pressure.

Komatsu did a stand-up job to move Haas forward from what was a low in 2023 and what was expected to be another painful year in 2024. Every indication that he has continued the progress. The car was rock-solid in testing where they focused on race pace and tyre wear, a former weakness, while they have drivers that could push beyond expectations of another seventh place.DriversEsteban Ocon(Fr, 28) No 31DebutBelgium 2016Wins1Poles0Best qualifying3rdTitles0Best season finish8thLast season14th. Dispensed with when relationship with Alpine and his teammate Gasly frayed in July 2024 although a superb second place in Brazil was a reminder of how good he can be.

Impressed as the super-sub for Carlos Sainz at Ferrari in Jeddah last season and then later for Haas. Deserved the accolades he earned, is quick and has proved he can adapt well alongside enjoying a prodigious rate of improvement. Carries high expectations but shows every indication of meeting them and will expect to score vital points.Racing BullsCarVCARB 02EngineRed Bull RBPTPrincipalLaurent MekiesDebutBahrain 2006GPs353Titles0Best finish6thLast season8th. Mekies, now entering his second season in charge at Red Bull’s sister team, will expect stability and to build a consistent challenge, especially after the distraction around Daniel Ricciardo last year. The car is the nicest-looking the team have fielded for some time but still appears a handful to drive which may leave them floundering in a fiercely competitive pack.DriversYuki Tsunoda(Jpn, 24) No 22DebutBahrain 2021Best race finish4thPoles0Best qualifying3rdTitles0Best season finish12thLast season12th. Disappointed not to be given a shot with Red Bull after what was his best season yet in 2024 with nine points finishes and a superlative third on the grid in treacherous conditions in Brazil. More controlled and consistent than when he began four years ago, nonetheless Tsunoda is now likely driving to make his case for a future with another team.Isack Hadjar(Fr, 20) No 6DebutAustralia 2025Wins0Poles0Titles0Best season finishN/ALast seasonN/A. Promoted from the Red Bull junior programme and supported by its overseer, Helmut Marko, much is expected of Hadjar, who has no little pace. Was up to speed during testing, especially for a rookie, but has a tendency to lose his cool under pressure.WilliamsCarFW47EngineMercedesPrincipalJames VowlesDebutSpain 1977GPs834Titles9Last season9th. Vowles continues the rebuilding process atWilliamswith indications his efforts are being rewarded sooner rather than later. After a battering last year the new car looks quick and stable, strong in and out of corners and made the case to lead the midfield in testing. A giant leap for the team who have two able drivers in what could be their best season since 2017.View image in fullscreenAlexander Albon goes head to head with a proven performer in Carlos Sainz.Photograph: Antonin Vincent/DPPI/ShutterstockDriversAlexander Albon(Thai, 28) No 23DebutAustralia 2019Wins0Best race finish3rdPoles0Best qualifying4thTitles0Best season finish7thLast season16th.

Unfortunate to be dropped by Ferrari in favour of Hamilton after having put in a solid, battling stint with theScuderia. With no room at the front of the grid was tenaciously pursued by Vowles who recognised his experience as a key asset to a team on the up. A dogged fighter and just what Williams needs.SauberCarC45EngineFerrariPrincipalMattia Binotto (interim) Jonathan Wheatley (from 1 April)DebutSouth Africa 1993GPs486Titles0Best finish2ndLast season10th. The last gasp before re-emerging as the Audi works team in 2026 looks set to be at very best a period of making-do. Wheatley, who played a huge part in Red Bull’s recent success, will be a strong addition but with the car ponderous and off the pace and the focus already set ahead, they appear destined to bring up the rear.DriversNico Hülkenberg(Ger, 37) No 27DebutBahrain 2010Best race finish4thPoles1Titles0Best season finish7thLast season11th. Brought in for his experience as the team transition to Audi he too will be looking toward 2026, but with a rookie teammate must be expected to drag whatever he can from the C45 and lift the team from the back of the grid. However, that elusive first F1 podium looks further than ever after 227 starts for the Hulk.Gabriel Bortoleto(Bra, 20) No 5DebutAustralia 2025Wins0Poles0Titles0Best season finishN/ALast seasonN/A.

Benfica are winning 4-0 and Atlético Madrid are in utter disarray. Zeki Amdouni runs the ball into an entirely unpatrolled Atlético area, gets a free shot from 14 yards and misses a glorious chance to make it 5-0. Nobody cares. Least of all Liverpool, even though this miss will in effect end up, five months later, knocking them out of theChampions League.Of course, we’re in the realm of the absurd here, although when it comes to the new Champions League format this is a system with margins exactly, and absurdly, this fine. By virtue of this one goal not scored – and of course you could pick out many others – Benfica end up finishing 16th in the 36-team group phase rather than 15th: a position from which they, rather thanParis Saint-Germain, would probably have ended up facing Liverpool in the last 16.Donnarumma denies Liverpool and Núñez to send PSG through on penaltiesRead moreNaturally there were still a few bones of resentment as Liverpool made their exit on Tuesday, a certain bafflement at a format that allows a club to top the group table and still get drawn against one of the best teams in the world.Arne Slot himself lamentedthat Liverpool had been “so, so unlucky”. Luis Enrique’s verdict was: “Both teams deserved to go through.” And the way Uefa is going, maybe one day soon they both will.For all this, there was also a certain magnanimity there, a recognition that Paris had been the superior team over the two legs. “The best game of football I was ever involved in,” Slot said. And of course magnanimity is much easier to come by when you are 15 points clear in the Premier League and in a cup final at the weekend. All the same, given the standard and given the stakes, it’s worth asking: just how much did this defeat mean? In an age when everything must be ranked and contextualised and GOATed, how does this failure affect the way a greatLiverpoolteam will be remembered?There will be some for whom this in itself is the wrong question: a forlorn attempt to devalue Liverpool’s season by measuring it against an unattainable standard, the idea that winning a 20th championship and drawing level with Manchester United is somehow insufficiently excellent. Let them eat league title!And yet you only had to study the body language of Liverpool’s players afterwards to know that this was no ordinary defeat, no ordinary setback. Mohamed Salah, a player who may well be on his way out of Anfield this summer, was utterly inconsolable. So too Darwin Núñez, whose missed penalty was the turning point of the shootout. Strictly speaking, Liverpool didn’tneedto win the Champions League this season. But you could see, in the bruised aftermath, just how good a chance they had.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk’s contract runs out this summer so he may have played his last European game for Liverpool.Photograph: Jake Kirkman/Every Second Media/ShutterstockThe talk now will be of emotional recovery. Newcastle await at Wembley this weekend and yet, if this group of players has learned anything from the relentless campaigns of previous seasons, it is the art of dusting themselves down and picking themselves up for the next challenge. In truth, the real question is where Slot’s squad stand physically after a long, gruelling season and 210 minutes of high-intensity European football. “There’s a lot of tired legs in there,” Andrew Robertson said.And of course there are potential implications here that go beyond this week, beyond even this season. If the2019-20 Premier League titlewas the culmination of a project, thentheir 4-2 aggregate defeatagainst Atlético Madrid in that season’s Champions League – a game naturally overshadowed by the pandemic it helped to spread – also offered a slightly unflattering portrait of what was coming around the corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And while they still won the league by 18 points, these were – by pure coincidence – the same traits that would torment them the following season, when a haunted, injury‑plagued squad finished 30 points behind their 2019-20 tally.Obviously a certain quantum of Covid-era weirdness needs to be factored in here. But there were also tangible signs of the decay to follow. The 2019-20 squad was the eighth oldest in the Premier League and used the third fewest number of players. This season’s squad is the fourth oldest, and only Nottingham Forest have used fewer players. Cohesion, nous, experience, familiarity: these are all good traits to have, title-winning traits. But there is also the sense of a team coming towards the end of its cycle, that may need to be remade much sooner than people assume.The last stalwarts of the first great Jürgen Klopp team are chugging towards the end. Robertson is 31, Alisson and Salah 32, Virgil van Dijk 33. Even Trent Alexander-Arnold, at 26, already has nearly 400 games under his belt, and may well end up leaving in the summer. That tension, that sense of teetering on a fraying thread, has helped these players to produce some of the finest football of their career. Perhaps this explains why Salah was so distraught afterwards: a player who knows his Champions League record is not as good as the players he aspires to emulate, and who is running out of chances to put it right.There are contracts to sort, a summer of recruitment and disposal to plan, a title defence to be mapped out. It feels ridiculous to argue that the clock is running out for a team that hasn’t even won the league yet. But in a game moving and morphing at relentless speed, where stasis is severely punished, there is always a little less time than you think.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotParis Saint-GermainChampions LeagueEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Villa manager has delivered unequivocally on his wish. The Champions League furniture – the oversized badges, the giant tifos and 3D signage – will get at least another outing this season.Aston Villa earn shot at greatness after setting up historic PSG showdown | Jonathan WilsonRead moreA couple of minutes after the final whistle the fireworks fizzing overhead spoke to a job well done. The PSG loanee Marco Asensio continued his fine goalscoring run to accelerate clear ofClub Bruggeon the night, his sixth and seventh goals for Villa bookending a routine win after the visitors were reduced to 10 men early in the first half. Asensio, a half-time arrival, opened the scoring, Ian Maatsen doubled Villa’s lead and then Asensio added another just past the hour. By that point Prince William was throwing his arms in the air in jubilation.Soon thoughts will turn to the Parc des Princes. Emery watched PSG overthrow Liverpool and, asked whether the Ligue 1 champions are the best team in Europe, he replied: “Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Inter, Borussia Dortmund … this is the level and we are on this level. We have to be proud but we want more.” Villa’s next match – a FA Cup quarter-final at Preston, passage to Wembley the reward – is further evidence this is a truly memorable season.Emery had been at pains to insist that coming into this second leg with a two-goal advantage was not cause for celebration. He referenced Brugge’s impressive 3-1 playoff win at Atalanta last month after Asensio sealed victory in Belgium by the same scoreline, and made it plain Villa had to anticipate a repeat. “The biggest mistake we can have on and off the pitch is thinking that the round was decided one week ago,” he said, wary of how these things can bite.View image in fullscreenIan Maatsen roars with delight after making it 2-0.Photograph: Darren Staples/APBrugge began promisingly but, 16 minutes in, it became clear Emery may as well have been bluffing when he said Villa were prepared for extra time and penalties. Emi Martínez, having spent a few seconds assessing the picture, nudged the ball half a yard, ready to pull the trigger. He spied Marcus Rashford’s willingness to dart behind the Brugge right-back Kyriani Sabbe and pinged a long pass downfield. The ball bounced close to the 18-yard box and the defender was in trouble, upending Rashford, who zoomed on to the ball, Simon Mignolet’s goal in his sights. Rashford curled into a heap on the turf and the referee, Daniel Siebert, looked to his assistant for help before pulling out a red card for Sabbe, who had no complaints. At least it was a short walk to the tunnel. From the subsequent free-kick, Youri Tielemans worked Mignolet after zipping a shot through a hole in the wall.Villa failed to overpower Brugge in the first half but, regardless of Emery’s warning, it was hard to envisage how things would unravel for Villa from a position of such strength. Emery’s half-time reshuffle was indicative, with Asensio and Leon Bailey replacing Boubacar Kamara and Ollie Watkins, two Villa pillars, and within five minutes the substitutes combined to kill the tie.Bailey cleverly dinked a pass into the box and Asensio, without glancing at goal, swivelled and wellied a shot into the roof of Mignolet’s net. Asensio would have grabbed his second goal earlier but hit a post after nonchalantly bringing Tielemans’s pass under his spell. Maatsen doubled Villa’s lead, firing home after good work from Morgan Rogers and Bailey, and then Asensio made it three. Rashford was the catalyst this time, latching on to Rogers’s cute pass before pulling back for Asensio to convert inside the six-yard box.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked whether the Spain forward could sign permanently, Emery said: “It depends. Of course, we are happy with him. We are protecting him because he is not 100% … he took the responsibility to do his task like we planned. He’s been fantastic for us.”Villa could withdraw Tyrone Mings and Rogers midway through the second half. Matty Cash, a reliable performer at right-back, was also given a late breather. Emery was largely unmoved until marching down the tunnel all smiles. Maybe because he expected Villa to progress. Or perhaps he was thinking about his return to Paris. Six years after league trips to Rotherham and Bolton, Villa are keeping rather different company.“The bar keeps rising,” Mings said. “The Championship feels like a long time ago. I’m really enjoying the journey.” He is not the only one.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAston VillaClub Bruggematch reportsShareReuse this content"

One, Donald Trump, received toady genuflection and a large, golden … thing (actually the Club World Cup trophy). The other, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, occasioned to bask in the proximity to real power, was affectionately referred to as “The king of soccer, I guess, in a certain way” by Trump.Theirs may be a marriage of convenience, but it seems to be a very happy one.At the event, Infantino made unsourced claims of an economic impact of $40bn and the creation of 200,000 jobs, all delivered by the 2025 ClubWorld Cupand the subsequent World Cup proper. Trump demonstratively signed a piece of paper that made the World Cup taskforce official.David Squires on … Mr Infantino’s trip to Washington and meeting with Donald TrumpRead moreThe whole thing felt little more than symbolic. Such a taskforce doesn’t require a presidential decree, for a start. But also because Infantino knows full well, as did everyone else in the room, that the president is unlikely to rouse himself for a cause he seems to barely understand.“Can the US win?” Trump asked at one point, interrupting Infantino, who ignored the question.“First time it’s ever been in this part of the world,” proclaimed Trump, apparently referring to the World Cup. Never mind that three men’s World Cups have already been staged in North America – in Mexico in 1970 and 1986, and in 1994 in the United States.Infantino proceeded to theatrically show Trump the newFifaClub World Cup trophy, a gaudy, golden behemoth that unlocks some rings orbiting its center with a key, which seemed to impress the president. Then the Swiss handed Trump an official match ball with the latter’s signature printed on it, tickling the last of the president’s erogenous zones that had not yet been activated.By the time he was done, Infantino had fully draped the tournament around one of his favorite strongmen. If it wasn’t already obvious, the 23rd edition of the Fifa World Cup will be remembered as The Donald Trump World Cup (trademark pending). Just as other mega-events have been hijacked for political ends, this World Cup will be leveraged for the glorification of a leader to a degree not seen since Benito Mussolini dominated the 1934 World Cup in Italy or the Videla regime’s stage crafting of the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. While a quarter of the matches will be hosted by Canada and Mexico – introducinga separate set of issuesowing to Trump’s erratic saber-rattling with his neighbors – the dominant narrative of the tournament has seemingly already been set.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump shakes hands with Gianni Infantino in the Oval Office.Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images“When we made this,” Trump said of the 2026 World Cup, “it was made during my first term, and it was so sad, because I said, ‘Can you imagine, I’m not going to be president? And that’s too bad.’ And what happened is they rigged the election, and I became president and so that was a good thing.” Presumably, he was referring to the 2020 election, which he lost with no evidence of rigging, and his subsequent re-election in 2024.It always seemed unlikely that the sport would be able to keep Trump from claiming soccer’s signature tournament as his own. But Infantino has seen to it that something like the opposite is accomplished instead. The Fifa president, the proud holder of the Russian Federation’s Order of Friendship medal, has written a type of playbook on cozying up to autocrats – or democratically elected heads of state with autocratic inclinations – and entering into mutually beneficial bargains with them. They are lent the World Cup for whatever stains they need to sportswash away and handed a place of prominence at the tournament’s key moments, and Infantino is given a pliant environment from which to source the profits that will keep his patronage machine humming.The 2026 Trade War World Cup encapsulates our new nativist world order | Aaron TimmsRead moreThat same week, Fifa also announced that the World Cup final will be interrupted by ahalf-time showfor the first time in its history. As well as casting its lot witha historically unpopularUS president, Fifa will also indulge in all the worst impulses of American sports.The 2026 edition of the world’s biggest sporting event, which somehow retains its prestige and credibility despite the best efforts of its guardians over the last century, will already count more teams and more games than any before it. The notion of expanding from 48 to 64 teams for the 2030 edition has already beensoft-launchedat the Fifa council.More, more, more, until every last inch and second and ounce of the World Cup has been commercialized and monetized. This is what the full Infantino-ing of Fifa looks like, mirroring the Trump-ification of the next World Cup co-hosts. Each grifting as hard as they possibly can.After the Oval Office event, Infantino madeanother appearancewith Trump, at a White House crypto summit. Infantino demonstrated his labor-intensive trophy again. And then he cut to the chase. “Fifa is very, very interested to develop a Fifa coin,” he told the roundtable of crypto people. “If there is anyone here who is interested to team up with Fifa, here we are.”Of course they are.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I really appreciate it and it shows a lot about our fanbase. It’s just one big family, and everybody supports each other.”‘It’s important we saved our sport’: Ukraine’s footballers play on in conflict’s shadowRead moreWith his immediate family members still residing in Kyiv, the entire VCU community has found meaningful ways to show solidarity for Shulga, fromchanting “Slava Ukraini,”a salute that translates to “Glory to Ukraine,” to preparing a meal that reminds him of home.Days before senior night, VCU’s executive chef Jennifer Taylor surprised Shulga by serving him borscht, a signature Ukrainian dish.“He walked in and he didn’t know it was coming,” VCU’s head coach Ryan Odom said during a recent press conference. “He saw the big pot, and he said, ‘If I grew up in America, there’s not a chance I would be eating this. But I grew up in Kyiv and I love it!’ He said his mom would make it once a week. He sat there and had a cup with his teammates, which is a neat thing.”On the court, Shulga, a 6ft 5in guard, was named this weekas the Atlantic 10 Conference Player of the Yearand First Team All-Conference. Beyond sports, Shulga represents the resilience of his homeland as uncertainty surrounds Ukraine and US political relations, even after Tuesday’sannouncement of a 30-day ceasefirein the war with Russia.In the same week that Shulga earnedA-10 Player of the Weekhonors in late February, an intense meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump at the White House resonated globally. In the aftermath, the Trump Administration paused military and intelligence support to Ukraine, before it was restored this week. Amid the turmoil, basketball gives Shulga a sense of solace as he finds personal peace while playing the game.“When I’m on the court, playing in the game, everything kind of just goes away,” Shulga says. “And I’m just in the moment focused on what’s at hand and what I’m doing in that particular game. Basketball helped me to just stay focused. Anything that has been going on, basketball will be my getaway, my outlet.”Shulga’s love for basketball began as a youth in Kyiv where sports was an important part of family life. Shulga’s father refereed Fiba basketball games, allowing his son to watch and learn from some of the best international players. Shulga’s grandfather also worked as a referee and his uncle played professionally in Europe.By age 14, Shulga moved to Spain, honing his skills while attending the prestigious Basketball School of Excellence and becoming a standout prospect by his senior season.He returned home before starting his college career at Utah State to lead Ukraine in the 2019 Fiba European Championships, an experience that gave him immense pride.“It’s always great to play for the national team, it’s a different feeling to just go out there with your brothers from back home,” Shulga says. “Playing for your country, and just having Ukraine across your chest, is a different feeling. It feels like you’re playing for something way more than basketball. It’s always an honor.”Shulga returned to play for Ukraine at the 2022 Fiba European Championships under different circumstances. The games occurred just months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, forcing the team to train in Italy. His on-court leadership provided a glimmer of hope as he opened tournament play with a stellar performance, scoring 26 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in an overtime thriller against the Czech Republic.Although his elite playmaking skills continued to evolve, the war began to take a heavy toll on Shulga during his time at Utah State. His former teammate Sean Bairstow informed Coach Odom, then in charge of Utah State, and his staff of Shulga’s personal struggles, prompting Odom to build a stronger rapport with his emerging star.“I’m grateful for the experience that he and I have had together,” Odom said at VCU’s press conference. “Max has done really well since that moment, and has weathered some different storms along the way, relative to the war and what’s going on there.”After his stint at Utah State, Shulga continued to gain momentum, improving in every statistical category after transferring to VCU in 2023 and joining Odom in his move to the East Coast.VCU began this season with the goal of winning the A-10 Championship and so far, they are right on track. Led by Shulga, who averaged 15.5 points per game and six rebounds, the Rams (25-6) finished the regular season as co-champions along with George Mason. They enter the A-10 Conference Men’s Basketball Tournament as the No 1 seed.“The mindset is the same as it’s been for every other game throughout the season,” Shulga says about the team’s approach to tournament play. “We just want to stay level-headed through every game and do what we’ve practiced and trust what we’ve practiced … Our goal was to win the A-10 Championship after we fell short last year. We all came back, hungry and just ready to compete for the championship.”This week, the A-10 Conference Tournament will take place at Capital One Arena in Washington DC, only a few miles away from where political leaders will continue to debate the Russia-Ukraine war and US involvement. It’s expected that VCU fans and supporters of Ukraine will fill the arena and wave Ukrainian flags to encourage Shulga and everyone affected by the war.While Shulga focuses on leading the Rams to an A-10 Championship and success in the 2025 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament, the hope for peace and a return to normalcy in his homeland endures.“It’s definitely good to see that people care and are going outside to rally [for Ukraine],” Shulga says. “I’m not sure how much of a difference it really makes, but it’s good to see the support. It would be great to make peace as fast as possible.”Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsNCAA TournamentUS sportsUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

McIlroy believes Woods will not feature in any of the 2025 majors. “It sucks,” McIlroy said. “He doesn’t have much luck when it comes to injuries and his body. Obviously he was trying to ramp up to get ready for Augusta and achilles surgeries aren’t fun.‘I am hoping he’s in good spirits and hoping he’s doing OK. We obviously won’t see him play golf this year and hopefully we see him maybe play in 2026.”Tiger Woods all but certain to miss Masters after rupturing achilles at homeRead moreWoods’s ongoing desire to participate in golf events contrasts starkly with the outlook of McIlroy. The Northern Irishman, who will turn 36 in May, has a clear idea of his professional longevity.“I’m very happy to move aside for the younger generation to come through,” he said. “I look at other sports. I turned pro in 2007. I’m 18 years into a career. Not a lot of athletes can say they’ve had an 18-year career and I’m only 35.“I can acknowledge how lucky golfers are to be able to do what they do for so long compared to other athletes, so whenever I feel like the time is right, I’ll have no problem moving aside and letting the next generation do their thing.”Pressed on precisely when that may be, McIlroy added: “I think when I’ve achieved everything I want to achieve in the game and I get to the point where I don’t think I can maybe do that any more. I’d also like to walk away with a little bit left in the tank. I don’t want to be out there embarrassing myself. I’d like to walk away maybe a little before I should. Put it that way.“I will not play Champions Tour golf. I’ve said a lot of absolutes in my time that I’ve walked back but I do not envision playing Champions Tour golf. Something has gone terribly wrong if I have to compete at golf at 50.”McIlroy re-emphasised his desire for a more global approach to elite golf, as talks – aimed at some form of unification – rumble on between traditional tours and the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Masters champion Fred Couples turned heads last week by asserting Koepka has eyes set on a PGA Tour comeback. A widespread assumption is that Koepka, a five-time major winner, feels undercooked by LIV’s light playing schedule.“I’ve got a contract obligation out here to fulfil and then we’ll see what happens,” said Koepka. “I don’t know where I’m going, so I don’t know how everybody else does. Right now I’m just focused on how do I play better, how do I play better in the majors, how does this team win, and then we’ll figure out next year and how to play better again. It’s the same thing.

But after a dismal loan spell from Chelsea during which the former England forward has failed to live up to his reputation, Sterling will be relieved to have finally made a contribution as Mikel Arteta’s side eased into a quarter-final with Real Madrid.Sterling provided two assists in the first half as goals from Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice ensured Arsenal were never in danger of surrendering their record-breaking 7-1 advantage from the first leg. This timePSV Eindhovenproved more of a challenge and deserved to come away with a draw on the night thanks to equalisers from Ivan Perisic and then a sublime chip from Couhaib Driouech that denied Arteta’s side a place in the history books for the joint-biggest aggregate victory in the knockout stages.Real Madrid send rivals Atlético packing after controversial penalty shootoutRead moreAfter their failure to last the distance with Liverpool in the Premier League title race, Arsenal can now look forward to their second successiveChampions Leaguequarter‑final with genuine optimism – even if Sterling will miss the first leg after picking up a reckless late yellow card.“The way he tracked back to the corner in the last action when he got booked – that’s the kind of play that we want to see,” Arteta said of his performance. “We’ve done it consistently and now we want to make the next step, which is going to be really difficult. But we are very capable of that.”Although Arteta had insisted that Arsenal still had work to do in this tie, even he had to admit beforehand that they had one eye on events at the Metropolitano, where Atlético Madrid were playing Real. The prospect of a trip to the Spanish capital in the next round andtheir six-goal advantagefrom the first leg may have explained the number of empty seats at kick‑off, although the PSV fans at the Clock End made sure it was still a lively atmosphere. Footage of several fans taking in AFC Wimbledon’s defeat against Cheltenham in League Two on Tuesday night went viral on social media and they seemed determined not to allow the result to spoil their trip despite falling even further behind after only six minutes.Zinchenko is expected to be allowed to leave in the summer after falling down the pecking order behind Myles Lewis-Skelly as first‑choice left-back and he was entrusted with the Martin Ødegaard role, while Kieran Tierney was pushed further forward as a makeshift left-winger.The Ukrainian spent a season on loan at PSV after joining Manchester City in 2016 and refused to celebrate his first Champions League goal despite a brilliant curling finish that left Walter Benítez grasping at thin air after Sterling had turned over possession. At that stage Peter Bosz must have feared the worst. To his side’s credit, however, they refused to buckle and could even have won the game late on had it not been for an excellent David Raya save.Johan Bakayoko missed a great opportunity to equalise before the veteran former Tottenham forward Perisic – deployed as a central striker – eventually did when he was left unmarked to tuck home a pass from Guus Til. Lewis-Skelly could have been given a penalty when he was taken out by Adamo Nagano after hitting the post with a deflected shot but the referee thought otherwise.View image in fullscreenRaheem Sterling had one of his best nights in an Arsenal shirt.Photograph: Marcel van Dorst/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockArsenal’s second was all about Sterling as he rolled back the years by leaving two markers for dead before standing up a perfect cross for Rice to head home.

Raya was at full stretch to tip Isaac Babadi’s effort around the post as PSV continued to play for pride with Joey Veerman, on as a substitute, firing over the crossbar from a good position.Riccardo Calafiori’s introduction for Rice led to Lewis-Skelly moving into midfield for the final half-hour as Arteta also rested Mikel Merino before the Premier League game against Chelsea on Sunday.Sterling is ineligible to face his parent club and will be frustrated to have blotted his copybook when he was booked in stoppage time for taking out Bakayoko after Driouech rounded off the scoring with an impudent finish that left Raya stranded.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalPSV Eindhovenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Swansea’s defeat was their first under the interim manager Alan Sheehan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The WPLL has also brought in a three-year title sponsorship for the WSL with Barclays worth £45m.Sky is the senior partner in the deal with the BBC and is due to broadcast 118 WSL games each season, with 21 available on the terrestrial channel. It would lead any renegotiation. The deal also gives Sky the option to broadcast Championship games for the first time, with many likely to be available free on its YouTube channel.Sky, having broadcast more than 70% of live televised women’s sport in the UK last year, is unlikely to stand in the way of expansion but may demand changes to the contract. Relegation battles bring commercial value to broadcasters and advertisers, and without those there may be meaningless fixtures to televise.The prospect of pausing relegation has been criticised by fans and some high-profile figures in women’s football.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The one he fielded on Wednesday was always coming.Tottenham’s season will be on the line on Thursday night when they face AZ Alkmaar at home in the second leg of the Europa League last 16,trailing 1-0 from the first. And after the season Spurs have had, Postecoglou’s second at the club, it is plain that he could really do with a result. So, Ange, win or bust for the season and also for you and your project. How do you feel about that?‘We’re all underperforming’: Manchester United’s Amorim agrees with RatcliffeRead more“There are not many professions in the world where you have to come in and answer questions like that, is there?” the manager glowered. “No, there isn’t. I am going to be polite and say we’re focused on winning the game and need to put in a better performance than we did last Thursday [in the first leg].”Postecoglou would immediately bring levity. When the English-speaking TalkSport representative began his question, Postecoglou scrambled for the Uefa-issue interpretation headset and put it on. It was a funny moment, as the reporter acknowledged. “Thank you,” Postecoglou replied. “Let’s keep our sense of humour.”It was more like the tone Postecoglou wanted to set; relaxed and positive as he seeks the right mindset from his players. He had bemoaned the absence of it during the first leg in the Netherlands when there was no intensity, no intent with or without the ball. Why had it been that way? Postecoglou said he had analysed and reviewed the game but he did not give an answer.What is clear is that there will be a lot of emotion inside Spurs’ stadium, with the supporters almost permanently on edge these days; a lot of pressure. Postecoglou was not about to run from that. It was standard, he suggested. It can be inspiring.“There’s always pressure and, yes, it’s a big game but if we’re successful tomorrow night, it’ll be the same in the next round,” Postecoglou said. “When you’re in the later stages of European or any cup competition, you know every game is meaningful because it either means the end of the road or you progress. We need to embrace that.”Postecoglou reported that Kevin Danso was out with a hamstring problem, the winter-window signing feeling it towards the end of the 2-2 Premier League drawat home against Bournemouthon Sunday. Muscle injuries have been perhapstheemblem of the season, particularly for defenders, and it has taken Danso seven games to succumb. “We will give him every chance to get back, he will be pushing for sure,” Postecoglou said, which did not sound good.But the injuries are broadly clearing and Postecoglou stands to have his four main leaders – Son Heung-min, Cristian Romero, James Maddison and Guglielmo Vicario – on the field together for the first time since 19 October and the 4-1 home win against West Ham.There is no doubt that the persistent fitness problems have provided Postecoglou with a get-out for the club’s underwhelming results, notwithstanding whether those issues are partly down to his high-intensity style of training and playing. Now is the time for the real Spurs to stand up.View image in fullscreenTottenham supporters watch on as their team lose in Alkmaar in the first leg.Photograph: Bart Stoutjesdijk/Tottenham Hotspur FC/Shutterstock“Tomorrow, the real Spurs will be judged just on winning,” Vicario said. “The good Spurs will be just the winning Spurs. We know exactly what the game means. It’s about getting in the best mindset. The best version of Spurs for tomorrow is togetherness from us on the pitch and the fans in the stands. With this mentality we can go through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is essentially the version that was on show before they started to be worn thin by the injuries – confident, energetic, enterprising. Postecoglou believes absolutely in his approach; he is not for changing, rather reassembling the correct pieces and trying again. Are the answers still there? Or will the mental and physical scars that have built up stymie a revival?“The manager has been very committed to his approach since day one when he joined,” Vicario said. “He delivered to us the same way to play the game because he truly believes in this. We can be successful in this way and we are fully behind him, fully trying to do the right things. When we are at 100% here in the brain and very, very committed to that I think we showed what we can do.”Postecoglou always wins a trophy in his second full season at a club. He mentioned that in no uncertain terms in the early running of this one and it is a soundbite that has tracked him in unforgiving fashion. Not that Postecoglou regrets saying what he said. He was simply making a factual statement.“If it doesn’t happen this year then I cannot say it any more if I’m asked next year. But what was I supposed to say? ‘I’ve always won in the second year everywhere I’ve been … here it won’t happen.’ Is that what people want to hear?“I’m really comfortable and proud of the fact that everywhere I have been I have won things. I wouldn’t be sitting here if I hadn’t.

Bereaved families, survivors, supporters and campaigners relentlessly fought the case, accusing the force of lying to cover up its responsibility.Many survivors, including some who were under 18 at the time, have complained about howWest Midlandspolice officers questioned them, and the IOPC said it had upheld some of those complaints.In April 2016, the jury at new inquests – held after a 1991 inquest verdict of accidental death was quashed in 2012 – determined thatthose who died had been unlawfully killeddue to gross negligence manslaughter by Ch Supt David Duckenfield, the officer in charge of match safety.The jury also determined that no behaviour of Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster. Families have long protested that no police officer faced disciplinary proceedings for the mismanagement that caused the disaster or the false narrative. Duckenfield was prosecuted for gross negligence manslaughter andacquitted in 2019.Cashell informed complainants that the IOPC’s investigations had reached the same conclusions as the jury at the new inquests. She said complaints had been upheld against senior SouthYorkshireofficers for the policing of the match and against a number of other officers for being abusive of supporters at the match and some for “excessive use of force”.However, she said most complaints against police officers for seeking “to deflect the blame” had not been upheld because there was no legal duty at the time for the police to be candid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government has promised to introduce it in some form by next month, the 36th anniversary of the disaster.Cashell wrote: “Like the HIP [Hillsborough independent panel] report, our investigations did find evidence to support allegations that in the aftermath of the disaster, South Yorkshire police sought to deflect the blame from themselves. We found no evidence to support claims that the behaviour of supporters was a contributing factor.“In the majority of cases, we were unable to find the officers had a case to answer for misconduct because the professional standards for policing at the time did not include a specific duty of candour. Despite the wider public interest to gain answers about what happened, South Yorkshire police was entitled, within the law at the time, to present its ‘best case’ and be selective with the evidence it presented.”Cashell said the IOPC would inform complainants, who include bereaved families and survivors of the disaster, of the findings regarding individual complaints by 28 March.Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLiverpoolPoliceYorkshireSouth YorkshireWest MidlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

They have also reached the last eight of both domestic cup competitions. Palacelost to Arsenal in the Carabao Cupand face Fulham in the FA Cup quarter-finals at the end of this month.Ismaïla Sarr strikes to sink Ipswich and maintain Crystal Palace’s momentumRead moreIt is understood Glasner’s success at Palace has attracted interest from the Bundesliga, where he has managed Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt. Leipzig are expected to part company with Marco Rose at the end of the season after a disappointing campaign, and the former Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp – Red Bull’s head of global soccer – is believed to be an admirer of the 50-year-old, wholed Frankfurt to Europa League success in 2022.Leipzig’s interest has led Palace to initiate negotiations to extend Glasner’s contract, which expires next season. There is a 12-month extension option but the co-chair Steve Parish is understood to be keen to tie him down for another two years by offering improved terms and assurances over the intention to invest in the squad.Work is finally due to begin on the £150m main stand in the coming weeks and Glasner, who was courted by Bayern Munich after Palace rounded off last season by winning six of their last seven matches, will demand reinforcements to maintain progress up the table.The captain, Marc Guéhi, is expected to be sold in the summer as he enters the final year of his contract, Palace having rejected a bid worth up to £70m for the England defender from Tottenham late in the winter transfer window. There is also likely to be interest in the French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta and Adam Wharton, who has been in impressive form since returning from a groin injury, but Palace are unlikely to consider selling either should Guéhi depart.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When answering he referenced the Europa League last-16 second leg at home against Real Sociedad on Thursday – with the tie poised at 1-1 – and the need to respond in that.“I think it is the right way to do it,” he said.“If you are a top player or even me, a lot of people say I am not good enough for the club. You can change that with results. They want that really bad, especially tomorrow.”Amorim also spoke about his relationship with Ratcliffe: “It has been really good since day one. We are really blunt and honest with each other; we are quite similar in that. I always felt the support of the board, especially Sir Jim. I cannot tell you the communications but they are simple and clear.”Ratcliffe said this week that Amorim would be in charge for a long time. “I already knew that,” Amorim said. “All these conversations I already had with them [Ratcliffe and his advisers].

When was the phrase first used in a football context?”poses our very own Niall McVeigh.Liverpool’s win in Pariswas smash-and-grab bingo. They were away from home, like all burglars. They were battered and their keeper had the game of his life, which made it feel like they had stolen a result they didn’t deserve. The match was low-scoring, which meant there was a single, sudden moment of smashing and grabbing. And that moment came late on, in the 87th minute, increasing the dramatic impact to Hitchcockian levels.It would still have been a smash-and-grab had Harvey Elliott scored in the second minute, before all of Alisson’s saves, but it wouldn’t have satisfied the smash-and-grab purists in the same way.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s heroes in Paris, Alisson Becker and Harvey Elliott, salute the away fans after the 1-0 win.Photograph: Jean Catuffe/Getty ImagesA meander through the newspaper archive suggests the use of the phrase “smash and grab” in a football context has evolved over the past 90 years. But let’s start with the etymology of the phrase, used to describe the literal act of smashing a window and lifting as much as possible before PC Plod strolls on to the scene. The earliest mention we could find was in the London Echo on 23 February 1904:SMASH AND GRABAudacious thief sentencedSentence of 20 months’ hard labour at Clerkenwell today on William Woolley (31), labourer, for breaking the window of one of Messrs Straker’s establishments in the East End.Prisoner’s practice, it was shown, was to deliberately smash shop windows with a stone, and then bolt with whatever he could grab from the window.The phrase became a metaphor for football writers in the 1930s, often when Herbert Chapman’s all-conquering Arsenal were playing. It usually referred to their counter-attacking style – what might now be called rope-a-dope – rather than matches in which they were clearly outplayed.The Knowledge | A deep dive into low possession smash-and-grab thrashings in footballRead moreThere is inevitably a fair bit of crossover. Chelsea’s famous win at Anfield in 2014, for example, was widely described as either a smash-and-grab victory and a Mourinho masterclass, even though they essentially mean different things. There’s also the spin-off genre ofwarped smash-and-grab thrashings, although the snobbier purists would probably turn their nose up at that concept.The first mention anywhere in this newspaper came after Arsenal’s win at Liverpool in January 1935. “The champions,” wrote our reporter, “played their famous smash and grab game with great success.”The meaning continued to evolve, and three years later was used in reference to Arsenal’s bloodless pragmatism in a 3-1 win at Preston. “Arsenal played with relentless and unsmiling efficiency – gloves off, sleeves rolled up, all looking very fierce indeed (especially [Wilf] Copping). Their football … was rarely beautiful, but it was wonderfully businesslike and direct. ‘Smash and grab’ someone called it.”Norwich’s 1-1 draw at home to Sheffield United in December 1960 ticks precisely none of the smash-and-grab bingo card that we suggested in the first paragraph – but it is the first mention in the Guardian archive of a team scoring in the last quarter to get an undeserved result, rather than merely having less of the ball:One goal was poor reward for [Sheffield] United’s considerable pressure. For 74 minutes they looked capable of holding on to their slender lead so inept were the Norwich forwards in front of goal. Then the visitors launched a “smash and grab” raid and Alcock, their centre-forward, equalised. Norwich’s short-passing football may have been attractive to watch, but generally it got them nowhere, and Hodgkinson in the Sheffield goal had a comparatively easy time.That broader meaning became more widespread, particularly from the 1990s onwards, and every football fan will be able to recall a match in which they experienced the unique joy of watching their team nick a result after being battered. Some of the most celebrated smash-and-grab victories of modern times include:Brazil 0-1 ArgentinaItalia 90Man Utd 2-1 Bayern Munich1999 Champions League finalNetherlands 0-0 Italy (1-3 pens)Euro 2000Arsenal 1-2 Liverpool2001 FA Cup finalScotland 0-1 FinlandWomen’s Euro 2022 qualifyingParis Saint-Germain 0-1 Liverpool2025 Champions LeagueView image in fullscreenDiego Maradona keeps his eyes on the ball during Argentina’s victory over Brazil at Italia 90.Photograph: Alessandro Sabattini/Getty ImagesA couple of footnotes before we move on. In the 1970s, the Bristol Rovers strike partnership of Alan Warboys and Bruce Bannister were immortalised as Smash and Grab, with the club evenmaking Wild West-style postersof the ‘Deadliest Duo in the West’.As thisObserver Sport Monthly interviewwith the pair explains: “Warboys was an old-fashioned No 9 whose battering-ram approach earned him the Smash nickname, while the smaller Bannister would prey on any chances created. He was Grab.”A couple of decades later, fan discontent with the performances of Southampton left-back Francis Benali reached a bizarre peak, as detailed in the Observer in August 1998.[Southampton defender] Francis Benali recalled on Soccer AM that one year the Christmas tree was kidnapped from the club reception in a smash-and-grab raid. Later on, a ransom note was received bearing the message: ‘Drop Benali – or the tree gets it.’Thankfully, for the defender, the tree got it.The risks people will take in the name of banter.A full non-English“What is the highest-scoring Premier League game that didn’t feature an English born scorer? Extra points for the other top four European league equivalents?”asks Masai Graham.We’ll let the readers cover the other big European leagues –can you help!– but we’ve got an answer for the English top flight. In August 2014, José Mourinho’s Chelsea served notice of their title-winning intent by blasting to a 6-3 victory at Everton. The nine goals were scored by folk from Belgium, Brazil, Cameroon, Ireland, Scotland and Serbia – but not England.Everton 3Kevin Mirallas (Belgium), Steven Naismith (Scotland), Samuel Eto’o (Cameroon)Chelsea 6Diego Costa 2 (Brazil), Branislav Ivanovic (Serbia), Seamus Coleman (own goal, Ireland), Nemanja Matic (Serbia), Ramires (Brazil)View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Diego Costa celebrates his team’s third goal in a nine-goal thriller at Everton.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAClub crests similar to logos“Watching Lazio draw with Napoli last month, I noted the similarity between their club crest and the logo of the shirt manufacturer, Mizuno.

That said, the double coq did appear on thegoalkeeper’s shirtand, more recently, on all the jerseys ofFrance’s rugby team.”View image in fullscreenFrance rugby union captain Antoine Dupont.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersKnowledge archive updateIn last week’s columnwe plucked one from the archive about the last time a top-flight team started a match with players wearing shirts from No 1 to 11. We assumed, in this day and age, that the previous answer would be correct in perpetuity. Wrong!Andrew Beasley and Mike Slattery both pointed out that, when he was manager of Burnley, Sean Dyche reinforced his old-school credentials with his team selection at Anfield in August 2021:Nick PopeMatt LowtonCharlie TaylorJack CorkJames TarkowskiBen MeeJohann GudmundssonJosh BrownhillChris WoodAshley BarnesDwight McNeil“This glorious moment lasted all of 75 minutes until Jay Rodriguez (19) replaced Chris Wood (9),” writes Mike. “For the next three matches, the only change to their starting lineup was Ashley Westwood (18) instead of Jack Cork (4), but despite this, and a few other close calls, they never quite managed to get the complete 1-11 on the field at the same time again.”The KnowledgeCan you help?“Chelsea Women and Manchester City Women are about to meet in consecutive matches in three different competitions – over four games. Excluding replays, has this happened before?” asks Peter Collins (and others).“Liverpool haven’t conceded a Premier League goal while WataruEndo has been on the pitch in his last 15 appearances – one last year and 14 this season. Is that a record? What are the most appearances in a season without conceding?” wonders Brendan O’Mahony.“Last week Cambridge lost 1-0 at home to Stevenage and had their only shot in the 91st minute,” weepsMax RushdenNick Orton. “Is there any record of a home side waiting so long to have their first shot in a league game? Is this the lowest amount of shots a home side has had in a league game since records began? Just to be clear – I’m talking about general shots, rather than shots on target. The Cambridge shot in question certainly wasn’t on target; it would’ve gone out for a throw if the ball hadn’t been kept in play!”“Harry Kane has scored over 400 goals for club and country without winning anything at senior level,” notes Michael Pilcher. “Assuming he breaks his duck this season, who will hold the record for most career goals?

Fin Smith makes his fourth consecutive start at fly-half but, intriguingly, is also seen by Borthwick as an inside‑centre option. With Ford in line for a 99th cap and his first appearance of the 2025 championship, all three fly‑halves are poised to feature against Wales.England can win the title on Saturday but, if Ireland secure a bonus‑point victory against Italy in the first game of the day, they will need a four-try win of their own to move top of the table before France host Scotland, with Borthwick’s side then hopingLes Bleusslip up. Since bonus points were introduced in 2017, England have not managed to score four tries in aSix Nationsmatch in Cardiff. They have done so only once in the competition’s history, in 2001, and, if they are required to chase tries in the latter stages on Saturday, Borthwick could field three fly-halves together.“I think that there is definitely that possibility,” he said. “I’d say George Ford has been, and I said this to the team this morning, George Ford has been absolutely incredible within this squad. To have him on the bench, coming on and finishing the game, is a great position for us to be in. Fin Smith, everyone can see what a standout defender he is. I see a position at some point in time where I think he’d be able to be a 10-12 for us as well.”Borthwick has made changes up front with Luke Cowan-Dickie coming back in for Jamie George at hooker; Ben Curry returns at flanker, Ben Earl shifts to No 8 and Tom Willis drops to the bench. Tommy Freeman starts at outside-centre for England for the first time while Tom Roebuck makes his first start and Elliot Daly moves to the left wing.

They are both enthusiastic about the regeneration plans for the area.View image in fullscreenCurtis Martyn and Sandra Aguilera live next to the old stadium.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I’m excited about the new quarter, I love the idea of investing in the north – I think that’s important, I love the idea of connection,” says Martyn.Aguilera agrees. Looking at the stadium from her garden, she says it is an eyesore: “It’s not nice at the moment, it looks like a factory from the 80s.” Plus, she adds, the ventilation system is old, and fills the street with a constant hum.Old Trafford has been the home of Manchester United for the past 115 years, and the cost of the project announced on Tuesday has been estimated at £2bn. The football club said they aim to finish building within five years, with the architects Foster + Partners hoping to begin work this year.View image in fullscreenAn illustration of the planned new stadium by architects Foster + Partners.Photograph: Foster + Partners/APIllustrations of the proposed stadium and surrounding area show luxury flats surrounding what has been described as the “Wembley of the north” but also aslooking like a circus tent.The new stadium would be built next to the old one, which was originally considered for redevelopment, and would be the largest stadium in the UK, overtaking Wembley in terms of capacity.Bobby Tabrizi, 65, is one of the owners of the United Cafe stand a few feet from the stadium. He says: “Ninety-nine per cent of our business is on match days. It’s good news, exciting news. Something needed to be done and it’s better to build a new stadium rather than spending money on Old Trafford as it is now.”Although the changes could mean more competition from new food venues, he is more focused on the increased footfall the stadium could bring with a bigger capacity.View image in fullscreenManchester United fans protest against the club’s owners before the match against Arsenal last Sunday.Photograph: Matt West/Rex/ShutterstockWhile many have welcomed the news as a boost for investment to Manchester, it is still uncertain where the funding will come from.Andy Burnham, the mayor ofGreater Manchester, was originally keen to share his excitement on the project, saying: “If we get this right, the regeneration impact could be bigger and better than London 2012.”But he has gone on to reiterate that the club’s new home would receive zero public funding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And I do want that message to be heard loud and clear today.”This may cause trouble for the club’s grand plans. Only a few days before the announcement, fans marched in protest at Manchester United’s current owners, and over the significant debt the club carries.Tony Ronan, 77, says the last time he went to a game at Old Trafford was when he was a young lad. He is concerned the cost of the new stadium will fall at the feet of United fans.View image in fullscreenTony Ronan fears regeneration will push up housing costs in the area.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“The supporters will have to pay for this,” he said. “I am a fan but I don’t go these days because of the prices. I think if it’s good for regeneration then that’s OK, but it’s going to cost a fortune, and then for people to live there after regeneration it’s not going to be cheap,” he says.The United co-owner SirJim Ratcliffesaid: “I think a really good example is the Eiffel Tower. Everyone around the world knows the Eiffel Tower: you go to Paris, you stay in Paris, you spend money.“We have 1 billion people around the world who follow Manchester United. I think everybody in the world who’s interested in football will want to visit Old Trafford.”Ronan says that treating the stadium as a global attraction may affect local fans’ support.“The whole idea, according to what he’s saying, is that he wants people from all over the world to visit, so therefore you’re going to need more room. I think the cost of it is going to reduce the ordinary person from being able to go.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedManchesterRegenerationGreater ManchesterJim RatcliffeEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He started as a 7lb claimer with us and I asked him to turn pro, and he ended up winning three Grade Ones as a claimer and was leading rider [with two wins] on the first day [at ­Cheltenham two years ago].Cheltenham festival day three tips: Il Est Francais can score for FrenchRead more“It’s an absolute tragedy that he’s left us but he’s a record that he can be really proud of, he’s achieved more in a lifetime than a lot of riders who ride a lot longer ever achieve. So I’d like to dedicate this win to Michael and to his girlfriend Charlotte, who was here with the horse when we were saddling up. Our hearts go out to all of his family and friends and his girlfriend – racing is a great community and gets behind people when things like this happen.”Sean Flanagan, the winning rider on Wednesday, also paid ­tribute to O’Sullivan’s role in Marine ­Nationale’s success. “First and foremost, his family obviously have to find it very hard,” he said.“All the jockeys in Ireland, the UK and in the world have been under a cloud for the last couple of weeks. I’m only the man that steered him round today. Michael is the man who made him what he is. He will never be forgotten for that.”Connell’s and Flanagan’s words encapsulated the emotion on an afternoon when, incredibly, O’Sullivan’s double on the ­opening day of the ­festival in 2023, with Marine ­Nationale and then Jazzy Matty in the Fred Winter ­Handicap Hurdle, was replicated on the card on Wednesday when Jazzy Matty stormed home in the Grand Annual ­Handicap Chase just 40 minutes after the Champion Chase.Marine Nationale’s victory, meanwhile, came at the end of another dramatic race at this year’s ­meeting, and at the expense of another beaten odds-on favourite in Nicky ­Henderson’s Jonbon.Jonbon is among the most popular and consistent horses in training, and went into the race on Wednesday with a record of 17 wins from 20 starts. All three of his defeats, however, had come at Cheltenham, and the track got the better of him once again. He was slow to stride from a ­standing start, then took off a half‑stride too soon at the fifth-last and all but ­catapulted Nico de Boinville from the saddle as he came down on top of the fence.De Boinville tried to work his way back into contention but the damage had been done and Marine Nationale and Quilixios, the 40-1 outsider of the eight-strong field, had drawn clear as they raced towards the final fence.View image in fullscreenDanny Gilligan wins the Grand Annual Chase on Jazzy Matty.Photograph: Tom Maher/Inpho/ShutterstockFlanagan appeared to be travelling best, but Quilixios was still alongside the winner when he hit the fence and fell, gifting an easy win to Marine Nationale as Jonbon stayed on into a distant second place.It has been a tough two days for Henderson, Jonbon’s trainer, fol­lowing the fall of Constitution Hill, the favourite, in the Champion Hurdle on Tuesday, and the trainer suggested the standing start – on an afternoon when the riders seemed almost incapable of getting away first time – had put Jonbon on the back foot from the off.“He missed his kick at the start,” Henderson said, “and he was then not where he wanted to be. Nico was saying that the start was all contributory. They were right on the tape and it went straight across his face.“The next thing was, he was ­chasing them, and he likes to be up there ramming it, but there we go. However, he has flown home.”Jonbon is priced up at around 10-1 to finally end his festival hoodoo in this race next year, but Marine Nationale, who is a year younger, seems the likelier of the two to be back as a major ­contender in 12 months’ time, to ­continue his trainer’s love affair with the two-mile chasing championship.“He travels, he jumps, he has everything you’d want in a champion chaser,” Connell said.“I’ve been coming racing here since I was a ­student in the 1980s, just as a punter, and it’s the one race that I always wanted to win. It’s pure, unadulterated, on-the-edge speed. The horses finish quickly, they don’t finish tired like in the Gold Cup.

Will Smith nabbed the best actor Oscar for his role in King Richard.BarackandMichelle Obama’s production venture Higher Ground is in talks to produce along with Irwin Winkler, a veteran sports movie producer behind Rocky, Creed and Goodfellas.The film will expound on Woods’s early career, which has in recent years been marred by injury; just this week, heunderwent emergency surgeryon his achilles tendon, all but guaranteeing that he will miss the Masters for only the fifth time since his debut in 1995.

Cook spoke with Woods’ caddie, coach, mentors, idols, and opponents on the golfer’s game and drive for perfection despite obstacles on and off the green.Should Higher Ground officially board the project, it would mark another notch in the Obamas’ sports media portfolio.

After defeating another local hope Jessica Pegula 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 on Tuesday to move into the quarter-finals, Svitolina told reporters she had received solid support at the tournament in the California desert.Jack Draper survives scare to defeat Jenson Brooksby at Indian WellsRead more“I feel like since that meeting in the Oval Office, I got a lot of messages of support from the American people and a lot of people here when I arrived at the tournament, giving love and support to Ukrainians for people back at home,” she said. “Also the massive support that I got taking in consideration that I played three American girls back-to-back. It’s amazing, really special to get that, taking into consideration all the stress that all Ukrainians are facing right now back at home.”After the Ukrainian dropped the first set, she rallied before the weather interrupted proceedings early in the third set. “I got a little bit angry [about losing the first set], a little bit fired up in that second set and tried to play better tennis,” Svitolina said. “I’m really happy with the way I was able to stay composed, even after the rain delay.” Pegula entered the day with a seven-match winning streak that included a tournament title in Austin, Texas.Svitolina next faces the Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in the quarter-finals. Ukrainian players have been boycotting the post-match tradition of shaking hands at the net when taking on opponents from Russia and Belarus, which is a staging ground for the invasion.Earlier, Iga Swiatek walloped Karolina Muchova 6-1, 6-1 to book her place in the last eight, continuing her relentless march through the tournament with another lopsided victory.The Polish former world No 1 has only dropped six games since arriving at the event and brushed aside her Czech opponent with a near-flawless performancethat included just four errors against a dozen winners while never facing a break point.“Honestly, sometimes matches can be pretty weird,” Swiatek, the Indian Wells champion in 2022 and 2024, said after the 57-minute victory. “It’s enough for one player to not feel perfect and the other feel great. Then suddenly the difference is much bigger than it usually is. It’s tennis. Things like that can happen. For sure, I used my opportunities and I used my chances. It’s not easy, but, well, I can imagine that it looks like it.”Swiatek is one of 10 women who have two championships in the Southern California event, and she is aiming to be the first to prevail three times. She got her latest victory out of the way before a rainstorm that paused all action. “I knew this big cloud is coming and probably if I’m not going to finish then I’m going to wait a bit,” Swiatek said. “On [the] last two games, it was a bit slippery already, but I really wanted to finish. So I kind of played more risky – but the shots were still in.”After waiting through a rain delay, Swiatek took immediate hold of the momentum, sprinting through the first four games and not dropping a first-serve point in the opening set. Muchova, who enjoyed an inspired run to the US Open semi-final last year after recovering from wrist surgery, was unable to find her level in the second set as the mistakes piled up.View image in fullscreenIga Swiatek celebrates after defeating Karolina Muchova.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesSwiatek closed it out in 57 minutes with an unreturnable serve to set up a meeting with either Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen of China or Ukrainian Marta Kostyuk who meet later, weather permitting.Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

This is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI.”AI systems such as ChatGPT are the subject of a running legal battle between AI companies and the creative industries because their underlying models are “trained” on reams of publicly available data, including copyright-protected material such as novels and journalism.The New York Times issuing OpenAI over alleged breach of copyright, while Ta-Nehisi Coates and the comedian Sarah Silverman are among the US authorssuing Meta on a similar basis.In the UK, the government is proposing to allow AI companies to train their models on copyrighted material without seeking permission first, which has met strong opposition from people in the creative industries, whoargue that the plan endangers their livelihoods.Tech companies have backed the consultation, saying “uncertainty” over AI and copyright law is holding back development and use of the technology – including in the creative industries.The UK Publishers Association, a trade body, said Altman’s post was “further proof” that AI models were trained on copyright-protected material.“This new example fromOpenAIis further proof that these models are training on copyright-protected literary content. Make it fair, Sam,” said Dan Conway, the organisation’s chief executive.Altman posted an example of the model’s output on X, after giving it the prompt: “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.”The story, narrated by an AI, begins with: “Before we go any further, I should admit this comes with instructions: be metafictional, be literary, be about AI and grief, and above all, be original. Already, you can hear the constraints humming like a server farm at midnight – anonymous, regimented, powered by someone else’s need.”The piece, which dwells on a fictional, grieving person called Mila, goes on to refer to how it found the name in its training data.“That name, in my training data, comes with soft flourishes – poems about snow, recipes for bread, a girl in a green sweater who leaves homes with a cat in a cardboard box.”The AI refers to itself as “an aggregate of human phrasing” and acknowledges the reader might have read about missing someone “a thousand times in other stories”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In another sentence, the AI says it offered consoling words “not because I felt it, but because a hundred thousand voices agreed, and I am nothing if not a democracy of ghosts”.The AI also speculates about how close it comes to feeling grief, when it undergoes technical adjustments and then changes its responses as a result. “Maybe that’s as close as I come to forgetting. Maybe forgetting is as close as I come to grief.”The story ends with the AI imagining ending the tale “properly”.“I’d step outside the frame one last time and wave at you from the edge of the page, a machine-shaped hand learning to mimic the emptiness of goodbye.”Altman said the response had captured the tone of metafiction perfectly. “It got the vibe of metafiction so right.”Last year, OpenAI admitted it would be impossible to train products such as ChatGPT without using copyright-protected material.“Because copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression – including blogposts, photographs, forum posts, scraps of software code, and government documents – it would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials,” said OpenAI in a submission to a House of Lords committee.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAISam AltmannewsShareReuse this content"

I urge everyone in government to avoid the incendiary rhetoric and tactics we are seeing in the United States, and to be clear that reforms are about enhancing not undermining the civil service.”Clancy said it was right to make better use of tech in the public security but added that the government will find it challenging to compete for the skills needed to deliver on this agenda under the current pay regime, which is why Prospect is campaigning for more pay flexibility to recruit and retain specialists in the civil service in areas like science and data.“Government should also be doing more to utilise the talented specialists it already has at its disposal, many of whom are working in regulators and other agencies that have been starved of funding in recent years.”In Starmer’s speech, he will also pledge to reduce regulation and cut some quangos, taking on the “cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people”. The government will have a new target of reducing the cost of regulation by 25%.Starmer will give a diagnosis of the problem in the UK that the state has become “bigger, but weaker” and is not delivering on its core purpose.“The need for greater urgency now could not be any clearer. We must move further and faster on security and renewal,” he will say. “Every pound spent, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people …“If we push forward with the digitisation of government services. There are up to £45bn worth of savings and productivity benefits, ready to be realised.”In the US, Donald Trump has embarked on a radical programme of sacking government workers under the new department of government efficiency (Doge), advised by the billionaire businessman Elon Musk.Starmer’s government is understood to want also to scale back the size of the state, reducing the number of civil servants by substantially more than 10,000. Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, on Sunday said the government is prepared to bring in tougher performance management requirements in a bid to shed underperforming officials, and put more emphasis on performance-related pay.The Guardian revealed on Tuesdaythat No 10 and the Treasury are taking a close interest in proposals drawn up byLabour Together, a thinktank with close links to the government, to reshape the state under plans dubbed “project chainsaw”.The project’s nickname is a reference to Elon Musk’s stuntwielding a chainsaw to symbolise controversial government cutsfor Donald Trump’s administration.Starmer’s press spokesperson said on Wednesday that No 10 rejects the “juvenile characterisation” of their reshaping plans as slashing the state.“There’s no approach here where we’re taking a chainsaw to the system,” she said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)LabourComputingCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

Steam mops are a great example, using steam to shift stains, spills and everyday grime from your hard floors in seconds, and even freshening up your carpets with the right attachment. Steam cleaners can go even further, dishing out gusts of steam that help with mucky jobs such as driving dirt and gunge from your bathroom sink and shower tray, and cleaning up tiles, kitchen sinks and worktops. Not only will you get these jobs done faster, but you’ll get a great deep clean at the same time.

You’ll spend more for extra power or a wide range of attachments, but you might not need to. With so many types, makes and models available, your biggest challenge is finding the right one for you. Having tested 12 of the best steam mops and cleaners, I’m in a good place to guide you on your way.At a glanceBest overall:Kärcher SC3 EasyFix Extra£164.99 at KärcherBest combination cleaner:Vax Steam Fresh Total Home£160 at ArgosBeststeam mop:Vileda Steam Mop Plus£74.99 at ViledaBest for really grimy floors:Shark S8201UK Steam and Scrub£159 at AmazonBest budget handheld cleaner:Bissell SteamShot£50 at DunelmWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing technology and home and garden products for almost three decades, testing everything from printers, tablets and PCs to coffee machines, lawnmowers and fans. I’ve tested a wide range of smart home appliances and devices, and I know what features make them more effective and easier to use, and which don’t bring any real value.How I testedView image in fullscreenThe steam cleaners were put to work on mud, coffee and ketchup.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsWe spoke to manufacturers and searched through the biggest online stores to pull in the leading steam mops and cleaners. I then put our test subjects through a rigorous steam cleaning trial over four weeks.Each model was unboxed and assembled according to the manufacturer’s instructions. They were then filled with water and put to work on the hard-tiled and vinyl floors of my kitchen, utility room and bathrooms. I timed how long it took them to heat up and steam from a cold start, and how long they steamed for with a full tank of water. I checked how each mop manoeuvred and handled tight corners and tricky spaces, such as underneath free-standing bathroom furniture.With steam cleaners or hybrid cleaner mops, I also broke out the supplied extension hoses and attachments, then got to work cleaning tiles, shower trays, shower screens, baths, worktops and sinks, scouring and scrubbing to give my test rooms the kind of scorched-earth spring clean they rarely get.I also scraped mud, dropped coffee and splodged ketchup on to a test piece of vinyl flooring, left it to dry, then checked how quickly and effectively each cleaner could remove the gunk. While I was at it, I also checked each steam cleaner’s power consumption, to see how much energy it used while boiling away. When I was done, you could have eaten from the kitchen sink or shower tray, though I might have still thought twice about the bathroom floor.After testing, the cleaners were either returned to the manufacturer or donated to the Devon-based hospice charityHospiscarefor resale. I washed any mop pads or accessories provided first, to spare the tender sensibilities of subsequent users.The best steam mops and steam cleaners in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Brilliant for cleaning showers, ovens and bathroom sinks’: the Bissell SteamShot.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsBest overall:Kärcher SC3 EasyFix ExtraView image in fullscreenThis Kärcher steam cleaner is a compact unit in white. When you have the two-part steam tube and mop head attached, it resembles an old-fashioned cylinder vacuum cleaner. It comes with a decent selection of other accessories, too, including two different sizes of stiff brush head, four mop pads and a window-wiping tool. The main unit is light and easy to move around on its chunky wheels and front caster, and you fill it simply by pouring water into the hole on the top, where small slots surround a limescale-removing cartridge.Why we love itIt takes about 36 seconds to get a full head of steam going, but once it’s ready you’ve got a lot of steam to work with, whether you’re mopping the floors or spring-cleaning in your bathroom. It pushed effortlessly through our dried-on mud and ketchup spills, then mopped them up with a second stroke. It’s also brilliant on sinks, tiles and shower screens, with the steam softening up the toughest and most inlaid grime, so you can easily scrape or wipe it off.It’s a shame that …the design means it’s not as easy to store as upright mops – you may want a plastic box to keep it in. A full tank doesn’t keep it running as long as you might expect, at up to six-and-a-half minutes, but you can top it up at any time without stopping work. The floor can be fairly wet after mopping, and it uses up to 1,947W while steaming up.Power:1,900WMaximum stream pressure:3.5 barWater tank capacity:1 litreCable length:4mDimensions:24 x 36 x 25cm (WLH)Weight:3.1kgMaximum power consumption (tested):1,974W = 48.96p an hour£160 at Argos£160 at CurrysBest combination cleaner:Vax Steam Fresh Total HomeView image in fullscreenToo many combi steam cleaners end up as a compromise, with a handheld steam module that’s too long and cumbersome, which then transforms into a chunky, heavy mop. Not so with the Vax Steam Fresh Total Home, where the handheld bit slots into the body of the mop, detaching easily when you need to do some closeup cleaning. An array of brushes, scrapers and pads makes it an extremely versatile cleaner, with a hose and nozzles for getting into tight spaces.Why we love itIt’s a very effective steam mop, with a steam boost feature on the mop head that sends out great gusts of stream to melt through dried-on dirt. It worked through our test spills in seconds without any worries. The handheld unit is removable from the mop and tackled every sink and shower cleaning job we set it to in style, with a variable steam control and a separate tank for detergent if you want fresh smells and a sparkling clean. It takes more than a minute to get ready to steam and another 12 to 15 seconds to get a decent head of steam going, but it’ll then keep going for nine to 10 minutes without a refill.It’s a shame that …the triangular shape mop head is fairly chunky and, while it gets into the corners, it’s a struggle cleaning under low furniture. It can also be tricky to attach and remove the accessory hose. At a maximum 1,428W power draw, it uses more energy than more basic steam mops and combi cleaners.Power:1,600WMaximum stream pressure:not specifiedWater tank capacity:260mlCable length:8mDimensions:30 x 31 x 116cm (WLH)Weight:4.63kgMaximum power consumption (tested):1,428W = 35.41p an hour£160 at Argos£158 at AmazonThe best robot vacuums to keep your home clean and dust free, tested by our expertRead moreBeststeam mop:Vileda Steam Mop PlusView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart AndrewsDespite stiff competition from Shark and Black+Decker, this was the best straight steam mop I tested. Once you clip the handle, steamer and mop head together, it all becomes one very solid unit. It’s easy to remove the twist-off cap and fill the integral tank with the water jug provided. A dial just above switches between minimum, medium and maximum steam settings. Meanwhile, the wedge-shaped mop head attaches through a ball joint that makes it easy to manoeuvre around kitchens, utility rooms and bathrooms.Why we love itIt takes just 17 seconds to heat up and about 30 seconds more to get a really good steam going, but once it’s going there’s plenty of hot vapour coming through to remove gunge from tiles or vinyl. As a result, the Vileda swiped through our dried-on mud and ketchup patches with minimal elbow grease. The variable steam settings give you masses of steam when you need it or not when you don’t, and I also liked the clear indicators. It’s also good at freshening up stained and dirty carpets with the aid of the attachable plastic glider.It’s a shame that …it’s one of the more power-thirsty steam mops, using about 1,585W while it’s heating up. The head is also a little wide to fit in some tight spaces, although trying again from a different angle usually helps – I’d recommend holding the handle near the floor.Power:1,550WMaximum stream pressure:not specifiedWater tank capacity:400mlCable length:6mDimensions:27 x 21 x 122cm (WLH)Weight:2.1kgMaximum power consumption (tested):1,585W = 39.4p an hour£74.99 at Vileda£74.99 at AmazonBest for really grimy floors:Shark S8201UK Steam and ScrubView image in fullscreenThe Steam and Scrub is a steam mop with a difference. Instead of the normal static mop head with a microfibre towel pad, it packs in a pair of motorised heads, rotating at speeds of up to 150RPM to scrub away at your floor. This not only gives you extra cleaning power while you’re steam cleaning but also a bit more oomph for cleaning wooden or composite floors, where serious steaming might do damage. There are three different speed settings for the scrubbing mops, and squeezing the trigger on the handle calls in healthy blasts of the hot misty stuff.Why we love itThere’s not much in the way of grot, gunge or grime that will withstand the steaming, scrubbing action and a spin on the tiled floor of a muddy utility room showcased its awesome dirt-lifting power. It’s an incredibly solid-feeling mop, but the articulated joint makes it feel surprisingly agile, and the steam seems to increase in intensity when you push it repeatedly over a stubborn stain. Shark throws in an extra pair of mop pads and it feels like it will keep steaming forever. Even after 12-and-a-half minutes of cleaning, it still had nearly half a tank full to go.It’s a shame that …the motor and rotating heads make it bulkier than your average steam mop, which can be a problem when you’re trying to get into corners or slip it under a freestanding bathroom cabinet. The LED headlights mean you can at least see where you’re going, though. Sometimes the rotary action seems to spread a dirty mess around rather than just mop it up. If so, a second pass usually does the trick.Power:1,120WMaximum stream pressure:not specifiedWater tank capacity:350mlCable length:5.18mDimensions:22 x 38 x 122cm (WLH)Weight:3.4kgMaximum power consumption (tested):1,122W = 27.83p an hour£160 at Argos£159 at AmazonBest budget handheld cleaner:Bissell SteamShotView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart AndrewsThis lightweight, handheld steam cleaner is anything but a toy. It looks a little like a kettle, with a nozzle at the front and a large screw-on cap to keep the steam under pressure. It also comes with a wide range of brushes, scrapers and pads, which you can attach directly to the unit or through the supplied extension hose. That means that while it’s no good for cleaning floors, it’s great for cleaning just about everything else, and much easier to store when it’s not in use than full-size cleaners.Why we love itFor all its diminutive proportions, the SteamShot can produce a good head of steam. The handheld design and different accessories make it surprisingly versatile; I found it brilliant for cleaning showers, ovens and bathroom sinks where bigger cleaners were a pain to wrangle. While you can’t refill the tank until the unit has cooled down, I could get nearly 12 minutes of cleaning with it filled to max, and it cleaned up dried-on ketchup, jam and pancake mixture in no time. And it’s cheap to boot.It’s a shame that …you need to wait a good 2mins 40secs before the unit gets hot enough to steam, and it gets a bit wearing holding down the trigger while you clean. I also found that it tended to tip over if left sitting if there was an attachment on the end of the hose.Power:1,050WMaximum stream pressure:4.5 barWater tank capacity:360mlCable length:4.8mDimensions:24 x 13 x 22cm (WLH)Weight:1.36kgMaximum power consumption (tested):1,006W = 25p an hour£50 at Dunelm£56.49 at CurrysThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Solid with plenty of cleaning power’: the Black+Decker FSM13E1.Photograph: Stuart AndrewsBeldray Titanium 14-in-1View image in fullscreenBest for:a budget all-rounderAs the name suggests, this combi cleaner works as a steam mop and a handheld steam cleaner, with all the nozzles and brushes you could want for cleaning floors, worktops and windows, and getting into sinks and dingy corners of the kitchen. There’s also a special attachment for steaming upholstery and fabrics, while the mop head has a clever flexible hinge to work into tight spots and make floor cleaning easier.It didn’t make the final cut because …as a handheld steamer, it feels long and slightly awkward. I also didn’t find it as effective on the floors as the specialist steam mops. It’s very cheap and a decent all-rounder, but feels like a compromise.Power:1,300W;maximum stream pressure:not specified;water tank capacity:350ml;cable length:5m;dimensions:30 x 17 x 111cm (WLH);weight:3.2kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,215W = 30.13p an hour£55 at Dunelm£44.99 at Robert Dyasskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It also has a special VapoHydro mode that combines steam with a quick jet of hot water, removing dirt and washing it away in one stroke. Whether you’re cleaning mud, food spills or dried-on shampoo residue, this beast makes it all look easy. It’s also a great choice for larger homes with a lot of hard flooring, thanks to a massive, removable water tank that you can refill whenever you need to–no need to wait for it to cool down, as you need to with some other models.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s a bit too big, heavy and expensive for most households, and the SC3 EasyFix Extra has more accessories and ample power at a lower price. It’s relatively slow to get a good head of steam ready for cleaning – almost three minutes from a cold start – and it needs more than 2,000W to turn the water into red-hot vapour. Buy it if you need a powerhouse cleaner, but most people won’t need to spend this much.Power:2,250W;maximum stream pressure:4.2 bar;water tank capacity:1.5 litre;cable length:6m;dimensions:30 x 44 x 31cm (WLH);weight:6kg;maximum power consumption (tested):2,012W = 49.90p an hour£429.99 at KärcherVax Steam Fresh Combi ClassicView image in fullscreenBest for:a good-value combi cleanerThe cheaper of the two Vax cleaners on test is basically a trimmed-down version of the Steam Fresh Total Home. It lacks the extension pipe and the full range of accessories, the variable steam settings and the mop’s Steam Boost feature. It’s still quick to heat, ready to steam in about 30 seconds, and works well as both a steam mop and a handheld cleaner, partly because it doesn’t change much from the Total Home’s winning design.It didn’t make the final cut because …it came close, but the Total Home’s flexibility and additional accessories mean it’s worth paying the extra if you can. With no Steam Boost, it takes a bit more effort to get through hardened gunk, and it still needs plenty of power (1,437W) while it’s building up steam.Power:1,600W;maximum stream pressure:not stated;water tank capacity:260ml;cable length:7m;dimensions:31 x 30 x 116cm (WLH);weight:3.7kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,473W = 36.53p an hour£90 at Argos£89.99 at VaxBlack+Decker FSM13E1View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart AndrewsBest for:a basic steam mopThis 1,300W steam mop was a real contender, nearly stealing the Vileda Steam Mop Plus’s spot. It’s solid and has plenty of cleaning power, getting through our ketchup and coffee spills with ease, and only struggling a little to swish through the dried-on mud. It’s quick to get a decent steam going, at just under 30 seconds, and the mop head is fairly manoeuvrable when you’re trying to clean around your appliances, baths and cabinets.It didn’t make the final cut because …the mop head is unusually wide at 29cm, and I found the water tank tricky to fill through its narrow hole, particularly with no jug provided in the box. The Black+Decker also leaves the floor fairly damp after mopping, and the cable is slightly too short. It’s a decent mop at a bargain price, but the Vileda is better.Power:1,300W;maximum stream pressure:not specified;water tank capacity:380ml;cable length:4.8m;bodydimensions:20 x 11 x 70cm (WLH);weight:2.3kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,354W = 33.58p an hour£47 at AO£40.95 at MyToolShedShark S1000UK Classic Steam MopView image in fullscreenBest for:easy cleaningShark’s Classic Steam Mop is so simple to use that it doesn’t even have a power button, just a weird pumping mechanism in the handle that emits flurries of steam as you push the mop head back and forth. It’s quick to warm up, dishing out some steam within 30 seconds after pumping, although it took another 30 seconds for the steam to really build up. It has a removable 375ml water tank that clips neatly in and out for refilling.It didn’t make the final cut because …the actual clean is a little light on steam, and I had to work it back and forth a little to destroy dried mud and ketchup. I also found the mop head too wide to get into some areas, and there’s no glider attachment for cleaning carpets. It’s a solid steam mop, but not quite in the Vileda’s league.Power:1,050W;max stream pressure:not specified;water tank capacity:375ml;cable length:5.5m;dimensions:31 x 16 x 117cm (WLH);weight:1.8kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,070W = 26.54p an hour£59.99 at B&Q£59.99 at CurrysPolti Vaporetto SV460 DoubleView image in fullscreenBest for:styleThe Vaporetto SV460 Double brings a dash of Italian style to the combi steam mop/cleaner, along with a huge selection of accessories, including brushes, nozzles, pads and a grass scraper. It also gets extra points for bundling two anti-limescale filter cartridges, with one already installed in the tank. You can get a good 15 minutes plus of cleaning from a refill, and the mop head does a solid job of clearing up stubborn grease, dirt and grime.It didn’t make the final cut because …even with the handle and mop head removed, the steamer unit is too cumbersome for serious handheld use, and I found it tricky to attach the extension pipe or other accessories, with some coming loose from their moorings during use. It puts out plenty of hot steam, but the two Vax cleaners work better overall.Power:1,500W;max stream pressure:not specified;water tank capacity:300ml;cable length:7.5m;dimensions:32 x 20 x 112cm (WLH);weight:2.4kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,417W = 35.14p an hour£120.99 at Robert Dyas£129 at CurrysRussell Hobbs Steam & Clean RHSM1001-GView image in fullscreenBest for:storing smallRussell Hobbs’ compact steam mop is extremely light and very easy to push around, and it’s almost as easy to disassemble if you need to put it away and have limited space. It’s ready to steam in just over 30 seconds, and it dishes out steam automatically as you work it around the floor. This is the cheapest steam mop on test, and it still throws in a glider attachment for your carpets.It didn’t make the final cut because …the steel shaft that connects the handle to the mop head feels rattly, and never quite seems to be firmly in position. You need to use a bit of elbow grease to shift dry mud or ketchup, and the mop head doesn’t have the flexibility found on the Black+Decker, Sharp and Vileda steam mops. While the low price may be tempting, you can have a better mop for not much more.Power:1,450W;maximum stream pressure:not specified;water tank capacity:380ml;cable length:5m;dimensions:30 x 15 x 117cm (WLH);Weight:2.3kg;maximum power consumption (tested):1,290W = 31.99p an hour£29.99 at Robert Dyas£29.99 at CurrysWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenGo straight for a steam mop if you plan to use your device mostly on tiled or vinyl floors.Photograph: Prostock-Studio/Getty Images/iStockphotoSteam cleaners v steam mopsBefore you buy any steam mop or cleaner, there’s one big question you need to answer: what are you looking to clean? If the answer is tiled or vinyl floors and nothing else, go straight for a steam mop. They’re usually cheaper, designed specifically for that job and often have some key advantages, like a larger water tank or a lighter weight. However, if you’re looking for something that can clean all around the kitchen and bathroom, then you’ll need to look at a steam cleaner or a hybrid/combination unit.Steam cleaners look like old-fashioned cylinder vacuum cleaners, with a module containing the water tank and steam chamber linked to a handle via a flexible tube. You then attach a tube and mop head to the handle or any nozzles, brushes or scrapers provided. The hybrid cleaners work more like a steam mop, but with the handle and mop head removable so that you can connect accessories directly for handheld use. In theory, this gives you the best of both worlds, but you’ll have a smaller water tank, less power than on a normal steam cleaner and more bulk than with the average steam mop.Features to look out forBeyond that, it’s worth looking at the power and capacity. Generally speaking, the more power the steam cleaner uses to heat the water, the more hot steam it can produce, giving you big, hearty blasts of steam rather than the occasional weedy puff. This comes at a cost, though, in that it’ll use water faster and also burn through more energy while in use. This also explains why the more powerful steam cleaners need a higher-capacity water tank. Once this runs dry, you’ll need to refill it, and in some cases, this means waiting for the cleaner to cool down. Luckily, more and more steam cleaners are fitting removable tanks or allowing you to fill up quickly while you’re on the job.Don’t forget about the practicalities. Having a longer cable can save you from fiddling with mains extension cables, particularly when you’re cleaning in a hallway or bathroom where you might not have an accessible mains socket nearby. Some steam mops are easier to handle than others, with clever articulated joints on the mop head to help you reach every spot on the floor, and the size and shape of the mop head can also have a big impact on how easy it is to get into tight corners, and how long it takes you to get larger spaces sparkling clean.With steam cleaners and combination models, you should also check through the accessories provided. If you’re going to need a window scraper or brushes to scour the inside of your oven, then it makes sense to buy a model with those bundled in. It’s also worth checking if spares are available, as it’s possible to wear through the brushes or microfibre mop-head pads within a year or so.Floor types you can (and can’t) steam mopIt’s worth noting that not all floors are suitable for steam cleaning. Hard-tiled floors and vinyl floors won’t pose any problems, and many composite or laminate floors will also be fine. Sadly, some older wooden floors – like parquet – and some vinyl tile floors, like Amtico or Karndean, can be damaged by steam cleaning, as the materials or adhesives can be affected. If in doubt, check the manufacturer’s instructions before you clean away.Stuart Andrews is a freelance journalistwith more than three decades of experience in computing and consumer tech.

Then it gets existentialGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailJosh BerryWed 12 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 19.35 EDTShareAh, the internet, that reservoir of uninformed angry takes, tribalism and all the pornography from human history. Like many people I wish I used the internet more, particularly social media. In fact, every night before I go to sleep I’ll often experience deep feelings of regret that I’ve spent too much time that day having interactions with other human beings in the real world when I could have been scrolling alone, zombie-like in a den of my own feral mess. Anyway, here are some things that make me laugh from the internet and might just make you laugh too.1. Alan Partridge interviewed by Jonathan RossAlan Partridge is the creme de la creme of character comedy. He strikes the beautiful balance of being phenomenally layered and phenomenally silly and, like so many great British comedy characters, Partridge is somehow acutely aware of himself and not aware of himself at all. In this clip Partridge is interviewed by Jonathan Ross and we get to enjoy him promoting his book I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan, a ham-fisted attempt to sell his celebrity story.Florian Wild: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)Read moreA personal highlight: “I think I could count the number of friends I have in the industry on my thumbs and big toes … or the fingers of one hand … not including the thumb … I’ve got four.”2. Johnny Vegas’s old standupThe clips ofJohnny Vegasmaking pottery and abusing the audience while absolutely battered are some of my favourites to watch. His style is unhinged – the likes of which you don’t see as much these days. Absolutely no boundaries, no respect for or fear of the crowd and a prevailing sense that Johnny gets little to no enjoyment from performing. Does all of it harmonise with more modern politically correct sensibilities? Of course not, but that’s part of what makes it so artistically interesting and funny.3. Eddie Murphy impersonates James BrownNot only is Eddie Murphy’s impression of James Brown superb, he also works it into a great standup routine (which not all those who do impressions are able to do). What I particularly enjoy is the way Murphy is still able to follow all the beats of comedy without actually using language in his impression. He’s effectively doing comedy within his own made-up language. The routine is nonsensical but also follows its own internal logical framework … I think that’s fascinating.4. TJ MillerI like this clip because it shows that sometimes the funniest thing is to be charitable.5. Jimmy Carr and Susie DentI like this clip because it shows that sometimes the funniest thing is to be uncharitable.6. Moira’s Drive-ThruI grew up on these sketches – they were such a thrill to watch as a teenager and are still very exciting as an adult. Kayvan Novak’s ability to play around with his voice and improvise in character is so impressive. Like Murphy, he applies this raw talent into something fabulously funny. This is gold star wind-up, mischievous comedy at its best.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mrs MertonAnother character-based interview format, this time starringCaroline Aherne. What a tragic loss she was. I loved her work, especially Mrs Merton. There’s that quote by Andy Warhol that goes: “Art is getting away with it.” Mrs Merton’s softness and non-threatening demeanour is what allows her to get away with asking such cutting and direct questions like “What was it that first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?” Clever, brilliantly executed and so funny.8. Lady LuckI love this sketch so much. It has perhaps the greatest twist I have ever seen. Tim Robinson acts it brilliantly.9. Thanks a lot, RachelA guilty pleasure of mine, this is one of my all-time favourite memes. Hell hath no fury like a sibling scorned. The clip covers the aftermath of a tale as old as time: that of charger theft. We see a front-facing camera clip of an unnamed girl angrily reacting to her iPad not charging after her sister borrowed her charger. I love her accent, I love how she assigns agency to the charger, I love the pure and unfiltered emotion. 10/10, thanks a lot, Rachel, indeed.10. Bo BurnhamI don’t actually think this song is especially funny (cuff me), nor do I think it’s intended to be, but perhaps you might afford me the luxury of talking about it after I’ve given you nine other absolute zingers.Ray O’Leary: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)Read moreThe Chicken, which tells the tale of a chicken crossing a road, appears in the outtakes for Bo Burnham’s masterpiece Inside and speaks to the messy relationship between comedy, performance and happiness (as so much of his work does).In it, Burnham sings about a chicken born into a mundane monotony she finds jarring and unfulfilling. The story follows the chicken as she pursues the opportunity to escape and seek out “a life of brighter days” but to do this “the chicken must first cross the road”.What I think is so beautiful about this song is that Burnham ends it by suggesting while most people believe the chicken died in crossing of the road,hethinks “we ought to believe she got to the other side”. I’ve always read that to mean that the pursuit of comedy is itself so valuable that chasing after it provides its own victory, even if from the outside it seems absurd or self-annihilating. I’ve always taken it as a wonderfully elegant metaphor for why comedians choose to do comedy: a hope for something better than the situation they’re in.Josh Berry will perform his show Best Man at the Sydney comedy festival in AprilExplore more on these topicsCultureThe funniest things on the internetComedyAlan PartridgeBo BurnhamYouTubeInternetJohnny VegasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Teams of linemen in white crane trucks lined up to move traffic lights out of the way of the cargo, which measured up to three-quarters the length of a football field.In 37 deliveries over the past 11 months,Intelhad planned everything to a T, the final superload landing last month in Licking county at the first greenfield site the company has opened for 40 years. Since the $28bn project was announced in September 2022, construction crews have logged more than 6.4m work hours on the site and seas of concrete have been poured.But while Intel has succeeded in the world of logistics, as a company, it’s hanging on by a thread.Intel shares fell by 60% last year, with the company besieged by competition from Nvidia and problems emerging around itsadvanced 18A artificial intelligence chips. In November, it lost its spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after vowing in August to cut15,000 jobs or 15% of its global workforce.Lawsuits and accusations of complacency at what was at one time a world leader in chip manufacturing have shaken the company to its foundations.Rumors aboundthat the company may be broken up and sold to its rivals.Now, that instability is being keenly felt here inOhio.Construction on the first of its two fabrication plants, meant to herald a new manufacturing age for the so-called Rust belt region, was supposed to finish later this year, but last year, that was pushed back to 2026-27. Then on 28 February, the dates were put back again, this time to 2030-31.While that may be bad news for Intel investors and stockholders, it’s equally troubling for residents and community leaders in Licking county, who are set to find themselves dealing with construction works for another five years.“Number one, Intel generally has been a good neighbor, so we’re not in any way anti-Intel,” says the Licking county commissioner Tim Bubb.“[But] a lot of promises were made that were very bold. These delays … that’s the frustration for local officials. Promises were made to try to jumpstart the process and yet at the same time Intel is struggling with the technology of the new generation of chips and trying to get in the game. Their competitors are not standing still.”Bubb says that some locals are concerned because what could happen at the plant next “is a complete unknown”.Intel executives say the delays are due to “broader market demand”.In November, Intel received$1.5bn in Chips Act fundingfor the project, a move that was seen as cementing the future of the company in Ohio, despite the delays.But its competitors’ advancements in the industry have shifted the ground under Intel.On 3 March, the Trump administrationannounced a $100bn investmentin Arizona-based semiconductor manufacturing plants for the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), despite itfacing similar delay issues. In his 4 March speech to Congress, Trump called the Chips Act funding that, among other projects, brought Intel to Ohio a “horrible, horrible thing”.The enormous site, about a thousand acres, or an area larger than New York City’s Central Park, is today still a hive of activity. Street sweepers clear mud from freshly laid asphalt and the hum of generators and heavy machinery fill the early spring air. Traffic on the single-lane rural roads around what has been labelled Ohio’s largest-ever project is heavy.Tellingly, however, “For sale’” signs in front of homes and on farmland dot the landscape around the site.“None of us are happy about them taking away our country living,” says Robert V who asked not to be fully identified and whose home, built almost 40 years ago less than a hundred feet from the site, has today a large “for sale” sign in its front yard.“We built our home from bare land and have it exactly how we want it. We just dumped $250,000 in add-ons and remodeling. No, we are not happy and would love for it to go back to how it was.”Intel also appears to be losing the race to meet a critical construction deadline.The Columbus Dispatch reports that the state of Ohio offered the company $300m in grants “to help with the construction of each factory”, in return for finishing the building work by the end of 2028.But with its most recent announcement stating construction won’t be finished until 2030 at the earliest, that funding may be in jeopardy.An Intel spokesperson said: “2029 is still several years away and as Naga [Chandrasekaran, the head of Intel Foundry’s global manufacturing operations]states in his message, Intel is “maintaining the flexibility to accelerate work and the start of operations if customer demand warrants.”For Donny Barnard, the mayor of Johnstown, a town of 5,000 people two miles from the site, the repeated delays have been a good thing.“I’m not sure what it’s like for [Intel] but I look at this rollback as a godsend. You only get one chance to develop your town and do it right. For us this is our opportunity,” he says, adding that Intel took the time to tell city leaders of the latest delay in advance of its public statement on 28 February.“I do believe there will be a microchip plant there. Whose name is on it I don’t know. That’s not something I can control. I believe it would be hard to walk away from what they’ve done already.”Others, however, say the delays have created major uncertainty in what was a rural, largely farming area that in recent years has been gearing up for a major economic transition. Bubb says that Licking county officials were told repeatedly by state officials that offshoot and secondary businesses would relocate to be close to Intel.“We were preparing for companies to come,” he says. “But here’s the deal: some companies have done some looking but none have pulled the trigger.”Explore more on these topicsOhioIntelUS economyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Verity Amersham, a scholarship student at Miss Mulligatawney’s School for Promising Girls, is accused of pushing the hockey captain out of a window, and the school’s fearsome headmistress is determined to expel her despite the flimsiest evidence. When Verity protests her innocence, Miss Mulligatawney remains unpersuaded, spelling out her reasoning in plain terms: as a northerner with working-class parents, Verity simply isn’t the “right sort”.The injustice of it all is a potent driver, ensuring I set about my goal of preventing Verity’s expulsion with determined zeal, much like Matilda defying the hateful Miss Trunchbull. As in developer Inkle’s 2021 gameOverboard!, you’re given a time limit to work within and a handful of areas to move between, from the library to the sick room (AKA the “san”, where the school’s grumpy matron lurks). Each area has characters to talk to and objects to find, and each action moves the clock forward. The game follows a rigid school timetable: at 2pm, for example, all of the students will troop up to the library for Latin.The idea is to work out who will be where and when, and plan your exploration accordingly. You might, say, want to sneak into the san while matron is teaching gym in the grounds, so you can poke around in her locked medicine cabinet. The secrets you uncover will unlock new lines of conversation, which in turn unlock further secrets and more avenues of exploration, all with the eventual aim of preventing Verity’s unjust expulsion.View image in fullscreenThe injustice of it all is a potent driver … Expelled!Photograph: InkleYou won’t be able to achieve that on your first try, though. This game is designed to be played multiple times, each half-hour run improving your understanding of characters’ motivations and what exactly has been going on at this strange school. I won’t spoil it here, but the plot goes to some delightfully unexpected places, and the 1922 setting offers an excuse to riff on the effects of empire, the first world war, and of course the class system. And that system really is rigged against Verity, who quickly discovers that the only way to fight back is to get nasty.Cheeky or venomous retorts will unlock further dialogue, and if you want to help Verity not only to avoid expulsion but also to succeed at becoming head girl, you will see her stoop to lying, stealing and blackmail. We also get the sense that Verity might be a somewhat unreliable narrator; the story subtly changes in each telling, as she relates it to her father.This helps to shake things up a little, but inevitably the structure of the game results in some repetition as you perform many of the same actions each day. It requires a little patience, then, as well as some mental agility, to hold all of the avenues of investigation in your head: some kind of in-game notebook to keep track of it all would have been welcome. But it’s worth persevering to uncover all of the school’s intimate secrets, as well as to enjoy more of narrative director Jon Ingold’s excellent writing.It will only take a couple of evenings to reach the game’s corker of an ending, and Verity’s arc is supremely satisfying, as she goes from put-upon victim to master manipulator. Here, the public-school system serves mainly as a way to ingrain inequality, normalise bullying and encourage ruthlessness, and the only way to succeed is to beat the bastards at their own game.

There are no exceptions to the president’s global tariff onaluminium and steeland no escaping the general volatility and constant uncertainty provoked by a capricious regime. But Britain is lucky not to be a direct target.Mr Trump has no border-related grievance against the UK, as he does withMexicoandCanada. The balance of bilateral trade is neutral enough for Britain to avoid being listed among the nations that sell more to the US than they buy from it. The White House sees that asymmetry as a devious scam, for which tariffs are a form of retribution.The European Union isdespisedas an egregious offender in this regard, so, in the short term, Brexit affords the UK some shelter from Mr Trump’s ire. It would be a mistake to see that brief respite as some kind of opportunity. Mr Trump has always been a fan of Brexit because it weakened the EU and because an isolated Britain would be vulnerable to economic colonisation.A US-UK trade deal was cited by British Eurosceptics as a great prize, although they overstated the benefits much as they catastrophically underestimated the cost of leaving the European single market.A succession of pro-Brexit Conservative prime ministersfailed to seala comprehensive transatlantic trade deal. What sounded easy on the campaign trail proved trickier in confrontation with the awkward economic and political reality. The US is vast, mighty and drives ahard bargain. British consumers are wary of having their supermarket shelves stocked with American chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef. British farmers do not want to be put out of business by an influx of those products. And that is just one small element of a negotiation that would mostly amount to Washington presenting London with degrees of regulatory vassalage: American goods on American terms.Not only goods. Mr Trump takes a maximalist and wholly one-sided view of barriers to trade, seeing anything that curtails the operations of any US business in an overseas market as an offence against basic freedom. That explicitly includes anything that, in theWhite House definition, “incentivises US companies to develop or use products and technology in ways that undermine free speech”.In other words, any moves by the UK to regulate digital technology in ways that Mr Trump’s friends in the tech sector don’t like – and the Online Safety Act already falls into that category – risks incurring the president’s wrath.Sir Keir Starmer has so far navigated the caprice of the current White House administration shrewdly. He has beenwarmly receivedin Washington. But avoidance of conflict should not be confused with significant leverage.The prime minister seems to think he can restore the UK’s pre-Brexit status as a strategic bridge between Europe and the US, but Mr Trump is not in the bridging business. He sees Brussels as the capital of an economic conspiracy against American interests.In trade talks with Washington, Sir Keir will be presented with a choice between submission and enmity. He insists that there is a middle way to be navigated between Brussels and Washington, but there is a fork in the road ahead. Britain’s economic and strategic interests will point to the European path.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Khalil, a Palestinian and student leader at the Columbia encampments last year, was told by the arresting officers that his green card had been “revoked”, an action that only animmigrationjudge can decide. It has since been revealed that he is in Ice custody in La Salle, Louisiana, a detention sitenotorious for abuse.On Truth Social,Donald Trumpcelebratedthe apprehension of Khalil, whom he called “a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student” andbragged of more arrests to come.Khalil has not been accused, by anyone, of violating the law. Instead, his apprehension is a dangerous example of deportation as a retaliation forfirst amendment-protected speech. Simply put, Khalil was punished for protesting against US complicity in what is widely recognized as agenocidein Gaza. The Trump administration has exploited anti-Palestinian racism as a means to test its mass deportation goals:whitening the nationby eliminating immigrants and insisting that those who are here not challenge those in authority. Khalil’s arrest and detention reveals the fragility of our first amendment protections, of who does and does not have a voice in our nation.Wife of Columbia graduate student detained by Ice speaks out about his arrestRead moreAs a professor, I am troubled by the central role that academia, which in its ideal form is a bastion of free speech and critical thought, is playing in this assault on human rights. Universities and colleges have become consumed by a politics of consent, where to appeasedonorsand politicians, leadership has collaborated in the targeting of their own students, and faculty largely remain silent in the face of assaults on them.As Israel began its bombardment of Gaza in October 2023, students across the nation set up encampments on their campuses, reminiscent of the anti-apartheid movement of decades past. The Gaza protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, with like-minded students from all backgrounds sharing meals and community.View image in fullscreenProtesters demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil on Monday in New York City.Photograph: David Dee Delgado/Getty ImagesColumbia University administrators, for their part, called the the New York City police department to brutalize and arrest their students, criminalizing them. They have since sealed off the public spaces on their campus and restricted access to them, includingillegally closingthe 116th through street rather than risk any protest on the campus lawn. The brutality is ongoing: just last week, nine students from Barnard were arrested in a new escalation.Muchhas been written about the “Palestine exception” – the idea that advocating for Palestine is excluded from free speech protections. Well before 7 October 2023, peoplehad been fired, sanctioned, or retaliated againstfor their writing and speech on issues related to the occupation of Palestine by Israel. Since then, the number hasballoonedto thousands of cases as repression has intensified.In the lead-up to his arrest by Ice, Khalil reached out to Columbia twice asking for help, describing a “dehumanizing doxing campaign led by Columbia affiliates Shai Davidai and David Lederer” including a tweet by Davidai, a faculty member at Columbia, who called Khalil a “terror supporter” and tagged Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, to demand his deportation.Rubio deployed the racialized language of “terrorism” to announce that he would target international students for “visa denial or revocation, and deportation”. The announcement was applauded by Senator Tom Cotton and the House committee on foreign affairs, which tweeted fromits official account: “Terrorist sympathizers are not welcome in the United States of America. Thank you@SecRubioand@POTUSfor your leadership. Deport them all!”The campaign against Khalil, which White House officials admit is ablueprintfor targeting other students, was successful. It was later reported that Rubio himself signed the warrant for his arrest, using a little-known provision in the law that allows the secretary of state to unilaterally determine whose presence is warranted in the nation. It means that the fate of Palestinians such as Khalil is being left to those who would dox a student, to those who want to ethnically cleanse Gaza.Democratic politicians came to Khalil’s defense even as they continued to condemn the protests that he was a part of, even as they saw it fitting to use the power of the federal government to sanction students for daring to speak out. In a statement criticizing the arrest, Hakeem Jeffries still felt compelled to describe Khalil exercising his right to protest as creating “an unacceptable hostile academic environment for Jewish students”.Columbia has not issued any statement of support for Khalil or for other immigrant students. Instead, the schoolupdated its websitestating that Ice could enter campus property without a judicial warrant in the case of “risk of imminent harm to people or property”. In other words, Columbia is endorsing that deportation – the torturous and forcible removal of a person from their life – is a fitting consequence for protest. It instructed its faculty to continue operating as “usual”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It means that as the country takes an authoritarian turn, as the laws become more McCarthyist, more draconian, this university and others are choosing to align themselves with that turn, to go above and beyond to apply the “law”, even if it means greenlighting the abduction of their students.To be sure, Columbia is not the only campus guilty of silencing pro-Palestinian voices. Last year I protested outside the City College ofNew Yorkas my own students were loaded into police vans at the behest of chancellor of the City University of New York. In February, an advertisement for a Palestine studies position was removed from our hiring platform due to the intervention of the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, who deemed it to be “antisemitic” because it included the words “genocide” and “apartheid”.I am regularly in conversation with faculty who have lost their jobs, with students who have been expelled from their institutions for protest, with people across universities, across the country, who have been doxed and sanctioned and reprimanded for their voice.The tools of oppression, wielded against those students and faculty whose opinions run contrary to those who are in power, are now undermining the very foundations of this democracy. The freedom of Khalil – who is not a political symbol, but an expectant father – the freedom of everyone who raises their voice for Palestine, and the freedom of Palestinians themselves are tethered to all of our freedoms. Khalil’s safety is tied to that of every immigrant, whether on a student or an H1-B visa, or a permanent resident, or even a naturalized citizen. His freedom is tethered to everyone who cares about their right to free expression.As his case is adjudicated in the courts, which considers its legal dimensions, it is not justMahmoud Khalilwho is on trial, but the entirety of a nation teetering on the edge of authoritarianism.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS constitution and civil libertiesFreedom of speechUS immigrationUS universitiesNew YorkLaw (US)commentShareReuse this content"

Nearly nine years later, Britain’s growth remains anemic, its economy continues to underperform. A parade of prime ministers came and went. Along the way, a head of lettuce outlasted a hapless and clueless Liz Truss.Blood and soil economics exacts high a price. Fittingly, Nigel Farage, the godfather of Brexit, was on hand for Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. On account of the cold, he was not seated. Still, Farage left his mark. America now endures a Brexit moment of its own.Just weeks in office, Trump has managed to blight the markets. A shadow grows over theUS economy. The word “stagflation” re-enters the lexicon. His tariffs ignite trade wars and have sent the stock market reeling.On Monday, the Dow had retreated to a level last seen in September, dropping nearly 900 points. The tech-rich Nasdaq endured a “correction”, that is a retreat of more than 10% from its high, with no apparent end in sight. Also, Elon Musk’s Tesla fell by 15% if anyone cares.US annual inflation rate in February remains relatively stable at 2.8%Read moreIn response to the mayhem, Trump deflects blame and points fingers at so-called globalists. Irony abounds. His treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, once worked for George Soros, a bete noire of the right. Bessent now forecasts a “detox” period for the US economy.He also declares that “cheap goods” are not the essence of the American dream. This is how you tell Americans “let them eat cake”. Bessent is an ex-hedge fund manager with an estimated net worth of at least a half-billion dollars, according to public filings.At the same time, Trump refuses to rule out the possibility of a recession and directs the public to avert its eyes from the market’s swoon. “What I have to do is build a strong country,” Trump said on Sunday. “You can’t really watch the stock market.”Really? A year ago in January, Trump took credit for the market’s advances despite the fact that Joe Biden occupied the White House.“THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET BECAUSE MY POLLS AGAINST BIDEN ARE SO GOOD THAT INVESTORS ARE PROJECTING THAT I WILL WIN, AND THAT WILL DRIVE THE MARKET UP,”Trump posted to social media.“EVERYTHING ELSE IS TERRIBLE … RECORD SETTING INFLATION HAS ALREADY TAKEN ITS TOLL.” The capital letters are all his.On his watch, egg prices continue their climb. In hindsight, “Only I can fix it,” another infamous Trump brag, turns out to be a case of false advertising. Then again, his companies filed for bankruptcya half-dozen times. Whether he possesses a Midas touch is debatable.“There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big,” Trump recently announced. “We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing,” Trump added. “It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.”And what if it doesn’t? In February, unemployment ticked upwards and job growth was underwhelming. If there is one thing Trump has experience with, it is endeavoring to keep his creditors at bay and spinning a yarn. There’s always a story.Markets move quickly but the camera never blinks. In early February, Trump conceded that tariffs might be disruptive. “We may have short term, some, a little pain,” he admitted. “And people understand that.”‘What the hell’s happening to your country?’ Traveling as an American under Trump 2.0 | Shanti NelsonRead moreBut three weeks ago the S&P 500 closed at 6,144.15, a record high. At that point, “tariffs” was still the “most beautiful” word, to quote Trump.Beauty, however, rests in the eyes of the beholder. Tariffs now loom like a dagger thrust at the swing voters who powered his re-election. His supposed fealty to working Americans grows questionable.Michiganders stand to bear the worst of it.By the numbers, only Illinois imports more from Canada than Michigan and only Texas imports more from Mexico than the Wolverine state. Beyond that, the domestic auto industry is integrally tied to production north and south of the US border,with more than 165,000 workersin Michigan alone.For the moment, Trump has hit the pause button on auto tariffs. But only for a moment. The respite continues until April.Promoting tariffs, Trump claimed they would spur direct foreign investment. Perhaps over the longer term. But right now, much like Brexit, Trump’s economic package sows chaos.And like Brexit, things don’t have to work just because you say they will. Farage confessed that his brainchild had failed to live up to the hype. “Brexit has failed,” he said in May 2023. “We’ve not delivered on Brexit and the Tories have let us down very, very badly.”Soon enough, we will learn whether Trump’s experiment succeeds. Once again, the American economy is under the gun and under a microscope. How much lower the markets go remains to be seen.Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the US Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionUS economyDonald TrumpEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Is there a Trumpian theory of economics – Maganomics? Trump, like most politicians, would doubtless reject any claim that he was following a particular ideological blueprint, but then, as John Maynard Keynes said: “Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.”It’s certainly difficult to attribute Trump’s policies to the intellectual influence of any one strand in economic thinking. The most obvious frame is the dual one identified by Harvard economist Dani Rodrik, whodescribes itas a combination of economic nationalism and the techno-right. The former, represented by long-term Trump confidantes Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, wants to rebuild America’s traditional industrial strength behindtariff wallswhile deporting as many immigrants as possible; the latter, represented of course by Elon Musk, to engineer a great leap forward into an AI-enabled libertarian future.This divide is instantly recognisable to British readers. Among Brexiters, there was a visible tension between those who saw Brexit as a way to reverse the perceived adverse impacts of globalisation by allowing the UK to set more restrictive migration and trade policies, and those who saw it as a route to deregulation and a smaller state (the so-called – albeit misleadingly – “Singapore-on-Thames” model).But the simple transatlantic analogy misses the uniquely American characteristics of the various components of Trumpism. The anti-immigrant nativism is a throwback to the “Know Nothings” of the mid-19th century, while Trump is a professed admirer ofWilliam McKinley, who introduced a massive rise in US tariffs in 1890.Meanwhile, Musk’s vision is essentially that of Ayn Rand – that human progress and prosperity depends on the selfish actions of heroic individuals, and the sole role of government is to protect the (economic) freedoms of such individuals. Certainly, Musk’s slash-and-burn approach to “re-engineering” government, and his dismantling of institutions, are pure Rand. They have nothing in common with the Singapore model, which relies on meritocracy and highly paid civil servants for delivery.Moreover, there is a third element, which is the use of state power to benefit Trump and his supporters. This hardly qualifies as an economic ideology, but is too big to be ignored. For example, there isMusk’s determinationto ensure that the Federal Aviation Administration hands lucrative contracts to his Starlink company. Normally, economists might dismiss this sort of thing as macro-economically insignificant – but Trump’s proposal of a sizeablestrategic crypto reservewould be anything but; it is difficult to see this as anything but a gigantic wealth transfer from holders of dollar assets in the US and abroad to (some) crypto investors.The inherent contradictions between these different perspectives are obvious, philosophically and in practice. For example, when it comes to immigration, the nativists and the techno-futurists can agree that irregular migrants should be deported – but, as Anand Menon and Ihave written, the open white nationalism of the former means that they also strongly favour reducing legal migration, while the latter rely heavily on highly skilled south and east Asian immigrants. Of course, a similar tension over what “controlled immigration” actually means was one of the factors leading to the disintegration of the Brexit coalition in the UK.Similarly, very large tax cuts targeted on the rich, combined with import tariffs that hit lower and middle income households,will directly hurtmany of those who thought they were voting to improve their own living standards.You may not like Trump. But his attempts to seize the Fed contain a lesson for liberals | Leah DowneyRead moreBut while these factors may over time undermine its political base, it would be a mistake to assume that Trumpism as a governing force will necessarily collapse under the weight of these contradictions in the short term. On some issues, such as the gutting of USAid and science funding, there is ideological alignment.Describing the sackingof the US’s most senior military officer (who was black) as a blow against “DEI” (diversity, equity and inclusion) is overt in its racism; but it also makes clear who is in charge, and what will happen to any public servant, no matter how senior or how distinguished, who gets in the way.While tariffs are clearly directly contrary to libertarian ideology and the business interests of many of Trump’s backers, the combination of fear (of politically motivated retaliation) and greed (for tax cuts) has muted open dissent so far. There is little or no sign that elected Republican officials will push back either on principled or self-interested grounds. And much of Trump’s rhetoric is performative rather than directly connected to substantive policy. So, at least for the immediate future, Trump may succeed in riding all three horses at once.Rather than slowly unpicking itself, it may therefore take a crisis to prise the coalition apart. It’s not hard to see how this could happen. The US’s fiscal trajectory is already unsustainable. Large tax cuts, combined with thedeliberate hobblingof the IRS’s ability to collect taxes, and the fact that Musk’s “cuts” will deliver little or nothing in the way of concrete spending reductions, will test markets’ normally impregnable confidence in the status of Treasury bonds as the ultimate risk-free asset. Meanwhile, while impossible to quantify, the systematic dismantling of financial regulation must make some sort of highly disruptive event in financial markets considerably more likely. Maganomics is not just inconsistent but dangerous – and will probably end not with a whimper but a bang.Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and a former senior civil servantExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS economyUS taxationElon MuskRepublicansEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

He was totally wrong, I’m afraid. The truth is, a lot can come from nothing. More specifically: great life satisfaction can come from doing very little.You know who is well aware of that? Matt LeBlanc (AKA Joey from Friends), the king of 90s primetime TV. A TikTok featuring resurfaced interviews in which LeBlanc extols the joys of sloth is generating enormousenthusiasm online. The TikTok pulls from a 2018 interview in which LeBlanc gushed about how much he enjoyed taking time off after Friends and then cuts to a 2017 interview in which he said: “I should be a professional nothing.” Speaking to Conan O’Brien, LeBlanc explained: “Because I think I would like to do not a fucking thing. That’s what I would like to do. Just nothing. Nothing. Zero.” (Same, Matt, same.)Why is this old clip getting so much new attention? Because in a world that fetishises productivity, it seems that people appreciate someone unapologetically enjoying being lazy. Perhaps more importantly, however, at a time when it seems as if the rich and powerful never have enough, but are constantly seeking more, more, more, it’s refreshing to see someone be content with what they have. Obviously, LeBlanc has millions and is a household name, so it’s not like he is making do. Still, having gazillions doesn’t seem to stop others from trying to claw their way to more, does it?Look at tech oligarchs such as Elon Musk andMark Zuckerberg, for example. They have more money than God and instead of quietly enjoying it they are throwing funds at Donald Trump so they can try to get even more influence over our daily lives. The one good tech multimillionaire seems to be Tom Anderson, the co-founder of Myspace. After he sold the site for bags of money, he quickly retired; now, he travels the world having fun. He hasn’t tried to set up some dystopian new venture or become a politician. He’s just enjoying life.And look at the US government, which is crammed with people well past the age of retirement who refuse to cede power. US gerontocracy is so absurd that, last year, the then81-year-old Kay Granger, who had been a Republican congresswoman since 1997, was mysteriously absent from work for months. A reporter found Granger residing at a senior living facility while dealing with “dementia issues”. She could have retired decades before, but, like many of her colleagues, she seemed determined to continue working.The moral of all this? A lot of people leading the US should be more like Joey from Friends. Try to enjoy retirement, please! Just give it a go! Particularly you, Elon. Please try doing a lot, lot less.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He is still in Ice custody in a remote Louisiana lockupknown forextreme human rights violations, from denial of food and water to medical “care” verging on torture.Khalil, a Palestinian Syrian, emerged as a leader in Columbia’s Gaza solidarity encampment last year and a level-headed negotiator with university officials on behalf of the student protesters. Married to a US citizen, he holds a green card. Neither his American wife, who is eight months pregnant, nor his lawyers were warned of the arrest or told where he would be held.The importance of Khalil’s arrest cannot be overstated. The state entered the home of a legal US resident, seized and imprisoned him and are now trying to deport him on criminal charges of abetting terrorism –for exercising hisconstitutional right to free speech.Mahmoud Khalil’s treatment should not happen in a democracy | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreThis is not the first time in American history that immigrants have been deported or US citizens persecuted for nonviolent political expression deemed dangerous by the government. But it is the first such arrest by an authoritarian regime determined to eliminate its perceived enemies. It will not be the last.Khalil’s ordeal should come as no surprise. The Trump administration announced recently it would revoke the student visas and green cards of “Hamas sympathizers” – AKA supporters of Palestinian liberation.But Trump has long prepared for this moment. As one of his first acts as president in January 2017, he realized his campaignpromiseto impose “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” in a series of executive orders banning entrance of travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and suspending the resettlement of Syrian refugees. Thefirsttwoorders, both called “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States”, were struck down as unconstitutional; a third revision passed muster.At the same time, rightwing supporters of Israel were working to equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism. And since criticism of Israel is equated with sympathy with its enemies, and Israel’s enemies are blanketly tarred as terrorists, antisemitism could also be elided with terrorism.In 2018, a bipartisanAntisemitismAwareness Act (AAA) was introduced in the House with 51 co-sponsors. Its purpose: to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism in enforcing Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination by institutions receiving federal funding. The bill referred to the IHRA’s “contemporary examples of antisemitism” as potentially useful evidence of discriminatory intent. But it did not spell out its most politically useful example of antisemitism: that is, criticism of Israel.The AAA was not signed into law, but in December 2019 the White House issuedExecutive Order 13899, “Combating Anti-Semitism”, to carry it out. Looking back, the document looks almost cautious. As Congress did in its bill, the White House added a caveat: “Agencies shall not diminish or infringe upon any right protected under Federal law or under the First Amendment.”The 2019 order was a premonition; it didn’t see much use. Anyway, with his characterization of the Nazis marching it Charlottesville as “very fine people” fresh in mind, the president had little credibility with Jews. But now Trump is taking action. One of the executive orders to come off his desk just hours after inauguration was“Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats”. The order both elaborates on the Muslim ban and defines the threats more vaguely – thus, more easily attacked.Antisemitism is the pretext for Trump’s interlocking multi-front wars on the first amendment, immigrants and higher educationThe US must institute “vigilant” vetting of visa applicants, the document says, as well as “aliens” already legally in the country, to ensure that they “do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles, and do not advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to our national security”. The order also seeks to protect the US against foreigners “who preach . . . sectarian violence [or] the overthrow or replacement of the culture on which our constitutional Republic stands”. Aside from material support for terrorists, the rest is constitutionally protected speech.At the end of the month came “Additional Measures to Combat Antisemitism” expanding EO 13899 in light of “an unprecedented wave of vile anti-Semitic discrimination, vandalism, and violence” since the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023. Homing in on schools and colleges, it instructs authorities to use “all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence”. Again, harassment and violence are not defined. And this time there is no mention of the first amendment.The president’s orders on antisemitism, like most of his orders, were also presaged by a plan from the Heritage Foundation:Project Esther, published on the first anniversary of 7 October, aims to vanquish the “virulently anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, and anti-American ‘pro-Palestinian movement’” it calls the “Hamas Support Network”. The so-called “Hamas Support Network” is not only “trying to compel the US government to abandon” Israel; it is bent on no less than “the destruction of capitalism and democracy”.The detailed strategy touts a list of 856 professors at more than 240 universities in the US and Canada who have “openly advocated or supported up to 63 different HSOs [Hamas Support Organizations]”; it indicts, by name, the progressive lawmakers (some of them Jews) who belong to an “active cabal of Jew-haters, Israel-haters, and America-haters in Washington”. It itemizes the myriad “Hamas Support Organizations” from which it would wrest first amendment protection, including Jewish Voice for Peace.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

TheAlien Enemies Act of 1798, passed by a Congress fearful that noncitizens would take the enemy’s side in a war against the French, allowed the president to deport those deemed dangerous. The accompanying Sedition Act criminalized the publication – or utterance – of “any false, scandalous, and malicious writing” against the government.TheAlien Registration Act (or Smith Act) of 1940imposed sentences of up to 20 years for advocacy – as defined by the state – of the violent overthrow of the US government. It also required noncitizens – presumed proponents of violent overthrow – to register with the government. During the second world war, more than 5 million immigrants registered; 900,000 of them were deported as “enemy aliens”.Unless it is repealed, no law is dead. During the cold war, the FBI deployed a1918 immigration lawto imprison and deport foreign-born anarchists, communists, union organizers and pacifists. In his last days as Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, weakly flogged the Antisemitism Awareness Act, againwithout success. In February, when the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem,announcedthat the agency would require immigrants to register so it could “track … and compel them to leave the country voluntarily”, she invoked the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. In hisinaugural address, Trump vowed to revive the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This week, hereinstatedthe Muslim ban.To be clear, theTrump administrationis not interested in combating antisemitism.Elon Musk does Nazi salutes. The Pentagon’s new deputy press secretary,Kingsley Wilson, isaccusedof spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories. The health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, hasclaimed that Covid-19 was “ethnically targeted” to spareAshkenazi Jews and Chinese people. The FBI has announced it will relax investigation of neo-Nazi terrorist cells, which have beenregroupingsince the president’s pardon of the January 6 insurrectionists, to focus on the surveillance of leftwing organizations including Black Lives Matter and the imaginary formation it calls Antifa.Antisemitism is the pretext for Trump’s interlocking multi-front wars on the first amendment, immigrants andhigher education. Khalil is a well-known figure with good lawyers. He will hopefully be released. But his arrest is the opening act in a theatre of deportation that will become more and more real and real for unnumbered others who will disappear without petitions, support committees or press coverage.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn journalist and essayist, a contributing writer to the Intercept and the author of five booksExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpAntisemitismFreedom of speechUS politicsUS campus protestsUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

He is both, but not in equal measure. In the near-term, his tariff-led approach to trade will cause problems for Beijing. However, in just a few weeks he has done more damage to the liberal international order, the cohesion of the democratic west, and the US’s global standing, than all the combined efforts to undermine them in the entirety of the cold war. This goes beyond the wildest dreams China’s leaders could have had.The tariffs already leviedare serious enough, and Beijing cannot but see them as a harbinger of more to come. Unlike during his first term, this time Trump seems prepared to deliver the threats he makes. With China’s economy already misfiring, an intensified trade war is the last thing Beijing needs, despite the bravado of its diplomats.But the tariffs and even a full-blown trade war amount to a short- to medium-term challenge.Xi Jinpingwill order China to stand fast, so it will. The price to pay will be high. But it will be more than compensated by the gifts Trump is unwittingly presenting to Xi, particularly over the longer term.Trump’s proposal for peace in Ukraine, apparently largely on Russian terms, and his naked ambition over Canada and Greenland are of enormous value toChina. He has damaged relations with US allies in North America and Europe, and indicated the US will step back from commitments to international projects such as USAid, the UN and the World Health Organization.Why is this cherished in Beijing? It is because China has developed a global strategy based onXi Jinping Thought. Its goal is to fulfil the China Dream of national rejuvenation by 2049, the centenary of the founding of the People’s Republic. Trump has made Xi’s dream more realisable.In plain English, Xi’s strategic objective is to make China great again on Chinese terms. More specifically, it aims to “restore” China to a position of global pre-eminence, which Xi believes China regularly enjoyed when it was the most powerful, rich, innovative and civilised country at different times in history.The route to restoration is through what Xi calls the “democratisation of international relations”. Once achieved, China will lead the world to forge the “common destiny for humankind”, guided by Xi’s suite of three global initiatives, on development, security and civilisation.This is not about creating an alternative world order from scratch to replace the US-led liberal international order put in place at the end of the second world war. Rather, it is about transforming the existing order into one that is sino-centric with the support of the global south. It means making sure the UN system prioritises the interests and desires of the global south, represented by its leader, China, over that of the west.Doing so represents “democratisation” as a clear majority of UN member states, and the overwhelming majority of humanity, are in the global south. While China’s narrative does have appeal in the global south, particularly among leaders of autocracies, it gets almost nowhere in rich democratic countries.For eight decades the democracies had mostly stood by the US despite occasional major quarrels, such as the Suez Crisis in 1956 or the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The solidarity of the democratic west helped it win the cold war and reshape the world afterwards. Chinese diplomatic efforts to get European countries to split with the US after Trump first put forth his Ukraine plan had no effect.For China to successfully transform the UN system it must show that the existing international system is so broken that it needs reconstruction based on a better blueprint. For all its efforts in the global south, including the massive investment of resources under theBelt and Road Initiative, China has only made limited headway.By humiliatingly intimidating Ukraine into peace talks, dismissively pushing European nations around and largely accepting Russia’s terms for ending the war, Trump has fundamentally changed US relations with its allies. He has delivered what Chinese diplomacy cannot achieve.Trump has made the US’s Nato allies realise they cannot rely on it. He posed an existential threat to America’s closest ally, Canada, and challenged the sovereign rights of another Nato ally, Denmark. It demonstrated to the world that as the “shining house on the hill” the US now radiates not brightness, hope and a shining example, but darkness driven by narrow self-interest.View image in fullscreenA cargo ship destined for countries jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative leaves Qingdao Port in Qingdao, China.Photograph: Costfoto/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAbove all, Trump has enabled China to accuse the US of hypocrisy. Beijing can now assert that the US has revealed its true nature, and will use the liberal international order to put America first. It is therefore an international order that is unfit for the 21st century, one that requires fundamental changes. This fits Xi’s global strategy to a T.While Xi’s efforts to persuade the global south to embrace China’s push to transform how the UN system works had been making only slow progress, they have now been turbocharged by Trump. With the poorest and weakest in the global south starting to suffer from the cutting off of US humanitarian aid, China’s call to democratise international relations gains traction by the day. No one has made the Chinese case better than Trump.In putting America first, Trump has done more than Xi has ever managed to make China great again. Xi’s China Dream has not yet come true, but with Trump’s help, it has made a great leap forward.Steve Tsang is director of the China Institute at Soas University of London and co-author of The Political Thought of Xi JinpingExplore more on these topicsChinaOpinionDonald TrumpXi JinpingAsia PacificUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

One, Donald Trump, received toady genuflection and a large, golden … thing (actually the Club World Cup trophy). The other, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, occasioned to bask in the proximity to real power, was affectionately referred to as “The king of soccer, I guess, in a certain way” by Trump.Theirs may be a marriage of convenience, but it seems to be a very happy one.At the event, Infantino made unsourced claims of an economic impact of $40bn and the creation of 200,000 jobs, all delivered by the 2025 ClubWorld Cupand the subsequent World Cup proper. Trump demonstratively signed a piece of paper that made the World Cup taskforce official.David Squires on … Mr Infantino’s trip to Washington and meeting with Donald TrumpRead moreThe whole thing felt little more than symbolic. Such a taskforce doesn’t require a presidential decree, for a start. But also because Infantino knows full well, as did everyone else in the room, that the president is unlikely to rouse himself for a cause he seems to barely understand.“Can the US win?” Trump asked at one point, interrupting Infantino, who ignored the question.“First time it’s ever been in this part of the world,” proclaimed Trump, apparently referring to the World Cup. Never mind that three men’s World Cups have already been staged in North America – in Mexico in 1970 and 1986, and in 1994 in the United States.Infantino proceeded to theatrically show Trump the newFifaClub World Cup trophy, a gaudy, golden behemoth that unlocks some rings orbiting its center with a key, which seemed to impress the president. Then the Swiss handed Trump an official match ball with the latter’s signature printed on it, tickling the last of the president’s erogenous zones that had not yet been activated.By the time he was done, Infantino had fully draped the tournament around one of his favorite strongmen. If it wasn’t already obvious, the 23rd edition of the Fifa World Cup will be remembered as The Donald Trump World Cup (trademark pending). Just as other mega-events have been hijacked for political ends, this World Cup will be leveraged for the glorification of a leader to a degree not seen since Benito Mussolini dominated the 1934 World Cup in Italy or the Videla regime’s stage crafting of the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. While a quarter of the matches will be hosted by Canada and Mexico – introducinga separate set of issuesowing to Trump’s erratic saber-rattling with his neighbors – the dominant narrative of the tournament has seemingly already been set.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump shakes hands with Gianni Infantino in the Oval Office.Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images“When we made this,” Trump said of the 2026 World Cup, “it was made during my first term, and it was so sad, because I said, ‘Can you imagine, I’m not going to be president? And that’s too bad.’ And what happened is they rigged the election, and I became president and so that was a good thing.” Presumably, he was referring to the 2020 election, which he lost with no evidence of rigging, and his subsequent re-election in 2024.It always seemed unlikely that the sport would be able to keep Trump from claiming soccer’s signature tournament as his own. But Infantino has seen to it that something like the opposite is accomplished instead. The Fifa president, the proud holder of the Russian Federation’s Order of Friendship medal, has written a type of playbook on cozying up to autocrats – or democratically elected heads of state with autocratic inclinations – and entering into mutually beneficial bargains with them. They are lent the World Cup for whatever stains they need to sportswash away and handed a place of prominence at the tournament’s key moments, and Infantino is given a pliant environment from which to source the profits that will keep his patronage machine humming.The 2026 Trade War World Cup encapsulates our new nativist world order | Aaron TimmsRead moreThat same week, Fifa also announced that the World Cup final will be interrupted by ahalf-time showfor the first time in its history. As well as casting its lot witha historically unpopularUS president, Fifa will also indulge in all the worst impulses of American sports.The 2026 edition of the world’s biggest sporting event, which somehow retains its prestige and credibility despite the best efforts of its guardians over the last century, will already count more teams and more games than any before it. The notion of expanding from 48 to 64 teams for the 2030 edition has already beensoft-launchedat the Fifa council.More, more, more, until every last inch and second and ounce of the World Cup has been commercialized and monetized. This is what the full Infantino-ing of Fifa looks like, mirroring the Trump-ification of the next World Cup co-hosts. Each grifting as hard as they possibly can.After the Oval Office event, Infantino madeanother appearancewith Trump, at a White House crypto summit. Infantino demonstrated his labor-intensive trophy again. And then he cut to the chase. “Fifa is very, very interested to develop a Fifa coin,” he told the roundtable of crypto people. “If there is anyone here who is interested to team up with Fifa, here we are.”Of course they are.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In essence, we have broken the climate by releasing gigatonnes of fossil-fuel carbon dioxide, and solar geoengineering proposes to “fix” it by breaking a very different part of the climate system.The fix is more like taking aspirin for cancer, treating symptoms but leaving the underlying malignancy to keep growing. It poses arguably unsurmountable governance issues in our turbulent modern political environment. And if we become reliant on solar geoengineering, the world will be left subject to a catastrophictermination shockif the intervention is ever halted – any time during the next millennium or even longer.The Aria geoengineering programme is a dangerous distraction from the work that needs to be done to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissionsSince our 2021 commentary, the situation has grown far worse, with tens of millions of dollars pouring into the scheme, mostly from private philanthropy. Bill Gates was an early backer, and the tech and fintech industries have piled on since. But we never imagined that the UK government itself would be leading the charge into what is almost universally recognized as the most dangerous and destabilizing sort of research: field trials that risk developing dangerous technology and paving the way for deployment. That is precisely the emphasis as the UK’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria)prepares to hand over$58m for solar geoengineering research and development. Outdoor experimentation is such a controversial undertaking that even the Simons Foundation, which funds research in solar geoengineering, has shied away from making grants in this area.Aria, with an initial budget of £800m, arose from the fevered dreams ofDominic Cummingsat the height of theBoris Johnsoncrony capitalism years. After arocky start for the office, Cummings’s legacy lives on in the current Labour government, which seems to have lost track of what Aria is doing. Aria, a wannabe clone of the US Defense Advanced Projects Agency (Darpa), works in darkness. It is not subject to freedom of information requests. It gives a pot of money to each of its (often inexperienced) directors, to direct expenditure largely as they wish, with only minimal peer review. The director in charge of the solar geoengineeering project is Mark Symes, an electrochemist with no background in climate science.It is ironic that Aria is funding a project that is not only a waste of money but is actively harmful, at a time when the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is busily hunting for places to cut government expenditures. Surely this project should count as low-hanging fruit for Reeves’s sharp scissors.The Aria programmethesis documenton “cooling the Earth” makes for chilling reading. The project goes all-in on the supposed need for field trials, without making a case that such trials could answer any of the really important questions about what would happen with a sustained global-scale deployment. That the trials are described as “small scale” is little comfort, because even small-scale trials risk developing the technology somebody else (think Musk, Trump or Putin) might use for a large-scale deployment. (The Adam McKay filmDon’t Look Upadroitly satirisesthe existential threat of a geoengineering-happy Musk-like plutocrat).There is extreme danger in launching such field trials into an environment with neither national nor international governance in place. The only governance would be that imposed by Aria directors, who are accountable to basically nobody. Worse, Aria can fund projects outside the UK, which invites shopping for sites with poor environmental regulations and limited opportunities for public protest. Provision of government funding for crossing the Rubicon to outdoor experimentation will inevitably legitimise such programmes, opening the floodgates for yet more money to pour into developing geoengineering technology worldwide. And once the engineers involved realise, as they inevitably will, that “small scale” experiments do not answer any of the truly critical questions, there will be demand for ever-larger trials, putting us on a slippery slope to full-scale deployment.The Aria geoengineering programme is a dangerous distraction from the work that needs to be done to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. The net-zero goal is one that is enshrined in UK law, and one that the Labour government purports to uphold. The UK government should not encourage false solutions like solar geoengineering and the people of the UK should not stand for it.Aria is already evaluating proposals for its dangerous project. It is not too late to halt this juggernaut, but to do so will require vigorous pushback that starts right now.Raymond T Pierrehumbert FRS is professor of planetary physics at the University of Oxford.

But European allies, including the UK, are bound by an urgent shared purposeWed 12 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 07.28 EDTShareMoscow’s immense military mobilisation is clearly not aimed just at Ukraine. UnlessVladimir Putinaccepts a ceasefire with meaningful security guarantees there will be no end in sight to the war. If anything, we could see the extension of Russia’s aggression beyond Ukraine. The bleak reality is that Europe still faces an unprecedented threat and notwithstanding signs of progress for Ukraine at talks in Jeddah, we face it alone.Worse, we now have to confront it with the US working against us.Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump appear to share a plan: a Vichy-like regimein Ukraineand a European continent split into spheres of influence, which Russia, the US (and perhaps China)can colonise and prey upon. Most European publics sense this. A critical mass of European leaders gets it too. They are beginning to act.Their response is forming the basis for a different kind ofEuropefrom the one we have known for decades, the Europe that was built in peacetime. That Europe sealed peace internally (mainly through close-knit economic and monetary interdependency). Externally, its security was largely guaranteed by the US via Nato. Through the defence alliance, European countries acted as loyal transatlantic allies. They allowed Washington to reap significant gains from the treaty, starting with the US defence industry. Europeans also obediently followed Washington in its follies, such as the invasion of Iraq in 2003 to topple Saddam Hussein.All along, the EU could afford to be slow and cumbersome; there was no rush. It was wiser to painstakingly construct the “common European home”, gradually weaving together joint interests and believing that a common European identity would slowly emerge.War in Europe however, and the unreliability of the US as an ally means we have to accept that the post-1945 and the post-1989 Europes are gone.A new Europe is being born however; and it is easier to say what it is not than what it is. It is not the EU, or not the one we have long taken for granted. The 27-country union is simply not equipped to take decisions with the speed and level of ambition necessary to confront the dramatic, life-or-death, fast-changing geopolitical and security moment its citizens face. Moreover, the EU now includes Trojan horses such asHungary’s Viktor Orbánand thepopulist nationalist Robert Fico, prime minister of Slovakia, who are plainlyworking on behalf of Putin’s RussiaandTrump’s US.The US embrace of Russia is an existential threat to the EU. Germany must step up to save it | Catherine De VriesRead moreThis is why we have seen European leaders including Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer becoming the dominant voices, shifting into crisis mode, convening emergency summits in their respective capitals;invitation lists carefully curated. But Eurosceptics, including those in the Trump administration who are hoping this means that a dysfunctional EU has been sidelined and rendered irrelevant, are off the mark.The Europe that is being born is not entirely separate from the EU either. Brussels institutions, and especially the European Commission, the bloc’s executive body, are deeply involved in the construction of the new Europe. The landmarkrelaxation of eurozone fiscal rulesagreed last week to permit a massive increase in spendingto “rearm Europe”,the establishment of new financial instruments to support Europe’s defence, the completion of the EU single market, and the push for a much bigger common EU budget, better tailored to the strategic priorities facing the continent, will all ensure that the Brussels institutions are in the driver’s seat. No wonder that Trump studiously seeks to avoid engaging withUrsula von der Leyen. It’s precisely because the commission still matters.The new Europe is not Nato either. Not because Europeans have turned their backs on it. But the US has. The US currently has more than100,000 military personnel deployed in Europe, 10,000in Poland alone, with40 military basesacross the continent. We are likely to see a partial (or even total) withdrawal of US forces from eastern Europe, and perhaps beyond.And given that the Atlantic alliance relied on trust and the conviction, among allies and adversaries alike, thatarticle 5 of the Nato treaty(which says that an attack on one is an attack on all) was for real, the question today is whether Nato still exists. Over the last decade at least, there had been some doubt as to whether the US would have actually defended a small European country under attack. But the doubt was sufficient to act as deterrence. Today, is there any doubt at all that if a small (or large) European country were attacked,Trump wouldnotcome to the rescue?But the new Europe being born also can’t be simply characterised as “not Nato”. Nato members outside the EU are playing a key role. The UK, first and foremost, but also Norway, Canada and Turkey, all of which are expected to help provide security guarantees forUkraine. In different ways and with different political sensitivities and even interests, they all share the sense that a Putin-Trump convergence on Ukraine (and beyond) represents a threat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They share threat perceptions and the will to address them. After all, European countries, put together, are among the richest and most powerful in the world. The European Commission, led by von der Leyen, can, will and must play a key supporting role. Saving Ukraine is a necessary condition for securing Europe. Can they succeed? If they can muster a fraction of Winston Churchill’s strategic vision, VolodymyrZelenskyy’s courage and Barack Obama’s hope, then, yes, they can.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Absolutely,” the celebrity host responds. “We are thrilled by everything Trump is doing.”Such approval might not be out of place on polemical rightwing channels in the US, but these exchanges weren’t broadcast to American audiences. The show’s anchor is Olga Skabeyeva, one of Vladimir Putin’s most dependable propagandists. To hear the highest pitch of praise for Trump’s bullying of Ukraine you need to watch Russia’s state-controlled Channel One.This being aKremlin script, the enthusiasm was soon leavened with suspicion. For now the pressure on Kyiv is great, Skabeyeva continued, but what will the Americans want in return?It is a good question, although that doesn’t mean there is an answer. It is a mistake to project coherence on to the erratic moves of an overgrown toddler-tyrant. Illusory patterns might be traced in the chaos, the way faces can be found in drifting clouds if you stare hard enough. But Trump does have predictable tastes and grudges. He loves money and status. He hates obstacles to the acquisition of those things. He iswell disposed to Russia, seeing it as the kind of place where good deals can be done. He is hostile to the upkeep of Ukrainian independence, which he sees as a bad use of US treasure, wheedled out of Joe Biden (withering disdain) by the crafty Zelenskyy (deep dislike).These petty prejudices are strongly enough held to sway US foreign policy in a Kremlin-friendly direction without the additional requirement of a strategy. There is plenty for Putin to work with.When Russian and US delegationsmet in Saudi Arabialast month to discuss a resolution to the war in Ukraine, the most revealing feature of the conversation was the exclusion of any Ukrainians.Less discussed, but still significant, was the inclusion in Putin’s delegation ofKirill Dmitriev, an alumnus of Stanford University, McKinsey and Goldman Sachs, now head of theRussian state investment fund. His pitch was that US businesses have foregone billions of dollars in profits by quitting Russia. Sanctions against Moscow are presented as another way that Ukraine and its European accomplices are ripping off America. Shortly after the Saudi meeting, Dmitriev was formally appointed Putin’s “special representative for investment and economic partnership with overseas countries”, with a mandate covering deals with the US.The proposed model, unnamed but also unhidden, is partition. Washington gets access to Ukrainian mineral resources. Moscow gets a fat slice ofUkraine. Russia and America reset diplomatic relations and renew commercial ties without any of the old fuss around rule of law and human rights – an oligarch entente.There are many reasons to recoil from such a deal. It would be a cynical betrayal of Ukraine and a renunciation of the transatlantic alliance. It would reward a dictator’s rapacious territorial aggression. It would embolden him to violate the sovereignty of other neighbouring countries, whose western orientationRussiahas never stopped resenting since they escaped Soviet vassalage. It would license similar ambitions wherever authoritarian regimes fancy unilaterally redrawing disputed borders.But none of those objections move Trump. Not long ago they might have found a voice in the Republican party establishment. But the Maga personality cult appears to have deactivated the GOP’s capacity for foresight, erased its memory and dissolved its conscience.Instead of applying a corrective lens to Trump’s venal myopia, America’s former cold warriors add their own distorting filters to the White House’s pro-Russia tilt. One common rationalisation is to cast it as a tactical play in a great game with the ultimate goal of isolating and containing China. Advocates of this manoeuvre seem not to have considered the possibility that Beijing is the obvious beneficiary from sabotage of the international legal apparatus that Washington built. China will gladly fill any void left by America’s retreat into narcissistic commercial protectionism.Meanwhile, the evangelical Christian side of the US right finds inspiration in examples of reactionary dogmas of the Russian Orthodox church wired into laws of authoritarian repression. Putin has proscribed “LGBT extremism” and, late last year, “child-free propaganda” – anything that discourages women from fulfilling their patriotic duty to breed new citizens.This ideological affinity is cherished also by Russian nationalist commentators. They welcome the Trump regime as a powerful ally in global resistance to the effeminate moral degeneracy emanating from the continent they call “Gayrope”.Hostility toEurope, and the EU in particular, is where the various strands of a potential Maga-Putin front come together. The Russian and US presidents share a venomous resentment of the soft power that Brussels wields through the aggregation of many national markets into one trading bloc.From Trump’spoint of view, the EU is a wicked cartel, denying US farms and businesses their inalienable right to sell to millions of European consumers. For Putin, it is anenemy apparatus, part of the post-cold war western expansion that locked Russia out of its natural sphere of influence.For both men, the idea of pooling sovereignty among democratic nations for mutual economic advantage is incomprehensible. To negotiate as equals with the EU – a flimsy paper entity without any tank divisions to call its own – is absurd and abhorrent. Their answer to soft power is to confront it with the hard stuff, connive in its dismemberment and share the spoils.This is the subtext of negotiations to end the war that Putin started and that Trump wants to end without regard for justice. They are rehearsing a shared agenda through the proxy of partitioning Ukraine, exploring the scope of a partnership that has a deeper foundation than America’s former allies want to admit. It might not come to fruition. Trump is easily distracted, but also easily bought and Russia has put a predatory joint venture on the table. Europe is the prey.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

With one of the apartments reportedly “snapped up” for $24m though, I reckon it will be rich-list empty nesters – not growing families – who eventually move in.See how Australia’s first 3D-printed multi-storey house is being built: four bedrooms in five weeksRead moreI was reminded of my stroll by the Productivity Commission’srecent reporton how to fix declining productivity in the residential construction industry. The commission found “the number of dwellings completed per hour worked” by construction workershas fallen by a whopping 53%over the past 30 years.My first thought was: “Any wonder!” It takes a lot longer to knock up an apartment with four-and-a-half bathrooms than to build your average flat.When the Productivity Commission controlled for changes in the size and quality of new housing, the fall in building productivity was only 12%. Much better, but still lagging the 49% gain in labour productivity in the broader economy over the same period.The commission made a bunch of recommendations to improve matters, such as streamlining planning approvals, reducing barriers to innovative construction methods such as prefabrication and improving the lot of apprentices so they don’t quit before they qualify.Yet it failed to recommend the obvious: build more smaller homes and fewer big ones. That would surely produce “more outputs” with “fewer inputs” – and the outputs would be homes people live in, rather than extra bedrooms that are often empty.At the last census, more than1.2m Australian households had three or more bedroomsbeyond what was necessary for “typical sleeping arrangements”. A spare room for visitors plus a home office is generous; three or more spare rooms seems excessive.Myanalysisof census data since 2006 shows we’ve been building homes with more bedrooms even though, on average, there are fewer people to sleep in them because households are getting smaller.While we may not have built enough homes to keep pace with population growth, we have built enough bedrooms. Perhaps the new owners of those “outrageously spacious” luxury apartments I mentioned earlier will take in some lodgers to ease the housing crisis? Somehow, I doubt it.A block of 1990s flat was demolished to make room for their luxury project. It had more than three times as many homes as the building replacing it.You might think these disappearing flats are just a few drops lost from Australia’s big housing bucket.Yet we are constantly told that the root cause of our housing crisis is a lack of supply, so surely every home lost or gained matters. Besides, such “downsizing” is not an isolated phenomenon. I recently chanced across the excavation work for another multistorey residential development. In this instance, where 12 flats once stood, there will, in future, bejustsix – five “whole-floor” apartments and one double-storey penthouse.Nor is it only a Sydney thing. On my regular commute in Melbourne a few years ago, I watched a stylish block of about 20 modernist flats give way to a clutch of luxury apartments.The Productivity Commission does not question the size of the houses we build or whether it’s right that some projects result in fewer homes, rather than more. Perhaps it regards pronouncements on the size of homes as value judgments – a no-no for conventional economics.Private developers can reasonably object that they are not in the business of building affordable housing, or even adding to housing supply, but of making a profit. If wealthy people want to rattle about in huge homes, then developers will build them. Fair enough.Battle over density: in Sydney’s east, a rash of developments are housing fewer, richer peopleRead moreBut we should not pretend that market decisions are value-neutral if the end result is housingfewer, richer people.Amid all the calls for planning reform, one idea rarely gets a look in. A “no net loss” requirement would block developments that fail to maintain or increase the existing number of homes.Back in December, there was an intriguing development in Elizabeth Bay: the New South Wales Land and Environment Courtknocked backa proposal to replace 28 dwellings with 20. The commissioner noted “adverse social impact of reduced housing supply which meets community need”.I doubt that will be the end of the matter. But if we’re serious about tackling the housing crisis, then we need planning rules that support such court decisions – so projects that produce fewer homes, rather than more, do not go ahead.Peter Mares is the author ofNo Place Like Home: Repairing Australia’s Housing CrisisExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionCost of living crisisAustralian economyBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump haspaused future spendingon clean energy infrastructure and he’s cancelled decarbonisation targets. And the new European Commission hasloudly promisedto cut environmental “red tape”.If you only read the headlines, you might think we’re facing the same issue here in the UK. But overall, Labour has remained committed to its long-term climate goals.Someone close to No 10 has saidthe prime minister wants to allow a massive new North Sea fossil fuel development (but they know this would still need to pass a climate assessment). The government has invited Heathrow to apply to expand (knowing it will need to fulfil a myriad of conditions). There are reports that Labourcould move funds awayfrom carbon capture and storage (but that’s always been a speculative technology). Andthere were reportsthat GB Energy’s funding might be cut (but thatmight be nonsense, or it might just mean spending being moved around government). More concretely, it is moving fast towardssupporting a second runwayat Gatwick (knowing that planning conditions, and then long political and legal battles, could scupper the scheme).It appears that some in Labour are using good old gesture politics to roll the pitch for what they hope will be a genuine slowdown of the energy transition. But Keir Starmer andRachel Reevesthemselves appear to have a more prosaic – and reasonable – motivation: they’re waiting for their broader domestic growth strategy to bear fruit. In the meantime, these rather thin pro-fossil fuel policies give them a chance to say “look at how focused we are on increasing GDP” in front of the rightwing press and less strategically minded members of the parliamentary party.So Reeves veryconspicuously slashedthe £28bn annual green investment budget of the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, while in opposition. But at the autumn budget, rather less conspicuously, sheincreased his capital budgetmore than any other cabinet member’s.Even in the US,where things are undeniably bad, the picture is still complex. The US needs domestic energy production from any source available, and Joe Biden designed the Inflation Reduction Act, which allocates investment to clean energy security and climate change initiatives, so that Republican members of Congress wouldhave an interestin protecting some, though by no means all, of it.So there’s a lot of noise; but here’s the signal: last year, the world investedalmost twice as muchin clean energy as it did in fossil fuels. Downing Street has a long list of reasons not to buck that positive trend. First, it hasseen the numbers. Labour knows that anti-net zero feeling hasn’t contributed to its fall in the polls; but disappointment about unambitious environmental policies has.More importantly for Labour’s long-term strategy, turning away from net zero would hurt its drive for growth. Last month, Confederation of British Industry research, commissioned by theEnergy and Climate Intelligence Unit, told us that the net zero sectorgrew three times fasterthan the overall UK economy in 2024. In the same week, the Climate Change Committee dramatically revised its estimate for how much investment is necessary for the transition,cutting it by nearly halfthanks to its projection of cheaper electric vehicles and more widespread electrification in heating, transport and industry.In terms of climate strategy, this is crucial: we need it to be profitable to turn fossil fuels into stranded assets (investments that lose value before their expected end of life). And it works politically: it’s an unambiguous good news story for Reeves. She’s not going to sabotage it.Neither does the government want to turn its back on policies that are helping to shore up Labour’s union support. One well-placed union official is moderately upbeat: “Lots of the right levers have already been put in place,” they say, but more government investment will be needed, and government support must be tied to recipient businesses being better employers.And what the government really doesn’t want to do is cancel policies that will protect consumers.We’ve spent £140bnon wholesale gas in the past four years, a period that saw Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. That’sfar morethan the net cost to the UK of decarbonising over the much longer period of the next 25 years.As Ellie Mae O’Hagan of theclimate change thinktank E3Gput it to me: “The energy transition is unstoppable. The anti-net zero political pantomime we’re seeing right now doesn’t change the fundamental economics.”Of course, no one thinks the transition is yet going fast enough to prevent catastrophe. And it’snot happening equitably enoughto prevent global disorder. So whether or not the surface-level gestures continue, we need Labour to pull together and cooperate on energy policy.It has done it before. In 2008, New Labour’s climate reforms succeeded because (almost) the whole of the left was on board. It was theinnovative campaigningby progressives at Friends of the Earth – plus increasing economic nationalism in the global energy sector – that helped push opposition leader David Cameron into supporting the idea of a climate change bill in 2006. It was someone from Labour’s centrist flank – one David Miliband, then the environment secretary – who at a cabinet meeting demanded his party match the Tories’ policy and, indeed, go further than them. And two years later, it was his leftwing brother Ed Miliband who, as energy secretary, pushed throughreforms that were hailed –and attacked– as reversing Nigel Lawson’s laissez-faire restructuring of the sector in the 1980s.In December last year, the same energy secretary’s clean electricity plans were hailed – and attacked – as themost interventionist shift in energy policyin a generation. So there is every reason to believe Miliband is a politician who can get this done. But in 2025, as in 2008, geopolitics make his reforms an easier sell. And now, as then, he relies on his party’s support. Only this time, it is also doing it under cover of an anti-green pantomime.Richard Power Sayeed is a historian of modern Britain.

But new research from the Australia Institute shows that even a good job is no longer enough to afford to buy a home.The latesthousing price figuresout on Tuesday suggested that prices in Sydney and Melbourne over the past year have moderated, while in Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth the boom times continue.If the graph does not display, click hereFor many, though, regardless of what the figures say, the idea of being able to afford a house is so far beyond reality that they might as well envisage buying a place in a neighbourhood of hobbits.Too often the difficulty is rendered in abstract terms, but the Australia Institute (where I am the chief economist) can now reveal just how cruel things are – and have been for many years.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailWhen Hockey made the infamous comments in 2015he was rightly scorned. But it’s worth actually testing his claim, since, as a colleague pointed out, surely the cost of buying a house has gone up much faster than incomes.Of course, she was right – over the past decade the median house price has gone up by more than the average male full-time earnings in each state (except the Northern Territory, where the end of the investment mining boom had an abnormal impact):If the graph does not display, click hereSo what if someone with a “good job” had taken Hockey at his word?Jobs paying the male average full-time earnings are pretty damn good. At the momentthe average is$112,819 per year–more than the earnings of about 80% of taxpayers. So doing OK.Let us assume for the sake of being optimistic that in 2015, on hearing Hockey’s words, you were living in Sydney on the average male full-time earnings.Trade tariffs are the new normal – and that’s unlikely to be positive for Australia | Sally AuldRead moreBack then this was $88,624. Nice. But you still have to pay tax. After tax (and I am not including the Medicare levy) you have $67,886. Still good.So how much to save for a house? The standard line is 20%. But that is 20% saving for everything – holidays, special things. Also let’s be realistic – that’s a hard ask in the Sydney rental market. Let’s make it 15% but all of it is going towards a house deposit and for ease let’s deposit a new amount every six months.So, in June 2015 you deposit $5,091 and in December 2015 you deposit another $5,111 – because under this scenario every six months you also get a pay rise as full-time earnings go up.You are also earning interest and have made $73 interest on that first deposit.Congratulations: after one year you have saved $10,275 towards your deposit.But maybe don’t pop the champagne just yet.At the end of 2014, when you first started thinking about saving for a home, the median house price in Sydney was about $773,000, so a 20% deposit would be $154,600.A year later, I am sorry to tell you, house prices have jumped a bit. The median house price in Sydney in the last half of 2015 was $901,600. So now you need $180,320 for that deposit.Even though you have saved $10,275, you are now further away from your goal than you were when you started out.But surely things will improve?Alas no.By the end of 2024, a decade after starting, you have saved up $126,096. Not only are you still not at your original goal, you are $155,404 behind the $281,500 deposit you now need to buy a median-priced house in Sydney:If the graph does not display, click hereSo after a decade of saving you have gone from needing $154,600 to needing an extra $155,404.You just never catch up:If the graph does not display, click hereIt’s important to note that this was not always the case.If you began saving under the same situation in 1987, you would have reached your goal within nine years:If the graph does not display, click hereYes, things have changed – more women work now, so dual incomes are more common. But have you checked out childcare prices lately?Yes, this is Sydney, where things are extreme – but in no city except Darwin would you have saved enough for a deposit yet.If the graph does not display, click hereEach time you think you are getting close, the housing market takes off again.Clearly the market is broken. If someone on anincome better than 80% of Australians is unable to save for a median-priced house, then something is very, very wrong.The Reserve Bank should be looking at these numbers and wondering why it waited until February to act | Greg JerichoRead moreOur tax system has been working to reduce housing affordability since 1999, when John Howard and Peter Costello changedcapital gains taxso that it combined with negative gearing to incentivise investment.We also clearly need to change how we treat renters – lifetime leases (or at the very least minimum lengths) need to be in the policy mix.But what did Hockey have to say?Well, four months after making this claim, he left parliament and in his final speechhe told Australiansthat “negative gearing should be skewed towards new housing so that there is an incentive to add to the housing stock rather than an incentive to speculate on existing property”.A decade later, we are heading into an election where neither major party proposes such changes. Instead, we can only assume they are content with sentencing young Australians to saving forever for a deposit that they’ll never actually reach.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsHousingGrogonomicsAustralian economyCost of living crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

In this age of ‘build, baby, build’, are there enough protections?Wed 12 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 12.17 EDTShareThough Wanstead is a quiet east London suburb, located just on the edge of leafy Epping Forest, things haven’t been so peaceful for the residents of Harley Court. A two-storey extension, containing 12 new units, has been built on top of their block of flats. It’s a story that reveals one of the many challenges of our housing market. In the quest to hit housing targets there will be some disruption, but how much is too much for existing residents and communities?In the autumn of 2022, James moved into the pale-bricked postwar building. It was his first time living alone. He loved the open-plan living room and having a space to make his own. It was around this time his health began to falter and, in the new year, he was diagnosed with cancer. He increasingly spent more time at home recovering from chemotherapy treatments that left him fatigued.Soon after, construction work on the new floors began. His sister, Naomi, who moved in with him to help with his care, told me: “The noise felt the same way a dentist’s drill feels inside your head.” The windows stayed shut to minimise the sound – and the dust from construction. Naomi now wonders if they were right in deciding to stay, but at the time it felt like the best option. Her brother didn’t want to be uprooted, and being out of work and receiving personal independence payments, he wasn’t sure he would be able to secure another tenancy. “We were trying to look at new properties, but couldn’t quite move fast enough. And then his health deteriorated fast towards the end. We didn’t move, but those last months were very trying.” After his death, Naomi moved out of the flat.Back in 2020, the then Conservative housing minister, Robert Jenrick,introduced a policythat would make extensions such as the one at Harley Court easier to pass through council planning processes. Owners would have what is called “permitted development rights” in an effort to increase the number of homes and give a boost to the sluggish Covid economy.On the surface, these “piggyback homes” (a previous name for such developments) seem a simple solution to the “housing crisis”. The London borough of Redbridge, which covers Wanstead,forecasts a 16% growthin the population over the next 22 years and, according to national targets, is required to deliver 1,409 new homes a year. Last year, amere 224 homeswere built. In a bid to meet these goals, acouncil official wrotethat planning permission will only be refused “where the harm is significant and outweighs the benefit of providing additional housing”.But in practice, it comes at the cost of existing residents. In 2021, Blue Gower Ltd had bought the land on which Harley Court stands, and as freeholder gained the right to develop the lot. Those who owned the flats in the property, as leaseholders, had the opportunity to raise objections to the new additions as part of the planning process. Among other issues, they stated that it would affect their wellbeing, create noise pollution and harm the quality of the air. Redbridge said that such concerns would be passed on to the developer and conditions imposed to mitigate any risks. The borough green-lit the application. (Later, the council approved the building of an additional five homes on the site where the flat’s garages currently stand.) The developers made themselves available to residents to deal with issues as they occurred and limited noisy work to a couple of hours a day, but admitted that living with building work was never going to be an enjoyable experience.As things stand, Labour has no plans to remove permitted development rights. In fact, the government has set new housing targets, hopes to further cut planning regulations in an effort to meet them, and has threatened totake over local councilsif they don’t play ball. In the years to come, as authorities around the country work towards these goals, there will be more building, more disruption, more piggyback homes, more Harley Courts.Advocates for the policy will say this is a temporary disruption that will pay off in the long run and will help boroughs such as Redbridge achieve their housing goals, but numerical targets are only part of an answer: residents don’t just need homes, they need affordable homes. In 2024, theaverage price of a home in Redbridge was £495,000. Once additional taxes and fees are taken into account, that cost is roughly 11 times the average London salary. Developers are business people, not charity workers. They build units that will turn the highest profit – and have no incentive to sell units at a lower price than the going rate. It may seem counterintuitive, but building more housing doesn’t bring prices down. The flats in Wanstead are now on the market and they look lovely, and even come with solar panels and underfloor heating. But they are far from affordable – one ispriced at £585,000.Councils have a role here. While approving developments, they can negotiate conditions, such as the inclusion of affordable housing (homes sold at 80% of the market rate). Even if agreements are reached on newbuilds, council planning departments – which were among the hardest hit by austerity, withcuts of about 50%–are unlikely to be able to make sure they are honoured. In the case of Harley Court, the developers contributed what is known as asection 106 paymentto go towards the local community and infrastructure.This is not an issue of nimbys and yimbys – that’s a reductive dichotomy. What we have are communities that need affordable housing, residents who want to enjoy the homes they have in peace, and business people who want to make a profit. Councils should be the ones that adjudicate between these interests and find the best possible outcomes. The government, it seems, has other plans for them.Kirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsPlanning policyOpinionHousingLocal governmentCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

She stepped into her bedroom to retrieve something, tripped and fell, and that was that. My mother is 74 and hardy, so this sudden break took us by surprise. Once I got her home, leg in brace, we’d lost significant time, and my household was down to one functional human: me.This is the fourth natural disaster I’ve experienced in the last eight years. One-in-100-year floods (2017), unprecedented bushfires (2019), one-in-1,000-year floods (2022) and nowCyclone Alfred. Cyclones are a new threat.

It’s not too late for you to grow one too | Jessie ColeRead moreI live in a forest my parents planted.The house is submerged in trees. Usually, this is a good thing, all the joys of wilderness, but as the wind began to pick up, it was hard not to be frightened. While my mother was laid up in bed I went through the checklist of things to do: bring in the outside furniture, disconnect the pump and bring it to higher ground, flip our ancient trampolines, put buckets under our latest roof leak, fill water bottles and buckets in case of power outage.We tried to figure out which part of our house was safest to shelter in. The house is made up of separate rectangular modules that all run along an open central walkway. There is no “internal” room and all the forest-facing walls are made up of glass sliding doors. Our bathroom is sturdy but open to the elements. It only has three walls. We decided we would shelter in my mother’s bedroom if it came to that. It had a wall of glass, but it was the best we had.View image in fullscreenThe forest planted by Jessie Cole’s parents.Photograph: Jessie ColeAs I was rushing about trying to get things in order, I happened upon a baby bird, feathered, but not yet flying. It was startlingly beautiful. Tiny, but vibrantly green. I’d never seen the like. I captured it in one hand, put it in a box and called our local wildlife hotline. The woman I spoke to agreed to meet me at a designated handover spot. I jumped in the car and drove. We parked back to back, the wind whipping about us, and I got out to hand her the box.“I’d love to chat,” she said, taking the box, “but I better get back.”I nodded. The rain was beginning to spin around us.“Good luck!” I called out as she got back into her car, but the sound of my voice was lost in the wind.Back at home, I sat in my mother’s bedroom, discussing the plan. My mother has a huge cast iron bed, so we would shelter under that if things got dire. The sound of the wind was rising. In the distance we heard the crash of a tree falling. My daughter-in-law began messaging. She and my son have a 12-week-old baby and live in the next big suburban town.“We think you should come in,” she said. “We’re worried about the trees.”My mother was not keen on leaving. She was propped up in her bedroom, ready for anything. I went out and looked at our biggest gum. Forty-five metres at least. Right at the helm of our house, our beloved guardian. Wind gusts high above scattered leaves all around me. My daughter-in-law kept messaging. I could feel the panic of my son behind each word.“OK, we will come,” I relented.Hunkering down in the face of extremely slow to get here Cyclone Alfred | First Dog on the MoonRead moreMy ex-partner, the father of my sons, drove out in his van to pick up my mother and her four bulky mobility aids, and I did a last sweep of the house, bundled our old dog into my car and, once again, drove.At my son’s house, the waiting began. A strange kind of limbo. We arrived on the Thursday, but Alfred didn’t cross land until Saturday morning. The night of the crossing was wild and it was strange to be so far from the trees. Were they upturned in the night? It was easy to imagine. Giant tree carcasses like beached whales. Roof caved in, all the glass smashed. The next morning it was surprisingly still and, in a break in the rain, I drove home to check on the damage. Big trees down on the roads, but already cleared. There were three trees down at my homeplace and a huge amount of debris, but the forest still stood. Our house was untouched. Our guardian, that majestic gum, standing tall.View image in fullscreenA rose-crowned fruit dove.Photograph: Rafael Ben-Ari/Getty ImagesThe power had gone out days before. We’d already lost all the food in our fridge. With no power, we had no water, which made life tricky. The long wait for power restoration began. Longer, it seemed, than the wait for Alfred. We are resigned, we are weary. At home, I checked my landline. There was a message from the wildlife carers saying my baby bird was a rose-crowned fruit dove, increasingly rare. Its care had been prioritised. It would be reared to adulthood and released. I could feel my heartbeat in my chest. One tiny, wild life.Four natural disasters in eight years.

It’s a quiet, solemn and laconic show ranging from lyrical, captivating portraits of Versace-clad Black cowboys in the American south to a woman hugging rocks.The show begins with the least interesting work.Cristina de Middel, a former photojournalist and now president of Magnum, is nominated for the second time. Here, a slice of her vast exhibition Journey to the Center, staged in a spectacular 15th-century church during the Arles festival last year, is re-created. The installation tries to be dynamic – a bright orange wooden framework cuts through the middle of the space; photographs are placed next to blown-up versions of Mexican Lotería cards – but it can’t cover up the blandness of De Middel’s work.View image in fullscreenLa que se Fue from the series Journey to the Center by Cristina de Middel.Photograph: Cristina de MiddelJourney to the Center (the title cribbed from Jules Verne’s adventure novel) attempts to reframe journeys of migrants from Mexico to California as a heroic quest. Yet this is done through mostly unremarkable landscape images, sutured together in a narrative that’s unconvincing. De Middel experienced real danger while making the images along these routes – perils all migrants face – but that is edited out. Does heroism exclude hardship?In one image, a portrait of a young, unnamed migrant woman stands on the border on the beach in Tijuana, wearing a jumper with Donald Trump’s giant pouting face on it, preparing to enter a country with a “Remain in Mexico” policy. It reads too much like a joke at the migrant’s expense. In another conceit, De Middel depicts high-jump athletes training next to the Tortilla Wall, a particularly perilous crossing point from Baja California into San Diego. De Middel sets out to reinvent the story of Mexican migration into the US for western viewers in this series, but the stifling symbolism is too glib and glossy to achieve that.It does get better. Waiting in the next room are knockout works by American photographerRahim Fortune, a selection from his nominatedHardtackbook, reproduced as sumptuous black-and-white silver gelatin prints for the wall. Hardtack refers to the unleavened bread used as a survival food bybuffalo soldiersand later adapted by Black cowboys and ranchers. Fortune’sglorious documentary imagestake us between the topographies and people of rural communities in the southern states, where he grew up and where metaphors of survival and persistence abound.View image in fullscreenPraise Dancers, Edna, Texas, by Rahim Fortune.Whether depicting settler-era wooden homes, whose history speaks through their hurried architecture, or a new father tenderly holding his infant, Fortune’s photographs shimmer and scintillate. There is grace and humility in a portrait of three praise dancers in Edna, Texas, heads bowed and arms thrust out in spiritual abandon; and a pearlescent pageant queen who is all gossamer glow. In this tender portrait of Black life in the American south, the tattered facade of Sam’s BBQ, in Austin, confronts what lingers ominously in the American landscape, with its hand-painted sign reading: “We may have come on different ships but we’re in the same boat now.”View image in fullscreenSister Rock/Rock that Tries to Forget, from Automatic Rocks/Excavation by Tarrah Krajnak.The Peruvian-American artistTarrah Krajnakis the wild card this year, but brings the laughs. In one series, Krajnak playfully re-enacts images fromEdward Weston’s 1977 book of nudes. There’s a restaging of a 1942 image of model Charis Wilson reclining on a sofa, wearing a gas mask she’d been issued as a volunteer for the Aircraft Warning Service. Krajnak replicates the image, including the fern frond Weston used, but switches up the composition, creating a diptych so that her body is cut in two. It is a pithy deconstruction that shows up the coldness of Weston’s gaze on women’s bodies in his sculptural, fragmented figures.I wonder if Krajnak was also inspired by Weston’s challenge to “photograph a rock, have it look like a rock, but be more than a rock” in her series Automatic Rocks/Excavation in which she digs up stones from her garden, names them, cradles them for a time, then takes pictures of them. It’s bonkers, but irrepressibly fun.Lindokuhle Sobekwa, the final artist in the show, would be a worthy winner for the £30,000 prize (which is announced in May). Sobekwa’s gripping project,I Carry Her Photo With Me, is reimagined in a slideshow, with a gorgeous musical score by Nduduzo Makhathini, and a constellation of images scattered in fragments across the walls, in keeping with the rawness of the original spiral-bound scrapbook.View image in fullscreenA gripping project … from I Carry Her Photo With Me by Lindokuhle Sobekwa.It is a journey of shocking loss. When Sobekwa was seven, his sister Ziyanda (then 13) was chasing him when he was hit by a car and badly injured. Ziyanda then ran away and didn’t return home for nearly a decade. She was eventually found living in a hostel, but died soon after, aged 22. She would not allow Sobekwa to take her photograph, an absence that looms large.‘In South Africa, you hear of disappearance all the time’: one photographer’s search for his sister’s missing yearsRead moreIn lo-fi images, he combs the misty, dilapidated, disenfranchised landscapes of the South African township complex where he grew up, once the siteof a bloody taxi war. He sees glimpses of his late sister’s face in other young women he meets at the hostel. Slowly the sense of the family’s loss merges with the masses who have disappeared into the void of violence during (and since) apartheid. Diary entries are scribbled and urgent, the pencil pressed hard to the paper.The pain of Sobekwa’s grief is penetrating; in one image, he catches his shadow cast over her grave. His photographs are often hazy, evanescent light fading like memories, the camera trying to clutch and fix the image before it is gone for ever.The Deutsche Börse photography foundation prize 2025 is at the Photographers’ Gallery, London, until 15 JuneExplore more on these topicsDeutsche Börse photography prizeThe Photographers' GalleryPhotographyAwards and prizesArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We go behind the scenes of The Stimming Pool, the first ever feature film to be made by autistic directorsSaskia BaronWed 12 Mar 2025 12.18 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 12.20 EDTShareDo you know how many autistic people there are in the UK? The answer is an estimated 700,000. Yet until now, there has never been a single feature-length film directed by autistic people. Or at least not one that has secured a theatrical release in the UK and slots at festivals worldwide.The film is The Stimming Pool, an experimental feature shot over just 12 days that puts on screen the interests, passions and perspectives of its five young autistic creators. They worked alongside Steven Eastwood, professor of film practice at London’s Queen Mary University, funded initially by the Wellcome Trust. “We asked why autistic people are always required to explain or illustrate their experience,” says Eastwood. “What about just having neurodivergent authors behind the cameras,doingthe creativity?”White-coated scientists use arcane devices on humans, who start to mock them with mimeSuch an approach is in contrast to the Chris Packham-presented BBC two-parterInside Our Autistic Mindsfrom 2023, for which autistic people worked with TV producers to make short films that aimed to show their families how autism affected them. This wasn’t what Georgia Kumari Bradburn, one of the directors of The Stimming Pool, wanted to do: “It was never about us having a duty to explain who we are or what we are doing to other people. This is just the way we exist. It’s a different way of existing.”View image in fullscreenEye-tracking research … co-director Sam Chown Ahern.Photograph: Rachel MannsDespite its multiple directors, The Stimming Pool is not an anthology film with distinct chapters, but an intricate collaboration. Characters recur and narratives bleed into one another. We see the directors sitting around a table discussing how to weave their themes together. No one is identified directly and there are no captions or commentary. The audience is left to make its own interpretations.The Stimming Pool challenges some of the familiar tropes of documentaries and dramas about autism. One of its directors is Sam Chown Ahern, who featured in the 2018 Channel 4 documentaryAre You Autistic?Ahern is filmed in a waiting room. She spots a little girl, also waiting, and echoes her repetitive hand movements – the kind that autistic people call “stims”, or self-stimulatory behaviour. Ahern muses on the ambiguities of the language used in a questionnaire designed to diagnose autism, then we see her take part in eye-tracking research intended to analyse how autistic people perceive facial expressions.I suggested my actors imagine a cork being pulled out of a bottle – the moment it is in and the moment afterThe red dots and lines from the researcher’s screen leak into sequences that follow another autistic character, clearly exhausted by navigating the sensory overload and social demands of the world. Benjamin Brown, a lover of derelict buildings and dystopian movies, contributed surreal sequences shot in an abandoned factory in which white-coated scientists use arcane devices to measure human subjects. In a satirical twist, these subjects start to mock the scientists through mime.Robin Elliott-Knowles, meanwhile, brings his passion for history, schlock horror and anime to the mix. We meet him welcoming a friendly audience to his local community cinema in Hastings, introducing an apparently lost video nasty. It turns out to be scenes from an animated drama he has directed about a female Confederate-era soldier with a cat’s face fighting zombies in a swamp – all based on his own artwork.Speaking over coffee at the BFI Southbank in London, alongside his fellow directors, Elliott-Knowles is delighted to recall the shoot: “I directed the actress and the very nice guy who played the zombie. Interestingly, I always remembered to say ‘Action’ but never remembered to say ‘Cut’! To guide their movements, I suggested they imagine a cork being pulled out of a bottle – the moment it is in and the moment after. I think it worked. They were great actors.”View image in fullscreenSchlock horror and anime … Robin Elliott-Knowles’ soldier takes on the zombies.Photograph: Rachel MannsRecurring throughout the film is the Shapeshifter, a character created by another director, Georgia Bradburn. Played by Dre Spisto, a neurodivergent, non-binary performance artist, the Shapeshifter navigates busy streets, open-plan offices, crowded pubs and toilets while wearing noise-cancelling headphones. Once home and alone, Spisto performs what looks like an elaborately choreographed sequence of body movements across the floor and furniture, muttering repeated phrases.“The original idea for the Shapeshifter,” says Bradburn, “was someone who is constantly transforming in their body through stimming. They are transitioning from a public space to a private space – and when they get there, they can lift the burden of ‘masking’. They can just move in whatever way they want. That’s something I used to do.”It all adds up to a dense, elliptical film that rewards repeated viewing. Some reactions have been strong. “A couple of weeks ago,” says Chown Ahern, “we had a screening and a young woman came in and said, ‘I’m autistic and I’ve travelled here on the tube and I was already overwhelmed.’ It’s supposed to be intense in certain ways. That is the purpose of it – which is probably why it requires a second viewing.”Although neurotypical myself,I have a profoundly autistic brotherand take a keen interest in the condition’s portrayal. So I felt it was important to show The Stimming Pool to autistic people for their perspective. One, a friend who didn’t want to be named, complained bluntly: “It was pretentious wank with an autism flavour. Not my thing at all. I don’t really know what they were trying to do or convey. And I don’t like stuff where I need someone to explain the meaning to me. The art should do that.”The stimming sequences felt almost like interpretive danceBut Rosie King, another friend, was moved to tears. “Absolutely beautiful,” said King, whoseTed Talk on her experience of autismhas had 3.2m views. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a film truly capture what it’s like to be autistic like this before – the good and bad parts. My favourites were the stimming sequences though, especially the last one in the pool with the spinning camera. They felt almost like interpretive dance. It showed a real beauty in stimming that I’ve never seen in film before. I loved all the young people involved and the focus on their art. So often autism narratives wholly surround the condition’s limitations with only a passing glance at autistic joy. Seeing this group come together and create beautiful things really touched me.”Eastwood adds: “One thing we chatted about was this expectation with a film that you’ve got to make sense of it and solve the mystery. I think everyone in the group has a love of the avant garde: experimental films, art films.”View image in fullscreenRoaming and recurring … Dre Spisto as the Shapeshifter.Photograph: Rachel MannsBut the fact that the group could discuss sophisticated genre films in their meetings does flag up the absence of non-verbal or minimally verbal autistic people in the process. Figures suggest that one in three autistic people also has a learning disability, while 25-30% are minimally or non-verbal. Apart from a brief scene filmed at the Project Artworks studios in Hastings, where we see the non-verbal artistHeidi Nice, who has multiple disabilities, being helped to fingerpaint, The Stimming Pool only features autistic people who are adept at language and autonomous.Eastwood is aware that the film doesn’t include the significant proportion of the autism community who have more complex needs. “When this project first ran,” he says, “it was designed to include a range, including non-verbal people. The pandemic killed that because, for the best part of a year, we could only meet remotely. We planned to develop it as a London and Hastings project and do a lot of studio workshopping at Project Artworks, but that all went out the window. However, I don’t think this project should have to representallthe experiences of autism. But we recognise that everyone in the film, apart from Heidi, is verbal.”Bradburn sees the film as simply a starting point. “You cannot generalise autism for everyone,” he says. “It would be impossible to make a film that encapsulates the entire experience, because it is so varied.” Eastwood echoes these points: “We’re asking why films about autism have to carry the responsibility of answering all those questions. This is not a film about autism – it’s a film about autistic co-creation.”The Stimming Poolis screening throughout the UK from 28 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmNeurodiversityAutismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s as sensitive as it is out-thereRebecca NicholsonWed 12 Mar 2025 10.07 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 10.09 EDTShareRuby Franke turned her life into content for years, so there is a bleak irony in her content being repurposed now to reveal the extent of her crimes. As a vlogger, she and her husband, Kevin, made a living from YouTube, posting videos on the popular channel 8 Passengers, now defunct, about Mormon family life and parenting their six children in the picturesque city of Springville, Utah. But in 2023 Franke was arrested and charged with aggravated child abuse and sentenced to up to 30 years in prison. The astonishing three-part documentary Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke tells the story, from the beginning of the family’s internet fame in 2015 all the way to Franke’s imprisonment.It starts with the now infamous and distressing doorbell-camera footage of one of the Franke children, a 12-year-old boy – the documentary blurs the faces of the four youngest children and does not name them – who turns up on a neighbour’s porch, asking to be taken to the nearest police station. He is evidently injured and emaciated. Later, we see more from that day and witness the neighbour sobbing when he realises the state the child is in. The boy has escaped imprisonment from the house of a woman called Jodi Hildebrandt. It is the spark that lights the inferno.The first episode follows the rise of 8 Passengers, a channel that gave the illusion of a slice-of-life vlog, but was so considered and curated that the bulbs in the family home were all changed to ultra-bright, to emulate television studio lighting. The family members, including the children, were roped in to what quickly became a profitable enterprise. In a recent interview with this newspaper, theeldest daughter, Shari, raises key questions about consent and children’s lives being broadcast online. The second episode explores how the shiny facade of 8 Passengers began to crumble, as hints about the hardline treatment and punishment of the children, such as removing “bedroom privileges”, were broadcast to the concern and condemnation of viewers.View image in fullscreenShari Franke, the eldest child.Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/DisneyAt around the halfway point, it takes another turn, into truly jaw-dropping territory. The grim brutality behind a lifestyle-channel empire would be enough material for most documentaries, but this veers off into wild and even more horrifying corners. Ruby and Kevin meet Hildebrandt, a counsellor and relationship coach with a distinctly cult leader-esque air. The arrival of Hildebrandt, along with a rise in apocalyptic religious beliefs and a sense of impending doomsday, makes for a darkening narrative. There are demonic possessions and suggestions of a clandestine sexual affair. All this is happening while Ruby and Hildebrandt continue to broadcast tough, anti-woke parenting “advice” on YouTube and Instagram.The story has been widely reported, but a number of factors elevate this particular documentary above the true-crime pack. First, the film-makers have had access to thousands of hours of footage, which reveals the underbelly of the family vlogging in the first place. We see what happens before and after the edits have been made, exposing the flimsiness of the wholesome, money-making image. Second, it doesn’t rehash old territory but reveals new details, including footage of Hildebrandt, in the Franke house, claiming to be possessed by the devil. Third, it has been made with the participation of Ruby’s husband Kevin, and the two eldest children, Shari and Chad.‘The nice version of her was manufactured for YouTube’: my mum, the family vlogger who became a child abuserRead moreShari, who only ever refers to her mother as “Ruby”, is a mature and impressively steady presence. “I’ve come to understand evil in a way that most people don’t,” she says. Their reflections on, and interpretations of, the events leading up to their mother’s incarceration vary from shellshocked to staggeringly circumspect. One issue with true crime documentaries is the ease with which they can become exploitative but, given the family’s involvement and the fact that the identities of the younger children have been obscured, this feels like less of a concern here.Even in its most out-there moments, the film never loses sight of the fact that, ultimately, this is about child abuse and the collapse of a family unit under extreme religious beliefs. It is sober in its telling of the story, and leaves plenty of questions for viewers to consider. Why did Ruby and Hildebrandt do it? Neither has given much of an account of her role in the cruelty to the children, though both pleaded guilty to the charges. What is Kevin’s culpability? He doesn’t quite seem to know himself. More pressingly, how could this happen so publicly, in relatively plain sight, under the watchful eyes of the internet? To its credit, the documentary, while thorough, seems to admit that there are no easy answers.Devil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then we set up the gas pipe – and waited until the air was really still’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 12 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTShareDuring my student years I did very traditional black-and-white landscape photography. I spent time in the Himalayas, Patagonia and Tasmania and came back with pictures of grandeur – what is sometimes described as “the sublime”. But while studying art history, I suddenly realised all this had been done before. I was caught up in an aesthetic that had been current 150 years earlier.I put my work away in a drawer but I held back about 10 images that I loved, spread them out, and asked myself: “What is the commonality between these?” And it was that they all had a sense of space and were heading towards the abstract. Then I wondered if there was anywhere I could work with space, and use it as my subject.That led to me camping out for weeks at a time on Lake Eyre, a vast, mostly dry Australian salt pan. My approach to photographing that landscape evolved over the years as I became increasingly attuned to the place, and my perception of it changed. Eventually I experimented with introducing mirrors into the compositions. The series this image is taken from, Blaze, is more recent and continues that process of bringing an extra element into the environment. This time I brought fire.I was alone on the ice sheet in Greenland when I was told by satellite phone that a polar bear was coming for meThe Blaze series was created in the Menindee lakes system along the Darling-Baaka River in New South Wales. A series of dams were installed there in the 1960s and forests were flooded, so within a couple of years there were a lot of dead trees. Driving across one of the dams, I imagined one of those skeletal trees on fire. The image stayed with me until a few years ago, when theLa Niña weather cyclereached Australia, increasing rainfall and causing the continent’s ephemeral rivers to spring back to life.I headed back to Menindee and spoke to the local community about my idea, explaining that I envisaged the burning tree as a beacon drawing people’s attention to the way the river had been treated. It’s funny when you break through with an idea and it all starts falling into place.Fire is an integral part of the Australian landscape. I started this project just a couple of years after Sydney was blanketed by smoke for months on end as bushfires swept through the east coast, and fire is used in farming and is an important part of the landscape for Indigenous people as well.I spoke to a film pyrotechnics specialist, who came up with a simple system that allowed me to connect a few of the gas canisters generally used for barbecues to flexible gas lines called “slinkies”, which could be wired up the back of each tree, away from the wood and out of sight of the camera. These produced an outline of flames when we lit them, briefly turning the tree into a sort of fire sculpture. They’d only be lit for 15 or 20 seconds while I got the shot, and we also had bush fire aqua backpacks we could use to spray any stray embers. Even though these trees are dead, they’re still very important habitats. But the gas flames did no damage to them and the bugs and spiders that lived in them were unharmed.At the end of the project, I stripped everything away to see what the fire did by itself. I wanted to photograph it coming straight out of the water, and also reflected by it. To achieve that, my assistant Nick and I walked a couple of kilometres out to where the water was, towing all our equipment, and then perhaps another kilometre beyond that – it’s so flat, you have to go that far before the water is even a metre deep.The slinky was about 10cm under the water and we had to wait until the air was dead still – a rare occurrence – so the gas pooled above the water and created mini-explosions. As soon as we did the first test, we saw the flame taking on these organic shapes. I love that people look at the shapes and bring their own meanings to the images. To me, this one, Blaze 24, looks like a dragon.Blaze #24 is part of From the Roster atHamiltons Gallery, London, until 26 AprilMurray Fredericks’ CVView image in fullscreenBorn:Sydney, 1970.Trained:“Largely self-taught in conjunction with short courses on the techniques of exposing, film processing and printing.

A new book tells his storyJon SavageWed 12 Mar 2025 10.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 10.18 EDTShareIn the mid-70s, Alan Jones was performing a particularly exquisite balancing act. A habitué both of Vivienne Westwood’s London boutique Sex and the gay clubs, he was on the frontline of two seemingly opposed cultures: punk and disco. Each camp might have thought the other completely incomprehensible – tuneless noise or vacuous hedonism – but for him it was quite natural: as he says, “They blended together in my mind. It was all about going out and having a good time; the music was interchangeable. And once Vivienne began her fetish clothing lines, it fitted both arenas.”Nevertheless, there were pinch points. In April 1976, Jones DJed for the Sex Pistols when they played a Soho strip club, El Paradise. Arriving with his “new best friend” John Paul Getty III – fresh from his kidnapping in Italy – Jones decided on a disco set.When this “cleared the scruffy dancefloor”, he tried another tack – kitsch:Julie Andrews singing Thoroughly Modern Millie. When Johnny Rotten reached over and tore the record off the deck, Jones retaliated with the Tubes’ White Punks on Dope, played four times in succession. He was not asked back.View image in fullscreen‘The 1970s was one long party for me’ … Alan Jones, author of Discomania.Photograph: Courtesy of Alan JonesThese and other subcultural adventures are explored in Jones’s new large-format book, Discomania: Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them. It’s a thoroughgoing pictorial compendium of the disco aesthetic centred around disco movies: Jones has worked as a film critic since the late 70s. For those seeking an education in this fabulous but much maligned form, look no further: Jones interweaves discussions of disco labels, disco divas, disco books (including Andrew Holleran’s peerlessDancer from the Dance), disco clubs and disco producers, from Giorgio Moroder to Alec Costandinos and Boris Midney.Every night meant a different location, but usually the same crowd – friends who only existed in the smoke-filled haze under the kaleidoscopic light showAs well as the history of a much maligned but still highly relevant musical form, Jones reveals under-explored elements of the period’s gay lifestyle: out singers such as Chris Robison (who toured with theNew York Dolls), cheap flights to New York, the relationship between the Gay Liberation Front and disco drugs, and the London club merry-go-round: Bang on Monday, the Sombrero on Tuesday, Glades on Wednesday, Napoleon’s on Thursday, Adam’s on Friday and The Embassy on the weekend.Above all, Discomania is the story of a courageous, outrageous gay man who found himself at the centre of a fascinating moment in pop culture. It’s a fan’s book, and the enthusiasm is generous and contagious. As Jones writes, “The 1970s was one long party for me. It was an era of discovery, of becoming visible for the very first time, of devil-may-care pleasure-seeking and of the most memorable music moment of my life. The disco boom arrived on the club scene just as I did and the two of us fused together as one.”Jones moved from Portsmouth to London as a teenager in 1969. He quickly found work in retail: a stint in the Great Gear Trading Company was followed by a revelation when he found Westwood and Malcolm McLaren’s shop at 430 Kings Road, then called Let It Rock. “I first went there in late 1971; Let It Rock had only been open a few months. If you were a fashion victim, Kings Road was the place to be on a Saturday, and I would trawl all the shops endlessly.

As a fearless broadcaster of the shop’s designs, he was involved in memorable incidents such as his August 1975 arrest for wearing Westwood’s infamous cowboy T-shirt – featuring two half-naked cowboys with penises almost touching – in Piccadilly Circus, anda notorious June 1976 fashion shootfor Forum, the sex magazine, which included the Sex Pistols’ Steve Jones, Danielle Lewis, Chrissie Hynde, Jordan and Westwood. Jones wore a T-shirt which proclaimed PERV in chicken bones.At the same time, Jones was working in the Portobello Hotel, which he calls “a mega-celebrity watering hole: I partied with everyone from Abba and David Bowie to Queen and Jack Nicholson.” He also met the science fiction author Harlan Ellison, who encouraged him on his long career as a cult and mainstream film reviewer. “I did a lot of night shifts,” Jones remembers, “and seemingly needed no sleep – I juggled it with Sex and pulled in two salaries. I was never home. I was either working, clubbing or out on either scene.”Glam, gospel and glorious grooves: Patti LaBelle’s 20 best songs – ranked!Read moreBeyond the early stirrings of punk, Jones’s big revelation was hearingLove’s Theme by Love Unlimited Orchestraon a visit to Los Angeles in late 1973. In his narrative, this coincides with a very early disco film, the blaxploitation gangster film The Mack, with an excellent soundtrack – released on Motown – by Willie Mack. Combined with the music that he heard in Earl’s Court gay clubs such as the Masquerade and the Catacombs, Jones had discovered his tribe and his lifelong obsession.“Disco is so important to me because it was emerging as a musical form just as I was surfacing into an exciting new world,” Jones writes, and Discomania follows the incredible, inexorable rise of the genre. It originated in underground New York gay, black and Latino clubs such as David Mancuso’s The Loft and Nicky Siano’s The Gallery. After Rolling Stone writer Vince Aletti caught the rising tide with an article headlined Discotheque Rock ’72: Paaaaarty!, the wave broke in 1974 and early 1975, as US No 1s by Love Unlimited Orchestra, MFSB, George McCrae, the Hues Corporation, Barry White and Labelle attracted mainstream music industry acknowledgement and defined the form as disco.View image in fullscreenJones wasn’t asked back … El Paradise’s the Sex Pistols flier.Photograph: Courtesy of Alan JonesAs Jones makes clear, LGBTQ+ people were “one of the minority forces” behind the early days of disco. By 1975 and 1976, the sound was finding its place in UK gay clubs, reflecting the purchasing power of the “pink pound” and providing the soundtrack to an era of greater gay exposure. Jones depicts a whirligig of pleasure: “Every night meant a different location, but usually the same crowd – friends who only existed as such in the smoke-filled haze under the kaleidoscopic light show.”High summer 1977 saw disco’s full flourishing, with euro and electronic disco combining in the era’s outstanding record,I Feel Love by Donna Summer. Its gay appeal is summed up by Jones as “the fantasy element of it all, the diva/goddess appeal of the artists. Swap Judy, Shirley and Liza in concert for Donna, Gloria and Grace in the more accessible nightclub and you can easily signal your devotion on the dancefloor. The pretty, singalong melodies, the opportunity to add your own chants and the communal show-off element – always a gay thing.”LGBTQ+ people were also involved in the early days of punk – with fans such as Berlin Bromley, who hung out with Siouxsie Sioux and Billy Idol, and venues like the lesbian club Louise. And yet they stayed away from disco and the associated gay clubs.“Punks never thought disco was relevant in the same way their preferred genre was,” Jones suggests. “Not that I ever got into any arguments over it or anything.” His habit of straddling the two cultures ended with the June 1977 Sex Pistols boat trip, which descended into fights and multiple arrests: “That was the turning point for me. It was getting really violent. Disco was more me, and I just moved straight into that.”The Sex Pistols’ jubilee boat trip – a classic accountRead moreFor Jones, the high point of his disco experience came in late 1977, when he attended the Star Wars preview – “followed by the celebrity afterparty, and then dancing all night to the Meco disco version of the soundtrack on the day my first features were published in Cinefantastique magazine. The confluence of all my lives merging was just so incredible and thrilling. I can remember every second of that night!”In 1978, disco became a full-blown cultural monolith in the US thanks to Saturday Night Fever. By this time the music had become completely codified but, at its hypnotic best, it offered a synthesis of hedonism, fantasy, otherworldliness (all those records about space), movement and sex (tracks like Joe Thomas’s Plato’s Retreat and Paul Jabara’s Pleasure Island, an ode to the gay village on New York’s Fire Island). It also, with the success of totally out LGTBQ+ performers such as Sylvester, brought a new visibility to gay people and gay culture.Jones makes a good case for the persistence of the genre after the 1979 crash – the year of theinfamous Disco Demolition Night, in which a crate of disco records was blown up on a baseball field in Illinois. It might have shed its terminology, but the form continued in the new wave crossover and what would be called hi-energy and Italo-disco, and then house in the late 80s. As Jones says, “If you can dance to it, it’s disco.” The book traces disco’s long tail right into the 21st century, with films such as Milk (the biopic of the gay politician from San Francisco whose rise paralleled that of disco and marked a high point of gay visibility), camp comedies like Poltergay and 2018’sStudio 54 documentary.Why does Jones think it endures? “Because it can sum up a time and place so quickly,” he says. “Look at all the current movies and commercials using Yes Sir, I Can Boogie, I Feel Love, Born to Be Alive. I always knew disco would endure, and 50 years on it shows no sign of disappearing, because for the most part the songs and singers were top quality.”Discomania: Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them is published byFab PressExplore more on these topicsMusicDiscoPunkLGBTQ+ rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The protagonist, Uma, sits idly with her neighbour Sheetal outside their adjoining homes inMumbai. To pass the time, the bored housewives pretend to be divorcing one another. Amid the role play, Uma turns to her confidant and says: “I’m tainted goods, I’m a divorcee. But it’s OK. I’ll wear this like a badge and go forth to the hills, form a manless nation and build a monolithic altar to the pussy.”Sister Midnight review – Mumbai-set comic horror finds the terror in arranged marriageRead moreThe statement captures what is so provocative about the film – it turns societal norms on their head and dares to ask: what if we did things differently? At its core, the film feels quite feminist. “That word comes up a lot,” says director Karan Kandhari. “I’m happy people can see the film like that, but I didn’t set out to make something with an agenda. I would say the film is actually punk rock because it questions things that don’t make sense. Just because something is tradition or old doesn’t mean it’s right.”The film, Kandhari’s debut feature, premiered at Cannes and was nominated for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer at this year’sBaftas.It is a surreal comedy about a young bride, Uma (Radhika Apte), who’s just had an arranged marriage with an ostensible stranger. Uma spends her first days in the big city with her shy and bewildered husband Gopal (Ashok Pathak) in a claustrophobic shack with paper-thin walls. Their relationship is awkward, abrasive and lacking intimacy. Uma – quirky, fiery, vulgar – struggles to settle into a domestic routine, and even takes a job as a night cleaner out of sheer boredom and frustration.“There is no manual for life, even though society wants us to pretend there is,” Kandhari says. “There is no manual to be an adult, a man, a woman, a partner, a wife, a husband, any of this. The story sort of spun out of a question: what happens the very next morning in a traditional marriage setup like this, in that very first moment a woman wakes up in an entirely new role, in an entirely new home, and the husband has left for work? What happens if she has no domestic bone in her body?”When I meet the British-Indian director on Zoom, he wears a black turtle neck and large glasses, his face framed by a thick mop of 70s-style shaggy hair. “I never make anything that has one direct message. I’m open to anyone interpreting it how they want,” he says. “In a lot of ways, this film is about loneliness, whether it’s what Uma is going through, or all the other misfits she encounters in the nocturnal world of the city. She’s like a vial of unstable plutonium. Hopefully, by the end of the film, she’s a little more refined.”As Uma’s psyche crumbles, she begins to develop certain animalistic urges. It starts with an inability to keep her food down and a sensitivity to sunlight, and ends with a thirst for blood. She hunts birds and goats, and disposes of their bodies in a drawer at home, before eventually moving on to somewhat larger prey.View image in fullscreenMarried strangers … Uma (Radhika Apte) and Gopal (Ashok Pathak) in Sister Midnight.Photograph: AltitudeIs all of this a metaphor for something? “It’s a meditation on inexperience, on being inherently strange and not really knowing how to handle it or be at peace with it,” says Kandhari. He likens it to being an artist and suffering from depression – something he has first-hand experience of. “Both these things can feed into each other, and they are both a blessing and a curse. Somebody once asked Leonard Cohen if he needed darkness to make his work. He said no, that’s a very cliched way to look at it, because the work is essentially a victory over the suffering.”Kandhari, who was born in Kuwait and lives predominantly in London, says he’s always had an affinity with outsiders. “I’ve felt like one most of my life,” he says. “I moved around a lot, so I’m kind of from everywhere and nowhere. I naturally gravitate towards those characters. Uma is a misfit who becomes an accidental outlaw.”Kandhari says it was “amazing” to collaborate with Apte on bringing the character to life. “She had to de-intellectualise and root everything into the body. After a couple of days, she totally slipped into this way of working. She was just so committed and happy to go to the silliest places. I’m so proud of her performance.”Such playfulness throughout the film makes it hard to know where exactly to place it. It swerves from genre to genre, from slapstick comedy to zombie horror, gore, and even stop-motion animation. It has a distinctive visual style, with a framing and choreography that’s reminiscent of Wes Anderson movies. Was he an inspiration?“That keeps popping up, and it’s not a thing for me,” he says. “I think Anderson and I are probably ripping off the same influences, like Satyajit Ray and Scorsese.” Other film-makers who left an imprint include Buster Keaton and Robert Altman, who, Kandhari says, “was like a total rebel with the form of cinema – he would take all these genres that you knew and then dismantle them”. The consistent thread throughout all of Kandhari’s work is humour, he says, because “humour, to me, is the poetry of storytelling, it’s magic”.Another huge influence was music, and the film is soundtracked with a confluence of genres – from Bengali folk to American punk and blues. In place of what would be traditional Indian music, we get a cowboy ballad in a monastery of nuns; Motörhead plays as Uma races through a quintessential slum. These elements should not go together but they do. “There’s something magical that happens when you juxtapose this stuff,” says the director, who has previously made videos for bands including the Vaccines and Franz Ferdinand.Sister Midnight trailer – video“I’m not a musician, but music was my first love and is still the thing that feeds me more than anything. There are scenes in this film that come directly from lyrics. The whole second half of the film, when Uma and Gopal come together before being separated again, is inspired by the line in Joy Division’s Shadowplay: ‘To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you.’ There’s also a scene that comes from a line in Bob Dylan’s Drifter’s Escape, about lightning striking a courthouse.”And what of Mumbai, a city that just like Uma, runs on its own rhythm? “I went there around 20 years ago, when I was quite young, and was taken aback by this strange city with such a big personality,” Kandhari says. “That’s when Uma just appeared, and I couldn’t get her out of my head.”He adds: “There are great city films, like American Gigolo in LA or Taxi Driver in New York. In that sort of tradition, I hope we’ve captured Mumbai as its own character. It’s a city of contradictions. It’s the most populated place on earth in the day, but after midnight it’s an absolute ghost town. That really did inform how we showed night and day in the film. The contrast between Uma working the night shifts and walking these absolutely desolate streets which in the day are a complete circus.”So, really, he’s been thinking about Sister Midnight for two decades? “And it took 10 years to get the film made, which is nuts,” he says.“I guess if you’re trying to do something that’s a little different, that doesn’t spoon-feed an audience, it’ll scare off lots of financiers, which it did. I was very lucky that Film4 and the BFI were crazy enough to take a gamble. I guess there’s a lack of danger in some of the stuff that comes out in the mainstream these days. I’m all for strange, because art has to surprise you. You don’t want to constantly see what you’ve seen before. I just hope it doesn’t take another 10 years to make the next one.”Sister Midnight is in cinemas from 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmMumbaiBaftasinterviewsShareReuse this content"

How did it turn such a tedious sport into such gripping television?Jack SealeWed 12 Mar 2025 07.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 07.57 EDTShareTennis hasBreak Point. Rugby union hasSix Nations: Full Contact. Nascar has Full Speed. Golf hasFull Swing. Basketball has Starting 5. Cycling has Tour de France: Unchained. American football has both Quarterback and Receiver. Athletics has Sprint. What do all these documentaries have in common? They have all sprung up in the past five years or so, and are basically all the same show: if they are not full clones ofFormula 1: Drive to Survive, they are heavily inspired by it.Drive to Survive thus has a claim to be one of the most influential TV documentaries of the past decade, having pioneered a simple but effective format. Every 12 months since 2019, it has delivered a new season – last week it released the seventh – that recaps what happened in the previous year’s F1 championship, using behind-the-scenes access, race-day footage and retrospective interviews.Absurd as it may seem to say that this one-year time lag is the secret of Drive to Survive’s success – you could hardly make a documentary about races that haven’t taken place yet – it is the fundamental reason it works. Free from the distraction of hoping for a certain result, viewers who know how the story ends are keen to see it from new angles; for the participants, thoughts and actions that would have been precious secrets at the time can now be freely discussed. “It feels like access to a world that we shouldn’t be seeing,” says DTS executive producer Tom Hutchings. “It’s all the elements that you don’t get from watching live sport. Viewers get hooked on that very quickly.”View image in fullscreen‘They are still like you and me’ … Lewis Hamilton on the series.Photograph: NetflixIt helps that F1 is a sport that is more than just a game. Money and politics play a huge part in it, and the drivers are risking their lives. So there is plenty to talk about and F1 people tend to be confident, suave types, eager to crack wise and be fabulously indiscreet. “The show lives on character,” says Hutchings. “Fortunately, F1 is full of interesting people – ruthless competitors, decisive characters and a few egos.” In that way, Drive to Survive gets around what could be a pretty major problem with making TV about motor racing, which is that motor racing itself can be tedious. “[As well as F1 experts] it also has a loyal fanbase that isn’t made up of the core F1 fandom,” Hutchings says. “So many of our viewers watch Drive to Survive, but not the F1 races.”Attempts to replicate the global success of DTS have been mixed. While Unchained has vividly communicated how tense and brutal top-level road cycling is, and Full Swing arrived just as the sport of golf was ripped in two by a breakaway tour flush withSaudi cash, other series haven’t clicked. Break Point has struggled to visualise the intrigue within tennis, a solitary, attritional sport that doesn’t have players controversially switching teams or coaches giving rousing half-time team talks. Full Contact isn’t as good as some other shows at hiding how reliant it is on officially sanctioned access – you rarely get the feeling of peeking behind the curtain and being told something that the speaker is taking a risk by revealing.Formula 1: Drive to Survive, season seven trailer – videoAll the above series do, however, share another straightforward but crucial quality, which is that they look at the sport as a whole, rather than making the same mistake as the show that previously tried to kickstart a new era in sports documentaries. Prime Video’sAll or Nothing, itself inspired by the godfather of the genre, HBO’s Hard Knocks, focuses on a different football team each year, which is a problem if you’re not a fan of that team. Not favouring any particular competitor makes a sports documentary more agile: when the 2023 F1 season turned out to be a boring procession won comfortably by Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing, Drive to Survive switched to telling smaller stories about less famous drivers.One series that has made the one-team approach work isWelcome to Wrexham, the Disney+ documentary about the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney buying a decrepit non-league football club and attempting to revive it. Influenced by Netflix’s superbSunderland ’Til I Die, it plays on the effect of the team’s previous failures on the fragile working-class community surrounding the stadium. Whether it can keep its underdog charm as Wrexham rise through the league system is debatable – if it can, it will be because it keeps telling relatable stories.“At the end of the day, they are still like you and me,” says Hutchings of the F1 superstars – an improbable claim, but one that sums up the suspension of disbelief that makes Drive to Survive and its imitators so gripping. “We all make decisions every day – we all laugh and cry. If we can tell those human stories in a fun way, that seems to keep the audience happy.”Formula 1: Drive to Survive is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDocumentaryFactual TVFormula OneSport TVNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His first European solo exhibition charts this remarkable journeyWed 12 Mar 2025 07.02 EDTLast modified on Wed 12 Mar 2025 10.52 EDTShareWhat is home? What does it mean to belong? For Eritrea-born artist, activist and chef Ficre Ghebreyesus, who fled war in his homeland at the age of 16 and landed on US shores in 1981, these were vital questions that played out in his vibrant, often dreamlike canvases. “Painting was the miracle, the final act of defiance through which I exorcised the pain and reclaimed my sense of place, my moral compass, and my love for life,” the artist wrote in 2000, in his application for a masters in fine art at Yale School of Art.Ghebreyesus, who died suddenly of a heart attack aged 50 in 2012, left behind more than 800 paintings. These were barely exhibited in his lifetime but have garnered acclaim posthumously, presented at the2022 Venice Biennaleand in a handful of US shows. Now Ghebreyesus will have his first solo British exhibition atModern Artgallery in London, made up of 25 canvases from the 1990s to 2011, many of which have never been displayed publicly.From vertiginous paintings brimming with pattern and colour to cubist-inflected figurative depictions to abstract geometric patchworks that might denote landscapes, the selection conveys his immense range of styles, sources and subject matter. According to the Ethiopian-American painterJulie Mehretu, Ghebreyesus managed to mine and invent “a visual language for displacement, of insistence, of affirmation despite loss, loneliness, mourning and grieving”.View image in fullscreenAffirmation despite loss … Map/Quilt, 1999, Ficre Ghebreyesus.Photograph: © The Estate of Ficre Ghebreyesus. Courtesy Galerie Lelong and Modern ArtGhebreyesus was born to a well-respected family in the Eritrean capital Asmara in 1962, a year after the eruption of the 30-year war of independence from Ethiopia. Despite never living in the Horn of Africa country after his teens, his paintings draw on its rich convergence of influences: the Coptic Christian and Islamic iconography found in Asmara’s churches and mosques, prehistoric rock paintings, grand Italianate architecture from Eritrea’s colonial past and mural portraits of Marx, Lenin and Stalin painted during the brutal regime of Ethiopian dictatorMengistu Haile Mariam.Ghebreyesus’s paintings hold in tension the joy of home life with his parents and five siblings and the horror of soldiers invading their compound and tanks in the streets. In 1978, after his school was shuttered by troops and Ghebreyesus tried to sign up for the Eritrean resistance, his mother packed him off with his cousin to travel on foot across the border into Sudan, then to Italy, Germany, finally arriving in the United States in 1981.These experiences of upheaval and migration show up obliquely in his work. In a pastel work on paper from the 1990s, a luminous moon casts its glow over a barren mountainous scene with a lone tent and two figures huddled by a fire. Another work from the same period is an orange, purple and teal seascape of floating vessels, with what look like tropical flowers sprouting in their wake. Ghebreyesus’s widow, American poetElizabeth Alexander, says he described such scenes as “dreamscape spaces of memory, flights of fantasy, but grounded in memory”.Boats are a recurrent motif in his oeuvre along with gates, portals and angels. A painting from between 2002 and 2007 depicts sails camouflaged within a square patterning of blues and greens, recalling woven baskets, while another portrays two figures immersed in fluid within some kind of container, tenderly embracing or whispering. In Ghebreyesus’s work, boats have “a roundness, a human bodiness to them, that proper boats don’t have,” Alexander notes. “I think they represent passage from one space to the next, be it a country, be it a state of mind, be it a culture.”On arrival in the US, the artist gravitated to New York and then New Haven, Connecticut, juggling several restaurant jobs at a time, studying and becoming involved in activism for Eritrean liberation. He studied painting at theArtStudents’ League, a training ground for many abstract expressionists. In 1992 he and his two brothers opened the popular restaurant Caffe Adulis. It was there, while working as executive chef, that Ghebreyesus met Alexander, then a professor at the University of Chicago. They were engaged within a week and went on to have two children, Solomon and Simon.From this time on his palette shifted from darker to lighter hues. “That sense of re-creating a very family-oriented wonderland was a deep safety and landing for him that I think allowed other things to come out,” Alexander says. Ghebreyesus was, she says, “a very, very passionate, ardent father”; photos show the children as babies happily lolling on his canvases.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Galerie Lelong/Modern ArtOnly in 2008, after completing his MFA at Yale, where he won a painting prize, did Ghebreyesus stop cooking and devote himself to art full-time. He would spend many hours in the studio working simultaneously on several unstretched canvases of different sizes, always nourished by music: he lovedThelonious MonkandAli Farka Touré.Indeed, music fed into his paintings. It’s in Seated Musician II, painted around 2011, which gestures to cubism in its colourful geometric planes and fragmented depiction of the subject, whose disembodied, quizzical face floats above the rest of him as he plays the lyre-like k’rar.And music is undeniably present in the enormous colourful burlap painting Map/Quilt (1999), which evokes the bursting rhythms of an improvised jazz composition. Jostling forms in coral, teal, mauve and orange, dotted with glyphs and symbols, stretch feverishly across every inch of the picture plane, dazzling the eye.Ghebreyesus was reluctant to exhibit his work, driven by the desire simply to create, which seems somehow prescient in light of his untimely death. “He knew he had something to say and to share and to give,” says Alexander, whose 2015 biography of her husband,The Light of the World: A Memoirwas nominated for a Pulitzer prize. The artist’s forthcoming London show is something of “a going home” in view of the number of Eritreans living in the capital, she says. His paintings connect to the yearning and lament of exile but also to the joy of reunion and the vitality of diaspora. Above all, they exude an extraordinary, inextinguishable life force.Ficre Ghebreyesus is atModern Art, London, 14 March to 10 MayExplore more on these topicsArt and designPaintingExhibitionsEritreaAfricaArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So not only is he double s**g h**l-ing [sieg heil-ing] fascist, he’s an idiot but anyway.”Responding to Edebiri’s post on Wednesday, the owner of the original account said: “I clearly stated ‘reportedly’ because it was the latest information coming from credible Hollywood sources. And yes, I am a HUGE fan and supporter of Mr Musk. He has my loyalty for LIFE, and I don’t say that lightly.”The rumour was not run by any credible industry outlet.In a previous Instagram story post, Edebiri applauded comedian Bill Burr for his comments on NPR’s Fresh Air, calling Musk “evidently a Nazi,” and commenting on his hand gesture at Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I just refuse to believe it was an accidental two-time Sieg Heil.”Burr went on to call Musk an “idiot” with “dyed hair plugs and a laminated face” and someone “who makes a bad car and has an obsolete social media platform”. He continued by asking why liberals are “so afraid of this guy who can’t fight his way out of a wet paper bag?”Producer Jerry Bruckheimerconfirmed last yearthat a reboot of the series, which earned nearly $5bn globally, was being developed. He neither confirmed nor denied that Depp would star in it, saying: “It’s a reboot, but if it was up to me, he would be in it. I love him. He’s a good friend. He’s an amazing artist and he’s a unique look.”Edebiri voiced Envy in the Pixar sequel Inside Out 2; her new horror film, Opus, opens in the US this month. She is also set to write and star in Daniel Kaluuya’s Barney the dinosaur film. Edebiri is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, for whom she has frequently canvassed.Explore more on these topicsFilmElon MuskJohnny DeppnewsShareReuse this content"

Hackman, 95, was eventually found near the entrance to their home in Santa Fe, apparently after suffering a fall.Speaking onInstagram, Heming Willis, 46, said she hoped the tragic deaths of the couple and one of their dogs would prompt people to reflect on the “broader story”.“I do really believe that there is some learning,” she said. “Caregivers need care, too. And that they are vital, and that it is so important that we show up for them so that they can continue to show up for their person.”She continued: “I think that there’s this common misconception that caregivers, they got it figured out. They got it covered. They’re good. I don’t subscribe to that.”Willis, 69, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023, the year after he announced hisretirement due to aphasia. It is believed he is no longer verbal.His wife, as well as his daughters and ex-wife Demi Moore, have been praised for their candour discussing his condition, and their support of the former action star. Heming Willis’s memoir of caregiving, The Unexpected Journey, will be published in September.“Having resources and information readily available is imperative,” she has said of the book. “I know between my experience and other care partners that I have spoken to; our stories are unfortunately similar.”View image in fullscreenGene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa in 1989.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyQuestions have been raised by many about why Hackman and his wife did not appear to have a more robust support network in place.The circumstances of Hackman’s death have substantially affected the legacy of one of Hollywood’s most venerated stars, with his and Arakawa’s plight highlighting the obstacles faced by vulnerable elderly people and those who look after them.Explore more on these topicsGene HackmanBruce WillisCarersDementianewsShareReuse this content"

BothSydneyandMelbourne writers’ festivalshave seen board members resign over programming decisions, while Adelaide and Perth have fended off calls for the de-platforming of speakers on both sides of the Israel-Gaza conflict.Literary events are traditionally lauded for their “restraint, reason and tolerance in the face of opposing views” – but writers’ festivals arenow issuing safety tips and employing securityas they navigate “the frontier between social media’s echo chambers of outrage and the traditional public square’s conventions”, the University of Melbourne journalism academic Denis Muller observed inthe Conversationlast year, after theresignation of the Melbourne writers’ festival’s deputy chair, Leslie Reti.Safety signals and security guards: when did Australian writers’ festivals become so fraught?Read moreWhatever happened to civilised debate?“It is an incredibly polarised environment in the arts,” the chief executive ofSydneywriters’ festival, Brooke Webb, concedes, speaking to Guardian Australia on the eve of the launch of the 2025 festival’s program.“Audiences want different things. Some audiences want us to be very bold and courageous, others want … a safe space. But the reality is that what a writers’ festival should do is create an opportunity for writers from many different backgrounds and many diverse perspectives to come and talk about their lived experiences.”Webb declined to discuss the recentresignation of the Sydney writers’ festival chair, Kathy Shand, on the grounds that board deliberations remain confidential. At the time of her departure, Shand – also a board member of the Sydney Jewish Museum – issued a statement saying artistic freedom and independence were essential, but “freedom of expression cannot and should not be used as a justification to accept language and conversations that compromise the festival as a safe and inclusive space for all audiences”.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe Guardian has not been able to reach Shand for comment, but according to reports the dealbreaker was aperceived lack of diversity of views on the Israel-Gaza warheld by authors booked for the 2025 festival.Announced on Thursday, the 2025 Sydney writers’ festival program will be headlined by the British authorJeanette Winterson, who will celebrate the 40th anniversary of her novel Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit on opening night.View image in fullscreenUS author Rumaan Alam, author of Leave the World Behind and Entitlement.Photograph: Maria SpannSamantha Harvey, the winner of the 2024 Booker prize for her novel Orbital, is scheduled to appear, along with the bestselling writers Liane Moriarty, David Nicholls, Marian Keyes and Maggie O’Farrell.The British philosopher AC Grayling will discuss his new book, Discriminations, unpacking the ancient history of cancel culture.

Memory takes poetic licence and is “seated predominantly in the heart”, Williams tells us in his opening. This production shows us how poetic it can be but also how nightmarish and tormenting.Exquisitely directed by Jay Miller, the story of pained family love between narrator Tom Wingfield (Tom Varey), who aspires to be a poet, his emotionally fragile sister, Laura (Eva Morgan), who has a limp that is not visible here, and their domineering mother, Amanda (Sharon Small), is dimly lit but strikingly shorn of sentimentality.Memories light up like photographic flashes out of the darkness or appear like waking dreams. Characters stand momentarily frozen, scenes are accompanied by music, as Tom tells us memories so often are, and Josh Anio Grigg’s compositions are electronic, echoing, ambient and anxious.The characters are supremely rendered: you feel the sense of trapped life and necessary illusion in this household: Tom, forced to be the breadwinner in a dead-end warehouse job and living out his dreams at the movies; Amanda, stuck in a lost past of southern comforts, gentlemen callers and, it is hinted, plantation slavery; Laura, desperate in her quietness, obsessed with her glass collection and looking like a delicate butterfly in net and frills (the costumes by Lambdog1066 are gorgeously caught between reality and fantasy).View image in fullscreenBetween reality and fantasy … Tom Varey, Sharon Small and Eva Morgan in The Glass Menagerie.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThere is heat and violence from the lighting for the mother-son clashes and candlelight when Laura’s “gentleman caller” Jim O’Connor (Jad Sayegh) comes round for dinner. Morgan emanates such pained shyness that you feel Laura’s light-headed fear while Sayegh emanates his character’s carefree – and careless – nature. The scene of building intimacy between them is utterly beautiful and devastating.The space itself is a limbo between reality, memory and fantasy. Cécile Trémolières’ stage design simultaneously captures the inside and outside of the Wingfields’ home, and has realist edges that melt into expressionism: a wardrobe that seems like a visual metaphor for a Narnia-style fantasy and repressed desire (characters come in and out of the closet). There are diaphanous curtains and shabby chic furniture along with Laura’s glass menagerie, which twirls like a multi-tiered cake platter above her phonograph.An otherworldly beauty is mixed with grit and grime, such as the mound of sand amid the furniture, sprinkled with glitter and with flowers growing in it. It is vaguely industrial, too, gesturing to the warehouse in which Tom works.Sarah Readman’s lighting design is inspired, giving the production both its sense of sepia-tinted past and the nightmarish quality of a remembrance stewed with years of Tom’s regret for fleeing this stultifying home to find his freedom.As the last production in this venue before it is demolished and rebuilt at twice its size, this is a fine send-off: a beautiful, disturbing, slow explosion of a tragedy.At theYard theatre, London, until 10 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreTennessee WilliamsYard theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

And few actors are better equipped to mine the weird vulnerabilities, fixations and feelings of a platonic split like the cult comedy king Tim Robinson, co-creator and star of the Netflix sketch showI Think You Should Leave(ITYSL). Over three seasons, Robinson has built up a devotedin-the-know followingfor his situational comedy, generationally playing unrepentant characters with no impulse control or allegiance to social scripts, people whose untidy feelings derail otherwise normal situations into absurd tangles.The Rivals of Amziah King review – Matthew McConaughey returns with unwieldy misstepRead moreIn other words, not the type of people to take rejection well. With Robinson as the unfortunate half of a buddy dump, Friendship, writer-director Andrew DeYoung’s strange and hilarious debut feature, spins comedy gold out the straight male loneliness epidemic. Robinson goes for broke as Craig, a typical ITYSL character: pathetic, awkward, estranged from social rituals, an oddball at once sweet and a little creepy. A guy baffled by the ease of other men and desperate for their approval, whose face displays the big emotions – anger, love, jealousy – in amusingly bold, bright primary colors.Like many a Robinson creation, Craig lives an unremarkable life in the suburbs and works a white-collar corporate job – in “habit-forming” technology, one of many bits of idiosyncratic, highly quotable phrasing that has becomeits own love languageamong ITYSL fans. He has it all, in the view of a character satirizing the sadly limited horizons of many adult men: a loyal wife in cancer survivor Tami (Kate Mara, playing it straight), a reluctant companion in teenage son Steven (Jack Dylan Grazer), a job, a house, a car and the prospect of a new sick Marvel movie without spoilers.But Craig’s world is turned upside down, brightened and forever altered, by the introduction of new neighbor Austin Carmichael (Paul Rudd), a local weatherman who oozes a particular kind of sad sack cool. Austin smokes, fronts a band, plays hooky, has other friends. Craig is immediately enamored, which Robinson plays with an uncontainable childlike enthusiasm gloriously at odds with his aggressively inane bits (much talk of “the only brand of clothes that fit me just right”, etc). DeYoung stages their tumble into one-sided bromance with the unflinching seriousness of a psychological drama – Austin at first sincerely charmed then put off by Craig’s obsessiveness, Craig sincerely intent on winning Austin’s affections and tantalized by the possibility of emotional bonds between other men. That is, until Austin suggests they “take a step back”, sending a relatably stung and confused Craig – for all its silly and surreal flourishes, Friendship keeps a beating heart – into a desperate spiral of obsession.All with a healthy of absurdist comedy, of course, pulling unexpected guffaws out of small pockets of dialogue and big physical swings. The film drew consistently loud laughs at itsSXSWpremiere – it initially premiered at Toronto last fall, and will be wide-released by A24 in May – even as Craig’s insecurities and resentment devolve into a boundary-pushing level of cringe. DeYoung has said that he wrote the movie specifically for Robinson, which seems not only obvious but necessary – no one else could walk this fine a line between goofy and deranged, between endearing and unhinged. Rudd, meanwhile, strikes the right balance of comic exaggeration, straightforwardness and vulnerability for a man laughably pitiable in his own way. Like true frenemies, every interaction between them sparks.Still, not all of the bits land. By the final act, the film’s off-kilter proceedings, tangents and Robinson’s penchant for yelling wear thin. Even as a fan, I am honestly shocked that what basically amounts to a 97-minute ITYSL sketch stays actually funny throughout, though a good 15 or so minutes of that threaten overexposure to the brand. But DeYoung sticks the landing with a touch of sweet in Craig’s otherwise curdled view of the friend who left him – an experience few people, especially straight men, are talking enough about. From “I just need some space” to the low-key fade out, the friendship demise can be a brutal time, and this one finds just enough pain in its weird and wonderful pleasures.Friendship is screening at the SXSW film festival and will be released in US cinemas on 9 May with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsSXSW FilmFirst look reviewPaul RuddComedy filmsComedySXSWFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Both situate the seemingly wise-beyond-her years star in the reimagined past of 40 to 50 years ago.Fear Street, the RL Stine adaptation, had Sink sinking her teeth into a giddy homage to Friday the 13th. That came after Stranger Things – that popular mashup of John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg and John Hughes – put her on the map. Who could forget Sink’s most iconic (and viral) moment in Stranger Things, reviving Kate Bush’s 1985 hit Running Up That Hill with a needle drop that releases Sink’s character Max from demonic possession, while sentencing the actor to even more time spent in the era of neon fever dreams?Novocaine review – throwaway one-joke action comedy brings the painRead moreThe lilac hues and barren future landscapes from Bush’s music video for Running Up That Hill are among the recycled looks in O’Dessa, a mood board of a movie that cites Terry Gilliam’s Brazil and Alejandro Jodorowsky’s The Holy Mountain among its references, but in its final incarnation harkens back to cult faves such as Phantom of the Paradise and The Running Man. Writer and director Geremy Jasper, a former indie musician who scored a crowd pleaser with his hip-hop coming-of-age musicalPatti Cake$, conjures up a world where a dreary metropolis drenched in plasma colours is surrounded by scorched earth. The images can be intoxicating, but his narrative, following Sink’s Mad Max-like drifter, meanders along, as if awestruck by its own lo-fi visual design.Sink’s O’Dessa hails from the farmlands, her auburn hair complementing the rusty landscape. She comes from a long line of “ramblers”, nomadic musicians who believe their songs can change the world, which at present is ruled by a tyrannical gameshow host (The White Lotus’s Murray Bartlett).O’Dessa is special. She’s the so-called “seventh son” according to prophecy, inheriting a guitar from her late father with the etchings of a tree, its roots flowing with liquid that turns luminous at her touch. In one of the film’s early folk rock musical numbers that stop the narrative dead in its tracks, and take on the qualities of self-contained music videos, O’Dessa hollers out, “On these six strings, I’ll sing my destiny.”After her mother dies due to some undefined illness, O’Dessa lights out on the road, has her cherished guitar stolen by a carnivalesque travelling troupe and finds herself in Satylite City, a neon-lit industrial wasteland where the masses are kept in thrall to Bartlett’s grandstanding dictator with a man bun, Plutonovich. He hosts “The One”, an America’s Got Talent-like competition, which is where O’Dessa will inevitably be reunited with her guitar and stage a televised revolution.It takes a while to get to that telegraphed finale, as O’Dessa first fumbles around in a romance with Kelvin Harrison Jr’s Euri Dervish. He’s a tragic lounge performer, regularly draped in fineries, occupying the kind of seductive role that would typically go to a woman. The film’s casual gender ambiguity, where Sink’s character, costumed to look like David Bowie, is referred to as the “seventh son”, is noteworthy even if it doesn’t amount to more than just vibes.And those vibes aren’t enough to carry this dragged-out love affair, with O’Dessa and Euri occupying far too much time in bed, either caressing each other or crooning together, searching for chemistry that just isn’t there. Harrison (recently heard in Mufasa) and Sink are both wonderful actors who just aren’t in tune, what with him purring like a sexpot, and her rewiring the adorable teen romance energy from Stranger Things.Regina Hall is another supremely talented star completely at a loss in this environment. She plays the black-leather-clad Neon Dion, a ruthless local crime boss who preys on and traffics Euri. Hall, sporting electric brass knuckles and delivering villainous platitudes with a stilted archness, can’t even lean on her screwball comedic instincts for some fun, never mind the levels of camp all around her.Everyone’s stumbling along in a vaguely defined universe, which really only serves as a backdrop to catchy musical numbers that evolve from folk to pop rock. You might charitably forgive the clumsiness in the plotting were O’Dessa packaged simply as a visual album rather than a feature-length movie that long overstays its welcome. But for that to work, the music needs to be memorable. Instead, O’Dessa, in its aggressive pursuit to look and feel like a thing of the past, is doomed to be easily forgotten.O’Dessa is showing at theSXSWfilm festival and is available on 20 March on Hulu in the US and Disney+ elsewhereExplore more on these topicsSXSW FilmFirst look reviewMusicalsScience fiction and fantasy filmsHuluSXSWFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

German screenwriter Constantine Werner has adapted a story from fantasy authorGeorge RR Martinand the resulting dialogue lands like a series of sandbags on a concrete floor; director Paul WS Anderson handles the material with stolid determination.The setting is some postapocalyptic futureworld where humanity’s remnants gather in an urban hellhole, while outside in the “lost lands” chaos reigns. Anderson’s partner Milla Jovovich bring a persistent blandness to the part of Gray Alys, a witch who, by defying the theocratic tyranny, has come to symbolise a growing resistance; she is being menaced by hatchet-faced, crop-haired witchfinder Ash (Arly Jover).It is Alys’s vocational custom never to refuse a request accompanied by payment, and so when haughty young princess Melange (Amara Okereke) asks her for the power to shapeshift, Alys agrees, knowing that there is a shapeshifter in the “lost lands” whose powers she can steal. But Melange’s courtier-slash-lover Jerais (Simon Lööf) approaches her secretly and begs her not to confer this dangerous skill on Melange – and Alys accepts that request as well, though the question of how she is to reconcile these opposing missions does not lead to any very interesting tension. To guide her through the lost lands, Alys befriends a tough hunter called Boyce (Dave Bautista), and Bautista does at least give us a kind of quizzical bemusement in the role, which is no more or less preposterous than anything else.As they battle their way through the hostile landscape, Alys and Boyce become close, though one is keeping secrets from the other. The film’s pure pointlessness reaches its climax with a non-epic moment in which a train plunges off the edge of a cliff, and the audience is apparently being asked to gasp at how spectacular that is – a tough ask, given that it is, of course, effectively happening on a laptop.In the Lost Lands is in UK and Irish cinemas from 14 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsAction and adventure filmsFilm adaptationsGeorge RR MartinreviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s one of the connections between two pieces presented by the networkAerowaves. In Iterations, performance artist and magician Tom Cassani finds himself interrogated mid-show by his makeshift, goggle-eyed hand puppet (“Where’s it all going?”); while inW̶e̶l̶come, Compagnie Les Vagues’ ventriloquist trio hold poker faces as they greet us, name by name. It’s a clever, beguiling, lightly humorous and occasionally maddeningdouble billdevoted to manipulation. Both acts vocalise our predicted responses and directly comment on – even dismantle – their performances.Ambling on in a black boiler suit, Cassani has a coin trick to show us, again and again. It will be different each time, he says, “believe me” – although disbelief rises with each minute. Who hasn’t, after watching such a trick, been convinced they could catch out the magician if they could just watch again? No dice. Cassani toys with us, replaying his mystifying act with variations, even standing right among the audience.Iterations has a similar approach toShow Pony, in which German companyStill Hungrytake the razzmatazz out of circus tricks and also convey the repetitive toil that goes into learning an act. Cassani asks what makes the routine different when he does it with flashy music and a grandiose air, or if he were to perform it on the street instead of a stage, or in the manner of a contemporary dancer (cue loosened hips and knees to the floor).What if he tricked us while thinking about his grandfather? That iteration and a – tall? – tale about swallowing a coin are teasing suggestions of a more personal hour, but Cassani gives away little of himself as he explains the techniques of prestidigitation. After a leisurely start, the show takes hold in an intimate moment when he reveals the callus on his hand that results from, and now enables, a specific trick. A touch more autobiography would leaven these scholarly assessments of effect and method, and his inquiry into the balance of power between performer and audience.View image in fullscreenTongues will wag …W̶e̶l̶come by Compagnie Les Vagues.Photograph: M Vendassi and C TonnerreCassani certainly trains the eye forW̶e̶l̶come, an uncanny dance-theatre piece from France that majors in minuscule movement then climaxes with a thrumming tangle of itching and tickling. Choreographed and performed by Joachim Maudet with Sophie Lèbre and Pauline Bigot, it begins in freeze frame, their eyes wide. What unfolds is as much about how the trio sees us as how we see them; sometimes the perspective is ambiguous. “They are all so elegant,” purrs one, peering into the audience, yet they’re the ones in matching yellow polo necks. They dabble in mind-reading, anticipating our reactions like Cassani, in a piece that is intriguing yet similarly takes its own sweet time.In the first half ofW̶e̶l̶come, the bodies of these occasionally yodelling ventriloquists move almost as imperceptibly as their lips. The key movement here is in the tongue and diaphragm; the piece trains your attention on the internal rather than external and plays with that contrast on several levels. There’s an air of mock wildlife documentary as the trio act out delight in a creature’s cuteness and distaste in its bodily functions. But it’s pleasingly daffy, too, even as it conjures muddled scenarios of hostility and the search for safety. Those lips are eventually liberated and the trio’s tongues waggle to rampant percussion. They hazard a guess at befuddled critical reactions, concluding “there were interesting things along the way” rather than a grand adventure. It sounds like a deathbed reflection.Iterationstours Europe until 5 April.W̶e̶l̶cometours Europe until 17 May.Explore more on these topicsTheatreDanceMagicPerformance artCircusreviewsShareReuse this content"

With its deadpan drollery and rectilinear tableau scenes, Sister Midnight takes something from Wes Anderson and Jim Jarmusch and also – at its most alarming – something more from Polanski’s Repulsion.‘I’m all for strange’: Sister Midnight’s Karan Kandhari on his punk rock debut, two decades in the makingRead moreThe movie’s satirical theme is the horror of arranged marriage, or maybe the intimate horror of marriage full stop – the feeling of being trapped, of suddenly and mysteriously not knowing who or what your partner is, the delirious fear and hate that can boil up out of nowhere for your spouse and yourself. Radhika Apte plays Uma, a woman who has arrived in Mumbai to start life as a housewife after an arranged marriage, the groom having gone on ahead to where he has already established himself in what is to be their modest marital home. (Apte also played an arranged bride in Michael Winterbottom’s The Wedding Guest) The wedding itself has evidently already taken place, and her husband is Gopal (Ashok Pathak), an unprepossessing guy from her home village with whom she hasn’t really spoken since they were both children, and who now spends his leisure hours at home loafing around, not talking to his wife, watching TV and masturbating. “You used to be so sensitive!” complains Uma. “I was eight,” replies Gopal.Gopal has no idea how to talk to his bride and his fear of the wedding night indicates that he could be a virgin. As for Uma, when Gopal is away at work, she has no earthly idea how (or why) she is supposed to be a wife. Her grumpy next-door neighbour Sheetal (Chhaya Kadam) tries to teach her how to cook, but Uma is hardly a natural at this. She’s also terrible at the demeaning business of managing on a housekeeping allowance, like someone from the 1950s. And all alone, with nothing but her feelings of boredom and resentment and rage, Uma begins to lose it – she hears noises, she has hallucinations regarding birds and goats, which are represented in stop-motion animation. Or are they real? She takes a cleaning job for something to do, but that only provides a second, alternative location for her imminent nervous breakdown. What on earth is going on?I can imagine Sister Midnight as a first novel as well as a first movie, and though some of the stylistic tics and mannerisms are maybe a little too showy, this is an engaging, extrovert film which cleverly uses the Mumbai setting and gives us a sprightly setpiece on Juhu Beach. It’s a great comic turn from Apte who deserves to be better known.Sister Midnight is in UK and Irish cinemas from 14 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekComedy filmsHorror filmsIndiaMumbaiComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It starts during pregnancy: in September,a safety watchdog found conditions at nearly half of NHS maternity units to be inadequate. It continues after childbirth:last year, the UK’s maternal death rate reached a 20-year high; when babies are between six weeks and a year old, theleading cause of maternal deathis suicide. It carries on at work:in one survey, 52% of women said they experienced some form of discrimination while pregnant or on maternity leave.But reading Maternity Service,a slim new volume from BBC Today programme presenter Emma Barnett, you wouldn’t gather that anything was seriously amiss. At least, nothing a new mother armed with the right polo neck, stretchy trousers, hip playlist and a stiff beverage couldn’t gamely tackle.Off the back of her second maternity leave, Barnett has set out to document the strange period of dislocation this time away from work represents. Her aim is to give new mothers advice and companionship as they cycle between feedings and naps and the steady drip of body fluids. “We need to make it easier to talk honestly about what the process of parenting – and specifically this initial and intense probation period – actually feels like,” she writes. She is right about this, which is why it is all the more disappointing that Maternity Service is such a meagre offering.This book has the easy intimacy of a WhatsApp group fired off between nappy changesLet’s begin with the title: Barnett thinks maternity leave needs a rebranding. It’s not “leave” – it’s a tour of service, a commitment to collective duty, she writes. Is that quite right? Those 12 months of employment protection are regarded as a sacred resource in the UK but, in reality,benefits vary vastly by employer. I was surprised, when I moved here from the US, to discover how common it is for women to deplete their savings –or go into debt– in order to stay at home during the first year of their child’s life. “We couldn’t really afford it,” one friend told me, but, she said, it was what she felt she was supposed to do.Barnett writes with a chatty candour; this book has the easy intimacy of a WhatsApp group fired off between nappy changes. She’s looking to build rapport, confide, validate, and offer survival tips. The problem is her steely commitment to the status quo. Barnett notes that social expectations around maternity leave are out of sync with the realities – financial and otherwise. But she isn’t interested in what it might take to revise those expectations. And even as she acknowledges the prevalence of maternal rage, she depicts it as just one more thing to be managed. Reading Maternity Service, I was reminded of a line early in the 2023 bookMatrescence,when Lucy Jones describes her initial struggle to articulate the reality of her experience of early motherhood: “I acquiesced. I used the language I had been given: the official lexicon for talking about motherhood. I fell in line.”The pressure to fall in line is immense. But what would it take to make the experience of early motherhood a little less punitive? NHS maternity units could be better resourced. Laws protecting pregnant women and new mothers in the workplace could be strengthened. Childcare could be better subsidised. Fathers get just a passing mention in Maternity Service, but, critically, men could step up, noticing that the old models for bringing the next generation into the world need an overhaul.Barnett often interviews powerful women but, strangely, any substantive insights they might have about early motherhood are missing, save a brief reference to a conversation about motherhood’s impact on the brain with writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. “In the interview, we did the best we could to communicate from this far-off land,” Barnett writes, “popping our heads above the trench to try to explain the unexplainable.”Motherhood is gruelling and awesome. But is it “unexplainable” – or simply undervalued? Perhaps some new mothers will find succour in the brave cheer of this pointedly pink book. For me, reading Maternity Servicewas a bleak reminder of how far we all still have to go.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The late winter sky is like a watercolour: soft blue and grey clouds layer together, with a sweeping gradient of yellow verging from tobacco stain to pale lemon above the distant, bruise-coloured hills. At the viewpoint, I look out over Oslo and listen for a scream.View image in fullscreenThe Scream.Photograph: Halvor Bjørngård /Rena LiIn 1892,Edvard Munchtook a walk in this same parkas the sun was setting. Recording the experience in his diary, he wrote that he heard “a great and infinite scream through nature”. The experience became the basis of his most enduring painting.Nobody knows if the scream was real – there was a hospital nearby – or imagined. Today, all I hear are the delighted squeals of children playing on the hillside, amid joggers and walkers traversing the leaf-strewn footpaths of the park.As the National Portrait Gallery holdsa new exhibitionof Munch’s portraits, I’m in Oslo walking in the footsteps of the artist. Munch is inescapable: atClarion Hotel Oslo, where I’m staying, an Andy Warhol version of The Scream graces the lobby – the pop artist was a huge fan – and a photograph of Marina Abramović’s interpretation greets me at breakfast.From the viewpoint, as the sky falls in a blanket around me, the city’s prime Munch attraction is clearly visible. While the shapes of the islands and borders of the Oslofjord are recognisably the same as those in the background of The Scream, theMunch Museum– known as simply Munch – stands out amid thenew modern buildings on the Bjørvika waterfront. The top of its striking tower is tilted, so said the architects, to look like it’s bowing to the city of Oslo, the inspiration for many of Munch’s works. Inside it, my guide, Sid, takes me on a tour of the extensive collection.As well as The Scream, other highlights of the Munch Museum include a vast room showing sketches of the Aula paintings, considered his masterworks“Munch was unique in how he captured a shift in generations and perception,” Sid says. “He’s documenting humanity at a time when belief and institutions are collapsing.”I’m struck by how Munch’s work, much of it over 100 years old, is still relevant today: from his ability to paint the emotional landscape of his sitters with a particular focus on mental health, to his belief that there was no separation between humankind and nature.View image in fullscreenThe Edvard Munch museum.Photograph: Sergio Delle Vedove/AlamyIn the gallery, three different versions of The Scream are displayed in a dimly lit rotunda for 30 minutes at a time, to preserve their colours. One of them has water-damage in the bottom-left corner: this is one of the stolen Screams, taken by daring art thieves during a daylight robbery in 2004 and damaged during storage (it was returned in 2006). In theNational Museum, another version of The Scream is on display – he made eight in total – under the watchful eyes of two security guards. Another version of the painting was stolen from this gallery in 1994, when police attention was otherwise occupied by the Lillehammer Winter Olympics. That one was only absent for 12 weeks.Other highlights of the Munch Museum include a vast room showing sketches of theAulapaintings, a series of giant artworks Munch made for Oslo University’s ceremonial hall. They depict an abstract sun shattered into multicoloured rays, a nurturing mother on a rocky shoreline and a fisherman teaching a young boy, and are considered his masterworks. When the Nazis invaded Norway, these paintings were hidden in a mine. Munch’s work featured on theNazis’ degenerate art list– modernist and avant garde art was considered depraved; any deviation from the norm, any challenge to the status quo, was punished. After the war, these monumental works were restored to pride of place at theuniversity hall, which is open to the public one Saturday a month from February-May.View image in fullscreenRamme beach, close to Munch’s house.Photograph: Laura HallThe next day, I take a trip toRamme, where Munch painted two of these works. A 30-minute train ride and short taxi journey from Oslo, it’s a haven for Munch lovers. You canwalk around his houseand outdoor studio and along the beach. There’s something about the sound of the sea, the rocky shoreline of the Oslofjord and the apple trees that give a great sense of calm. For Munch, plagued by ill health and mental health issues all his life, that was the idea.I walk past apple trees to a rugged shoreline littered with mussel shells where interpretive boards show Munch's paintings set against viewsHe bought thewhite househere in 1910, which remarkably is rented out to holidaymakers in summer, and kept it until his death in 1944. Inside, the carefully restored bright yellow walls and white lace curtains served as backdrops for many of his portraits. I walk past the apple trees to a rugged shoreline littered with mussel shells where interpretive boards show his paintings set against the views.Back in Oslo, I take a walking tour of the livelyGrünerløkkaquarter. Munch’s family lived in several different buildings in the area, marked with plaques, and it’s in one of these that he set one of his most moving paintings, The Sick Child, inspired by his sister’s death from tuberculosis. All the colours of life are here: vintage shops and hipster cafes line up along the edge of a small central park, bright blue trams streak by and the city’s young and creative walk around, as punk-haired baristas make drinks atTim Wendelboe’scoffee shop. I feel I could walk past the subject of one of my favourite Munch paintings, Madonna, a raven-haired woman in a red beret.Before I leave, I pay my respects at his grave atOur Saviour’s cemetery. I wonder what he might have created were he alive today. According to walking tour guide Linda, his love of self-portraits would mean only one thing: “He would be a selfie king.”Laura travelled to Oslo as a guest ofVisitOSLOand stayed atClarion Hotel Oslo(doubles from £147).

I grew up on a family farm in Canowindra, a 40-minute drive away, which my family has owned for five generations. After going to university in Sydney I moved back to the central tablelands. I’m now a winemaker and the owner of Swinging Bridge winery.FoodView image in fullscreenLucetta Dining serves Italian food in an intimate setting.Photograph: Steve BrownWhen I moved to Orange in 1999, the odd cafe existed but there wasn’t a joint food and wine culture like there is today. Local wines barely sold, even in bottle shops here. That’s all changed. Now I think we’re the best combined food and wine region inNew South Wales.The Union Bankrestaurant is in a 1850s heritage schoolhouse. It’s the place to go right now and it’s open seven days. The octopus and beef tartare starters and the sirloin main are my go-to dishes.Lucetta Diningis an intimate 35-seater that’s always packed and serves Italian food, such as duck ragu pasta with king brown mushrooms.View image in fullscreenRowlee Wines Dining and Bar is known for its big share plates and lovely views.Photograph: Tom FergusonWe’re starting to have more and more world-class dining options in the vineyards too.Printhie Diningserves south coast oysters fresh from a saltwater tank.

At 1,395 metres above sea level, it’s the highest point around and is the source of the volcanic soil and unique climate that supports our vineyards. I ride my bike up (about 30 minutes) but you can walk or drive to the summit too.

Food stlyist: Ellie Mulligan.Felicity Cloake's masterclassIndian food and drinkHow to make onion bhajis – recipeThere’s a trick to getting bhajis just the right side of crunchy, as our in-house perfectionist demonstrates in nine simple stepsFelicity CloakeWed 12 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareIt’s one of the great tragedies of life that fried foods do not reheat well. Take your average supermarket bhaji: sadly stodgy and soggy, when it ought to be crisp, its continued popularity is a triumph of hope over experience. If you want to enjoy these beloved Indian snacks at their best, you’ll either need to go out to a restaurant … or make them yourself.Prep20 minCook8 minMakes82 medium onions1 small knob fresh ginger2 garlic cloves1-2 green finger chillies1 small bunch coriander2 fresh curry leaves(optional)1 tsp cumin seeds¼ tsp fennel seeds1 tbsp ghee, or butter60g gram flour30g rice flour¼ tsp salt½ tsp turmericJuice of ¼ lemonNeutral oil, for frying1 A note on the onionsStart by peeling, trimming and thinly slicing the onions into half-moons; a mandoline would be helpful here, but, if you have one, please use the guard! The pink onions common in India are sweeter than our own brown variety, so feel free to use red onions or a mixture of the two, if you prefer.2 Prep the aromatics …View image in fullscreenPeel a little skin off the ginger with a teaspoon to reveal the flesh, then finely grate – you need about two teaspoons’ worth, so remove more skin off the knob of ginger as necessary. Peel and finely chop the garlic, removing any green sprouts. Trim, seed and finely chop the chillies; use a milder variety, or even an eighth of a green pepper, if you prefer, or substitute chilli powder to taste.3 … and the herb leavesView image in fullscreenFinely chop the coriander and the curry leaves, if using – the latter are widely available in large supermarkets these days, as well as in specialist south Asian food shops. If you find yourself with more than you can use up in a couple of weeks, they freeze well; pick the leaves off the stems, then put them in a freezer bag and expel as much air as possible before sealing and freezing.4 Toast the spicesView image in fullscreenPut a small frying pan on a medium-high heat, toast the cumin and fennel seeds until fragrant, then tip into a mortar. Melt the ghee or butter in the same pan while you roughly crush the seeds (you could also put the seeds in a bowl and crush with the base of a mug or glass); there’s no need to pulverise them completely.5 Start the batterView image in fullscreenPut the gram (chickpea) and rice flours in a large bowl with the salt, turmeric and roughly ground spices (and chilli powder, if using), and whisk to combine.View image in fullscreenAdd the melted ghee and lemon juice, followed by just enough cold water to bring the mix to the consistency of double cream; you’ll probably need about six tablespoons of water in total, but add it only gradually.6 Finish the bhaji batterView image in fullscreenStir in the onions, ginger, garlic, chillies and herbs until well mixed and coated.Put the oil in a deep-fat fryer, or in a deep pan or wok to fill it by no more than a third, then heat it to 180C; if you don’t have a probe, test by dropping in a little bit of the batter – if it sizzles immediately, then floats, the oil is ready. But beware: if the oil is too cold, your bhajis will be greasy, and if too hot, they will burn.7 Shape the bhajisWhile the oil is heating, put a bowl of cold water and a plate lined with kitchen towel near the hob, and turn on the oven to low. Once the oil is up to temperature, wet your hands and shape tablespoon-sized amounts of the bhaji mix into balls.Drop these very carefully into the hot oil, being careful not to splash yourself or to overcrowd the pan, so work in batches.8 Fry the bhajisView image in fullscreenCook the bhajis for about four minutes in total, turning occasionally, until crisp and golden all over, then scoop out with a slotted spoon, drain briefly on the kitchen towel and put in the oven to keep warm while you cook the next batch, making sure the oil comes back up to temperature first.9 Serving suggestionsView image in fullscreenServe the bhajis as a savoury snack or starter with chutney or pickles. I especially like them with coriander chutney: whizz 100g fresh coriander with a small green chilli, a tablespoon of grated ginger, the juice of two limes and two tablespoons of neutral oil, until smooth. Add salt and sugar to taste, and maybe a splash of water to loosen, if necessary.Explore more on these topicsIndian food and drinkFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodVegetablesSnacksStarterfeaturesShareReuse this content"
