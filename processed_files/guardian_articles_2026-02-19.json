        "Content": "Extreme heat labEnduring the climate of the futureGraham Readfearnenters a simulation to investigate how heatwaves affect the human bodyFri 20 Feb 2026ShareURL copied to clipboardScroll to continueHeatwaves on the riseAround the world, global heating is already giving us more frequent\n            heatwaves, and when we get them they are lasting longer and bringing\n            more heat.As burning fossil fuels adds more and more heat to the planet,\n            climate scientists know these trends will get ever more deadly.According to the medical journal the Lancet, heat extremes caused an\n            estimated 546,000 deaths every year between 2012 and 2021 – a 63%\n            rise on rates seen in the 1990s.“That's the equivalent of a fully loaded jumbo jet full of people\n            going down once every seven hours throughout the year,” says Prof\n            Ollie Jay.“And the really important thing to keep in mind is that every heat\n            related death is preventable.”Jay is the director of the Heat and Health Research Centre at the\n            University of Sydney, the home of the Thermal Ergonomics Laboratory\n            – a chamber the size of a big bedroom where the temperature and\n            humidity can be tightly controlled.So what does extreme heat do to the body? What does it feel like to\n            take a walk in the kind of heat that will become all too frequent in\n            the very near future?Me and my 51-year-old body are here to find out. I'm going to go\n            into the climate room twice. The first time, it's going to be 43C\n            and 18% humidity – the sort of conditions we'll see a lot more of in\n            place like Sydney, Mexico City and São Paulo when global warming\n            gets to 2C. That might only be a couple of decades away.What heat does to your bodyAfter the first experiment, Jay explains to me what I just went\n            through.\"So whenever people think about hot weather, they always talk about\n            the temperature,\" he says.\"There's two issues with that. First of all, most people don't\n            realise that the temperature is measured in the shade.\"So if you're in direct solar radiation, the amount of heat stress\n            you're exposed to is much greater as it will stress your body out a\n            lot more.\"That explains the heat lamps. And, according to Jay, the other\n            important variable is the humidity.\"Humidity is the amount of water vapour that's in the air. And the\n            reason that's important is that the only way in which your body can\n            physiologically keep cool is that you produce sweat.\"But it's not production of sweat that cools you down. It's the\n            evaporation of sweat and it's the humidity in the air that prevents\n            that sweat from evaporating, even though the ambient temperature\n            might be the same.\"So when high humidity goes along with extreme temperatures, your\n            body can no longer cool itself down, and the heat becomes deadly.This is why in the next experiment I'm going to experience\n            conditions at the same temperature as the first experiment, but with\n            a much higher humidity of 36%.Professor Ollie JayEven though 36% relative humidity doesn't sound high, at 43C that\n            means a lot of moisture because warmer air can hold more water. When\n            it's this hot, sweating isn't going to help me stay cool very much.Another way to think about it is the \"feels like\" temperature that\n            weather forecasts sometimes tell us about. Under the conditions I am\n            experiencing, the \"feels like\" temperature is over 49C or 120F.An avoidable future?So the extreme heat forced my heart to work overtime, I lost weight, and while I wasn’t really conscious of it, my core temperature went up.If you were stuck in these conditions they could be deadly. My body had no way to compensate for the heat and cool itself down.But as Jay says, the impact of heatwaves isn't just about how deadly they are.\"It's also about the way in which heat affects people's ability to carry out their daily activities,\" he says.\"It's a real problem for people in the workplace, particularly if you can't extract yourself from those extreme heat conditions.Graham Readfearn sweats under red heat lamps that mimic the sun\"It impacts our ability to be productive and safe in the workplace as well.\"Extreme heat can have all sorts of effects – it has been linked to an increase in the risk of still births and low birth weight and it puts infants, the elderly and people with underlying problems such as heart or kidney disease at increased risk.“So there's all these different types of impacts that extreme heat can have on human health and wellbeing, but are not necessarily just in that mortality statistic,” Jay says.And we know that global heating is only going to make these sorts of heatwaves – and all of the direct risks to humans – more common.\"It is very plausible that those impacts are just going to escalate. In fact it's pretty much almost certain, unless we unless we figure out a way to mitigate climate change in a more effective way.”"

Its raging alt-rock is a more robust take on the lo-fi fuzz of her third album Bury Me at Makeout Creek, while UK listeners might detect a certain Britpoppy swing about its rhythm, and it ends with a guitar solo so jarringly distorted it sounds as if something is wrong with the stream. It was accompanied by a video that featured the singer as a headscarf-sporting rural mother, trying to protect her family from the attentions of the outside world with increasing violence: a milkman gets attacked, her daughter’s potential suitor is beaten bloody. It’s both funny and unsettling: there are references to Rapunzel,Grey Gardens, Grant Wood’s American Gothic and Shirley Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle – a litany of the wilfully isolated.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Nothing’s About to Happen to Me.The visuals set the tone for the rest of Nothing’s About to Happen to Me, an album on which you’re never far from its author expressing a longing to disappear; to be, as she puts it on Instead of Here, “where nobody can reach”. On opener In a Lake, she extols moving to the city from a small town, not in search of bright lights and excitement, but obscurity, a means of obliterating your own history: “Some days you just go the long way to stay off memory lane.” On I’ll Change for You, she hymns bars – “such magic places” – precisely because of their anonymity: “You can be with other people without having anyone at all.” And on Rules, she’ll “get a new haircut … be somebody else”. All this is set to beautifully crafted music that splits the difference between alt-rock, country-infused acoustic lamentation and grander ambition: the brilliance of Rules lies in the disparity between the hopelessness of its lyric and the thickly orchestrated, perky, early 70s easy listening backing.Mitski’s relationship with celebrity is fraught – enough that herWikipedia pagehas a section ominously headlined “views on her fanbase” – and was possibly not helped by her 2023 singleMy Love Mine All Mine, which was dreamily understated but sold 4m copies in the US and made the Top 10 everywhere from the UK to the UAE. In fact, the album’s yearning for anonymity and solitude seems to have less to do with fame than a failing relationship, its awkward silences and sense of desperation sketched in painful detail on Cats and If I Leave. That central theme also seems timely and relatable regardless of the state of your love life: over the past 12 months, who hasn’t been at least temporarily been gripped by the urge to cut yourself off completely, to disconnect from the unremitting barrage of horror that constitutes the news cycle?One thing the world isn’t suffering from in 2026 is a drought of self-examining millennial singer-songwriters, publicly picking at their neuroses to a backing that sits somewhere between pop and indie, rich with references to music of the late 60s and early 70s. But that scarcely seems to matter while Nothing’s About to Happen to Me is playing, simply becauseMitskiis better at this stuff than her peers: stronger with melodies, more skilled at creating atmospheres that seep out of the headphones and into your bones, possessed of a way with lyrics where affecting lines – “I’ve been trying to start trying to be like someone you’d still like / Maybe if I could, you already would” – are balanced out by a mordant humour that undercuts any accusations of navel-gazing narcissism.The 50 best albums of 2023, No 5 – Mitski: The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are WeRead moreDead Women is alternately horrifying and hilarious, its author picturing herself as a ghost, looking on equivocally as friends and former lovers rewrite the story of her life, entirely incorrectly, in heroic terms. That White Cat, meanwhile, spins an existential where-do-I belong crisis from the sight of said cat marking out its territory in her garden: “It’s supposed to be my house, but I guess, according to cats, now it’s his house.”The album’s 35 minutes are variously thought-provoking, wrenching and lol-inducing listening. There’s a lot of unhappiness here – Mitski has talked aboutEric Carmen’s disconsolate 1975 soft rock hit All By Myself as a touchstone – but what’s emerged from said unhappiness is strangely delightful and rewarding. If misery loves company, then Mitski’s company is worth keeping.Nothing’s About to Happen to Me is released on 27 February.This week Alexis listened toThe Scratch – Pullin’ Teeth (ft Kevin Rheault)Sounds awful in theory – Irish traditional music meets heavy rock – but works to bracing effect in reality, further bolstered by Kevin Rheault’s raw-throated rapping.Explore more on these topicsMitskiAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

I sell ’em, $2,000 worth, for about $1,200-$1,500 cash.” Another Black woman ranted about taxpayers’ responsibility to her seven children with seven men, and yet another melted down after her food stamps were rejected at a corn-dog counter.Visible watermarks stamped some videos as AI-generated – apparently, too faintly for the racist commentators and hustlers more than happy to believe the frenzy was real. “You got people treating it like a side hustle, selling the stamps, abusing the system,” the conservative commentator Amir Odom whinged. Fox Newsreported on the Snap deepfakesas if they were authentic, beforeissuing a correction. Newsmax anchor Rob Schmittclaimedpeople were using Snap “to get their nails done, to get their weaves and hair”. (Lost in the outrage was a basic fact: white Americansmake up37% of Snap’s 42 million beneficiaries.)‘Pretty revolutionary’: a Brooklyn exhibit interrogates white-dominated AI to make it more inclusiveRead moreThe fake videos are mere shards in the widening mosaic of digital blackface, a pattern that’s spiked in the past two years as generative AI video tools have become widely accessible. “There’s been a massive acceleration,” says Safiya Umoja Noble, a UCLA gender studies professor and author of Algorithms of Oppression, which focuses on digital biases against Black women in particular. “The digital blackface videos are really pulling from the same racist and sexist stereotypes and tropes that have been used for centuries.” The net effect is a patina of Blackness stripped of cultural obligation or stewardship – minstrelsy in a nutshell.Coined in a 2006 academic paper, the term digital blackface describes a form of Black cultural commodification repurposed for non-Black expression online. Examples run the gamut: posts in African American Vernacular English, the use of darker-skinned emojis, reaction memes featuring Beyoncé, Katt Williams and other exemplars of Black cool.“The early research that was done on digital blackface started with white gamers using bitmojis of a different race and changing their vernacular to represent themselves,” says Mia Moody, a Baylor University journalism professor whose forthcoming book, Blackface Memes, links the role of Black users in starting and spreading online trends to subsequent digital blackface. “That’s part of the cultural appropriation, gaining the cultural capital. Maybe you’re a nerdy white guy, but if you use this cool avatar of a Black guy with dreadlocks, people will give you respect. You’re interesting all of a sudden.”During memeology’s expansion into short-form video, Black expression has increasingly been divorced from authorship, context or consequence. Internet culture scholars say some non-white online creators use AI-generated avatars modeled on familiar Black faces – the beauty influencer, the culture podcaster, the man-on-the-street interviewer; they slip into feeds alongside real Black content creators. Large language models scour digital spaces that gained cachet from Black speech and humor, absorbing their tone and slang. Hume AI is one of many firms that offer synthetic voices for podcasts and audiobooks such as “Black woman with subtle Louisiana accent”, or “middle-aged African American man with a tone of hard-earned wisdom”. In most cases, creators whose speech is scraped from YouTube, podcasts and social media receive no compensation, much less even know their personalities shaped these models.The Snap reaction clips, however, were a notable escalation in the mainstreaming of digital blackface – less blending in, more weapons-grade stereotyping. Many of those videos were created with OpenAI’s text-to-video appSora. As Sora’s popularity surged in 2025, users exploited its hyperrealism tosully Martin Luther King Jr’s image, sparking ethical debate around “synthetic resurrection”. Deepfakes showed him shoplifting, wrestling Malcolm X, and swearing through his I Have a Dream speech. Conservative influencers swamped feeds with AI-generated embraces between King andCharlie Kirk, conflating their clashing legacies and cultural martyrdom. Bernice King, MLK’s daughter and the director of his Atlanta-based non-profit, criticized the slopaganda as “foolishness”.double quotation markIf you have an authoritarian regime in power, they can use your systems to facilitate propagandaSafiya Umoja NobleInevitably the Trump White House has gotten into the act. In January the official White House X account posted adoctored photoof Minnesota activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, darkened and weeping, in the wake of her arrest at a non-violent anti-ICE demonstration. Earlier this month an image portraying theObamas as apeswas circulated via Trump’s own Truth Social account.Blackface abides at the underbelly of American mass media even as it evolves at breakneck pace. Its roots trace to the minstrel revues of the early 19th century; white performers smeared grease paint made from charred corks on their faces and plastered on oversized white lips to caricature Black features, and performed exaggerated routines of Black laziness, buffoonery and hypersexuality. Thomas D Rice, a Manhattan playwright, shot to fame in the 1830s playing a loping trickster named Jim Crow – a name that quickly became shorthand for the forced racial segregation policies in the American south that endured until the 1964 Civil Rights Act.In their heyday, minstrel shows werethedominant form of American entertainment – reflected in newspaper cartoons and the enormously popular Amos ‘n’ Andy radio shows. After the civil war, Black performers were largely forced into adopting minstrel elements, at the expense of their personhood once more, just to gain any footing on stage. “The objectives were, first, to make money to help educate our younger ones, and second, to try to break down the ill feeling that existed toward the colored people,”explainedTom Fletcher, a vaudeville minstrel and actor for almost 70 years who died in 1954.Even as minstrelsy faded from the spotlight by the early 20th century, its toxic residue lingered in American culture – from the shuffling crows of Disney’s Dumbo, to Ted Danson’s infamous 1993 blackface roast of Whoopi Goldberg, to the annual parade of white Halloween revelers in racial masquerade. A decade ago, when the internet was still a black box of sorts, researchers such as Noble and MIT’sJoy Buolamwiniwere sounding the alarm about the inherent racial biases in the coding of algorithms related to medical treatment, loan applications, hiring decisions and facial recognition. Now it’s out in the open, smearing wider and deeper than any burnt cork routine ever could.Tech firms have made some effort to stem the tide of digital blackface. Bowing to public backlash, the King family and more prominent estates, OpenAI, Google and the AI image generator Midjourney disallowed deepfakes of King and other American icons. In January 2025, Meta deleted two of its own AI blackface characters – a retiree called Grandpa Brian and Liv, described as a “proud Black queer momma” and “truth-teller” – after allegations of their non-diverse development team fueled atempest of criticism. Instagram and TikTok and more have made some attempts to scrub viral digital blackface videos,to tepid results. Last summer, efforts to replicate Bigfoot Baddie – the AI avatar of a Black woman as a human-yeti hybrid in pink wigs, acrylic nails and hair bonnets, created by Google’s Veo AI – erupted into a full-blown social media craze, with some users even hustling how-to courses. The avatar is still on socials.Black in AI and the Distributed AI Research Institute (Dair) are among the handful of affinity groups that have pushed for diversity and community input in AI model-building to address programming bias. The AI Now Institute and Partnership on AI have highlighted the risks of AI systems learning from marginalized communities’ data and noted that tech companies could provide mechanisms such as data opt-outs to help limit harmful or exploitative uses. But widespread adoption has been glacial.“YouTube alone has something like 400 hours of content per minute being uploaded,” Noble says. “With AI generation, these tech firms cannot manage what’s coming through their systems. So they don’t. Or they do what’s absolutely imperative to the US government. But if you have an authoritarian regime in power, they can use your systems to facilitate propaganda.”Are AI-powered ‘virtual rappers’ just a strange new form of Blackface? | Akin OllaRead moreAlthough the precise impact of AI-generated digital blackface is difficult to quantify, its use by theTrump administrationhighlights its potential as a powerful tool of official disinformation. The Obama Truth Social entry revived a slur that has festered for years in darker online corners, and one that rhymes with Trump’s sustained efforts to denigrate the former first family. (Trump disclaimed direct responsibility and refused to apologize for that post, which was taken down.) Meanwhile, the White House’s doctored image of Armstrong, altered from an actual photo taken by the Department of Homeland Security and published on their official Twitter account, scanned as a psyop by a government working closely with tech firms to track activists and other perceived enemies of the state.Beyond laundering bigotry as news, digital blackface exposes Black users to a level of personalized abuse and harassment that harkens to a minstrelsy heyday when racists were fully empowered to express their bigotry unbidden. And then just as now, it seems there is little that can be done to curb the vitriol. “We are living in a United States with an open, no-holds-barred, anti-civil-rights, anti-immigrant, anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ, anti-poor-policy agenda,” Noble says. “Finding the material to support this position is just a matter of the state bending reality to fit its imperatives. And that’s easily done when every tech company lines up behind the White House.”Even so, Moody remains hopeful that the current fascination with digital blackface will soon be as outdated and uninviting as the analog variant. She has seen this play before, after all. “Right now people are just experimenting with AI technology and having a ball seeing what they can get away with,” she says. “Once we get beyond that, then we’re going to see less of it. They’ll move on to something else. Or they’ll be up for a job, and it’ll be embarrassing. Just look at the history.”"

But, he added, the plan would “finally turn the tables” on the numbers making the crossing.The initiative, known as “one in, one out”, means each small boat arrival can be forcibly returned toFrancein exchange for another person – who has not attempted the crossing – being brought to the UK legally.Only a few hundred people have been sent back to France since the returns began last September, with a similar number brought legally to the UK – fewer than the number who cross on one moderately busy day. On Thursday, dozens of asylum seekers were forcibly removed to France on Thursday morning, despite warnings that their lives would be in danger there from traffickers. Some told the Guardian they were in deep distress about their situation, with some crying and others saying they were suicidal.View image in fullscreenThe UK government has put up warning signs in Calais to try to prevent people crossing the Channel in small boats.The situation for arrivals who are detained in the UK in preparation for a forced return is well documented: asylum seekers themselves haveissued reports from behind barsandstaged a peaceful protest. Earlier this month nine UN experts publisheda 20-page letterto the UK and French governments raising concerns about potential breaches of international law, and called for the scheme to be scrapped.But the experiences of those sent back under the scheme have been largely invisible. The UKHome Officesays the question is a matter for France. The French interior ministry has not commented.The Guardian has tracked the cases of more than a dozen returnees, building a picture of what happens once they leave UK custody. In interviews conducted over several months, they highlight the consequences of a system that was never organised with their plight in mind: some have fled France for their own safety, while others have experienced violence at the hands of smugglers who have rapidly adapted to the new system.Others have gone missing. Despite the assertion that they will never be allowed to settle in the UK, all of them say they intend to return. “We know that if we come on a small boat the UK will try to send us back again to France,” said one Kurdish man, who suggested that instead, he would try to come by lorry, and work in the hidden economy without informing the Home Office. “Then we will then come forward, and claim asylum when this ‘one in, one out’ deal is finished.”But before they can think of taking that step, the barriers facing them are formidable.Back in France: ‘They are playing a game of football with us’Returnees have little confidence that they can expect a stable situation once they are returned. One man, from a former Soviet republic, said he believed he would end up dead if he was forcibly returned to his country, because he had challenged his government politically.“I am frightened of being sent to Germany where I have fingerprints and from there back to my home country,” he said. “I face 15 years in prison but they don’t have the resources to maintain the prisons so they just kill people instead. The Home Office breaks your hope. They are playing a game of football with us – we are the ball. They think we are stupid. France takes the money from the UK to take us back but then ‘Dublins’ us. It’s corruption and it’s big money. It’s a political game, not a people game.”The Dublin regulation, named after the city where it was established, says that asylum seekers in the EU can be sent to another country where they have previously been fingerprinted.One in One out: broken dinghyThe man, who filmed part of his journey in a dinghy (above), said he was so traumatised by everything that had happened to him that he collapsed recently and was taken to hospital, where he was diagnosed with PTSD.A Somali man who was one of the first to be returned to France said he was also struggling as he waited for a decision on “Dublin”. He too is in French state-provided accommodation. “Is their idea of humanitarian protection to send back people who have no shelter or protection to the very countries they fled from?” he asked. “This UK agreement will go down as a dark chapter in history because it has abandoned us completely. They are using us as an example. It’s painful and shameful. Nothing is going well for us.”Leaving France: ‘It is not safe for me there’A central fear of many returnees is that if they are “Dublined”, they will be forcibly returned to their home country and the risk of persecution.One man who was detained in Bulgaria on his journey to the UK covertly filmed conditions there on his phone. “Bulgaria was so bad. I never want to go back there,” he said.One in One out: Rough sleeping in ItalyOthers have left of their own volition because they faced threats in France itself. The Guardian is aware of at least four “one in, one out” people sleeping on the streets in Italy, two huddled together next to a fire they lit to keep warm in the city of Ravenna (above).One Afghan asylum seeker, who fled France soon after being returned because of threats from people-smugglers, said: “If we felt that France was a safe country for us we never would have paid smugglers to make a dangerous crossing to the UK.”Another man, from Iraq, left France after a few days. “Really it is not safe for me there because of the smugglers,” he said.“I have crossed the border to Italy and have moved around different cities. I have been sleeping in the street and sometimes I sleep on trains – in the evenings the police and ticket inspectors don’t check the trains too much. One evening I got on a train in Italy and woke up the next morning in Switzerland. We like trains, they have become our home.”While lone children should not be sent to France under “one in, one out”, that rule may not have been reliably applied. The Guardian tracked down one 17-year-old who slept on the street for 20 nights in France before claiming asylum in Italy, where he has been determined to be a child. He is now being cared for in an Italian children’s home and is attending school.“I told the Home Office that I am 17 and showed them my identity document with my date of birth on it,” he said. “But they said they did not believe me and that I was lying about my age. I’m very heartbroken with the UK because I told them the truth.” Although the Guardian showed the Home Office the teenager’s Italian documents confirming him to be a child, the Home Office insisted that its age assessment procedures were “robust”.One in One out: Smuggler shootingSmugglers’ violence: ‘They make us afraid’Others have returned to the area in northern France where smugglers operate, known as the Jungle. Asylum seekers say those who offer to take them across the Channel illegally have become increasingly violent, and during the hours of darkness gunshots can often be heard there. Many carry guns and one asylum seeker recorded a smuggler firing his gun into the air (above).An asylum seeker now in Sweden after fleeing France said two days before he travelled to the UK, one of the smugglers had picked up a huge piece of wood, lit it from an open fire, and branded his back with it.View image in fullscreenThe smugglers ‘are strict and scary’, said a 27-year-old from Iran, who had returned to the UK for a second time but is now back in France.Photograph: Julien Daniel/MYOP/The Guardian“The smugglers do these violent things to make us afraid of them. I am going to stay in Sweden until I have recovered from my injury … after that I will find a way to get back to the UK.”One Iranian man who returned to the UK for a second time is now back in France, in basic accommodation provided by the French government as he waits to see if he will be sent to Italy under the Dublin rules.He said he had returned to the UK for a second time because his family, who had paid the smugglers for his place on a dinghy, had received credible death threats from them. “The smugglers … threatened us with death and took our photos. They are strict and scary. I stay inside, I’m not brave enough to go outside.”He is given an allowance of a few euros a day by the French government and has taught himself to cook, making a small amount of money go as far as possible. He posts some of the food he cooks on Instagram to try to occupy his time while he is waiting for his fate to be determined.Another Iranian who has now crossed the border to Germany said: “I don’t think the UK government understands how much danger they are putting us in with the smugglers by sending us back to France. I was raped by the smugglers when I was in Turkey. They know the Home Officeseizes our phoneswhen we arrive in the UK. They say: ‘If you give the UK any information about us we will kill you.’ Nowhere is safe for us. There is nowhere to go. Germany is speeding up interviews and deportations. I know I will not be able to stay here.”View image in fullscreenOne Iranian returnee has learned to cook to save money, and posts pictures of his meals on Instagram.The smugglers adapt: ‘Now, they can find us and threaten us’Even as violence remains commonplace, the smugglers have adapted to the “one in, one out” system, some returnees said. One Iranian who is no longer in France said the Home Office had stirred up a “hornet’s nest”.“Before, people paid a smuggler to cross the Channel and never had to see the smugglers again,” he said. “Now we are back in France, the smugglers can find us and threaten us – sometimes they force us to work for them in the Jungle because they say we did not pay them to cross the Channel to the UK. Other times they try to make us cross the Channel again to break the ‘one in, one out’ deal.”He described smugglers jumping into dinghies leaving France for the UK to evade French police on the beaches. “They are put into detention in the UK but are happy to go back to France because that is where they are working,” he said.Because of “one in, one out”, smugglers were offering a new deal saying that anyone who was detained on arrival in the UK did not have to pay for their journey, he said. Sometimes returnees were offered a “free” second trip to the UK because the first trip ended with a return to France.The missing: ‘Do you have any news about my son?’While many returnees have deliberately gone under the radar, a smaller number are missing. Their friends and family say they have had no news from them, but believe they were threatened by smugglers after returning to France.The Guardian spoke to the distraught mother of one Kurdish returnee to France. “Do you have any news about my son?” she asked.“He told me the UK was the only country where he felt safe. When he reached the UK he told me there were 80 on his boat, 10 were detained and the rest taken to a hotel. He had issues with the smugglers because he jumped into a boat without paying. We are all so scared of the smugglers. While others he travelled with are now safe in the UK, he is missing. I believe that if he was alive he would have called me. As his mum I just have a feeling that something has happened to him.”Another man, a Somali, was in touch with the Guardian at the beginning of January by email, soon after his forcible return to France.“I have not applied for asylum in France because France will send me to Germany and Germany will send me to Somalia,” he said. “I am a victim and I am at the deepest point of despair.”The UK authorities had determined with “positive conclusive grounds” that he was a victim of trafficking after being enslaved in his home country for 19 years. That was his last message.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeFranceMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

McLeod will pull pints for punters, there’s a dartboard where you can take aim at images of Thatcher or Trump, and visitors can explore his mixed-media artworks, spanning print, sculpture and sound, and swing by to catch drag acts, DJs and panel discussions.“I’ve even got a fruit machine that spits out chocolate coins,” he says. “Which is a comment on how these machines rinse working-class pockets for their own gain. Whereas with this work, everyone’s a winner.”View image in fullscreen‘I grew up in pubs – weddings, birthdays, funerals, disputes’ … Trackie McLeod.Photograph: @maxcgrangerUtopia takes place at Factory International’s Aviva Studios inManchester, and was commissioned by its Young Curators team. Touching on themes of nostalgia, class, identity and gentrification, it is also an ode to pubs and working men’s clubs as vital community hubs.“I grew up in places like this,” McLeod says. “All our family occasions were there – weddings, birthdays, funerals. It’s where all the disputes happened. Spaces that were cheap and cheerful but championed character and comfort. I’m trying to bring back a sense of togetherness that we’re lacking at the moment.”McLeod – whose nickname, Trackie, is based on his propensity, when younger, for bringing out a fresh tracksuit to put on when a party ran into day two – is having a very busy run. After two successful exhibitions, Fruit (2024) and Fruit II (2025), he now also has Soft Play running at the Charleston in Lewes until mid-April, where he has recreated an outdoor play park in the exhibition space. It explores “the awkward transition from childhood into teenager”, he says. “When you’re playing as an adult in these spaces – like drinking and vandalising – but are still really a kid.”View image in fullscreenExploring toxic masculinity … Nancy Boy 2024, by Trackie McLeod.Photograph: Courtesy the artistMcLeod struggled at school and didn’t connect with the art curriculum and its focus on “dead painters”, but one day an ex-student came in to give a talk. “He looked like me and sounded like me,” he recalls. “He spoke about Andy Warhol, Basquiat and Keith Haring. That was my introduction to art that wasn’t just necessarily painting. A real turning point.”He still failed art: he is dyslexic and struggled with the essays. But he “accidentally” ended up at college studying design, and then at university, trying to find his groove. “I’ve been chipping away at this for a long time,” he says. “It hasn’t been a linear path. There have been lots of ups and downs.”By the time of Fruit – which featured a whole car painted in a Burberry check, and a dovecote installed in the gallery – he felt he had found his stride; blending Scottish patter, popular culture, graphic design, 00s nostalgia and explorations of class. “It all came together,” he says.It also coincided with McLeod exploring his personal life in more depth. He had already been looking at toxic masculinity, and began to intersect it with his own experiences of growing up queer inGlasgow. In one piece – funny and absurd, but also quietly powerful and moving – he framed a long list of things that were deemed gay in school, including using gel pens, reading and crossing your legs. “It was only putting it out like that that you realise: fucking hell, that was ridiculous,” he says. “The things I would do to change myself to try and fit in at the time.”View image in fullscreen‘With this he found his stride’ … McLeod’s Burberry-clad car.Photograph: Courtesy the artist/ Matthew BarnesMcLeod has stayed in Glasgow, avoiding the frenzy of London, which he feels is “oversaturated”. He remains unrepresented by a gallery and happily part of a DIY scene. Despite his growing success, he has previously had to fund his own exhibitions to make them happen, sleeping on sofas at friends’ houses. For all the talk of representation, diversity and inclusion in the arts, that hasn’t been his experience as a working-class artist.“A lot of these galleries say they are championing underrepresented voices and most of the time they don’t,” he says. “They don’t practise what they preach. It’s just rich folk with limited life experience, pumping money into rich folk with limited life experience. The art world feeds on nepotism, privilege and the bank of mummy and daddy. There’s definitely a glass ceiling for working-class artists.”It’s been a slog for McLeod, but doing things on his own terms seems to be paying off and he now welcomes people to swing by Utopia for a pint and a chat. “I don’t have the answers, but I’m living proof that you can mark out your own path and it is possible,” he says. “But we need more working-class voices, more queer voices, and more POC voices, because it makes for more interesting art.”Trackie McLeod: Utopia is atAviva Studios, Manchester, 19-21 February. Soft Play is atCharleston, Lewes, until 12 April.Explore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsInstallationManchesterGlasgowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve hiked many a mile in the name of testing waterproof jackets. I reckon I’ve tried well over 100 differentraincoats, wearing them everywhere from the summit of Mount Kenya to my favourite local pathways in Cornwall and the Cotswolds. I’ve also just finished working on two UK walking guides for Lonely Planet – a great excuse to hit the trails in any weather.How I testedView image in fullscreenTesting the best waterproof jackets took our writer from the Cornish coast to the Lake District.Photograph: Mary Spender/The GuardianHandily for me, the rain over the past few months has been relentless, which means I had plenty of time to figure out which waterproofs would keep me dry over long wet days in the great outdoors. I took each jacket I’ve recommended on hikes around the country, everywhere from the top of Stickle Tarn in the Lake District to the sea-sprayed Cornish coast. The mild weather also gave me the chance to test another key feature of a good waterproof – breathability – on muddy trails and city streets alike.New jackets called in to test for this article were donated to theJulian Trust Night Shelterin Bristol.

There’s lots of great stuff here, and the design is pleasingly lightweight and comfortable to wear. It’s technical enough for adventures at altitude yet doesn’t feel like overkill if you’re walking the dog. The Torren’s recycled nylon shell is also highly waterproof without the use of damaging chemicals, something all outdoor clothing manufacturers should be working to achieve.Why we love itThe Torren is indeed highly waterproof and kept the rain off all day long when I was out in last October’s wet and windy Storm Ashley. Montane uses its own-brand Petrichor technology to waterproof this coat, but it seems to stand up when compared with Gore-Tex, plus it doesn’t use environmentally harmful Pfas.The Torren is ready for high-stakes days outdoors, thanks to a helmet-compatible hood, harness-compatible pockets and articulated arms, which give a good range of movement. However, it’s also simple enough to use for relaxed hiking days and, although it fits on the slim side, you can stick a thinner insulated jacket underneath. It’s hard to pick holes in the design, but if pushed, my niggle would be that, besides plain black, the only colours available are pastels.It’s a shame that …there are limited neutral colours available.Material:recycled nylonWaterproofing:Petrichor (20,000mm)Colours:threeSizes available:8-16MontaneTorrenfrom£259.95£259.95 at Outdoor Action£300 at MontaneWhat we loveGreat fit and performance; environmentally friendly materialWhat we don’t loveLimited colours; pricey if you want something casualBest budget waterproof jacket:Craghoppers Caldbeck IICraghoppersCaldbeck IIfrom£48£48 at Craghoppers£49.95 at Outdoor ActionWhat we loveWaterproof; recycled materials; relaxed longer fitWhat we don’t loveOnly some colourways have big reductionsFrom £48 at CraghoppersFrom £49.95 at Outdoor ActionThere’s no need to spend a fortune on a techie shell if all you want is a reliable waterproof for dog walks, school runs and weekend strolls. In that vein, the Craghoppers Caldbeck II is ideal: it’s a no-nonsense, longer-length jacket with a nicely fitted hood and a waterproof membrane to repel showers.Why we love itCraghoppers’ own AquaDry membrane proved its worth in tests, shrugging rain off the Caldbeck II while out and about. Note, though, that this performance may diminish over time, and it will need reproofing. Elsewhere, there’s a touch of stretch to the fabric, the fit is relaxed without feeling boxy, and there’s room for layering underneath on colder days. The main fabric and lining are made from recycled polyester, and the deep pockets are great for stashing your phone or warming your hands.At the time of writing this jacket’s RRP of £160 had been reduced to between £48 and £80, depending on the colour – but even at its full price, it remains good value.It’s a shame that… the biggest discounts are limited to certain colourways; the styling is more practical than pretty.Material:recycled polyesterWaterproofing:AquaDryColours:fourSizes available:8-20CraghoppersCaldbeck IIfrom£48£48 at Craghoppers£49.95 at Outdoor ActionWhat we loveWaterproof; recycled materials; relaxed longer fitWhat we don’t loveOnly some colourways have big reductionsBest premium waterproof jacket:Arc’teryx Beta ARArc’teryxBeta ARfrom£449.89£449.89 at Cotswold Outdoor£600 at Arc’teryxWhat we loveThe fit, waterproofing and versatility in the mountainsWhat we don’t loveThe price!Photograph: Mary Spender/The GuardianFrom £449.89 at Cotswold Outdoor£600 at Arc’teryxIf keeping dry is the feature you value above all else, then the Arc’teryx Beta AR is for you. The upgraded Beta jacket uses Gore-Tex Pro for serious weather protection for hikers, skiers and mountaineers alike, all while staying breathable.Why we love itGore-Tex’s Pro waterproofing material is PFC-free, eliminating the use of any chemicals that are harmful to the environment. However, in doing so, it doesn’t compromise on performance – it’s properly waterproof, with rain beading off the material as if off the proverbial duck’s back. I also rated the Beta AR’s fit, which is streamlined but with room to layer beneath.Every detail – from the helmet-compatible hood to the water-resistant zips – seems well thought out, great quality and comfortable to wear. The women’s version of this jacket comes with adjustable waist and wrists, too. I wore the Beta AR in squally, wet and cold weather, and it kept me dry all day, and even with layers beneath, I didn’t feel clammy or hot. Yes, the Beta AR is expensive, but it will keep you dry on everything from mountain missions to pub walks.It’s a shame that …it’s undeniably expensive. Casual wearers are unlikely to need this level of waterproofing.Material:Gore-Tex ProWaterproofing:28,000mmColours:fiveSizes available:XXS–XXLArc’teryxBeta ARfrom£449.89£449.89 at Cotswold Outdoor£600 at Arc’teryxWhat we loveThe fit, waterproofing and versatility in the mountainsWhat we don’t loveThe price!Best waterproof jacket for the mountains/pros:Rab Latok Gore-Tex ProRabLatok Gore-Tex Profrom£336£336 at Ellis Brigham£480 at RabWhat we loveAs waterproof as they come – but still light and comfortableWhat we don’t loveThe bells and whistles – overkill for casual country walkers£336 at Ellis Brigham£480 at RabBritish climbing and mountaineering brand Rab designed the Latok Pro for when you need “breathability, durability and protection in equal measure”. If you love to hike hill and dale in any weather, this jacket marries comfort and a female-specific fit with rain-repelling Gore-Tex in a sleek design.Why we love itI did lots of happy hiking in the Latok Pro. Gore-Tex is an ever-reliable technology for waterproofing, and the Latok comes with a hydrostatic head rating of 28,000mm. This ensured that nary a drop of rain seeped through while hiking through sustained wet weather in the Lake District. The hood was also my favourite on test – it stayed put in high winds, and the stiffened peak kept rain off my face. It packs a weatherproof punch and includes a Recco reflector (which makes you searchable by professional rescue teams using a special radar detector), yet the Latok Pro remains lightweight, at 366g, to be comfortable enough for all-day wear, and fits brilliantly while under a rucksack.It’s a shame that …it’s too techie and expensive for casual use.Material:Gore-Tex Pro fabricWaterproofing:Gore-TexColours available:fourSizes available:8-16RabLatok Gore-Tex Profrom£336£336 at Ellis Brigham£480 at RabWhat we loveAs waterproof as they come – but still light and comfortableWhat we don’t loveThe bells and whistles – overkill for casual country walkersBest packable jacket:Haglöfs Front ProofHaglöfsFront Prooffrom£114£114 at Ellis Brigham£120 at HaglöfsWhat we loveRainproof, but extremely lightweightWhat we don’t loveThere are limited pockets to save on weight£114 at Ellis BrighamFrom £120 at HaglöfsChangeable weather conditions on the horizon? The Haglöfs Front Proof is designed to be lightweight and packable, so it’s ideal for exploring under moody skies when you might be throwing waterproof layers on and off at every turn.Why we love itI’ve always rated Haglöfs’ outdoor kit, and the Front Proof didn’t disappoint. First, it was so lightweight that I barely noticed I was wearing it. Plus, I could quickly pack it down and chuck it in my rucksack once the rain had passed.While this design uses Haglöfs’ own-brand Proof technology, rather than a Gore-Tex membrane, it held up impressively well against steady rain and wind. It isn’t quite as breathable as premium Gore-Tex shells, so it can feel a little warm if hiking uphill. The minimalist design also means you don’t get features, such as pit zips or a chest pocket. Yet, for the £140 price, the weight and packability, the Front Proof is a brilliant all-rounder for unpredictable weather.It’s a shame that …design is somewhat minimalist.Material:recycled polyesterWaterproofing:Haglöfs ProofColours:fourSizes available:XS-XLHaglöfsFront Prooffrom£114£114 at Ellis Brigham£120 at HaglöfsWhat we loveRainproof, but extremely lightweightWhat we don’t loveThere are limited pockets to save on weightBest waterproof for fit and comfort:Klättermusen Allgron 2.0KlättermusenAllgron 2.0£500£500 at KlättermusenWhat we loveLovely female fit and soft-touch fabricWhat we don’t loveFiddling with the bungees on the wristsPhotograph: Mary Spender/The Guardian£500 at KlättermusenSwedish brand Klättermusen has been making mountain equipment since 1975, and if you want a hiking jacket you can also wear for snow sports, the four-season Allgron 2.0 is the perfect fit.Why we love itSome premium waterproofs repel rain brilliantly – but can feel plasticky and stiff, and rustle loudly with every step. Not so with Klättermusen’s Allgron 2.0, which is pleasingly soft to the touch, flexible and doesn’t feel scratchy against the skin. Cut slightly longer than other jackets I tested, this jacket covers more of your hips, keeping your lower torso warm and dry. It sits well under a rucksack without moving or riding up, too.There are plenty of technical features here: it’s fully waterproof, has great pockets and ventilation zips, and comes with a built-in Recco reflector for snow sports. I’d have preferred Velcro on the adjustable wrists rather than fiddly bungees, but overall, this was my favourite of all the jackets on test for comfort and female fit.It’s a shame that …it’s painfully pricey, and with fiddly bungees on the wristsMaterial:polyamideWaterproofing:CutanColours:sevenSizes available:XXS-XLKlättermusenAllgron 2.0£500£500 at KlättermusenWhat we loveLovely female fit and soft-touch fabricWhat we don’t loveFiddling with the bungees on the wristsBest jacket for breathability:Montane PhaseMontanePhasefrom£178£178 at LD Mountain Centre£261.89 at Cotswold OutdoorWhat we loveBreathable, ideal for fast-paced hikes and outdoor pursuitsWhat we don’t loveNo plus-size range, and the sleeves are a shade longFrom £178 at LD Mountain Centre£261.89 at Cotswold OutdoorMontane’s Phase jacket is one of the brand’s bestsellers, and I can see why. It’s comfortable to wear, sufficiently weatherproof for adventures at altitude – yet doesn’t feel too much for casual dog walking.Why we love itThe Phase uses Gore-Tex for waterproofing and kept the rain off all day when I was out in autumn 2025’s Storm Benjamin. Montane’s Barrier technology maintains breathability, and the Phase jacket really stood out in warmer wet weather, where I remained comfortable and cool – even when cycling or trekking uphill.Elsewhere, there’s a helmet-compatible hood, harness-compatible pockets, and articulated arms – which give a good range of movement for climbing, mountaineering and other high-octane pursuits. However, the Phase is also simple enough to use for relaxed hiking days. The fit was decent, but the sleeves were a shade too long for me, although they are adjustable. Sizing is limited, though.It’s a shame that …the sleeves are a little long; limited sizing.Material:recycled nylonWaterproofing:Gore-Tex (28,000mm)Colours:fourSizes available:8-16MontanePhasefrom£178£178 at LD Mountain Centre£261.89 at Cotswold OutdoorWhat we loveBreathable, ideal for fast-paced hikes and outdoor pursuitsWhat we don’t loveNo plus-size range, and the sleeves are a shade longBest jacket for skiing:Tierra Roc Blanc Gen 4TierraRoc Blanc Gen 4£480£480 at TrekittWhat we loveTough and ticks all the boxes for mountain adventuresWhat we don’t loveThe price – get something cheaper for weekend strollsPhotograph: Mary Spender/The Guardian£480 at TrekittAn updated version of Tierra’s reliable Roc Blanc, this jacket is designed in Sweden – where locals know how to handle serious winter weather. Built with top-end materials and mountain-ready features, it’s ideal for ski touring or alpine adventures.Why we love itThe three-layer Gore-Tex Pro fabric of the Roc Blanc Gen 4 shrugs off snow and sleet, while the generous cut of this jacket allows easy layering underneath. Mountain-specific design touches such as a helmet-compatible hood, large chest pockets (accessible even with a harness on), and ventilation zips make this a capable piece for demanding days on the slopes, as well as stylish enough to wear around resort towns.At £480, the Roc Blanc Gen 4 is an investment piece, but for performance, durability, and comfort in harsh alpine conditions, it earns its place among the best ski jackets out there.

It repelled water effectively out in the Cumbrian hills, with water beading on the jacket’s surface, and was breathable enough for hiking, thanks to good pit zips. However, I don’t think this design would be breathable enough for sweatier endeavours, such as climbing or mountaineering.I also like that this lightweight coat stuffs into its own pocket if the sun comes out. If you want to squeeze a thicker puffer jacket underneath, I’d consider a size up. As well as a high-quality jacket, Patagonia is an ethical pick – this jacket is Fairtrade and made using recycled materials.Itdidn’t make the final cut because …breathability is limited compared with the other jackets on test.Material:recycled polyester;waterproofing:H2No standard;colours:13;sizes:XXS-XXLPatagoniaTorrentshellfrom£124.89£124.89 at Cotswold Outdoor£180 at Ellis BrighamWhat we loveFun colours, fully waterproof, easy to wearWhat we don’t loveA touch flimsy when compared with our best in testMammut DucanMammutDucan£162£162 at MammutWhat we loveSoft, comfortable liner; tough outer waterproofingWhat we don’t loveYou’ll need to try this on to see if it fits properlyPhotograph: Mary Spender/The GuardianFrom £162 at MammutBest for:comfy liningMammut’s own Dry Tour technology renders the lightweight Ducan fully waterproof to 20,000mm, with rain rolling off its surface in seconds. Unlike some shell jackets, which can feel plasticky, the Ducan’s soft inner liner feels lovely to wear. The design is sustainable, made with part-recycled materials and repairable. Where I thought the Ducan was a little off was the fit. I’m a size 12, but the medium proved tight around my hips and wide on my shoulders and arms.

It’s made from 100% recycled polyester and finished with a PFC-free DWR coating, which saw it shed water well in light rain, while remaining breathable enough for brisk hikes. However, in heavy rain, I did find that water seeped into the fabric, so I’d save it for light showers.

For full waterproofing, look for a jacket that incorporates tried-and-tested technology such as Gore-Tex or own-brand waterproofing into the outer layer of the jacket (or the hard-shell).Some brands also list the amount of waterproofing their jackets offer, which is tested according to their hydrostatic head (this test assesses a fabric’s waterproofing abilities by subjecting it to increasing water pressure). Up to 1,500mm is considered only water resistant. Above 5,000mm is waterproof enough for wearing in steady rain, and a jacket with 10,000mm to 20,000mm is likely to work in torrential rain or snow.BreathabilityCheap and cheerful macs-in-sacs and rain ponchos will keep you dry at a pinch, but they’re not breathable – you’ll quickly get sweaty and hot, which isn’t ideal when you’re out on hikes or cycle trips. Instead, high-quality jackets incorporate a breathable membrane that wicks away moisture, so that you don’t overheat.Think about how and where you’ll wear your jacket before you buy. For casual use, a longer parka-length jacket with some insulation will offer warmth. If you’re planning fast-paced hikes or cycles, you’ll want something light and breathable, without insulation and with added ventilation zips.Design and fitA good jacket should fit snugly but not too tightly at the waist, cuffs and neck. It should include taped seams, sealed or protected zips, zipped pockets and a well-designed, adjustable hood. If you’re a keen climber, cyclist or mountaineer, look for a jacket with a hood that can be worn over a helmet, and a fit designed to work when worn under a backpack and a harness. A slim-fitting jacket will keep you warmer, but make sure there’s room underneath to wear a down layer or fleece layer in cold weather.How much to spendThere are rain-ready jackets at prices to suit pretty much every budget. Aim to spend about £150 on a good, versatile waterproof. Premium £200+ jackets are only worth the splurge if you’ll be heading out in serious conditions on proper hiking trips.It’s worth noting that no jacket – unless it’s a purely plastic mac, which won’t be breathable – will be completely waterproof forever. If your coat begins to lose its waterproofing (rain will sink into the outer fabric rather than bead straight off it), re-waterproof it witha treatment such as Nikwax.For more, read thebest umbrellas for staying dry in the wind and rainand thebest women’s walking bootsSian Lewis is an award-winningoutdoors and travel journalist and author who loves putting adventure kit through its paces whilehiking, swimming and wild camping.

Searches at the Royal Lodge in Windsor, Berkshire, his former address, were continuing.On an extraordinary day that could have profound effects for the royal family, unmarked police cars and plainclothes officers from the Thames Valley force were seen at Mountbatten-Windsor’s residence at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate at about 8am. They searched the Norfolk property as well as his former home in the Royal Lodge in Great Windsor Park.Hours later Charles gave his unqualified backing to the police investigation into his brother, who was arrested on his 66th birthday. The king said the “law must take its course”.“What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,” Charles said in a statement. “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation.”In the glare of increased public scrutiny, the king and queen continued their royal duties with Charles attending three separate in-person audiences at St James’s Palace and Camilla visiting the Sinfonia Smith Square in Westminster for a lunchtime orchestral concert.Meanwhile, Princess Anne visited a prison, HMP Leeds, in her capacity as patron of the Butler Trust, a UK charity that promotes the work of staff in prisons, probation and youth justice.Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, thought to be the first time in modern history that a member of the royal family has been held by police, came only hours after the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said “nobody is above the law” when questioned about the former prince. He added that “anybody who has any information should testify”.View image in fullscreenAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor riding a horse in Windsor Great Park on 2 February.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThames Valley police said it had arrested “a man in his 60s from Norfolk” on suspicion of misconduct in public office and was carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk.Oliver Wright, one of the force’s assistant chief constables, said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office. It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”Two key decisions were made before the arrest of the king’s brother.The first was that inviting Mountbatten-Windsor in for an interview under caution would not be enough, with detectives believing arrest “was necessary to progress the investigation”, a source said.The second key decision was that there would need to be searches.The arrest would grant police search powers of properties linked to the former prince. That meant there was no need to separately apply to a magistrate for a search warrant.Norfolk police confirmed they were supporting Thames Valley’s investigation.It is understood neither the king nor Buckingham Palace was informed in advance of Andrew’s arrest.Police leaders informed the Home Office on Thursday morning that officers were going to arrest Andrew and carry out searches. The National Police Chiefs’ Council said in a statement: “In line with routine practice, the [NPCC] alerted operational colleagues within the Home Office of the arrest. This gave 30 minutes’ notice before Thames Valley police made the arrest.”Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing or accusations against him. Thames Valley is one of a number of police forces to have assessed allegations that resurfaced when the US justice department published the so-called Epstein files.The force said previously it was reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mountbatten-Windsor, and claims the former prince shared sensitive information with the disgraced financier while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.10:09Andrew arrested: is this the end for the royal family? | The LatestThe family of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Mountbatten-Windsor of sexually abusing her when she was 17 as part of a sex trafficking ring run by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell – allegations the former prince has denied – released a statement on Thursday.Her family members Sky and Amanda Roberts and Danny and Lanette Wilson said: “At last. Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty. On behalf of our sister, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, we extend our gratitude to the UK’s Thames Valley police for their investigation and arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you.”Wright said previously that information was evaluated during an assessment phase to determine whether a criminal offence was suspected and a full investigation required. “Allegations of misconduct in public office involve particular complexities and therefore an assessment must be conducted carefully and thoroughly,” he said at a press briefing last week.View image in fullscreenUnmarked cars at the Sandringham estate on Thursday.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesResponding to Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, the former prime minister Gordon Brown said: “I have submitted a five-page memorandum to the Metropolitan, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley and other relevant UK police constabularies.“This memorandum provides new and additional information to that which I submitted last week to the Met, Essex and Thames Valley police forces, where I expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women.”According to the Crown Prosecution Service’s website, misconduct in public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.Mountbatten-Windsor could also face questions about alleged sexual wrongdoing while under arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office, according to a lawyer who specialises in representing abuse survivors.In 2015, the retired Church of England bishop Peter Ball, an associate of the king, was jailed for 32 months for misconduct in public office after the court was told that he had misused his authority over young men for sexual gratification.Richard Scorer, the head of abuse law at Slater and Gordon, said: “If prosecutors build a case which convinces a jury that Andrew misused his position to have sex with young women, in my opinion he could be pursued on that basis.”Republic, a group that campaigns to abolish the monarchy, welcomed the arrest, which it claimed was in response to a crime report sent to Thames Valley police by its chief executive, Graham Smith. He said: “Republic’s lawyers will continue to investigate related alleged offences and provide information to the police over the coming weeks and months.”The allegations stem from documents released by the US justice department relating to Epstein and his links to the rich and powerful. Emails released appeared to show Mountbatten-Windsor sharing reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore.One email, dated November 2010, appeared to be forwarded by the former duke to Epstein five minutes after it was sent by his then special adviser, Amir Patel. Another, seemingly sent on Christmas Eve 2010, included a confidential brief on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand province, Afghanistan.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

It was also announced the former duke would move out of the Royal Lodge in Windsor.Mountbatten-Windsor’s representatives have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Mountbatten-Windsor has denied all allegations of misconduct related to Epstein.In March of that year, agents traveled to Australia after an Epstein victim contacted federal prosecutors in south Florida, saying she had “information pertinent” to the late financier and his accomplice,Ghislaine Maxwell.The victim’s name is redacted from several documents chronicling the interview, but details closely track the public andlegal claimsmade by Virginia Giuffre, a well-known Epstein accuser who died by suicide last year.Giuffre said Epstein abused her and that he and Maxwell trafficked her to other men, including Mountbatten-Windsor.During the FBI interview, the woman said that she was a locker-room attendant atDonald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. Maxwell saw her reading a book on massage or anatomy and said she was seeking a traveling masseuse, the woman told investigators.She told FBI agents she traveled with Maxwell and Epstein to London and that they went to a nightclub with Mountbatten-Windsor and alleged that she and the then-royal engaged in sexual activity at Maxwell’s home. She also alleged that there was sexual activity at Epstein’s Manhattan home, according to the FBI document.Andrew hasrepeatedly deniedengaging in sexual activity with Giuffre. During his Newsnight interview in November 2019, Andrew insisted he had been elsewhere during this alleged incident, saying: “I was with the children, and I’d taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at, I suppose, four or five in the afternoon. And then because the duchess [Sarah Ferguson] was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other is there.”The document does not appear to be online any longer, at least as initially indexed, but the Guardian downloaded the file and its URL is in the Internet Archive. Another document that appears near-verbatim to this one, but with accused men’s names redacted,appearsin public records request filings that remain online.Following Epstein’s arrest, Mountbatten-Windsor appeared to feature more prominently in law enforcement’s inquiries into Epstein, both in private Department of Justice communication and public statements.An internal DoJ memo dated 19 December 2019 revealed prosecutors were interested in speaking to him. “We are in the process of obtaining the name of a lawyer who represents Prince Andrew. Once we have this contact information, we plan to request an interview,” a footnote in the memo states.Epstein died in jail several months earlier, while awaiting his Manhattan federal sex-trafficking trial. Maxwell was found guilty in 2021 of sex trafficking for her involvement in Epstein’s abuse of teenage girls.Geoffrey Berman, who was the Manhattan US attorney overseeing Epstein’s prosecution, repeatedly criticized Mountbatten-Windsor for alleged unwillingness to help their investigation. Bermansaidon 27 January 2020 Mountbatten-Windsor had provided “zero” cooperation in their Epstein investigation despite his promises to help.“Contrary to Prince Andrew’s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options,” Berman similarlysaidon 9 March 2020.“Today, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate with an ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offenses committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, even though the Prince has not given an interview to federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule such an interview, and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally – through the very same counsel who issued today’s release – that he would not come in for such an interview,” Berman said in a statement.“If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him.”Contact information for Mountbatten-Windsor’s press representative was not immediately available.Explore more on these topicsUS newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was one of multiple scandals in the 1990s and 2000s involving the former duchess, who was widely considered an embarrassment to the royal family.Ferguson has stood by Mountbatten-Windsor through waves of allegations produced by his links toJeffrey Epstein, though she was yet to comment on his arrest on Thursday.She has previously described him as “amazing” and said they were “the happiest divorced couple in the world”, later rejecting the claims against him and calling his alleged victim Virginia Giuffre a liar.While Ferguson’s ties to Mountbatten-Windsor have kept her adjacent to the Epstein scandal, it is her own closeness to the convicted sex offender that is threatening to make her persona non grata in the public sphere as more details come to light.News of the former prince’s arrest came only days after it was revealed that six of Ferguson’s businesses are set to be struck off the register of Companies House, after becoming dormant. It is not clear what each of them did, but one appeared to be a public relations business, while another appeared to be in the retail sector.Ferguson, whose money problems have been well documented over the years, and who has struggled to be financially independent, exchanged many emails with Epstein, even after he was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.A string of revelations have uncovered Ferguson’s financial ties – even an alleged dependence – on Epstein. The allegations have also opened up questions about the funding of the lifestyles of her daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, now in their 30s, who were pictured going on lavish holidays during their 20s while working relatively low-paid jobs.Ferguson has been involved in several scandals that appeared to be attempts to cash in on her royal connections, including two tell-all memoirs, in 1996 and 2011, and in 2010 when she was exposed in a News of the World sting operation attempting to sell access to her former husband in return for £500,000. She told Mazher Mahmood, who was undercover as the “Fake Sheikh”, that she would “open any door you want”, promising him he would get his investment back tenfold.Later apologising for the scandal, Ferguson said it was “true my finances are under stress”.The Epstein files, the tranche of documents gathered by US authorities in the investigation into the disgraced financier, have shown some of the extent to which she financially depended on the friendship with him, including evidence he wired Ferguson $150,000 (£104,000) in 2001, which she said was for share options she had earned as an “ambassador” for Weight Watchers, which had gone public earlier that year.She initially claimed to have cut ties with Epstein as soon as she became aware of the allegations against him in 2006. However, emails contained in the US department of justice files showed she maintained her closeness with him.“Cannot wait to see you,” she wrote in one email in 2009. Another email between Epstein and his assistant showed he paid $14,080 to fly Ferguson and her two daughters, then 19 and 20, to the US for lunch.Days later she wrote to him: “Thank you Jeffrey for being the brother I have always wished for.”The following year, in another email, she wrote: “You are a legend.” Later in the same email, she added: “I am at your service. Just marry me.”Nine months later, Ferguson publicly apologised for her association with him, saying in an interview with the Evening Standard newspaper: “I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf.”But in private, the former duchess emailed Epstein to “humbly apologise” for denouncing him publicly, calling him “a supreme friend to me and my family”.Later, when the conversation became public, she told the media she had sent that email to him to “assuage Epstein and his threats”.When the US government released the first tranche of Epstein files in September last year, a number of charities associated with the then duchess cut ties with her, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the children’s hospice Julia’s House, both of which she was patron.The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation issued a statement saying the charity was “disturbed” to read her comments, and also dropped her as a patron.Nothing uncovered in the files has indicated any criminal activity by Ferguson, who appeared to stop using the duchess title when her ex-husband was stripped of his title, though it may be one scandal too many.Explore more on these topicsSarah FergusonJeffrey EpsteinanalysisShareReuse this content"

On one hand, it is hard to believe any greater harm can befall the family after weeks of drip-feed from the US Department of Justice’s Epstein files. On the other, a royal arrest of this sort is unprecedented. Enough is already in the public domain to indicate that police believe that there must be a case to answer to the charge of misconduct in public office.King Charles, who apparently was not warned in advance that his brother was to be arrested, has been scrupulous in his response. “The law must take its course,” he said, offering prosecutors“full and wholehearted support and cooperation”. Whatever happens now, a line has been crossed in the life of the nation. A once exalted royal, facing serious judicial investigation by authorities acting on behalf of the citizenry. Stripped of status and finery, he faces the spotlight as would any other inhabitant of these isles. One cannot know the outcome, but just this arrest feels like a significant moment.Until now the royal family’s involvements with the law have been minimal. In her wilder days Princess Anne’s dog bit a girl in Windsor Great Park and she was fined £500. She was also fined £400 for speeding in Gloucestershire. Apart from that, researchers into royal quarrels with the law have had to go back to Charles I and Mary, Queen of Scots.This case begins at the time when Andrew strayed from the tedious round of royal duties, of fete openings and palace parties. He won a role as a government trade representative. It was a controversial appointment, made at the request of Buckingham Palace, which required him to travel extensively abroad. He was acting in effect as a junior minister, well away from the domestic political fray. He was not a policymaker, more a trade promoter. Andrew’s qualifications for the job were much discussed at the time, but the pressure from the palace was intense.‘Nobody above law,’ says DPP amid claims against AndrewRead moreThe extent to which members of the royal family are entitled to impinge on matters of government has long been vexed, if only because all public decisions are made in the monarch’s name. Mike Bartlett’s play Charles III famously involved the king refusing to sign a bill with which he strongly disagreed. He had to abdicate. His advisers pointed out that he was, in effect, a cypher without any exercise of discretion. He pointed out that if the bill could not pass without his active consent, it could not pass. He had refused that consent.That Charles has felt strongly about many issues – his friends would say most – was well known. From architecture to agriculture and from town planning to herbal remedies he was desperate for “something to be done”. He was scrupulous in arguing that as mere heir to the throne, he was entitled like any citizen to hold views on political issues, only to avoid party politics. This was sometimes a nuance too far, witness the blizzard of “black spider memos” that poured into ministerial in-trays. What Charles did know is that when he took the throne that would stop. We assume it has.View image in fullscreenAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor after the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey, London, 6 May 2023.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAAndrew is not the monarch. His status, like that of a dozen “working royals”, descends from the decision of the then queen and Prince Philip in 1969 to redefine the British monarchy as a “royal family”. The head of state became the family of state. This was popular as the young children were filmed playing round barbecues at Balmoral. It came across less well as overprotected teenagers blossomed into wealthy celebrities.Monarchy in a democracy depends entirely on the extent to which the king or queen of the day enjoys public support. Queen Elizabeth II made that dependence extend to the support of her family, leading in turn to her fierce backing of Andrew. When support seemed to evaporate, as in the 1990s largely over the Princess Diana affair, the family had nowhere to turn. It “ruled” in effect courtesy of Ipsos Mori and Gallup, and the latter at one point put supportat just 26%.Police investigating claims that Epstein trafficked women through UK airportsRead moreThe latest turn in the royal saga adds to the urgency of reform. The royal family was a constitutional wrong turning. At a time when monarchies across Europe were adopting purely figurative roles – the “bicycling monarchs” – the reliance of Britain’s extended royal family on celebrity and extravagance was simply out of date. What was more, it was grossly unfair in the pressure it put on the individuals involved. Unlikely ever to get the top job, they were condemned to a life of luxury – and exposure – in return for good behaviour. Not all could meet the bargain.Charles survived the tribulations of his marriage and won through. His elder son, William, has emerged as a model heir to the throne. That cannot brush aside the difficulties into which Andrew and Harry were plunged. Nor can it justify the ongoing fiscal leniency extended to the royal estates or the plethora of palaces and retainers sustained at public expense. It is not that the royal family is indefensibly expensive. It is that the expense serves only to undermine the monarchy when things go wrong.Whatever happens to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor now, it lies within the power of the monarch to change this state of affairs. Charles hinted at reform before he came to the throne. That he indulged in his absurd “anointment” in Westminster Abbey suggested this was skin deep. William letting it be known that he will not move into Buckingham Palace suggests a step in the right direction. He should show willing by also incorporating the palace gardens in the royal parks. But what would most benefit his children and those round them is to remove the capital letters from the “royal family”.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He wrote: “Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.”A pre-emptive strike onIranwould be unlikely to be in line with the UK’s interpretation of international law. US bases in the UK, like Fairford in Gloucestershire, the home for US B-2 bombers in Europe, are only used for military operations if the UK government agrees and they are considered legal.UK government sources said this was viewed as the reason for Trump to again turn against the Chagos plan.On Tuesday night, Starmer and Trump spoke in a conversation that covered the situation in Iran, although the Downing Street readout of the call made no mention of the Chagos plan.The hope in No 10 is that Trump will again change his mind. The bill setting out the Chagos agreement is due to return to the House of Lords soon.There has been speculation that the bill, which is nearing its final stages but was delayed last month amid continued uncertainty about the US position, might have returned to the Lords next week. However, it is now not expected for several weeks.Under parliamentary rules, if it is not passed before the end of the current parliamentary session in May, the bill would have to be presented again.One former government official who worked closely on the deal said he was concerned it might be scuppered. Ben Judah, who was until recently a special adviser to David Lammy, the former foreign secretary, told a Sun podcast: “It’s looking tricky for the government to get this deal through in the weeks and month ahead.”Map of US military bases near IranThe Conservatives are continuing to push the Trump administration to block the plan, which Downing Street has said can only go ahead with US buy-in.The shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, is giving a speech in Washington DC next week, and is expected to hold talks with US officials about the Chagos plan.In a statement, Patel said the deal was “now dead in the water”, adding: “It’s impossible for the deal to proceed without the support of our American allies, and Labour will soon run out of time to put anything before parliament.”A government spokesperson said: “As routine, we do not comment on operational matters. There is a political process ongoing between the US and Iran, which the UK supports. Iran must never be able to develop a nuclear weapon, and our priority is security in the region.”Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsDonald TrumpIranUS militaryMilitaryDefence policyKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Critics of the current system say lopsided funding mechanisms leave hundreds of thousands of children with little or no support in mainstream schools, requiring their families to battle local authorities for help.But government officials are concerned that proposals to limit who has access to educational, health and care plans could prompt a backlash from parents’ groups and Labour MPs when it comes to a Commons vote.Some are particularly concerned about plans to test those who hold ECHPs according to the new tougher criteriawhen they move up to secondary school, while others want to make sure parents can make a legal appeal if they feel schools are not meeting their children’s needs.View image in fullscreenThere is concern that the plan to test children with ECHPs against tougher criteria when they reach secondary school could prompt a fierce backlash.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAMeg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said: “The key thing is trust. If parents think their support could be ripped away from them they will worry.”However, she added that unlike the welfare reforms, over which she led a successful rebellion last year, ministers had been at pains to consult Labour MPs and were not focusing the reforms on saving money.Another Labour MP said: “The government has got everyone very, very anxious. But the truth is everyone recognises the need for reform and not letting things continue as they are.”‘A social justice issue’: London school believes it has model for Send inclusionRead moreGovernment insiders say they are optimistic that a rebellion can be averted in part because the Treasury has been more generous with funding than expected.The full package of reforms will be phased in over a decade, with mainstream schools to make extra provision and support “ordinarily available” to any pupils.Those schools will also be expected to make “reasonable adjustments” to accommodate children with conditions such as autism, ADHD or mental health issues, or face potential legal action.That action could involve appealing to an independent ombudsman, or changing equalities rules to make disabled children’s rights more explicit.Children with special needs at mainstream schools will be eligible for individual support plans (ISPs), which offer enhanced legal rights and assurances without a child requiring an EHCP.But policymakers say the reforms could be derailed if the government fails to make clear the benefits of the new system, including continuing protections for EHCPs, which agree the needs and support for individual children between families and councils.The new format for EHCPs will affect children only from 2030 onwards, and will take into account the extra provision available in mainstream schools.Those involved with the negotiations told the Guardian: “If MPs hear there are protections for EHCPs and there’s more money [in the system], I think they will come onboard.”More than 480,000 children and young people at schools inEnglandhave EHCPs, and reports have concentrated on fears that EHCPs could be curtailed or taken away at the transition from primary to secondary school after 2030.The first tier equalities tribunal will still be available for appeals involving EHCPs although its role will be “refocused” and take account of the other legal routes available to families.Ministers will also introduce new price bands for independent special schools, which currently charge more than twice the cost of a state special school on average.Under plans announced on Thursday, private providers will be forced to comply with set price bands for certain services and will have to sign up to minimum service standards.Phillipson said: “We’re cracking down on providers who put profit before children. New standards and proper oversight will ensure every independent special school placement delivers real outcomes for children – not unreasonable bills for local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsChildrenEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

That complaint was investigated by a senior diplomat who found that she had a case to answer, but was then dismissed by her line managers at the Cabinet Office, who gave her the all clear.The complaint has resurfaced in recent days after Simon McDonald, the former lead civil servant at the Foreign Office,urged the prime ministerto do more due diligence before making his decision. Starmer put aside those objections on Thursday when he confirmed Romeo’s appointment, making her the first ever female cabinet secretary.One former complainant said: “It is pretty extraordinary but not exactly out of character for the current No 10. It is just another example of poor judgment, and the elevation of those with questionable integrity despite the concerns raised by ordinary people.”Another said: “There is a real risk this comes back to bite the prime minister. The many people she bullied and intimidated, most of them women, will now feel failed for a second time. It’s not a good look for the civil service or the government.”A third complainant said: “Taking shortcuts to make appointments based on special treatment instead of merit and due diligence has already created chaos. This is an indication that problematic leadership decisions will persist.”Government sources have insisted that the allegations against Romeo should not be counted against her given they are 10 years old and were dismissed at the time by the Cabinet Office.Starmer defended his decision on Thursday, calling Romeo “an outstanding public servant, with a 25‑year record of delivering for the British people”.He added: “Antonia has shown she is the right person to drive the government to reform and I look forward to working with her to deliver this period of national renewal.”Romeo said it was a “huge privilege” to become the head of the civil service.“The civil service is a great and remarkable institution, which I love,” she said. “We should be known for delivery, efficiency and innovation, working to implement the government’s agenda and meet the challenges the country faces.”Romeo’s supporters say she is dynamic and willing to break civil service conventions to achieve the government’s goals.But her critics say she is more focused on promoting herself than the government she works for and that her impatience at more junior staff has sometimes tipped over into bullying.According to the complaint made in 2017, Romeo told several colleagues she would end or damage their careers after disagreements in the normal course of work.One allegation says Romeo warned that the refusal by a junior member of staff to comply with a particular request was a “career-limiting move” and “would only happen once”.Another who disagreed with one of Romeo’s ideas said Romeo told her she “would make sure [that person’s] reputation and career in London suffered”.Other allegations included in the complaint concerned her financial affairs. They included her decision to get Farrow & Ball to provide more than $100,000 (£74,000) worth of paint to redecorate her residence in return for free publicity, as well as a $250 (£186) expense claim for a taxi to a football match.The allegations, which were part of one complaint, were all investigated at the time by Tim Hitchens, a former ambassador to Japan, who was flown in to conduct a week-long review.Hitchens found that she had a case to answer on her management style, but not on her financial affairs. His finding was overturned by the Cabinet Office however, which said she had no case to answer.Three complainants from the time have contacted the Cabinet Office in recent weeks to raise concerns about her previous behaviour.Downing Street insisted on Thursday that full vetting had taken place on a previous occasion when she was considered for the job. No 10 said it had consulted the civil service commissioner, Gisela Stuart, who said the full process did not need to be re-run.Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian also identified two other CBP officers on St Thomas and in Florida who were in contact with Epstein, based on emails and text messages between Epstein, his staff and the officers. It does not appear the FBI ever investigated those two officers.The FBI in New York opened apreliminary investigationin October 2019 after receiving areportthat a long-serving CBP agricultural inspector “had ongoing friendship with Mr Epstein … while working for CBP Pre-Clearance in Saint Thomas for over 7 years”. The email establishing the investigation into the agricultural inspector, Timothy “Bill” Routch, is among the millions of files related to Epstein’s crimes that were released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) this month.Federal authorities interviewed Epstein’s longtime pilot about the convicted sex offender’s contacts with CBP agents.US Customs and Border Protection is the federal law enforcement agency tasked with overseeing the entrance of people and goods through US ports of entry, including airports. Itclaimsto be “uniquely situated to deter and disrupt human trafficking”, and is one of the four primary US agencies tasked with enforcing federal anti-trafficking law.In July 2019, federal prosecutors in New York indicted Epstein on charges of sex trafficking minors as young as 14 in New York and Palm Beach, Florida. Following Epstein’s death by suicide in jail in August 2019, the attorney general of the US Virgins Islands – an unincorporated territory of the US that includes St Thomas and Epstein’s private islands, Little St James and Great St James – filedsuitagainst his estate, alleging that Epstein “trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls” on those private islands, using “private planes, helicopters, boat and automobiles to transport victims to, from and within the Virgin Islands”.No CBP officer was ever charged for crimes related to Epstein, and the Guardian has not seen any evidence to suggest that CBP officers had direct knowledge or involvement in Epstein’s crimes. The FBI interviewed Routch and subpoenaed credit reports about him and three other CBP officers, but it is not clear whether the investigation went any further. The release of the government’s investigative files on Epstein has been delayed, redactions are inconsistent, and it is not clear how many more files will be made public.View image in fullscreenLittle St James Island, one of Epstein’s properties, as seen in July 2019.Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersRoutch acknowledged interacting with Epstein “in the course of [his] employment”, visiting Epstein’s island, and being investigated by the FBI. He disputed many of the details contained in FBI and CBP documents. In emails with the Guardian, he characterized the FBI investigation as “a wild goose chase”, and said: “All my encounters were of a business nature … I never [witnessed] anything remotely related to trafficking.”Epstein emailed and texted with CBP officers, invited them to his island, visited with them at the airport, and frequently sought to determine who was going to be on duty when he was traveling through STT, the released files show. Some officers received financial advice, others, small gifts, and employment opportunities. One officer was invited to perform the steel pan drums on Little St James on multiple occasions; Epstein tasked his assistant with helping another with an interest in accounting to find mentorship. That agent solicited Epstein for a “hard-money loan”, though he told the Guardian the loan never materialized.Epstein also raised complaints about less-than-friendly treatment from other CBP officers with his friendly agents, twice eliciting promises from supervisors to look into the perceived ill treatment.The Guardian contacted CBP and the Department of Homeland Security for comment. They did not respond by our deadline.In March 2016, Jeffrey Epstein was burdened with logistical headaches. Eight years after pleading guilty to charges of child sexual exploitation, the billionaire continued to enjoy a jet-setting lifestyle, regularly travelling between his homes in New York, Florida, New Mexico and the US Virgin Islands on afleetof private jets.Travel between the mainland US and his compound on Little St James was complicated. Flights to St Thomas were treated like domestic flights, but flights departing St Thomas for a US airport had to clear customs and immigration control.Epstein and his personal pilot, Larry Visoski, typically expedited this process by “pre-clearing” in St Thomas. Pre-clearance is alongstanding CBP programthat allows travelers to go through CBP inspections at certain overseas airports rather than upon arrival. Emails between Epstein and Visoski suggest that they preferred to pre-clear whenever possible and that Epstein was often personally involved in those arrangements.But on 1 March 2016, something went awry. About an hour out from Teterboro airport in New Jersey, a popular airport for private and corporate jets in close proximity to Manhattan, Visoski received a satellite call from his wife. A CBP officer had just called her as Visoski’s emergency contact and was threatening Visoski with some kind of fine. Visoski made contact with the Teterboro CBP officer, who told Visoski that he could “NOT let my passengers deplane and to bring the aircraft directly to the customs building upon arrival”, the pilot laterrecalled.Visoski informed the CBP officer by satellite phone that he had pre-cleared customs in STT and eventually received what hedescribedas “a sincere apology”. Epstein pursued the issue, however, seeking further information about CBP procedures at other airports and asking Visoski to get the name of the CBP officer’s supervisor.View image in fullscreenLarry Visoski arrives for Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial in New York in November 2021.Photograph: Jeenah Moon/ReutersJust two weeks later, another hiccup occurred. Upon arriving at the airport in Newark, New Jersey – and despite pre-clearing at STT – a CBP officer required Epstein’s passengers to pass through immigration control.Darren Indyke, Epstein’s longtime lawyer, sent a formalcomplaintto the Department of Homeland Security’s private aircraft support office, noting that “in the course of N212JE’s numerous flights between St Thomas and Teterboro, and St Thomas and West Palm Beach, there has been a lack of uniformity in the clearance and pre-arrival requirements imposed by local CBP offices at each of those locations, and, at times, by different CPB officers within them”. Indykefollowed upon 23 May and appears to have scheduled aconference callwith staff from private aircraft support on 25 May.But while Indyke was going through official channels, Epstein was taking a more direct approach. The billionaireemailedJames Heil, a supervisory CBP officer based on St Thomas. “One off the passengers . a woman with an asylum application pending, work authorization and a social secirity card, was asked for her passport and in it given a B 2 tourist visa,” Epsteincomplained. (Epstein’s communications are littered with punctuation and spelling errors.) “The other passenger was stamped in as well , though they did not change her departure date.”Heil offered to reach a supervisor “up there”, and said: “I apologize that you are experiencing these issues again.” It’s not clear what actions, if any, Heil took from there. Heil did not respond to queries from the Guardian.Heil had been in direct communication with Epstein since at least 2014, documents show. An email from one of Epstein’s assistants suggests Heil wasscheduledto visit Little St James by boat on 28 February 2014, though it’s not known whether the visit took place. Epstein regularly emailed or texted Heil about issues he had going through customs at various airports or to see if Heil was going to be on duty when he planned to depart STT.The correspondence appears friendly. Epstein texted Heil a message of thanks on Christmas Day 2014. “It was my pleasure,” Heil responded the next day. “Feel free to utilize my not-so-insignificant IQ anytime, and also feel free to connect via social media. (We Brooklyn Boys stick together.)”“Atta boy,” Epstein responded.At one point during their text exchanges, Epstein, perhaps jokingly, invited Heil to “stop by at my house and I’ll make you an egg cream”. There is no evidence Heil took him up on the offer. On Christmas Eve 2016, Epstein texted Heil: “Just landed with your xmas cannolis . Where can I deliver them.” Heil was off work, so Epstein had his driver deliver the treats to Heil’s home. Twice, Epstein appears to haveofferedto bring Heil “something” from the mainland.Epstein also regularly raised issues that he encountered with airport customs at STT and other US airports, and Heil said he wasworkingto liaise with CBP officers in Florida, Massachusetts and New Jersey on Epstein’s behalf. At times, Epsteindiscussedwith Visoski whether they should ask Heil to approve overtime – in an apparent effort to arrange for Epstein to get pre-cleared outside of CBP’s regular hours.In November 2016, EpsteintextedHeil that one of his agents had been “nasty”. “I will speak to him!” Heil responded. “I will handle it, formally.”Records of Epstein’s direct interactions with the six CBP officers are mingled amid the bold-faced names that have dominated coverage of Epstein’s circle of influence. A memorandum of Epstein’s May 2013schedule, included in an email to Indyke, records appointments with Mort Zuckerman, Leon Black, Bob Kerrey, Joel Klein, Joi Ito, Woody and Soon Yi Allen, and Tom Pritzker – as well as “Customs Agent Bill Routch”.Routch is the first CBP officer to appear in the files, chronologically. Epstein appears to have begun contacting him in late 2012 andinvitedhim to visit Little St James “for coffee” on 21 May 2013. Routch acknowledged visiting the island but said it was to perform an agricultural inspection of some trees.In 2014, Epstein made contact with Heil as well as another agent, Jeff McNally, whom Visoski hadflaggedas being “nice”. McNally wasscheduledfor lunch on Little St James in May 2014, according to an email from one of Epstein’s assistants, though it is not known whether he attended. McNally did not respond to queries from the Guardian.View image in fullscreenA villa stands on Little St James Island, owned by Epstein, in 2019.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesIn 2015, Epstein got the name of another agent, Glen Samuel, from Heil, and asked Samuel to perform steel pan drumming on the island. Emails from Epstein’s assistants show that Samuel was scheduled to perform on the island at least twice, and that in 2016 heproposedoffering regular lessons to Epstein’s “guests”. It’s unclear if the lessons ever occurred. Samuel did not respond to queries from the Guardian.Epstein had received assurance from Heil that Samuel was allowed to undertake outside employment, but Samuel appears to have declined payment. “Mr. Samuel says he does not intend to charge you,” one of Epstein’s assistantswrotein an email. “He considers you a friend and was doing this for you. If you wish to give him something, he is appreciative, but there is no fee.”Heil also appears to have introduced Epstein to Gerardo (Gerry) Martinez, a CBP supervisor at the airport in Palm Beach, Florida. The files show regular communication between Epstein and Martinez throughout 2018, with Epstein often flagging his arrival at the airport and seeking to meet. Epstein alsocomplainedto Martinez after “your guys busted my balls” when he told CBP agents he was carrying $3,000 in cash but actually had $11,800. Epstein repeatedly followed up with questions about the regulations on carrying currency between the US Virgin Islands and mainland US, with Martinez sending the question “all the way to chief counsel”.In March 2019, Epstein appears to have asked Martinez for help or advice in obtaining a new passport,writing: “can i call you , ? not sure =hat to do, i need to get a new passport with the sex identifier on =t. is it ok to travel back and forth to the Virigi= islands without a valid passport?” Epstein made three attempts to meet with Martinez at the airport in the ensuing weeks, though it’s not clear if they met or why Epstein would turn to a CBP officer for help obtaining a passport.Martinez acknowledged interacting with Epstein when reached by the Guardian by phone, but did not immediately respond to further queries.Epstein was arrested at Teterboro airport on federal sex-trafficking charges on 6 July 2019, after flying in from Paris.The emails provide extensive communication between Epstein and a St Thomas CBP agent, Alford Richards, with whom Epstein arranged more than a dozen meetings between 2015 and 2019. It is not clear how many actually occurred.The emails show that Richards and Epstein first spoke about finance in August 2015, while Richards was working at the airport. Epstein had his assistants follow up, emailing Richards a link to Khan Academy, an online education company, as well as the billionaire’s advice that Richards start with “basic finance courses first”. Richards initially communicated with Epstein’s assistants, seeking further instruction on finance and investments, but was soon emailing regularly with Epstein himself.“I’m in action mode right now and have dedicated everyday to getting there,” hewroteto Epstein about his plans for “financial freedom” in October 2015, after a meeting at Epstein’s helicopter hangar. “I only take advice from you and every time we speak i take every thing literal and go out and do it. I know this is the COST I must endure to get where I want to get and I will ‘never’ give up.”In an interview, Richards acknowledged his numerous interactions with Epstein, including through meetings at Epstein’s office and on his private island “a couple of times”, but sought to minimize the extent of the relationship. “It wasn’t anything in-depth,” Richards said. “It’s like, hey, this guy is rich, let me hear his opinions.” Epstein was well-known on the island as a billionaire, and Richards was “just trying to get some financial insight”, he said.By email, Epstein counseled Richards to take accounting courses andhad one of his assistantstry to find Richards “hand-on experience” in accounting with a company on the island, through part-time work, an internship, or some kind of mentoring. The assistant contacted multiple local companies with which Epstein did business on Richards’ behalf.Much of the advice Epstein gave was “stuff I already found out by reading my books”, Richards said, but it “felt good that little me, who is no one” was getting financial tips from a billionaire. The internship “never came to fruition”, he said. “He’d give me like, vague tips, and then that was it,” Richards said. “I just wanted some hints and to get better at my finances.”Early in their interactions, EpsteintaskedRichards with finding out whether the fuel supplier for commercial airlines at STT would also sell to him, calling it a “good project” for Richards. Richards made inquiries and responded within a day. (Richards recalled the incident and said Epstein’s request had been “over my head” and “out of my league”.) The pair shared links to articles about investment prospects (in Belize, bitcoin, immigration detention centers, and local real estate) and Richard’s shared a number of business proposals with Epstein. They regularly arranged to meet around Epstein’s travel schedule.In June 2017, Epstein and Richardsdiscusseda forthcoming auction of local real estate. Soon thereafter, EpsteinemailedRichards: “as you have asked me for hard money loan , please as= your supervisor if we can continue this converation.” Richardsrespondedon 31 July 2017: “I spoke with my supervisor & was told that conversations on such a matter is ok, however, if I was to actually procure a hard money loan from you. It could or may be interpreted in a awkward way if I had to process you for official CBP travel business and the full terms of the transaction is not known or understood by certain individuals.”Richards said that the request for a “hard-money loan” – a type of short-term loan typically used in real estate transactions – was not serious, but the result of him trying to “naively speak the jargon of a person that knows what they’re saying but not really knowing”. No actual loan was made, he said.Richards said he never saw any hint of Epstein’s alleged crimes, which he described as “horrible” and “disgusting”.“I just knew he was rich, and he had some issues with the law years ago,” he said. “To be associated with him is horrible, and I’m not that type of person. I can’t believe I actually was speaking to this horrible person, but you never know people’s life.”On 30 August 2019, Routch stepped into his supervisor’s office in North Charleston, South Carolina, where he had worked since leaving the US Virgin Islands in 2016. “He respectfully requested to speak in confidence, closed the door, and appeared to be concerned, worried, and a bit shaken, about federal investigators looking into his past,” according to a CBPmemodocumenting the meeting.It was just a few weeks since Epstein’s suicide in a New York City jail cell, and Routch had learned that a woman he had previously dated had alerted the FBI that Routch was “a known associate of Jeffery Epstein, had ongoing friendship with Mr. Epstein, and that while working for CBP Pre-Clearance in Saint Thomas for over 7 years, and assisted Mr Epstein for conducting human trafficking of underage females”, the memo states.Asked how the woman would have known about this, Routch responded: “Everyone knew I was friends with Jeffery Epstein … I have been to his house, been on his boat, and flew in helicopter for whale watching.”The memo was forwarded to the CBP Watch Commander, and then to an investigator with DHS’s inspector general’s office. The FBIopeneda preliminary investigation on the matter on 10 October 2019.The Guardian has not seen any evidence in the files to support the complainant’s allegation that Routch had direct knowledge or involvement in Epstein’s crimes.Routch disputes the account of the opening of the investigation provided in the CBP memo. In emails to the Guardian, he claimed that there had never been any report by a woman to the FBI, and that instead his supervisor “fabricated a story to send to the FBI to glorify himself”.“In the course of my employment I ran into Mr Epstein several times,” he said. “All my encounters were of a business nature … I never [witnessed] anything remotely related to trafficking.View image in fullscreenEpstein is seen on Little St James Island in an undated photo.Photograph: United States District Court Southern District of New York/PA“I have done nothing wrong,” he added.Routch alsotoldthe Charleston Post and Courier this week he did not have a close relationship with Epstein.In May 2020, federal prosecutors obtained subpoenas for credit checks on Routch.A July 2020 email memorializednotesfrom an initial conversation between federal prosecutors and attorneys for Visoski, who was asked about Epstein’s contact with Routch. Visoski did not recall Routch, though he acknowledged having his contact information in his phone, but he named Heil, McNally and Samuel as CBP officers with whom Epstein had some kind ofrelationship. “Some inspectors would delay JE for a while, whereas McNally and Heil wouldn’t give him a hard time,” the notes state.Federal prosecutors went on to subpoena credit reports for Heil, McNally and Samuel. There is no indication in the files that they ever investigated Richards or Martinez.The FBI and federal prosecutors interviewed Visoski about Epstein’s interactions with CBP officers in November 2020. Visoski related Epstein’s practice of making “small talk” with CBP officers during pre-clearance and said he had given “one or two helicopter rides to CBP officers to EPSTEIN’s private island”, according to an FBImemo. Visoski also disclosed that Epstein had asked him to call a CBP officer “approximately 20 times” when he was arriving at STT after the CBP office closed, to ask whether it could remain open to process their plane. The officer “denied their request 80% of the time”, Visoski said.The memo suggests that investigators were investigating CBP’s potential awareness of Epstein’s criminal activity.“Sometimes EPSTEIN would be traveling with a female who had a foreign passport,” it states. “EPSTEIN would argue with CBP that this did not pose a CUSTOMS issue and that it was an immigration issue only … Some passengers on EPSTEIN’s plane were college students with a letter from their college stating their purpose for travel. When questioned by CBP, EPSTEIN would intervene and argue about the fact that the plane had not left United States territory. Sometimes a CBP officer would take the passenger into another room to be interviewed … VISOSKI was not aware of any special benefits or gifts given to any CBP officers. VISOSKI had no knowledge of any CBP officer assisting EPSTEIN in trafficking underage passengers.”Routch was interviewed by the FBI and an agent from the DHS’s inspector general office on 7 April 2021. Thememorandumof the interview provides insight into Epstein’s correspondence with individuals so far removed from his normal, elite circles.Routch disputes much of what is contained in the memo, including the sequence of events that led to the investigation and the number of visits he made to Epstein’s island. He alleged that a CBP officer present during the interview “threaten[ed] me with physical violence” and that he was denied the right to have a union representative present during the interview.Routch “thought it was a good idea to maintain contact with EPSTEIN because of his status, wealth and influence”, according to the memo. He “overly exaggerated” the relationship to others, showing people that he had Epstein’s contact in his phone, especially after his death. “It was an ego boost … because not everyone can say they know a billionaire,” according to the memo. He had not actually been whale watching on Epstein’s helicopter, though he may have lied about having done so to exaggerate the relationship, according to the memo.According to the memo, Routch described ingratiating himself with Epstein through “mak[ing] sure he was being treated with fairness and respect by non-white US CBP personnel”, but said he never offered or received any special favors. Routch, who is white, told investigators that there was a “great deal of racial tension” in the Virgin Islands, and that “the ‘blacks’ disrespect the local white population”, prompting his concern for Epstein’s treatment. He said Epstein wanted to buy new computers for the CBP offices, as well as turkeys for CBP staff, but was told by a supervisor that they could not accept gifts.Routch denied any knowledge or involvement with trafficking underage girls, but said he was aware of Epstein’s criminal conviction and that he assumed that “eastern European women who took commercial flights to the USVI” were heading for Epstein’s island, according to the memo. When he visited the island for lunch in 2013, he claimed to see “three or four ‘nice’, ‘beautiful’ women swimming and having fun” but “did not notice anything unusual nor did he notice anybody who appeared to be in trouble”.“EPSTEIN always had older ladies with him, maybe in their 20s or 30s,” he said.According to the memo, Routch visited Little St James a second time in 2014 or 2015 to inspect some trees Epstein had imported for spider mites.By email, Routch insisted that only one visit occurred. “We had lunch and we discussed trees he was importing,” Routch wrote. Routch suggested that the FBI may have misconstrued a single visit as two; the memo clearly refers to two visits, a few years apart.Routch “was aware of EPSTEIN’s conviction involving the abuse of minors but supported EPSTEIN because he was a good guy”, according to the memo. He said he had also “heard” that Epstein may have been framed by a secretary.Ultimately, he told the FBI, he “stood by EPSTEIN as he would any friend, even though he was, in reality, more of an acquaintance”.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The actor remarked: “Get your ass up out of here, you silly bitch.”Those brief comments appeared to be his first in response to hisarrestat the R Bar in New Orleans’s Marigny section in connection to sworn police allegations that he punched Damnit and a second man while repeatedly insulting both with the word “faggot”.View image in fullscreenShia LaBeouf.Photograph: Orleans parish, Louisiana, sheriff’s office, via Guardian reporting partner WWL LouisianaThe Guardian, which viewed a video showing LaBeouf using the word “faggot” at the time of his arrest, had made multiple attempts to contact the actor and his representatives to respond to the allegations against him. They did not reply or decline comment, so the Guardian approached LaBeouf at aNew Orleanshome address listed for him in the police report generated by his arrest.LaBeouf’s front door was wide open when a Guardian reporter equipped with a press badge, pen and notepad arrived at the address. The actor was speaking with a locksmith. The two men soon walked out, and LaBeouf asked: “What’s up with you?” when he realized the reporter was standing toward the edge of his home’s small front yard.After being given the opportunity to respond to the allegations against him, LaBeouf gestured as if waving the journalist away and said: “Get your ass up out of here, you silly bitch.” He then screamed: “Yeah – I’mShia LaBeouf,” as the reporter complied with his request to leave.Police allege that LaBeouf became increasingly aggressive on the day of his arrest at R Bar, which is a short walk from New Orleans’s renowned French Quarter.Court documents state that LaBeouf tried to punch a bar manager who was trying to escort him out of the business. Once removed, LaBeouf allegedly punched the 49-year-old Damnit – who was helping the bar manager – in his upper body.LaBeouf subsequently returned and punched Nathan Thomas Reed, 34, in the nose, though the latter man had said he did not want to fight, officers alleged in the police report. The police report noted that LaBeouf was alleged to have aimed the word “faggot” at Reed and Damnit repeatedly.Damnit, an actor and frequent New Orleans visitor from Los Angeles, was wearing mascara, eyeshadow and lipstick at the time of his encounter with LaBeouf. Social media pictures show Damnit – whose given last name is Klein – having celebrated Mardi Gras in drag.Reed, meanwhile, says he identifies as queer.Bystanders ultimately held LaBeouf down until police and paramedics arrived, officers reported. He was taken to a hospital, discharged and then booked with two counts of simple battery.After his release from jail, LaBeouf wasseenpartying on Bourbon Street, a lively spot during New Orleans’s Mardi Gras revelry. He had Mardi Gras beads around his neck and danced with his jail release papers in his mouth at one point.LaBeouf has hadseveralpreviousbrushes with the criminal and civil court systems. During a 2017 disorderly conduct arrest in Savannah, Georgia, which led to a court-mandated rehab stint, LaBeouf was recorded accusing police of being racist and saying a Black officer on the scene was going to hell.While being arrested in 2014 over allegations that he disrupted a Broadway show in New York City, LaBeouf wasaccusedof using the homophobic slur “fag” to insult a police officer.Explore more on these topicsShia LaBeoufNew OrleansUS crimeCelebritynewsShareReuse this content"

Four non-native deer species – muntjac, Chinese water deer, fallow and sika – have been introduced into the wild and have thrived. Only two deer species present in England, the red and roe, are native.Overpopulation of deer causes problems for woodland: they eat leaves, buds and sapling stalks, and strip bark from mature trees, which can affect the trees’ health and make them susceptible to disease. Some deer, particularly the sika, rake their antlers against trees, which can kill younger wood.View image in fullscreenOverpopulation of deer affects woodlands as they eat leaves, buds and sapling stalks, and damage young trees with their antlers.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe government’s legally binding environment targets require it to regenerate woodland equivalent to a net increase of 43,000 hectares (106,255 acres), which will be difficult if the deer population continues to expand. Government figures show 33% of English woodlands are now in unfavourable condition due to the impact of deer, up from 24% in the early 2000s.The government has mostly focused on protecting trees with guards and fences rather than tackling the deer population. Now, it is announcing a change of approach. Under the plans, all publicly owned or managed land will have deer management plans within 10 years.National priority areas – where deer are extremely populous and are having a very detrimental impact on woodland – will be identified, with culls targeted there.There will also be a change to the grant system that pays landowners to shoot deer. Under the new scheme, landowners can be paid to shoot deer when the animals move out of wooded areas, making it easier to target a problematic population, said Emma Dear, the principal officer for tree establishment at Natural England.View image in fullscreenThe muntjac deer is listed as an invasive species, and along with the similarly non-native sika and Chinese water deer, deemed to be causing the most damage to woodland.Photograph: FLPA/Rex/ShutterstockShe told the Guardian: “This means we can have timely interventions when ecological damage is likely to be greatest. There is an issue because of the way deer move through the landscape and are not constrained to one patch. The grant system was only facilitated in the woodlands; the new strategy will address that.”Dear added that the lack of natural predators was driving the rise in the deer population across England. Wolves, bears, lynx and other apex predators were hunted to extinction many years ago. Climate breakdown is also a factor.“Deer are changing their behaviour because of warmer winters. They can overwinter in better conditions and the number of babies they have is higher when the winter is warmer,” Dear said.Defra sources said there would be a particular focus on reducing the muntjac population as these were listed as an invasive species, and the agency will assess sika and Chinese water deer to see if these can be added to the invasive species list and urgently targeted. These are the three deer species deemed to be causing the most damage.View image in fullscreenA red deer eats silver birch. ‘Our trees and native wildlife are under huge strain from deer damage,’ said Mary Creagh, the nature minister.Photograph: Mike Unwin/The GuardianThe nature minister, Mary Creagh, said: “Our trees and native wildlife are under huge strain from deer damage, including from non-native deer species. This government is helping landowners and farmers manage deer impacts more effectively so woodlands can flourish and crops are better protected. These new measures will also help restore nature, boost our homegrown timber industry and protect the millions of trees we are planting across the country.”The culled deer may be eaten, with Defra looking at how to market and safely get the meat into the supply chain.Dear said: “There is a section of the strategy that is looking at venison marketing and supporting that industry. Supporting the wild venison sector will hopefully reduce the cost of management.”Explore more on these topicsConservationWildlifeTrees and forestsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The site features a graphic of a ghostly horse galloping above the Earth, and the motto: “Information is power. Reclaim your human right to free expression. Get ready.”Though reports suggest the portal was developed by the state department, the domainappearsto be administered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The DHS also administers Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE).It comes after the Trump administration largelygutteda state department programme called Internet Freedom, which funded grassroots groups worldwide that built technologies to circumvent censorship. Over the past decade, this programme gave more than $500m to digital rights experts – from Myanmar to Iran to Cuba to Venezuela – who built tools used by local populations to access the global internet.Those tools allowed pictures and videos to filter out of Iran during the recent internet shutdown; they are heavily used by journalists and activists worldwide.Freedom.govappears to be an effort to redirect and politicise the Internet Freedom programme, according to sources.A former US official said: “It feels mostly performative. It reads more like a combative policy declaration. USG [US government] disagreements with the EU on free speech are nothing new as a matter of policy. But a portal of this kind takes it a step further, declaring publicly that the USG is concerned with freedom of expression even among our allies in Europe.”Internet Freedom funded tools that are open-source and privacy-preserving – technologies whose code can be audited and that do not expose their users to surveillance. These tools were not designed by US businesses, but by technologists around the world attuned to local censorship regimes.Whilefreedom.govis ostensibly also an “internet freedom” project, it does not propose to preserve privacy – instead, it appears to funnel users into an opaque, central system controlled by a US government agency.“What you’re now talking about is concentrating traffic through a US federal agency organised and kept closed – as opposed to multiple internet freedom, open-source, privacy-preserving projects,” said Andrew Ford Lyons, an independent consultant on digital security and media resilience, who worked on previous US internet freedom projects.The “censorships” that the site purports to counter are not internet shutdowns or broad restrictions on content such as those in place in China and Iran, but European restrictions on hate speech and illegal content such as those in the Digital Services Act, or the UK’s Online Safety Act.“When I worked with journalists in Myanmar or civil society in Afghanistan, I was helping get the right tools to the right people to do whatever they want. This is very specifically to help, like, an angry man in Schöndorf see neo-Nazi tweets from a guy in Arkansas,” said Ford Lyons.“If theTrump administrationis alleging that they’re gonna be bypassing content bans, what they’re gonna be helping users access in Europe is essentially hate speech, pornography, and child sexual abuse material,” said Nina Jankowicz, a former US official and disinformation expert.Jankowicz added it was odd that the site appeared administered by CISA, whose remit before Trump included election infrastructure and foreign disinformation in the US. “The site is in and of itself a propaganda tool,” she said.CISA “is the group that used to make sure secretaries of state were equipped with the tools that they needed to fight foreign disinformation. Now what we’re alleging is that our allies in Europe somehow pose a greater threat to Americans than the national security threats posed by Russia, China.”The Trump administration and US tech companies are in an escalating tussle with the EU over the bloc’s efforts to regulate big tech companies. The European Commission haslaunchedan investigation into X over its propagation of sexualised deepfakes; earlier this month itthreatenedaction against Meta over an apparent breach of its antitrust rules.Meanwhile, in December, the Trump administrationbarredfive Europeans, including the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, from entering the US over their work to regulate hate speech and disinformation.This confrontation was prefigured by US vice-president, JD Vance, in a speech at the Munich Security Conference last year, in which he lambasted Europe for media censorship, contentmoderationand political correctness, saying that free speech was in retreat.“This has been like a crusade of the Trump administration, even before they got into office. This free speech issue is one that they believe plays well with their base,” said Jankowicz.“What they’re able to say is this kind of us-versus-them dichotomy: the US is defending free speech and all of these other countries that are regulating the internet.”A state department spokesperson told Reuters the US government did not have a censorship-circumvention programme specific to Europe but added: “Digital freedom is a priority for the state department, however, and that includes the proliferation of privacy and censorship-circumvention technologies like VPNs.”CISA has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsInternetInternet safetyTrump administrationUS politicsCensorshipnewsShareReuse this content"

That was really fun. I’ve been looking forward to this for a good few weeks. I was really excited to come here. I felt like it was going to happen today, it was just a matter of how fast I could go. It was really hard that last lap, but I am super happy. It’s nice to have a world record and to say about something I am the best to ever do it. That’s really exciting. And I’ve been working at it for a long time.“The last couple of years I have said I have really wanted it. It almost felt a bit weird that it was set on the day I was born, and 24 years later I break it. But I think there’s still more to push.”View image in fullscreenKeely Hodgkinson takes a well-earned rest after her blistering 800m run.Photograph: Sameer Al-Doumy/AFP/Getty ImagesFor Hodgkinson it was a just reward for her perseverance. She had originally intended to break the record in her own event, the Keely Klassic, in Birmingham last February only to tweak her hamstring on the eve of the race.She then had more problems with her hamstring and back after an eight-hour round trip to Windsor Palace to collect an MBE. While she recovered to win a bronze medal at the world championships in Tokyo in September, it was clear that she was not at her best.But she has started the indoor season in superb form, and having gone through halfway in 55.56sec and through 600m in 1:25.06, she held her form enough to break the world indoor record – which WorldAthleticsnow call the short-track record – by 0.88sec.It is another extraordinary addition to her CV that now includes an Olympic gold and silver, as well as two silvers and a bronze at world championships. Hodgkinson will now target one of the few medals she has not won – at the world indoor championships in Torun in Poland next month.Explore more on these topicsKeely HodgkinsonAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

The ISF is part of the newly created Board of Peace which is meant to govern Gaza. TheBoard of Peaceis chaired byDonald Trumpand led in part by his son-in-law Jared Kushner.The plans reviewed by the Guardian call for the phased construction of a military outpost that will eventually have a footprint of 1,400 metres by 1,100 metres, ringed by 26 trailer-mounted armored watch towers, a small arms range, bunkers, and a warehouse for military equipment for operations. The entire base will be encircled with barbed wire.The fortification is planned for an arid stretch of flatlands in southernGazastrewn with saltbush and white broom shrubs, and littered with twisted metal from years of Israeli bombardment. The Guardian has reviewed video of the area. A source close to the planning tells the Guardian that a small group of bidders – international construction companies with experience in war zones – have already been shown the area in a site visit.The Indonesian government hasreportedlyoffered to send up to 8,000 troops.Indonesia’s presidentwas one of four south-east Asian leaders scheduled to attend an inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington DC on Thursday.The UN security council authorized the Board of Peace to establish atemporary International Stabilization Force in Gaza. The ISF, according to the UN, will be tasked with securing Gaza’s border and maintaining peace within the area. It is also supposed to protect civilians, and train and support “vetted Palestinian police forces”.It is unclear what the ISF’s rules of engagement would be if there is combat, renewed bombing byIsrael, or attacks by Hamas. Nor is it clear what role the ISF is meant to play in disarming Hamas, an Israeli condition to proceed with Gaza’s reconstruction.While more than 20 countries have signed up as members of the Board of Peace, much of the worldhas stayed away. Although it was set up with the UN’s approval, the organization’s charter appears to grant Trump permanent leadership and control.Major European allies decline to join first meeting of Trump’s Board of PeaceRead more“The Board of Peace is a kind of legal fiction, nominally with its own international legal personality separate from both the UN and the United States, but in reality it’s just an empty shell for the United States to use as it sees fit,” said Adil Haque, a professor of law at Rutgers University.Expertssaythe funding and governance structures are murky, and several contractors have told the Guardian that conversations with US officials are often conducted on Signal rather than over government email.The military base contracting document was issued by the Board of Peace, according to a person familiar with the process, and prepared with the help of US contracting officials.The plans say there is to be a network of bunkers each 6 metres by 4 metres and 2.5 metres tall, with elaborate ventilation systems where soldiers can go for protection.“The Contractor,” says the document, “shallconduct a geophysical survey of the site to identify any subterranean voids, tunnels, or large cavities per phase.” This provision is likely referencing the large network of tunnels Hamas has built inGaza.One section of the document describes a “Human Remains Protocol”. “If suspected human remains or cultural artifacts are discovered, all work in the immediate area must cease immediately, the area must be secured, and the Contracting Officer must be notified immediately for direction,” it says. The bodies of about 10,000 Palestinians are believed to be buried under the rubble in Gaza,according to Gaza’s civil defense agency.It is unclear who owns the land where the military compound is set to be built, but much of the south Gaza area is currentlyunder Israeli control. The UNestimatesthat at least 1.9 million Palestinians have been displaced during the war.Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and former peace negotiator, called building a military base on Palestinian land without the government’s approval an act of occupation. “Whose permission did they get to build that military base?”Officials from US Central Command referred all questions about the military base to the Board of Peace.ATrump administrationofficial declined to discuss the military base contract: “As the President has said, no US boots will be on the ground.

On screen: a nature documentary.For a quarter of a century, Toni has been the star attraction, drawing tens of thousands of visitors. He is Ukraine’s only gorilla. At 52 – old by western gorilla standards – he needs warm conditions similar to the lowlands of central Africa.In recent weeks, heating Toni’s spacious enclosure has become a logistical headache. The zoo receives only three or four hours of regular electricity a day. Russian strikes havebattered Ukraine’s energy infrastructure,leaving more than half a million people without power. In January, ballistic missiles destroyed a thermal plant on the left bank of the Dnipro River.Like the rest of Kyiv, the zoo has enduredrepeated and prolonged blackoutsduring one of the coldest and longest winters in years. Temperatures have fallen to -22C (-7.6F). Heavy snowfall this week blanketed the city, causing several car crashes and transforming the zoo’s lion enclosure into a surreal, Narnia-like scene.1:44Kyiv zoo resorts to wood-burning stoves to keep animals warm amid energy blackout – videoView image in fullscreenThe lion enclosureView image in fullscreenBactrian camels seem unbothered by the coldView image in fullscreenEuropean bisons in the snowSome of the zoo’s inhabitants are well adapted to the cold. Bison, yaks and camels remain outside, seemingly unbothered by the sub-zero temperatures as they graze across a brilliant white landscape. Others, including Toni, are more vulnerable. He shares a building with tortoises, lizards, a boa constrictor and a ginger cat that dozes by the entrance.To cope, the zoo has installed generators and wood-burning stoves. A large barrel-shaped convection heater, known as a Bullerjan, blows warm air into Toni’s enclosure, keeping it at about 17C. Staff feed the stove with logs gathered from the zoo’s 40-hectare (100 acres) grounds, even during midnight shifts. Additional stoves warm monkeys and exotic birds.View image in fullscreen‘War and a zoo are not compatible at all,’ says Kyrylo Trantin, the zoo’s directorThe zoo’s director, Kyrylo Trantin, said he had studied accounts of how zoos in Berlin and Soviet-era Leningrad struggled to survive the second world war, when most of their animals perished.“We use the same techniques as these zoos did. Already in summer, we started preparations for the coming winter season,” he said.“It’s a difficult situation. War and a zoo are not compatible at all. But we are doing everything we can to ensure that for the animals in our zoo, the war stays outside the fence. People work around the clock. At night, they maintain the temperature. We have 20-40 employees constantly on duty, including keepers and electricians.”View image in fullscreenA lizard in the terrariumView image in fullscreenTortoises bask in the heatEuropean zoos had donated 40 tonnes of dried food, while well-wishers had bought tickets online. The zoo has installed solar panels and a new ventilation system for the flamingos that uses less diesel to run than a conventional generator. “It’s been extremely cold for a month and a half. We’ve survived. But it’s been tough,” Trantin said.As well as maintaining critical facilities, the zoo has to deal with frequent Russian attacks. Lukyanivka, one of Kyiv’s most targeted districts, is nearby. An explosion recently shattered panels in the terrarium next to Toni’s quarters. Flying shards hit a crocodile and turtle, while a muntjac deer sustained a broken jaw. Damaged sections were patched with plywood.View image in fullscreenA nearby residential building damaged by a Russian airstrike“We managed to save the animals. They were injured but not severely. The main problem for us is when something is shot down above us, or there is a blast wave. Half of the zoo’s glass is already gone,” Trantin said.“It only takes three or four hours for a room to cool down. We cannot allow that to happen. In general, we are hanging on by our teeth. Now the task is to ensure that when there is shelling, when the air raid alarm sounds, there are always employees nearby. Because we also have a small amount of time to prevent stressful situations.”View image in fullscreenFood is cooked for animals on an old-fashioned stove during blackoutsView image in fullscreenFood for the zoo’s 3,000 animals is cooked in a wood-burning stove during blackouts. The kitchen manager, Olha Yanchuk, laid out Toni’s lunch: quail and chicken eggs, fresh fruit and several litres of juice. She said preparation carried on as normal: “We are used to these conditions. If there is no power our electric cooker won’t function, so we rely on an old-fashioned stove.”The zoo still attracts half a million visitors a year, including children evacuated from frontline areas and Ukrainian soldiers released from Russian jails who visit as part of rehabilitation programmes.“We have got used to power cuts. Ukrainians are strong people,” said Daria, visiting with her son Valentyn, as they stood before the gorilla enclosure.View image in fullscreenAwestruck visitors admire the zoo’s inhabitantsOne longtime employee, Ihor Oliynyk, showed off the snow-covered island used in summer by the zoo’s ring-tailed lemurs. Nearby, ducks and geese had gathered next to a small ice-fringed pond.“Were it not for the war, this winter would have been wonderful. It’s beautiful outside,” he said. “It’s been a long time since we have had a winter this cold and this bright, with sun and blue sky.”Explore more on these topicsKyivRussiaUkraineEuropeZoosConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was a consummate power broker, someone who controlled the careers of prominent musicians, actors and athletes through the talent agency named after him, cultivated relationships in local and national politics, raised money for key election contests, endowed civic buildings and, through his family wealth, gave lavishly to social causes.When Los Angeles hosted theSuper Bowl in 2022,Wasserman chaired the host committee, and his client Kendrick Lamar featured prominently in the half-time show’s all-star lineup. At the annual Coachella music festival, in the desert east of LA, his clients have become so dominant that, this year, they are set to outnumber the nearest competition bymore than two to one.LA mayor calls for Casey Wasserman to step down as Olympics chair over Epstein tiesRead moreWhen Wasserman celebrated his 50th birthday, in 2024, the Democratic party luminaries who flew in for the party and rubbed shoulders with Hollywood industry executives and sports, film and television stars included former president Bill Clinton, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom.All that influence and glamour is now in question, after the revelation of a 23-year-old,graphically sexualemail exchange between Wasserman, who was married at the time, and Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein’s closest friend and partner in crime now serving a life sentence for child sex trafficking and other offenses. Wasserman previously acknowledged that he and his wife flew on Epstein’s private plane on a humanitarian mission to Africa in 2002.Since the beginning of the month, several of Wasserman clients, including the pop starChappell RoanandAbby Wambach, the former US soccer player, announced that they were cutting ties with him. “We are tired of learning, over and over, that men who control access, resources, money and so-called safety in our industry are given endless grace,” one of the first to leave, Bethany Cosentino of the band Best Coast, said in astatement. “We are tired of being asked to treat proximity to something horrific as an unfortunate situation we should simply move past – especially when the person involved still holds all the power.”Wasserman sought to limit the damage with a statement of his own, in which he said hedeeply regrettedhis correspondence with Maxwell but that it occurred years before her crimes came to light. He also said he had never had a “personal or business relationship” with Epstein.That did little to turn the tide, however. With the exodus from his agency threatening to become a stampede, Wasserman announced last Friday that he was stepping aside and putting the agency up for sale. For now, he remains in charge of LA28, the organizing committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, but Los Angeles’s mayor, Karen Bass, and one-third of the city council are calling for him tostep down.“Shouldn’t it be a bare minimum expectation that you don’t have a leader [of the Olympic committee] who is associated with an international sex-trafficking ring?” LA city council member Monica Rodriguez asked in an interview. “We have an obligation and a duty to protect these athletes and uphold the integrity of the games.”Wasserman has not himself been accused of any association with sex trafficking. In his 31 January statement, he underlined that his correspondence with Maxwell occurred long before public knowledge of what he called her “horrific crimes”. He said of Maxwell and Epstein: “I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.”The fall from grace has been astonishingly rapid for a man who seemed to enjoy boundless resources, connections and good fortune. Wasserman’s grandfather was the formidableLew Wasserman, who also started out as a talent agent and ended his career with his name emblazoned on the executive building at Universal Studios, which his agency bought and ran for close to 30 years.The elder Wasserman had been instrumental in ending the old studio system and in negotiating lucrative single-picture deals for his actor clients, who included James Stewart and Marilyn Monroe. With the help of Ronald Reagan, then the head of the Screen Actors Guild, Wassermanbroke the firewallthat previously prevented talent agents from producing films and television, and in exchange helped launch Reagan’s political career.Casey was a favorite of his grandfather’s and for years had a regular weekend breakfast date with him at Nate and Al’s, a well-known Jewish deli in Beverly Hills. He used family money to help establish his sports agency and leaned on his fortune again to acquire Paradigm, a music agency, in 2021, and Brillstein Entertainment, which represents A-list actors including Brad Pitt and Florence Pugh, in 2023.It was Lew Wasserman who introduced him to the Clintons, among many other political connections, and it was Clinton Foundation business that led Wasserman and his wife to join Bill Clinton, Epstein and Maxwell – along with corporate executives and Hollywood celebrities – on Epstein’s plane in 2002.The files released by the justice department do not indicate any one-on-one contact between Wasserman and Epstein other than the plane rides to Africa and two FedEx packages sent shortly after the Africa trip. Paperwork on the packages, oneaddressed to Wassermanat his business address and the otherto his wife, lists both Epstein and Maxwell as the senders. There appears to be no correspondence sent directly to Epstein, and no communications between Wasserman and Maxwell after 2003.LA28’s board, a high-profile group including former labor secretary Elaine Chao and top Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, hired a law firm, O’Melveny & Myers, to conduct an investigation and concluded that Wasserman’s relationship with Epstein and Maxwell “did not go beyond what has already been publicly documented”.The board added: “[We have] determined that based on these facts, as well as the strong leadership he has exhibited over the past ten years, Mr Wasserman should continue to lead LA28 and deliver a safe and successful Games.”That, however, has not satisfied Wasserman’s critics, who say the known record is already damning enough – even leaving aside questions of what else might be in the millions of Epstein files that the justice department has yet to make public.They also question how Wasserman can be too compromised to stay on at his agency but still retain the credibility to continue to lead the Olympics.“Why should he have a different response in his private capacity to the one in his public capacity?” Rodriguez, the city council member, said. “We don’t know what we don’t know, but we know enough.”The critics have also questioned the reliability of the investigation that LA28 commissioned and paid for but has not made public. “I don’t know if people know this,” said John Manly, a lawyer who has represented high-profile sexual-abuse victims including Simone Biles and other US gymnasts, “but attorneys rarely find their own clients guilty. They act like this investigation is independent and it’s not.”Wasserman said through a spokesperson that he had nothing to add to his 31 January statement. Neither LA28 nor O’Melveny & Myers responded to a request for comment.Even before the Epstein revelations, Wasserman’s management of the Olympics had attracted criticism from city officials and public watchdogs, and that has added to the pressure on him to go. Despite concern about cost overruns – an abiding feature of all recent Olympic Games – and the possible impact on city finances, LA28blew through a deadlinelast October to define how much Los Angeles can expect to be reimbursed for extraordinary spending incurred while hosting the Games. (City officials say negotiations arecontinuing.)More recently, it blew through another deadline to publish ahuman rights planto protect vulnerable groups – everyone from athletes at risk of sexual abuse to unhoused Angelenos – during the Games. LA28 told a reporter for a local radio station that it had fulfilled its “obligation to the city” but the plan is still not public. City council members have expressed concern, too, that LA28 might try tocircumventLA’s standard contracting procedures and offer a fast track to vendors it prefers. LA28 did not respond to an invitation to comment.One of the reasons that LA28’s board members gave for continuing to support Wasserman, according to reporting in the Los Angeles Times, is that they saw him as essential to corporate sponsorships the Games can’t afford to lose. He was, they said, simply “too big to fail”.To which a strikingly blunt Rodriguez responded: “That’s a bunch of horseshit … We’re the damned city ofLos Angeles. We have major international companies with leaders who are well respected and just as qualified [as Wasserman]. We have plenty of talent to draw on.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinLA Olympic Games 2028Ghislaine MaxwellTelevisionLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The city’s bus station, the largest in Europe when it opened in 1969, is a brutalist masterpiece. Next month, a new public building opens opposite the bus station built with similar aspirations to transform local lives: a youth centre.To a generation raised whencuts had gutted services– between 2010-11 and 2023-24,local government spending on youth services fell by 73%andmore than 1,000 youth centres closed– the idea of a place designed just for young people may seem as anachronistic as coach travel, but 2026 brings big changes to youth services in the UK.View image in fullscreenHaçienda heritage … Vault Youth Zone in Preston.Photograph: Gareth GardnerThe government’sYouth Matters strategy, launched in December 2025, is the first national youth strategy in 15 years. It promised £500m investment over a decade to rebuild the service with a priority of creating 50 Young Futures (YF) hubs, with eight pilot schemes in Nottingham, Manchester, Birmingham, Brighton and Hove, Bristol, Leeds, Tower Hamlets in London and Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.It’s hoped that YF hubs will provide integrated support for mental health and employment skills in one place, room for sports and arts activities and a digital and physical safe space where young people “feel like they belong”. It’s a utopian check list that forces the question: what will these specialist places for young people look like?ForJohn Puttick, the architect behindPreston’s Youth Zone(now called Vault, a name chosen by local people), that space has to be something that young people are proud of. Puttick hasn’t worked on the YF hubs, but his practice has created community buildings throughout the UK, including youth centres in Grimsby and Blackburn with another slated for Thurrock. He works with the charityOnSidewhich creates centres for people between eight and 18 years old (or up to 25 with additional needs), in economically disadvantaged areas.“In Preston, we wanted the Vault to feel like a new civic presence, prominent, something that young people identify with. We spent a long time thinking about how to make the building playful and welcoming, but aspirational,” says Puttick.Externally this means yellow and black columns under a folded concrete facade, which mirrors the lauded bus station. Inside, Vault feelsswaggeringly aspirational.A double-height, open-plan central space houses a cafe and a gaming area with clear sightlines to a football pitch, kitchen, music rooms, climbing wall and sports hall – fostering a sense of community and flooding the space with as much natural light as Preston has to offer in February.View image in fullscreenSwaggeringly aspirational. … indoor football pitch at the Vault Youth Zone.Photograph: Gareth GardnerAnd if the interiors zoned by colour, columns and diagonal striped fittings bring a flicker of nostalgia to some of the parents and grandparents dropping off their children, there’s a reason: the scheme was created byBen Kelly, designer of Manchester’s fabled Haçienda nightclub. It’s not such an archaic reference as you might think. Preston’s younger people are familiar with Kelly thanks to the late fashion designerVirgil Abloh’s fascination with Factory Records.Emma Warren, author of the 2025 bookUp the Youth Club, a history of UK youth services, says that the UK has periodically bestowed beautiful buildings on the young. While the philanthropic desire to help young people goes back centuries, the 1960Albemarle reportfounded the modern understanding of youth provision, leading to the construction of 300 purpose-built centres between 1960 and 1968.View image in fullscreenYesterday’s utopia … exterior of theAbbey Wood estate youth club in Woolwich, London.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesFor an idea of how these places transformed lives, Warren recommends watching the beautiful short film about Lewisham’sGrove Park Youth Club, which was created by the London county council architecture team underSir Hubert Bennett(and a team also responsible for the Hayward Gallery, Queen Elizabeth Hall and Crystal Palace National Recreation Centre).Of course, the cultural landscape now is very different from these halcyon days. Warren says thatrecent researchfound that half of the UK’s young people spend most of their free time in their room.“People talk about youth workers getting kids off the streets, but it strikes me that a lot of youth work now is about getting kids out of their bedrooms,” she says. “Parents need to understand that having their young people isolated from their peers is deeply unsafe.”Larry Botchway is the co-founding director of the award-winning design practicePOoR Collective, which focuses on architecture and education for young people. He says: “Safe, free places outside the home are essential for connection and growth. Dedicated spaces show that young people are valued members of the community, not a problem to be managed.”While buildings like Preston’s Vault give a powerful signal, not every community has the finance or land to create such impressive monuments for the next generation. That isn’t always a negative thing. Tower Hamlets in London is one of the areas picked as a pilot for the new youth strategy.View image in fullscreenSafe space … participants at the Tower Hamlets girls’ youth centre.Like the others, it was chosen due to high measures of antisocial behaviour and knife crime. But Tower Hamlets was focused on the needs of its young population before the government’s intervention. The borough has the youngestmedian age of any area in the country, with one in two children living in low-income families – and the council has been working to open a youth space in every ward over the last two years. After discovering that users of the centre were 70% male, theyopened a girls-only clublast month as a priority.The girls’ centre is simple – a suite of rooms in a modern high-street community centre – but local girls made all the decisions here. Through a survey, they chose how it was furnished, what activities are on offer and even the centre’s name. On opening night in January, the centre had the pastel colour scheme they asked for and a sofa with cushions and fairy lights in a gaming area.Some of the girls get selfies with Lutfur Rahman, the executive mayor, as he tours the facility to officially open the club – bringing with him an enormous celebration cake decorated with the logo for Young Tower Hamlets. Rahmansays that this is the only time he’ll be allowed in.Fourteen-year-old Amaira Katyal, deputy young mayor of Tower Hamlets, took the survey which informed the youth club’s design and said she had a real throwback moment when she walked into the centre. “I remember filling out the form in June last year and now it’s finally come true. Spaces for young women have been overlooked, and it feels amazing to have this place where they can come and just be.”The idea of safe spaces for young people comes up constantly in reports and conversation. Maium Talukdar, who is deputy mayor of Tower Hamlets and lead cabinet member for education, youth and lifelong learning, says that is because it’s a recurring request from young people.View image in fullscreenCritically needed … 68 Erith Hub community centre in Greater London.Photograph: Jim Stephenson“But a safe space means very different things to different people,” says Warren. “An example I talk about in my book is the 1970s group theLondon Gay Teenage Group. They used to hang out with and feel protected by some ferocious punks; that felt safe to them. I think to adults or some institutional actors, safe is often conflated with safeguarding. That has its role, but it also has limits. My guess is safety is somewhere where you’re well supported, where you feel less anxious, and where you might even have a laugh.”Caspar Rodgers is director ofAlma-Nacarchitects, the studio behind 68 Erith Hub, a new community centre in Greater London. Rodgers’ concern with the government’s policy is the expectation that spaces promote social outcomes.“Design can make community spaces more likely to be adopted, but it can’t solve issues on its own. The YF hubs have the potential to be critically needed additions to their communities. On first read, they sound like highly managed provisions which, while potentially brilliant, does tie success to the quality and funding of its management. I hope the designs focus equally on creating great places for young people to simply spend time together as much as on their agenda of crime reduction and volunteering opportunities.”For some areas, any provision will be an improvement. Puttick’s next youth centre is in Tilbury, Essex, where he grew up. “There’s basically nothing to do there, it’s a very tough environment; delivering a building there will make a huge difference.”Of the six people interviewed for this feature, at least four attended youth centres as kids and have continued to support that system as grownups.Warren not only attended a club as a kid but is a volunteer youth worker now. She thinks these experiences do make a difference. “I imagine a lot of people with structural power didn’t go to a youth club because their parents paid for their leisure activities. They missed out on those connective effects – and on all the jokes.”Mayor Rahman is someone who is in on the joke. In his short speech before handing the new centre over to the young women of Tower Hamlets he describes his experience.“I grew up round here in an overcrowded household with no space to do my homework, so I’d go to a youth centre. It helped me so much – I worked hard but I got to spend time with my friends and play at the same time.” He looks admiringly down at the vast sheet cake in front of him. “We, though, never had this kind of big cake.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Hands up if your favourite way to spend a Sunday afternoon is tackling a mountain of ironing? No takers? Shocking. Faced with crumpled cottons and crinkled collars, there won’t be many who approach the ironing board with anything resembling excitement – and if you do, honestly, what’s wrong with you?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I am certainly no fan of ironing. In fact, I’d be happy with a wardrobe full ofeverything“stretch”. But when my children were in school uniforms, I faced a daunting pile of creased clothing every week – and found the only way through it was to arm myself with the right tools.You want an iron that glides smoothly across garments, without the risk of scorching or leaving any limescale marks. I also swear by a decent ironing board – one that’s sturdy, height-adjustable and comes with a quality cover and padding is, frankly, essential (look out for my upcoming test of the best).Stick with me as I reveal the best irons from my testing – models that will see you speed through those sheets and shirts in no time at all.At a glanceBest iron overall:Breville DiamondXpress VIN401£39.99 at AmazonBest cordless iron:Tefal Freemove Power£79.99 at John LewisBest iron for storage:Russell Hobbs Easy Store Pro Plug & Wind£37 at John LewisBest workhorse iron:Tefal Ultimate Pure£84.99 at ArgosWhy you should trust meYou might have gathered by now that ironing isn’t my favourite sport – but it’s definitely one where I’ve put in a lot of hours. Ironing two uniforms, five days a week, for 12 years means I have ironed literally thousands of shirts.These days, the pile is smaller, but the stakes are higher: when you’re ironing your nicest threads (or the young people’s best drip), the last thing you want is one scorch mark or a rogue water droplet to ruin your finery. I also use my iron to flatten fabrics for dressmaking.How I testedView image in fullscreenPressing matter: our test subjects, ready for ironing.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianI selected nine irons from leading brands to test, and started by considering their size, weight and ergonomics in my hand while I used them, noting comfort and efficiency.Each iron was used to cut through the crinkles on items including bedsheets, tea towels and cotton shirts, the latter to see how it handled collars and manoeuvred around buttons. I also ironed a silk sari, to see how each model fared on delicate fabrics – and, while I would never normally iron jeans, I did for this test to see how the irons coped with heavier fabrics.As well as evaluating performance and features, I used a power meter to measure the maximum wattage as each iron was heating up to gauge how much electricity it was using. I also timed how long the irons took to reach their top temperature, looking out for any that were especially fast or slow.I tested all of the models on a height-adjustableBrabantia ironing board Dwith aPerfectFlow cover, which I recommend because it doesn’t become soggy from steam, thanks to three layers of padding, including Fairtrade, unbleached cotton.After testing, all the irons that weren’t collected by manufacturers were donated toFurnishing Futures, a charity that creates fully furnished homes for women and children who have survived domestic abuse.The best irons in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Features actual crushed diamonds for improved durability and glide’: the Breville DiamondXpress VIN401.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianBest iron overall:Breville DiamondXpress VIN401BrevilleDiamondXpress VIN401from£39.99£49.99 at Currys£39.99 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat ironing performance; bargain if you shop aroundWhat we don’t loveThe blingy diamond theme and rose gold finishPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£49.99 at Currys£39.99 at AmazonYou’ll either love or loathe the rose gold finish of Breville’s iron – personally, I’m not a fan – but what you won’t be able to dispute is its performance, especially if you find it for less than the RRP. I picked it up online for less than £40.Fans of a bit of bling will love that the ceramic soleplate of this model features actual crushed diamonds for improved durability and glide.Why we love itThis iron impressed with its excellent performance, and strong and constant flow of steam. A wide soleplate makes quick work of large, flat areas of clothing, while the narrow nose lets you easily reach into folds and around buttons.The iron heated up in just 40 seconds, and did a great job of ironing even the silk sari, to which it didn’t stick, nor did it cause the fabric to wrinkle.I also liked the “safe store” strip on the side, near the soleplate, which indicates when the iron is cool enough to put away.It’s a shame that …the crystals on the temperature dial are OK, but in my opinion, the pictures of diamonds on the side of the iron (that’s the grey and white pattern) look naff. Also, while you can loop the cord around the heel for storage, there’s no clip to hold it in place.Cordless or corded?CordedTank capacity:400mlWeight in the hand:1.29kgSteam output:70g/minSteam shot:200g/minPeak power use on test:2.9kWBrevilleDiamondXpress VIN401from£39.99£49.99 at Currys£39.99 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat ironing performance; bargain if you shop aroundWhat we don’t loveThe blingy diamond theme and rose gold finishBest cordless iron:Tefal Freemove PowerTefalFreemove powerfrom£79.99£79.99 at Tefal£79.99 at John LewisWhat we loveGreat cordless performance; ergonomic charging baseWhat we don’t loveIt can’t sit back on its heel like most ironsPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£79.99 at Tefal£79.99 at John LewisTefal’s Freemove Power is a cordless model that works brilliantly: it recharges each time you place it down on the dock to adjust a garment on your board.A clip over the nose holds the iron on to the base for carrying and storage, much like a steam generator iron.Why we love itThe iron is light in the hand and, from an ergonomic standpoint, works flawlessly; placing the iron back down on to its base in between bouts of ironing felt effortless. The other cordless iron I tested, the Tower Ceraglide 360, didn’t feel so natural in use.It’s quick to iron and to recharge. The iron heated up in just 20 seconds, and when it’s on the dock, it has a light to clearly indicate when it’s up to temperature.I liked the traditional controls with a temperature dial. The Freemove Power ironed all my test clothing really well, even the silk sari.On top of a two-year guarantee, Tefal irons also come with a promise of 15-year repairability with low-cost parts.It’s a shame that …it can’t sit back on its heel like most irons, although this is only an issue if you like to fill your iron using a jug.

The advantage of this is that you can make your way through your ironing pile in any order, rather than tackling clothes in order of heat setting required.Why we love itThe temperature dial is replaced with a large, circular light that’s illuminated red. It would have been helpful to see this turn green once the iron was ready to use, but I saw great results with my clothes, and it’s great value, too. Register your purchase for a three-year guarantee.Most irons feature an indent at the base, around which you wrap the power cable for storage. The Russell Hobbs goes one further by providing a space to stow the plug, so you can store your iron tidily. This is despite being no bigger than rivals.It’s a shame that …you have to push the steam button very hard to get a steam shot.Cordless or corded?CordedTank capacity:320mlWeight in the hand:1.14kgSteam output:50g/minSteam shot:200g/minPeak power use on test:2.3kWRussell HobbsEasy Store Pro Plug & Windfrom£37£37 at John Lewis£38 at ArgosWhy we love itGood value and good cable storageWhy we don’t love itThe steam shot button needs a really strong pushBest workhorse iron:Tefal Ultimate PureTefalUltimate Purefrom£84.99£84.99 at Argos£84.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIncredibly powerful steam; great performanceWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive, and it’s the heaviest iron hereNo cats harmed during testing: please note that the iron was off when this picture was taken.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£84.99 at Argos£84.99 at AmazonTefal’s Ultimate Pure iron is pricey but powerful. If your weekly basket of washed clothing is more mountain than pile, the Tefal’s strong, constant flow of steam and steam shot will make light work of it.It performed well on all fabrics, and it was the very best on test when it came to the silk sari: the fabric could become stuck as a result of moisture on the soleplates of some irons, causing wrinkles, but the Tefal Ultimate Pure pressed the long length of cloth beautifully.Why we love itThe steam function here is impressively powerful, with even hard creases ironing out easily. The iron also comes with a heavy-duty anti-calc filter that keeps scale out of the steam. Simply remove the filter from the heel and rinse it out before reinserting. It’s more like a steam generator iron than a standard one. In fact, if you’re still deliberating over which of the two to choose, the Tefal Ultimate Pure might be the one for you.It comes with a two-year guarantee, plus a promise of 15-year repairability with low-cost parts. It seems pricey at RRP, but there are deals to be found online.

In its cordless form, it sits on its heel on a round base to charge, much like a kettle. You simply slide a bar across to lock it to the base for corded use.The iron heated up fairly quickly, in 1min 40secs, and I was a fan of the traditional controls and its black and goldDuracell-style finish. The steam and spray function worked well, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …that 360-degree charging base is insanely annoying. You have to tip back the iron to place its heel on the charging base, and putting down the iron on to the base at that angle just doesn’t come naturally. I would buy this iron for its light weight and good value, but use it corded most of the time.Cordless or corded?Both;tank capacity:370ml;weight in the hand:0.93kg cordless, 1.03kg corded;steam output:35g/min;steam shot:170g/min;peak power use on test:2.7kWTowerCeraglide 360 Cord Cordless steam ironfrom£27.99£29.99 at Tower£27.99 at AmazonWhat we loveYou can use it corded or cordlessWhat we don’t loveThe round charging base is annoying every time you dockPhilips Azur 8000PhilipsAzur 8000from£79£79 at John Lewis£79 at AmazonWhat we loveThe single setting means you can iron in any orderWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive – I didn’t think it was worth the price£79 at John Lewis£79 at AmazonBest for:smart setting steamThe Philips is pricey, but a bit of a workhorse.

To choose the temperature setting, you turn the black band (below the steam buttons) on the handle left or right to select one, two, three dots or max. The digital display will indicate the one chosen.But I wanted to be able to simply swipe left or right on that band – or at the very least jog it with my thumb – to change settings. Instead, the only way to move it was a firm grip with thumb and index finger.It didn’t make the final cut because …the controls proved annoying, the cable was short (1.9 metres, where many irons have 3 metres), and the plug was bulky – it’s a European plug inside an adaptor.Also, while you can loop the cable around the base to store the Polti, there’s no clip to hold it in place, so it will unravel.Cordless or corded?Corded;tank capacity:350ml;weight in the hand:1.36kg;steam output:40g/min;steam shot:250g/min;peak power use on test:2.3kWPoltiVaporella Quick & Slide QS220from£78.70£99 at Debenhams£78.70 at AmazonWhat we lovePerformance is OK; good steam shotWhat we don’t loveThe controls are annoying and the cable’s too shortMorphy Richards Power Steam EliteMorphy Richardsfrom£44.99£44.99 at Robert Dyas£49.99 at Morphy RichardsWhat we loveInteresting digital controls: tap to cycle through settingsWhat we don’t loveThe icons for those temperature settings are hard to see£44.99 at Robert Dyas£49.99 at Morphy RichardsBest for:an attractive displayIroning performance here was good, but not great. The cord is a decent length at three metres and stores well. I liked the Power Steam Elite’s looks, but found the controls bothersome.There are six light-up icons on the iron’s body: they’re positioned beneath the handle when you look down on to the iron. These display the power setting, presented as dots, and the type of fabric.But their position makes them difficult to see. And because they’re lights, not buttons, you have to tap a button on the handle and cycle through the temperature settings. Seasoned ironers will start at the bottom and go up, but if you do need to go down a setting, then you’ll need to press the button five times and shift your head to see the lights to check you’ve got it right.It didn’t make the final cut because …the controls were too annoying.Cordless or corded?Corded;tank capacity:450ml;weight in the hand:1.09kg;steam output:35g/min;steam shot:170g/min;peak power use on test:2.8kWMorphy Richardsfrom£44.99£44.99 at Robert Dyas£49.99 at Morphy RichardsWhat we loveInteresting digital controls: tap to cycle through settingsWhat we don’t loveThe icons for those temperature settings are hard to seeWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenA good ironing board is essential if you iron regularly.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianShould I register my new iron?Many of these irons provide an extra year’s guarantee (so one year becomes two, or two becomes three) if you register the product online. So, yes, it’s worth registering.CordedvscordlessironsCordless models are certainly convenient for a host of reasons – freedom of movement, no tangles, easy storage – but not at the expense of performance. I tested one excellent cordless model and one convertible that I frankly preferred when corded.Does the ironing board matter?If you iron rarely, a small board, or even a towel on a table, will do. But if you do lots of ironing, get a good ironing board that doesn’t become soggy when you use the steam shot. Mine is height-adjustable, too: being able to sit down while ironing is a gamechanger.Are steam generator irons worth it?Steam generators (an iron on a big base) often produce twice as much steam, making quick work of ironing. One of the main reasons for their appeal is the large water reservoir – holding litres, not millilitres – which means you won’t need to refill them often. Great if you have a mountain to get through. Look out for tests of steam generators and ironing boards in the coming months.How much does it cost to do the ironing?The maximum power use of the irons in this test ranged from 2.3 to 3.9kW. Electricity costs are in kilowatt hours (kWh), so if you’re using a 2.8kW iron for half an hour, it will use 1.4kWh. The energy price cap introduced on 1 January 2026 is 27.69p a kWh. Multiply this by the last figure, and you’ll discover it costs 39p to use a typical iron for half an hour.This is, of course, the maximum it costs, based on an iron’s peak power rating. In practice, it may cost less, as the iron uses less energy when it’s up to temperature. So half an hour of non-stop steam ironing costs 39p; half an hour where it’s sitting on its heel half the time and you don’t use much steam will cost less.Do I need to use water?No. While steam and water sprays can help with stubborn creases, all of the irons here can be used dry. Without water, they’ll weigh less in the hand, too.Do I need to use distilled water?No – all these irons are designed to work with tap water. If you’re in a hard-water area, then the iron’s anti-calc filter will collect any limescale in the water you add. Remove it periodically by using the self-clean function so the iron doesn’t deposit white powder on your clothes.Beyond that, read the instructions that come with your model of choice. Some suggest distilled, deionised or demineralised water as a good alternative to hard water. For example, the water from adehumidifieris distilled and limescale-free.

It was hidden, long term and denied until discovery.I divorced him but that was delayed and I had to live with him for a further two years. I spent ayear alone in my new house with my now adult sons. Now I am a little over a year into a new relationship and suddenly panicking about it. I’m scared to go forward. I’m not sure I can commit to long term again, and if I see him looking at other women (we work together in a predominantly female workplace), I panic! I’m older than him by nine years and I feel like I want to end things to prevent getting hurt. But then I feel I’m being cowardly. How can Istop going down this road in my head?Eleanor says:On behalf of everyone everywhere, let me say: what a schmuck thing for your husband to do. That is such a big betrayal. And the cruelty you’re living through now is that as well as teaching you to be mistrustful of others, betrayal on that magnitude teaches you to be unsure of yourself.If I misread things once …Hurt like that teaches us all too acutely about the costs of trusting people who don’t deserve that trust. It’s totally reasonable to prioritise avoiding hurt for a while. But in that self-protective aftermath, it can be easy to mistake isolation for safety. That’s what the panic tells us, anyway; cut it off, head back, smaller circle, lick the wounds.I’m finding it difficult to live up to my morals. How do I know when it’s OK to compromise?Read moreIn fact, retreat isn’t safe. It just keeps you safe from one specific kind of loss. Retreat and avoidance are not cost-free. Day after day of vigilance, of declining possible connections – what does it add up to? A life without betrayal, sure, but also a life with fewer loving connections. A life without ease.Backing away means there’s no one moment of acute hurt, but it’s a cost all the same; the steady accumulation of ways to make our world smaller. Taking the worst of the past as a guide for the future means we find less in that future to counterbalance the past.Your situation isn’t about trying to talk yourself into taking risks when safety is on offer. It’s a choice between two kinds of risk: is it worth missing out on a good relationship to guarantee not being hurt by a bad one? Could knowing that give you something to say back to the panic, when it tries to boss you around? The panic might say, yes! Keep me safe! And I know it can feel like it has a point; because it feels like another betrayal would be completely unbearable. Like stomping on a broken bone. But in fact, you know something from what you’ve been through: you know it didn’t destroy you. You know you can go through one of the worst things you thought could happen, have everything you thought you knew dissolve and then keep going. You weren’t finished.You might be hardier for this; you’ve met and spent a lot of time with the part of yourself that survives other people’s rejection and neglect.One last thing to tell the panic is that it can become self-fulfilling. Doubting people, scrutinising them and withdrawing can create the very distance and mind-change we’re so scrupulously scouring for evidence of. Just like urgently saying “trust me” isn’t a very good way to produce trust, urgently acting from a fearful need for reassurance isn’t a very good way to get it. One way you get relationships of ease and trust is by leading with the parts of you that aren’t your fear; because fear can obscure the best of you. You could remind the panic that in trying so hard to keep you from loss, it risks creating it.Fear can long outlast the need for vigilance, but you don’t face a choice between safety and threat. It’s a choice between which kind of loss you’d rather risk.This letter has been edited for length and clarityAsk Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleLeading questionsRelationshipsDivorceHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Five expert tips for making life-changing decisionsMaking choices can be difficult when options are not clearly better or worse than each other – how does one even begin to decide?Adrienne MateiThu 19 Feb 2026 12.21 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 15.34 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleI love cats. I’d been idly keeping an eye out for a less allergenic breed, when bam – a kitten became available. Suddenly I had to decide whether to take the leap.Even though I’d been considering cat ownership for a while, I felt anxious. I mulled over all the responsibilities: vet bills, stubborn allergies, years of commitment. One big sticking point was travel. Having a cat would be rewarding, but did I want it right now if it meant I couldn’t decide on a whim to book a cheap last minute flight to another city? Did I want to buy Fancy Feast, or stay fancy-free?Making choices can be difficult when the options are not clearly better or worse than each other, said contemporary philosopher Ruth Chang in a2014 Ted Talk. For example, should you take an exciting promotion that will consume your weekends? Should youhave a child, which would reshape your identity and daily life, or remainchildfreeand preserve your autonomy?How to start … anything: expert tips for trying something newRead moreSuch options have different kinds of value but at similar levels, defying pro-and-con reasoning, according to Chang. How does one even begin to decide? Here’s what experts say.Your emotions are valid data points“In decision sciences, we have the ‘rational’ decision-making approach – the one where people traditionally weigh up the pros and cons,” and compute the optimum results, says Julie Gore, a professor of organizational psychology at Birkbeck University.“The rational model is pervasive in economics, management theory, medicine, in all walks of professional life, but it’s limited because it doesn’t really explain everything in human behavior,” she says. No decision maker has perfect objectivity, and emotions can interfere with rationality in ways one may not even notice. Gore says: We can’t expect to be coldly rational when making decisions, but should rather incorporate our own feelings and “intuitive expertise”.We should “identify our emotions and acknowledge the role that they play in a decision”, says Anne-Laure Le Cunff, a neuroscientist and author of Tiny Experiments. Probe your own motivations ruthlessly, Le Cunff says: “Am I making this decision because I am seeking validation from my peers? Is it because I want to make sure my parents are happy?” Feelings are a useful data point, just like any other factor.There’s one simple way to figure out how you feel about two options. Le Cunff recommends flipping a coin to find out what you catch yourself wishing for.Try (mental) time travelWhat if we’re not sure how we feel? Try imagining yourself in the future, in a practice called future self-continuity. Studies show this can help us behave moreethically, develophealthierbehaviors and behappierwith life over time.For my kitten dilemma, I might consider how life will look different 10 weeks, 10 months or 10 years from now. How do I feel when I picture myself with a cat – does that version of me feel aligned with my intuitive sense of a good life?Gen Z in the US: how are you feeling about your finances?Read moreLe Cunff calls her version of this a “consequence cascade”. Visualize the potential impacts of a decision and ask yourself, so what? “I am going to lose my current level of freedom – so what? Am I willing to accept this consequence or not?” she says. If you still can’t decide, you need to find out what the roadblock is. Tracing where a decision might lead – and wherethatdecision leads further along – can help reveal what’s really holding you back.When I did this, I realized the real hurdle wasn’t occasionally having to hire a cat-sitter. Rather, it was remembering how devastated I was when my childhood cat died. Was I willing to go through that kind of grief again?Stanford professorsBill Burnett and Dave Evanssuggest a similar method for envisioning big life changes in their 2021 book, Designing Your Life. Sketch out three different versions of your life five years from now: one where you keep doing what you’re doing, like living in your hometown and deepening your work and relationships there; one realistic alternative that you would enact if option one vanished, like moving to the nearest big city and choosing a new career; and what you would do if anything was possible, like relocating to Mongolia or abandoning work altogether to focus on artistic pursuits. Then compare them. This can highlight your potential, fears and desires.Such planning can lay bare how we “moralize” decisions or tie them to idealized identities, Le Cunff says. You may unconsciously believe that choosing a risky, adventurous path would make you more interesting and therefore better, or that staying close to family means you’re more worthy of love. Ask yourself whether the underlying assumption truly resonates or whether it’s a script you have internalized, Le Cunff says.Experiment with smaller stepsBefore committing to a big, complex change, begin with a smaller element. This starts you off “from a place of curiosity” and “removes the binary definition of success and failure”, Le Cunff says.For instance, if you want to write a book, try writing a few pages every day for two weeks and see how that feels, she says. If you want to become a community organizer, host a monthly coffee with your neighbors.Running a short experiment can provide information about whether the challenging aspects of a choice feel like an interesting area of growth or something we’d rather not have to deal with, Le Cunff says.Identify what you can control – and what you can’tBetter decision-making frameworks can’t fix structural problems. “The systems that we’re navigating are not set up for thriving,” says Jon Rosemberg, an executive career coach and author of A Guide to Thriving. Systemic barriers to success and endless capitalistic demand for more can leave us feeling like we don’t actually have any choices. For instance, it might not be possible to quit your job to carve out more free time for other things that matter. But especially when we feel trapped, focusing on what wecanchange is its own form of power.Can being codependent in a relationship actually be a good thing?Read morePay close attention to the big and small ways we do have agency, and where we’re choosing to surrender it, Rosemberg says. For instance, allowing algorithms to curate entertainment can prevent us from actively shaping our own preferences.“Agency is a skill and it’s something that we can develop, like a muscle,” Rosemberg says. First, notice your narrative about the decision – say, “‘I can’t end this friendship.’ Then, ask yourself open-ended, non-judgmental questions: ‘Does this friendship make sense for me if our interactions leave me feeling worse?’ Finally, shift your perspective: ‘I would prefer fewer connections that feel more aligned.’ Whatever the decision, try to ascertain whether “the discomfort of staying the same is worse than the discomfort of changing,” he advises.This process can be “a lot more painful” in practice than this tidy framework might suggest, but it can be very helpful, Rosemberg says.Don’t fear the unknownDecision-making frameworks assume you have some sense of what you want. But if you genuinely don’t, that’s okay too.Many of us have “been told that a successful adult is supposed to know what they want,” Le Cunff says. This can cause misery. Yet periods when we don’t know what we want are completely normal – even something to celebrate.Rather than trying to force a decision, Le Cunff suggests taking your time sitting with uncertainty: “Try to have fun and experiment.” Through self-inquiry, agency and narrowing down our options using practices like future self-continuity, we can transform impossible decisions into a path forward.When it came to the kitten, I recognized that I want to love deeply, even though mundane inconveniences and great loss are inherent in doing so. And with my new pet sleeping soundly beside me, I feel like I made the right choice.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s how that would workLarry ElliottOnce a PM is seen as hapless, there is no way back. But Labour has good plans – and with the political landscape fragmented, it could yet prevailThu 19 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 07.52 ESTShareIn the summer of 1992 John Major was riding high. Selling himself as the everyman leader voters could relate to, Margaret Thatcher’s successor as prime minister had just won an election against the odds and had a few months when all seemed well.ThenBlack Wednesdayhappened,the 1992 sterling crisis, and after George Soros and his fellow speculators ousted Britain from the European exchange rate mechanism it was never the same again. Major became the man with the reverse Midas touch. He could do nothing right. He became a figure of fun. The press was merciless.Keir Starmer is the new John Major. True, there has been nothing as totemic as Black Wednesday in the past 18 months, merely a drip feed of bad news.Voters who expected Starmer to be a fresh start after 14 years of Conservative incompetence and sleaze have suffered from a bad dose of buyer’s remorse, with the Green party and Reform UK the beneficiaries of rapid public disillusionment.Once a prime minister has a reputation for being hapless, the impression is hard to shift.Major lost the 1997 electionby a landslide even though the economy had performed strongly in the five years after Black Wednesday. Starmer doesn’t even have that going for him.Growth is weakand this week there was news thatunemployment has risento its highest in almost five years.The fragmented state of British politics means it is still just about conceivable that Labour will win the next election. For that, though, four things need to happen. First, Starmer has to go. Voters feel he is not up to the job of being prime minister and he will remain in office only until the Labour party agrees on who should succeed him. Then the axe will fall.Second, the government needs to stop shooting itself in the foot. Labour was guilty of unforced errors when it came to power and has performedU-turn after U-turn. The uncertainty created by the 2024 and 2025 budgets has meant businesses have been hesitant about investing. The increase in employers’ national insurance contributions was what it says in the economics textbooks – a tax on jobs. Life isparticularly tough for young peoplelooking for work.Third, a successor to Starmer needs to show he or she has a coherent strategy. Here, if you look hard enough, there is material with which to work because – contrary to the current conventional wisdom – Labour was broadly in tune with the public mood at the 2024 election. It knew voters wanted extra investment in the NHS, more money spent on Britain’s clapped-out infrastructure, a shift in the workplace balance of power in favour of employees, a boost to manufacturing, higher taxes on the rich and an improvement in living standards.Labour has delivered on most of these things. Rachel Reeves’s first budget providedextra cash for the NHSandchanged accounting rulesso that the government could increase public investment. There is an industrial strategy focusing on eight specific potentialgrowth sectors, and a bill to provide workers with fresh rights.Now, it could be argued that this has not gone far enough and that focus has been lost due to the constant screw-ups. That’s true, but even so, higher public spending paid for by a mixture of borrowing and taxes, a plan to boost manufacturing output and an attempt to end the worst excesses of the labour market could form the kernel of a centre-left programme.Where Labour has failed to deliver is on growth, and in particular on growth in living standards, whichfell in the second half of 2025. After more than a decade and a half in which incomes per head rose only marginally and the state of the public realm deteriorated, Labour has so far offered more of the same. Patients are stillwaiting for treatment on trolleysin hospital corridors. The roads are stillfull of potholes. Starmer says that change will take time, but there is no point in saying the public needs to be patient. The public has had it with being patient.So the final condition for a Labour recovery is that the economy starts to motor. There is no real prospect of a return to the rapid growth of the mid-1990s, but things should get better from here. If nothing else, the sluggishness of the economy will force the Bank of England tocut interest rates.Internationally, things should also be calmer than they were during the first year of Donald Trump’s second term. Despite the dire predictions, tariffs have not proved to be a wrecking ball for the global economy.The conditions are ripe for business investment to pick up.Inflation will soon be back to its 2% targetand interest rates are coming down. The impacts of past shocks that helped delay capital spending – Brexit, the pandemic, the war in Ukraine – have faded. Tax breaks for investment announced by the Conservatives combined with the measures Labour has introduced – higher employer NICs and above-inflation increases in the minimum wage – have made capital spending relatively less expensive and hiring labour relatively more expensive.After years in which it has repeatedly done worse than forecast, the economy is now poised for a period of higher investment, higher productivity and higher living standards. The pick-up won’t be spectacular and it will be too late for Starmer. But perhaps not for his successor.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Now I fear a chilling sequel is on the wayThu 19 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 03.22 ESTShareTwenty-five years ago, George W Bush persuaded European leaders to back his “war on terror”. That disastrous project cost millions of lives and caused mass displacement of people from across the Middle East. It normalised racism and hatred for Muslims, refugees and racialised minorities in the US and Europe. I fearMarco Rubio’s speechat the Munich Security Conference, with its calls to defend white, western, Christian civilisation against supposedly contaminating racialised migrants – and the standing ovation he received from European elites – may mark a chilling sequel.Rubio’s language of a shared and superior American and European civilisation differs from that of his bosses, Donald Trump and JD Vance. His tone is more emollient but his outreach is conspiratorial. Rubio talks of migration and identity and civilisational anxiety, rather than terrorism and hard security threats as Bush once did. In his Munich speech, Rubio flattered Europeans about the continent’s colonial past. He denied preaching a message of xenophobia or hate, and instead framed his call to defend national borders as entirely respectable, dutiful and a“fundamental act of sovereignty”.The message of nativist exclusion, however, remained unchanged. Havinglived throughand reported on the aftermath of 9/11, I am acutely aware of the racist subtext and Islamophobic dog whistles that lurk behind such white-supremacy-tinged discourse, and the fears and even violence this can unleash.The anxious debates that were triggered all those years ago on Islam’s place inEurope, about loyalty and belonging and about Muslims representing an impossible-to-integrate “other”, continue to haunt European Muslims today.This is not alarmism. At a time of geopolitical precarity, not least over Ukraine, European leaders are understandably anxious not to alienate an already unpredictable US ally. But racism, however coded and cloaked as natural and virtuous, must be called out. Judging by the applause Rubio received in Munich, I fear that too many European leaders have already signalled their readiness to play along, either because they share Trump’s worldview or because it feels geopolitically expedient to do so.Yet, if we want to protect multiparty liberal democracy and push back against the far right, we should be far more wary not only of toxic speeches from across the Atlantic but of Trump’s close ties to Europe’s xenophobic parties and the many ways in which the US’s Maga politicians are legitimising far-right ideologies. The fact that the US state department may soon be fundingpolicy-aligned European thinktanksand charities should be ringing alarm bells across the continent.When I hear Trump, Rubio and their European acolytes, I wonder why so few of the EU’s political elite dare to say out loud that we have heard this stigmatising language of exclusion before – and we know where it can lead. That we are not going to follow the US’s lead. That colonialism was not a glorious enterprise but caused immense death and destruction. That once, Jews, too, were portrayed as a threat to white Christian Europe and accused of weakening nations from within.That today, the targets of what the British author Hanif Kureishi calls Europe’s “collective hallucination” about the power of unwanted outsiders to colonise and contaminate may be migrants, Muslims, and black and brown people. But the narrative about who belongs, and who does not, is dangerous and corrosive for all of us.It is difficult to swim against the tide. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, a rarity among European leaders in that he is trying to talk facts rather than fiction about migration, has run into strong opposition not only from the far right but from senior EU policymakers who portray hisdecision to regularise500,000 undocumented migrants and asylum seekers as undermining the EU’s deterrence message. The EU migration commissioner, Magnus Brunner, a conservative Austrian politician, haswarned that Spain“must ensure [its] decisions do not have negative consequences in other parts of the union”, conveniently ignoring the fact that hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants are already embedded in Europe’s labour markets, and that many EU states are signing labour-mobility agreements with countries in the global south even as they engage in migrant-bashing in public.Instead of recognising these uncomfortable facts, Brussels is focused on securing European parliament backing for Brunner’s “simpler and more effective return procedures” to step up and accelerate the deportations of undocumented people, including potentially sending them to offshore centres in non-EU countries. These plans,according to rights groups, would expand and normalise ICE-like immigration raids and surveillance measures across the continent.Why Marco Rubio’s ‘reassuring’ speech to Europe was nothing of the kind | Nathalie TocciRead moreEurope’s leaders really should know better. Instead of being seduced and reassured so easily by Rubio’s faux flattery, they should find the moral courage to stand up to Maga’s divisive discourse and ask, asSánchez didrecently: “When did recognising rights become something radical? When did empathy become something exceptional?”I know it is easy to fall in line with the dominant narrative and how difficult it is to stand up for one’s values. Soon after 9/11, a colleague took me aside and said that if I wanted to “succeed in Europe”, I should stop denouncingIslamophobiaand align with the emerging dominant narrative of Muslims as inherently violent or, better still, condemn Islam itself as backward and barbaric. The alternative, he warned, would be very difficult.He may have been right about the difficulty. But what still strikes me, more than two decades on, is how shocking that suggestion felt at the time. The idea that a European identity and a Muslim one were fundamentally incompatible was not yet mainstream. That today the same sentiment, voiced by Rubio, is met with applause rather than rebuttals in Munich is a troubling sign of how bias and prejudice – when they are not called out – can become embedded in Europe’s discourse and its politics at every level.Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs.

The novel, which remains a GCSE set text, has been a staple of secondary school English departments almost since its publication in 1954. The decision to include a diverse cast, including the excellent Winston Sawyers who plays Ralph, will probably be viewed by many as a progressive move, ensuring that not only white actors are offered roles and not only white people are represented on screen. But for all its progressive aspirations, an adaptation like this obscures some of the most interesting themes discernible in the book.It’s important to state at the outset that I am certainly not suggesting there are too many Black and Asian people on television. The opposite is often true. Instead, I’m questioning what aspects of Golding’s original story are obscured by the inclusion of Black and Asian actors in the series.A key trope of the “Robinsonade” genre, that takes its name from Daniel Defoe’s 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe, is white English men finding themselves on an island where they encounter non-European Others. If you’re not thinking about this, it is hard to understand Piggy’s declaration in Golding’s text: “We’ve got to have rules and obey them. After all we’re not savages. We’re English; and the English are best at everything.”The colour-blind approach to casting at the expense of story is not new, nor is the issue undiagnosed. Writing about Bridgerton in 2022, Gary Youngedescribedthe decision to employ a diverse cast as offering “the depiction of racial difference in the absence of racial inequality”. In the US, Ishmael Reed wrote the play The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda in response to Hamilton, drawing attention to how an inclusive cast obscured a racist past. The same might be said of another of Thorne’s projects, his 2020 film The Secret Garden.What is lost by this approach to adaptation and storytelling? For one thing, Golding’s tale loses some of its original potency, and meaning, when abstracted away from the context of British colonialism and racism.Golding envisaged Lord of the Flies as something of a response to RM Ballantyne’s The Coral Island, a Robinsonade boys’ adventure story that glorified British civilisation and treated racial hierarchies as natural. Robinsonades, which also include films such as Swiss Family Robinson, The Admirable Crichton, Lost in Space and The Martian, depict people (men, in the main) finding themselves in inhospitable climates, remote islands, where they are forced to survive by dint of their ingenuity and sure moral compass. Often, these survivors have their humanity brought into sharper focus through encounters with racialised others. This is the vision conjured up by Piggy’s reference to savages, a trope that can be traced right back to Defoe’s book and which even finds its way into the US Declaration of Independence in uneasy tension with the claim that “all men are created equal”, and suggesting that those labelled savages are not in fact to be regarded as fully human.The original edition of Golding’s book contained usage of the N-word, which was replaced in subsequent editions with the word “Indians”. These terms are used to indicate a racial hierarchy and in the traditional Robinsonade, this racial hierarchy is usually, and unapologetically, endorsed (spoiler: white European men are always at the top). Golding’s novel is certainly not unproblematic, but through irony and self-reflection, it opens itself up to be read as an anticolonial text. Informed by the events of the second world war, he departs from the Robinsonade tradition in suggesting that the “savagery” in fact lies within these upper-class white English boys. Is the same true for Thorne’s adaptation? It has clearly provided opportunities for actors of colour, which is important – but in rehabilitating a monocultural “classic” through diverse casting, it has also obscured important readings.Thorne has taken characters that are classed, gendered and raced in Golding’s book and decided that only two of those three identities are of consequence in his series. A story often viewed as dystopian becomes a racial utopia. At a time when so much racism is articulated through patriarchal notions of asserting dominance and protecting “our women” from those not like us, this feels like a curious retreat – a white flight, if you will – from how notions of masculinity are deeply entangled with both gender and racial hierarchies.Darren Chetty is a writer and academic, and co-author with Karen Sands O’Connor ofBeyond the Secret Garden: Racially Minoritised People in British Children’s BooksDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The posting of non-consensual intimate images is part of that crisis, and it must stopThu 19 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 03.21 ESTShareTackling violence against women and girls is not just a priority for my government. It is central to who I am.Before entering politics, when I led the Crown Prosecution Service as director of public prosecutions, I worked with victims of rape, domestic abuse and sexual violence, and I saw, up close, the lifelong damage these crimes cause. And I learned that when systems fail victims, the harm does not end, it deepens.Justice must begin with listening to victims. They are why I refuse to accept that abuse is inevitable. And they’re why I made halving violence against women and girls a central commitment of this government.That is an ambitious goal. Having spent the best part of two decades trying to drive up prosecutions, I know the challenges we face.But let me be clear: this is a national emergency. It requires an immediate and uncompromising response.And it also requires an honest conversation about the causes of abuse. Because violence does not exist within a vacuum. Our work cannot begin only when violence occurs – it must start much earlier.That means confronting an uncomfortable truth: misogyny is woven into the fabric of our institutions and stitched into every aspect of modern life. And it continues to cause real harm.Despite the brave actions of victims, campaigners and my fellow parliamentarians, too often, misogyny is excused, minimised or ignored. The arguments of women are dismissed as exaggerated or “one-offs”. That culture creates permission. It tells some men that boundaries are negotiable and accountability is optional. And it teaches young boys, watching from the sidelines, that disrespect can be rewarded.It exists in sport, culture, law and beyond. And, of course, in our politics. No institution can pretend it is immune.That is why I am determined to transform the culture of government: to challenge the structures that still marginalise women’s voices. And it’s why I believe that simply counting how many women hold senior roles is not enough. What matters is whether their views carry weight and lead to change.Others want to take us backwards. This week,Suella Braverman announcedthat Reform UK would scrap theEquality Actif it got into government. A piece of legislation developed by my colleagueHarriet Harmanto address decades of discrimination. Against working people. Disabled people. Pregnant women. A reckless decision that would undoubtedly put power back into the hands of the already powerful.So I am determined to lead from the front. Because if we want to change culture, leadership matters. But our work must stretch much further than Westminster. Not just into our workplaces around the country, but on to our phone screens too.Because in the digital age, misogyny spreads faster, travels further and does more damage than ever before. Platforms that were meant to connect us have too often become spaces of intimidation and exploitation. Keyboard cowards commit violence without having to leave the comfort of their own sofa.One of the most devastating examples is the sharing of non-consensual intimate images. The type of story that, as a parent, makes your heart drop to your stomach.Too often, those victims have been left to fight alone – chasing takedown of harmful content site to site, reporting the same material again and again, only to see it reappear elsewhere hours later. That is not justice. It is failure. And it is sending a message to the young people of this country that women and girls are a commodity to be used and shared.So today, my government is changing that. We are putting tech companies on notice: any non-consensual intimate image that is flagged must be taken down within 48 hours. We must create a system where a victim reports once, and it’s removed everywhere, on multiple platforms, and automatically deleted if it is reuploaded.We are also designating creating or sharingthese images as a priority offence underthe Online Safety Act, so they are treated with the seriousness they deserve.These measures build on ourviolence against women and girls strategy, published before Christmas, with more than 200 commitments across prevention, victim support and prosecution.They reflect a simple principle: the burden of tackling abuse must no longer fall on victims. It must fall on perpetrators – and on the companies that enable harm.This is a national emergency. But it is also a test of our values. I am determined that this country will meet it.Keir Starmer is UK prime ministerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As president, he has deployed the power of the state to expand his personal brand,adding his nameto the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the US Institute of Peace, a class of new navy warships, and even investment accounts for millions of children.Trump is now eyeing yetmore grandiose targets in his self-aggrandizement spree. He wants Congress to rename New York’s Penn Station and Washington Dulles international airport in his honor. But there’s a catch:Trump reportedlytold Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, that he would unfreeze billions of dollars in federal funding for a major infrastructure project in the north-east – if Schumer supported renaming the two sites.The presidentseemingly threatenedto hold federal funding, which had already been approved by Congress, hostage in his relentless campaign of self-promotion. Even by the standards that Trump set after a year back in the White House, when he has systematically dismantledanti-corruption lawsbuilt over decades and used the presidency toenrich himself and his family, trading naming rights as a political favor is a new low. Trump appears to have tried to leverage a $16bn transportation project to build a rail tunnel under the Hudson River, connecting New York and New Jersey, for his personal glorification.Over the past few weeks, Trump and his aides offered shifting explanations regarding whether he sought to extract naming rights in exchange for restoring federal funds – and why the administration had suspended the project’s funding in the first place.After reportsof the quid pro quo surfaced this month, Trump said it was Schumer who had suggested renaming Penn Station after the president – a claim that the New York Democratquickly deniedas an “absolute lie”. On 10 February, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,contradicted Trump’s accountwhen she responded to a question about whether her boss had asked Schumer for help renaming the train station and airport. “About the renaming, why not? It was something the president floated in his conversation with Chuck Schumer,”Leavitt said.In October, at the start of last year’s 43-day US government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it wouldwithhold fundsfor the sprawling infrastructure program, known as the Gateway project, until it concluded a review into whether diversity practices had played a role in selecting the project’s contractors. But in astatement last month, the administration shifted its argument for suspending the funds, saying it was because Schumer and other Democrats had refused to negotiate with Trump, especially on immigration policies. “There is nothing stopping Democrats from prioritizing the interests of Americans over illegal aliens and getting this project back on track,” said a White House spokesperson, Kush Desai.The administration’s changing rhetoric – railing about diversity and “illegal aliens” – is ultimately a bureaucratic weaponization of culture war grievances to mask a presidential shakedown. On 6 February, afederal judge orderedthe Trump administration to release overdue payments for the project while a lawsuit by state officials in New York and New Jersey winds its way through the courts. By 18 February, the administrationhad released$205m in federal funds owed to the project since it withheld funding in October. Construction work on the Gateway tunnel could resume next week, after it was stopped earlier this month because funds had run out. But the US transportation departmenthas appealedthe judge’s order, and it could freeze payments once again if other courts rule in its favor.For now, Trump has failed to use the cudgel of federal funding to expand his presidential branding opportunity. But he’s still eager to satiate his impulse as a real estate mogul, trying to use his second term to slap his name on as many monuments, buildings and federal projects as possible. And Republicans in Congress are keen to flatter their leader by plastering his moniker on a range of landmarks. One Republican Congress member last yearproposed renamingDulles airport as “Donald J. Trump International Airport”, while anotherintroduced a billrequiring the National Park Service to add Trump’s face to Mount Rushmore, the monument in South Dakota which features sculptures of the US presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.Trump is alsolobbying ownersof the NFL’s Washington Commanders team to name their planned $3.7bn stadium after him, and he’sreportedly pressingUS government bodies that must approve the project to pave the way for such a tribute when the stadium opens in 2030. (When asked about these reports, Leavitt, the White House press secretary,responded: “That would surely be a beautiful name, as it was President Trump who made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible.”)No previous US president has tried to put his name on so many buildings or monuments, especially while still in office. Most leaders havewaited years or decadesfor such honors, which are usually initiated by subsequent presidents or legislators. One exception was John F Kennedy, who was memorialized shortly after his assassination in 1963, with a federal building and the Kennedy Space Center named after him. In 1964,Congress renameda planned national cultural center in Washington in JFK’s honor – and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has served as a “living memorial” to him since it opened in 1971.In December, Trump’s name wasadded to the Kennedy Centerafter a vote by its board of trustees, a majority of whom were appointed by Trump last year, when he purged the board and installed himself as its chair. That decision promoted outrage and alawsuit by a Democraticlawmaker, arguing that only Congress has the authority to change the institution’s name. If a new US administration, or a Democratic-controlled Congress, takes power, it’s very likely to remove Trump’s name from the center.The US has drafted a coin featuring Trump. Here’s a better way to immortalize him | Robert ReichRead moreThe Kennedy Center’s renaming backfired on the president in other ways, with a cascade of high-profile artists and groups declaring that they wouldcancel performances. On 1 February, Trump abruptly announced that he plans toclose the centerfor two years of renovations, starting in July. It seems Trump decided to avoid the embarrassment of keeping open a cultural institute that now bears his name but fails to attract enough high-level programming.Many Americans are also getting tired of Trump’s endless self-promotion and narcissism. ACNN pollreleased last month found that 58% of the US public thinks Trump has “gone too far” in using the power of the presidency. In response to another question about Trump’s “changes to cultural institutions such as the Kennedy Center and the Smithsonian”, 62% of Americans said he had “gone too far” on that as well. But among the mostdamaging responseswas that only 37% of those surveyed said Trump “puts the good of the country above his personal gain” – meaning that nearly two-thirds of respondents think the president is mostly out for himself.The recent CNN poll,among others, show that Americans are put off by Trump’s brazen attempts toprofit from the presidencysince he returned to office. But the potential conflicts around Trump’s campaign to enrich himself and his family are complicated, especially as the White House insists Trump hasno conflictsof any kind. It’s easier for Americans to see through the hypocrisy of a leader who claims to be addressing deep economic problems while spending a lot of time building – or renaming – monuments to himself.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS CongressUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

For more than 15 years, allegations surrounding Mr Mountbatten-Windsor were managed away by silence, an out-of-court settlement and his withdrawal from royal duties. In short, his behaviour was viewed as an image problem to be handled privately. That era now looks to be over.That the eighth in line to the throne was sitting in a police cell on his 66th birthday shows how far he has fallen. The formal investigation means that the question is no longer about protecting the monarchy but one of what happened, and who might be responsible for unlawful acts. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s descent into ignominy has unfolded slowly but inexorably. His stupidityand arroganceled him to believe that he could talk his way out of his relationship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Instead, he faces a legal and constitutional reckoning.Thames Valley policearrestedthe royal on suspicion of misconduct in public office, following a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic. The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Within the 3m files and messages released by the US Department of Justice are emails that appear to show Mr Mountbatten-Windsor forwarding documents and commercial information to Epstein while serving as trade envoy. The king’s brother denies any wrongdoing.A single 2001photographplunged the monarchy into crisis. It showed the then Prince Andrew with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre and lent credibility to her trafficking allegations. The visual evidence made it hard to dismiss her statements as implausible. Though he denied knowing her and rejected the claims, a £12m settlement followed and the image shaped a scandal that shook the House of Windsor.Morewomenhave come forward alleging abuse, which Mr Mountbatten-Windsor denies.Ms Giuffre died by suicide last year. Her family said that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest shows that “no one is above the law”. MPs should not bend the knee before inheritance and rank. As this column has longargued, it cannot be right to call for the king’s brother to give evidence to US lawmakers, but not to parliament.Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the cross-party business and trade committee, was correct, in a constitutional sense, that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor could be questioned by MPs. His public office as trade envoy answers to parliament. It is not the law, but convention – including Commons rules barring “reflections” on the royals – which restrains politics.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is still acounsellor of state, theoretically able to stand in for the king. He will never wear the crown. Parliament should now debate whether hereditary privilege can coexist with democratic accountability.Symbolically, this episode surely marks the end of the assumption that being part of the royal household is a badge of impunity. Practically, it should deliver more victim-centred accountability. The story of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s Epstein connections is only beginning. If there are no charges, it becomes a story about institutional reform. If prosecution proceeds, he will answer to 12jurorswho will judge him by the evidence, not by his birth. Either way, the old model – of discreet exile and silence – seems finished.Explore more on these topicsLawOpinionMonarchyJeffrey EpsteinTrial by juryPolicecommentShareReuse this content"

Russia’s war in Ukraine has starklyunderlinedthe extent to which the continent’s energy security – and its future prosperity – is dependent on the transition away from fossil fuels. Lately, however, EU leaders’ environmental approach appears to be echoing the youthful St Augustine’s plea onchastity: make us greener, but not yet.The recent European Industry Summit in Antwerp made unusually big headlines thanks to Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s xenophobicoutburstover immigration. But it was also notable for fierceattackson one of the most important pillars of EU environmental policy. The bloc’s emissions trading system (ETS) – which makes polluters pay for the C02 they emit – has achieved dramatic results in driving down overall emissions since 2005 and encouraging green innovation. Worryingly, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, appeared tosympathisewith demands from Sir Jim and other CEOs for a radical relaxation of the rules.There will be much more of this to come. Together with the far-right Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, Mr Merz ischampioninga deregulatory approach to delivering growth that risks hobbling Europe’s climate ambitions. Ms Meloni has long railed at what she hasdescribedas “green follies” imposed by Brussels. In Mr Merz, an economic liberal instinctively hostile to regulation, she has acquired a powerful ally.The Berlin-Rome axis has already succeeded indilutingplans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035. EU leaders have also voted to scale back overall 2040 targets for greenhouse gas reduction. Corporate sustainability reporting rules have been watered down. Italo-German calls for greater flexibility in achieving decarbonising goals, and attacks on regulatory systems such as the ETS, have the potential to license a full-scale pivot away from net zero targets.This is disastrously shortsighted from an economic as well as an environmental point of view. When the green deal was launched, it was rightly seen as a means to encourage the changes needed to make economies competitive in a fossil-fuel-free era. Competition from China has underlined the importance of moving faster in this direction. Instead, the risinginfluenceof rightwing populism across the continent is leading to a new go-slow consensus.As the former head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi hasargued, the true path to future competitiveness lies in sustained investment, partly financed by common EU borrowing, and incorporating a bold green industrial strategy. Mr Merz is right to suggest that, in some areas, a simplification of bureaucratic hurdles could be beneficial for growth. But a blind faith in deregulation, and capitulation to corporate lobbying on environmental rules by the likes of Sir Jim, is not a remotely adequate strategy for the times, ethically or economically.Given Donald Trump’s ongoing determination toundermineinternational attempts to combat global heating, Europe’s role as a climate leader is more vital than ever. So too is the need to develop an industrial vision that ensures the continent’s prosperity and security in the long term. As Mr Merz and Ms Meloni manoeuvre, it is time for defenders of the EU’s green deal to stand up and be counted.Explore more on these topicsGreen deal and energy companies obligation (ECO)OpinionEuropean UnionFriedrich MerzGiorgia MeloniEnergyEnergy efficiencyEuropeeditorialsShareReuse this content"

The Ministry of Defence must surely first show it can put its house in order.The government is considering whether to scrap Ajax, the army’s planned new armoured vehicle, even though more than £6bn of taxpayers’ money has already been spent on the project. Ajax is eight years late, its defects so serious thatvibration and noisehave made soldiers training on it sick, with some suffering hearing loss.It is the latest and most egregious example of the huge waste caused by the MoD’s incompetence and profligacy over recent years. It has spent many billions on items, including aircraft carriers, that would be extremely vulnerable in modern conflicts, something that has been evident for a long time.The chairs of the Commons defence and public accounts committees told the MoD last month that its failure to publish its equipment plan in 2023, and again in 2024, has resulted in an unacceptable gap in parliament and the public’s ability to scrutinise defence spending. Repeated delays in publishing the MoD’s current plan risk sendingdamaging signals to adversaries, they added. The delays also signal that the MoD culture is unfit for purpose and its leadership cannot be trusted with so much of the British public’s money.Richard Norton-TaylorLondonDesire for greater security comes from people and countries feeling unsafe and fearful (British and German military chiefs press ‘moral’ case for rearmament, 15 February). But experience has shown that the apparent security that comes from rearmament is temporary at best and can provoke the conflict it tries to prevent.The British and German defence chiefs may argue that “strength deters aggression”, but this conceals the reality that Britain already has the world’s sixth-largest military budget, and that Nato’s military spending already dwarfs Russia’s. Their argument could easily come from defence chiefs in Russia or any other hostile state. As we are seeing with the US as well as Russia, strength also begets aggression.Countries aren’t static in responding to each other, and there’s a high likelihood that military buildup in Europe will spur further militarisation elsewhere. Long-term peace comes from building trust, friendship and mutual dependence between nations, not the constant threat of military retaliation.Oliver RobertsonHead of witness and worship, Quakers in BritainSo the British and German military chiefs are making the moral case for rearmament in order to “preserve peace”. Doing so, they say, is not warmongering. However, when doing so has led to a 45% cut in the government’s funding through the Integrated Security Fund dedicated to building peace and preventing conflict and when the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is being “restructured” with the loss of considerable conflict expertise, it does rather look like warmongering.If we are serious about preserving peace, we need to be investing in those diplomats and peacebuilders who are able to de-escalate and reduce tensions. Rearming without investing in these skill sets will simply increase tensions still further. It is the opposite of preserving peace.Lt Col David Couzens (retired)Faringdon, OxfordshireThe defence chiefs of the UK andGermanyquite rightly warn us of the increasing threat from a rapidly rearming Russia, and call for “an honest conversation” with citizens about defence being the responsibility of each and every one of us.Any meaningful conversation must be preceded by a crash course in recent events and an outline of the specific threats. Few people in the UK nowadays have any reason to be concerned about defence, and successive governments have been much too timid to talk openly about the threat of war for fear of spooking the population.There is one significant omission from the proposed conversation. If the government wants citizens to engage in building a whole-of-society defence, it must spell out in detail how it will protect us should open conflict break out. Civil defence organisations disappeared along with the cold war, and the (very few) nuclear shelters allocated to civilians have fallen into complete disrepair.Hannah WalkerWymondham, NorfolkThe British and German defence chiefswriteof the “moral dimension” of rearmament and say that weakness invites aggression. I would suggest that the people of Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine have offered no such invitation to their bear-like neighbour. Nor, indeed, the people of Iraq to this country’s catastrophic aggression in 2003. Greenlanders will likewise be anxiously checking their own invitation list.The top brass are nonetheless right that a whole-of-society approach is required to meet the complexity of threats to the UK and Europe – not just those emanating from Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and their ilk, but also climate breakdown, grotesque inequality, and deadly new technologies. But that approach cannot be reduced to a lecture on how military industries must prevail at the expense of our health and welfare.Eight months since the last defence and security reviews, we are still nowhere near the “continent-wide conversation with the public” that the prime minister and security elites glibly prescribe. The public remains wholly outside the conversation on its own security, excluded from even tokenistic input to the last national security strategy.We ignore at our peril how the “peace dividend” investment of the post-cold-war era strengthened our society, as well as how that trust, unity and resilience has been steadily undermined by austerity, corruption, misinvestment in wars of choice, and the politics of polarisation. If morally conscious leaders genuinely want to protect their people, they would do well to listen and look at home too. The UK’s weakened society invites not deflection and aggression, but recognition and action.Richard ReeveCoordinator, Rethinking SecurityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromChris GoldieThu 19 Feb 2026 12.31 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 12.33 ESTShareAngelika May rightly states that a considerable portion of working actors are privately educated (Wuthering slights: why are film-makers afraid of casting Yorkshire actors as Cathy Earnshaw?, 17 February). She neglects to mention, however, that Jessica Knappett, Wuthering Heights’ sole Bradford actor, isalsoprivately educated.Angelika points out that “northern characters, particularly women, are coded as working class”, to which I say, there’s northing wrong with that. Working-class culture, humour and identity should be celebrated. The key is to avoid what Angelika goes on to describe as “comic, chaotic or intellectually limited”. These stereotypes are deeply rooted in the British class system, and to overcome them, working class artists must smash the structures which uphold them.Working-class artists have nothing to gain from being invited into the inner sanctum, or by being given roles in reactionary fluff likeWuthering Heights, if we keep telling the same old tales for the benefit of the same old institutions. The real goal, I say, should be more working-class writers, directors and performers telling their stories and making their work, on their terms. We can do without another boring adaptation of repressed middle-class sexuality, whoever happens to play Cathy.Josh GuiryBradfordAngelika May presents a good argument concerning the failure of successive adaptations of Wuthering Heights to cast a Yorkshirewoman as Cathy, but it is not strictly true to say that, “Across every major adaptation … not one Cathy has been portrayed by a Yorkshirewoman”. In Andrea Arnold’s film, the young Cathy is played by Shannon Beer, an actress from Shirecliffe in Sheffield. It should also be noted that Arnold’s film is the only adaptation to have cast Heathcliff using a black actor, James Howson from Leeds, also in Yorkshire. This is significant because the novel strongly implies that Heathcliff was of Black or Romany heritage.Chris GoldieSheffieldExplore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsEmerald FennellClass issuesInequalitylettersShareReuse this content"

In this paean to the English, every other nation of the UK is rubbished through caricature, and the rest of Europe dismissed in a few lines (“The Germans are German, the Russians are red, and the Greeks and Italians eat garlic in bed!”).This line of reasoning is explored inWhatever Happened to the Likely Lads?too,where Terry, to the derision of his friend Bob, runs through the shortcomings of every other nation. “To tell you the truth, I don’t like anybody much outside this town,” Terry adds. “There’s a lot of families in our street I can’t stand either. Come to think of it, I don’t even like the people next door.”Unfortunately, this view seems to have breached the boundaries of the fictional world and become the policy espoused byJean-Marie Le Penand his Front National party, and more latterly that of Ukip/the Brexit party/Reform UK.How sad that where once this sort of belief was the subject of humour, it now feels dangerous and threatening. It seems that for some in the UK, and in particular England, losing influence on the world stage leads to an ever greater need to claim to be world-beating.Alex HeatonSheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

At nine o’clock on Thursday morning, Great Britain’s men’s curling team didn’t even know whether they would be in the Olympic semi-finals. By nine o’clock on Thursday night, they had won themselves a place in Saturday’s final against Canada by beating the undefeated Swiss team 8-5.The British, who scraped through the round robin only because the Italian team lost their last group stage game to the Swiss on Thursday morning, had promised that they would be an entirely different proposition if they got to the knockout rounds, and they were as good as their word.Winter Olympics 2026: GB men win curling semi-final, figure skating and more – liveRead more“An emotional rollercoaster is probably the way to describe this whole week, never mind just that game,” said Hammy McMillan. “I guess I’m still in a little bit of shock, because we had to really fight extremely hard in that game. We started off pretty slow and the Swiss guys really took advantage of that.”It was a hell of a game, played in front of a rowdy crowd, the loudest of them a happy band of mad Scottish curling fans who had come along with a repertoire of songs written especially for the four men on the team. There was a lone bagpiper in there somewhere too, and even someone playing a kazoo.“They were amazing. If they can bring that exact same energy on Saturday, it’ll spur us on,” McMillan said. “Any time you hear the bagpipes, you get goosebumps.” Well, yes, that’s one way of describing it.The game started to go their way in the sixth end, which the British managed to steal when Switzerland’s vice skip missed a tricky hammer shot. But it really turned on an improbable shot by Bruce Mouat in the seventh end. The curlers call it a “run back triple takeout”, but the rest of us might understand it better as a feat of geometry in which Mouat managed to hit one of the opposition’s stones into a second in such a way that the second scudded into a third. The Swiss, who had been expecting to reap at least three points and move into a 7-4 lead, suddenly found they needed to make a draw just to score one.View image in fullscreenBruce Mouat on the tense final end against Switzerland which Britain won to seal the passage into Saturday’s final.Photograph: Issei Kato/ReutersMouat judged it one of the best shots he has ever made in competition. You could tell he liked it because he even allowed himself to celebrate with a little fist pump. “In my opinion Bruce is one of the best shotmakers in the world, if not the best shotmaker in the world,” McMillan said. “You know, for the last 18 months he’s been incredible, and as long as we do our job, we’ve got 100% confidence in Bruce he’s going to finish it off.” Britain were able to score two in the next end, which meant they led 6-5 going into the 10th.Mouat and the Swiss skip Yannick Schwaller have a friendly rivalry that runs right back to their matches in the world junior championships a decade ago. Schwaller won the first games they played but Mouat has had much the better of it in the years since, and led 22-10 in their head to head coming into this semi-final, including their last four games straight. Last April the British beat the Swiss 5-4 in the world championship final.But it was around that time that the Swiss brought in the legendary Canadian curler Glenn Howard, a four-time world champion, as their national coach. Howard has built the Swiss team into the machine that was unbeaten in the round-robin stage of these Olympics, and during the time-out he came on to the side of the ice to try to steer his team through the final shots they needed to make to take that 10th end. But Mouat’s team had their measure. The Swiss missed with their final stone, and the British broke out into such wild celebrations that Bobby Lammie nearly clattered the referee with his broom when he threw it into the air.Now Mouat, who has played 16 days straight at these Olympics, has one game left. “It’s going to be a tough game,” says McMillan. “We play Canada a lot. We beat them in the semi-final of the world championships last year, and we know it’s going to be a battle. On paper this week they’ve been the second best team behind Switzerland. So we know we’ve got to bring the way we played in the last four or five ends there today for all 10 ends. We haven’t probably quite had a full A+ 10-end game yet. So it’s time to bring it on Saturday.”The British women weren’t so lucky. They beat Italy 7-4, their third-straight victory, to give them a 5-4 record for the tournament, which was good enough to get the men through, but they needed Switzerland to beat the USA too if they were going to make it. The Swiss came a couple of inches away from doing it, which seemed pretty unlikely when the US team were 6-3 up going into the 10th end. The Swiss skip pulled off an improbable shot to equalise the game with the final stone, only for the US to win in the extra end.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBCurlingnewsShareReuse this content"

Skating in a shimmering gold dress to Donna Summer’s MacArthur Park Suite, Liu cleanly landed all seven of her triple jumps, including three in combination, and drew a standing ovation before finishing with 226.79 points overall.‘If there was no one on Earth, I would still skate’: Alysa Liu on her remarkable figure skating comebackRead more“That’s what I’m fucking talking about,” Liu said as she left the ice. As the scores were announced she shook her head with knowing approval while she was hugged by her coaches, Phillip DiGuglielmo and Massimo Scali.Sakamoto finished with 224.90 points over both segments to take silver, her lone mistakes coming on her triple flip, double axel combo and triple loop. The 17-year-old Nakai, the youngest skater of the 29 entrants who came in first after the short program, made several errors in the second half of her program to finish ninth in the free skate and slip to bronze with an overall score of 219.16.Liu, the surprise world champion a year ago and now a double Olympic championafter last week’s team event, became the first American woman to win individual figure skating gold since Sarah Hughes in 2002.

I just thought, ‘I’m going do what I do best, which is enjoy skating’, and that’s what I did today.”But the night belonged to Liu, who skated third-to-last with the rollicking crowd in her thrall. By the time she closed with a graceful layback spin, the 12,000-seat arena was a white-hot wall of sound. She then watched as Sakamoto and Nakai skated beautifully, but failed to meet her mark.View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu during her gold medal winning performance.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I had dinner with [my family] last night and that was unbelievable,” Liu said. “But another unbelievable feeling was just when I was skating. When I was skating, hearing the cheers, I felt so connected with this audience. I want to be out there again.”The outcome was the culmination of one of the most unusual arcs in the sport’s history. Liu burst on to the scene in 2019 as the youngest ever US national champion at the age of 13. She repeated the feat a year later, then competed at the 2022 Olympics and won bronze at that year’s worlds – before abruptly retiring that same spring, citing fatigue and burnout.She stayed away for nearly two years. But by mid-2023, she was back training in California, with eyes on rediscovering joy in her sport and possibly targeting theseWinter Olympics.Adeliia Petrosian, the three-time Russian champion entered as an individual neutral athlete and a dangerous flier for gold despite entering Thursday in fifth place. She had hopes of a medal due to her planned quadruple toeloop, but clattered to the ice on the potential difference-making jump. The protege of controversial coach Eteri Tutberidze still managed a fifth-best free skate score of 141.64 to finish sixth.“I feel a little ashamed,” Petrosian said, “for myself, for the federation, for my coaches and for the spectators that it went this way. I understand that it’s my own fault.”Liu became the eight US woman to win figure skating’s biggest prize before an audience that included former Olympic champion Tenley Albright, who became the first at the 1956 Cortina d’Ampezzo Games.Explore more on these topicsAlysa LiuFigure skatingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was Knight’s 15th Olympic goal, the most for an American woman in history, and it hurled the match into a berserk three-on-three period that was settled by a game-winner from Keller that sparked joy and despair inside the arena in equal measure.Winter Olympics women’s ice hockey final: USA beat Canada 2-1 in overtime to win gold – liveRead moreOdd as it sounds when discussing the most successful nation in Olympic women’s ice hockey history – a country that has appeared in all eight finals – a Canadian victory would have been a notable upset for a squad that has been outclassed by its biggest adversary of late.That 5-0 defeat to the US last week was not only Canada’s worst-ever Olympic loss but the first time they had failed to score in a match at the Winter Games. Canada’s lack of strength in depth during the tournament had stood in contrast with the Americans, who profited from important contributions from each forward line. John Wroblewski’s side outscored opponents 31-1 and found the net at least five times in all six of their prior matches in Italy.The defence wasn’t bad either. Before this game the US had last conceded a goal in their first fixture of these Olympics, a 5-1 victory over Czechia on 5 February. That was the day before the opening ceremony.In the broader context, though, Canada won five of the previous seven finals – including a 3-2 triumph over the Americans in Beijing in 2022 – with the US claiming the other two, in 1998 and 2018. And optimists north of the border might have argued that they were due a win against their old foes, having lost their past seven fixtures against the US - a streak of struggles dating back to the women’s world championship last April.Canada upped their level when it mattered most. They adjusted tactically, defended robustly, fashioned good opportunities and were no doubt inspired by the example set by Marie-Philip Poulin, their talismanic 34-year-old captain. In her fifth Olympics, Poulin missed two group stage games with a knee injury but scored twice in the 2-1 win over Switzerland in the semi-finals, breaking the women’s all-time Olympic record with her 20th goal.The US had a much easier time of it in the last four against Sweden, reaching the gold medal game with a5-0 victory. (Switzerland beat Sweden 2-1 in overtime earlier on Thursday to win bronze.)But the lack of challenge up to this point appeared to be a disadvantage when adversity struck; and perhaps the Americans, less experienced than their opponents, struggled to handle the magnitude of the occasion.The US scored their first against Canada inside four minutes last week, but this was different.Canada out-shot their opponents by six to eight in the opening period, though neither team could find a breakthrough, with the Americans resolutely fending off two power plays – first they had too many players on the ice, then Joy Dunne was penalized for a trip.Canada struck only 54 seconds into the second period with a terrific short-handed goal by Kristin O’Neill, feinting to deceive goalkeeper Aerin Frankel and score from close range after a pass from Laura Stacey. The US were in arrears for the first time in the tournament.Then came promising chances at both ends, with Desbiens called into action and Frankel making a sharp, scampering save to deny Sarah Fillier when she looked set to double the lead. But with Canada resolute and confident, and the US lacking inspiration unless Caroline Harvey had the puck, it remained 1-0 after the second period.The Americans ratcheted up the pressure as the contest reached its climax, and Canada’s Erin Ambrose briefly went off injured after being shoved into the boards by Britta Curl-Salemme. It threatened to be a desperately disappointing night for the Americans that recalled the 2002 final, when Canada ended an eight-game losing streak against the US with a 3-2 win in the gold medal game in Salt Lake City.But a slight deflection from Knight in front of the net, with Frankel pulled off the ice, saved her team.Then came Keller, cutting inside and unleashing a shot from close in that dribbled past Desbiens to ensure Knight’s Olympic career ended in triumph. Wroblewski was moved to tears, and he wasn’t the only one.It was compelling drama – and with the US facing Slovakia and Canada meeting Finland in the men’s semi-finals on Friday, there may be another cross-border clash to come.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsIce hockeyUSA Olympic teamCanada ice hockey teamUSA ice hockey teamUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Imagine it as snow’s answer to triathlon. Only it’s more chaotic and over in about three minutes. First, the athletes’ power-ski up a steep slope. Then their skis are put in a rucksack as they run up a 40m staircase. After more uphill skiing to the top, they change the binding on their skis and whiz downhill to the finish.Athletes embrace it for its purity and romanticism, as the sport harks back to a different era before ski lifts became the norm. But there was also controversy as, for the first time in these Games, a medal was won by a Russian after Nikita Filippov emerged from the pack to take silver behind Spain’s Oriol Cardona Coll.Filippov, who was competing as a neutral athlete after the International Olympic Committee banned Russian and Belarusian athletes following the invasion of Ukraine, is said to have run away from a bear when he was six. But after winning his medal, he was quick to embrace another – the Russian one – by admitting he wished he had been wearing the colours of his country.View image in fullscreenNikita Filippov, wearing a neutral tracksuit, checks out his silver medal during the ceremony.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images“Of course it is difficult when you see guys from different countries wearing national jackets and boots,” he said. “But the Olympics is my childhood dream. It’s bad, but we should adapt and I hope next year that the Olympics, World Cups and all around the world there will be no neutral athletes and it will be just like in the past.”Naturally the Russian government was quick to celebrate their first medal of the Games, too. The medal was barely on Filippov’s neck when the country’s sports minister, Mikhail Degtyarev, awarded him the title of honoured master of sports of Russia.Filippov is famed for his strength, which he attributes partly to a workout that involves climbing two floors of a multistorey building while carrying two 24kg weights, putting the weights down and then hopping up two more floors. And doing it 25 times. It sounds extreme. But the Australian Lara Hamilton, who came last in her women’s heat, was quick to stress just how much strain skimo puts on the body.“The lungs, the chest, you feel deep burning,” she said. “The quads, the calves. It looks like a leg-dominant sport but there is a lot of pushing with your arms.” Hamilton, who had previously tried to get to the Olympics as a Nordic skier, 5,000m runner and surfer, described her experience as “trial by fire.”Meanwhile, the deep snow also proved to be a hindrance to another Australian, Phillip Bellingham, who had competed as a cross-country skier in three previous Games. “When there’s fresh snow on top, we’re sinking into it,” he said before admitting he was exhausted even before his semi-finals. “And because I’m a heavier guy, it’s more of a disadvantage.”View image in fullscreenAustralia’s Lara Hamilton (far left) says ‘you feel deep burning’ during skimo.Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesThere were, however, no British racers for a sport that Sir Arnold Lunn described as the “marriage of two great sports, mountaineering and skiing” nearly a century ago.Lunn, who came up with the idea of a slalom race in 1922 and was responsible for getting it and the downhill into the Winter Olympics in 1936, would have loved skimo. Even though he had a 100ft fall doing it in his youth, which left one leg two inches shorter than the other.At least there was a British presence here in the form of Emily Harrop, the favourite in the women’s race. The 28-year-old, who was born in France to English parents, was the British downhill champion as a teenager before switching to representing France. But having led most of the way up the mountain, she lost time on the second and third transitions and had to settle for silver behind Marianne Fatton of Switzerland.Not that she appeared too disappointed. “Our sport is beautiful; there is so much freedom and it’s an amazing way to find your limits – that’s why we love it,” she said. “If you enjoy freedom, if you enjoy the mountains, get into skimo. It’s fun but also hard.”But this day will be remembered for Russia’s silver medal too, which Fillipov’s father, Alexey, attributed to hard work, proper breathing and essential oils to help him relax under pressure.“What happened is an Olympic miracle, an Olympic fairytale, the kind you always want to believe in,” his father said. The Russians in Bormio duly celebrated. But not everyone here was as joyous.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

By the end, the yellow and navy stronghold had emptied and the Forest fans present savoured every moment. “Can we play you every week?” they sang, and then: “Where’s your famous atmosphere?”Evangelos Marinakis’s grand ambition at the outset of this season, before moving on to his fourth manager since August, was to win this competition across the Bosphorus at Besiktas in May and, for all of the chaos and valid criticism, on this evidence it is very much an achievable aim. Forest are in a position of power beforeFenerbahcevisit for the second leg next Thursday.Fenerbahce v Nottingham Forest: Europa League playoff, first leg – liveRead moreFor Pereira, who shared beers with Wolves supporters during happier times last season, it was a flask of ginger-infused tea post-match here. The Portuguese tapped his temples as he stressed the overarching factor he felt propelled Forest to victory.“When I analysed the squad, I accepted the job because I believe in the quality of the players,” he said. “I believe in the club, the president and the supporters. This is about confidence. The difference is the way they started the game. This is mental. It is what I asked them, that mentally they must be ready to face a team in this stadium with the passion of their supporters. We needed to send a message to them from the first minute.”Murillo is the buccaneering Brazilian centre-back with a penchant for shooting from distance and his fourth Forest goal and second this season opened the scoring in style. Igor Jesus headed in from a corner routine at the end of the first half and Morgan Gibbs-White capped the scoring on 50 minutes.By that point Forest should have led by a bigger margin. Midway through the second half Pereira had the luxury of being able to withdraw Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson, presumably with the bigger picture and Liverpool’s visit to the City Ground on Sunday in mind.View image in fullscreenVítor Pereira is off to a winning start.Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/ReutersPereira counts Fenerbahce among his 13 previous clubs but while this iteration are hunting a 29th Turkish league title, on the night they laboured and their experienced spine creaked, unable to cope with Forest’s zeal. Fenerbahce have never progressed from a major European tie when they have lost the first leg, going out on all 26 occasions, not that Pereira is getting carried away.“It was a good result but it is half-time and I know very well that Fener will be very tough in the second game,” the Forest head coach said. “We need to prepare mentally to face this team.”At first glance Murillo, back after missing Forest’s previous two matches, is an unlikely goalscorer but that would be to diminish the defender’s appetite to contribute at the other end of the pitch. He set the tone in his second Forest game, picking the ball up in the centre circle at Crystal Palace, whizzing past four opponents and hitting a stinging strike at opposition goalkeeper Sam Johnstone from the edge of the box.His only other goal this season, the opener at Anfield in Forest’s 3-0 win over Liverpool, was a significant occasion and a smart touch and finish, but this was in a different class. Murillo seized the ball just inside the Fenerbahce half and, blinkers on, set off with one thing in his mind. He brushed off N’Golo Kanté and then Jayden Oosterwolde, powering towards the edge of the box where his diagonal left-foot strike flew into the bottom corner of Ederson’s goal, via Milan Skriniar’s left boot. Domenico Tedesco, the Fenerbahce head coach who had lost only three matches since taking charge last September, shook his head in disbelief but more pain ensued.View image in fullscreenMurillo celebrates his goal in the first half to put Nottingham Forest ahead.Photograph: Raddad Jebarah/ShutterstockIgor Jesus doubled Forest’s lead from a well-worked corner approaching the interval. Forest had run through corners and free-kicks during the pre-match warmup: practice makes perfect?Gibbs-White did brilliantly at the front post to flick Anderson’s delivery towards the back post, where Igor Jesus leapt above Mert Muldur to head in.Tedesco threw off his jacket after half an hour and was booked for raging at the Swiss referee, Sandro Schärer, for not giving a first-half penalty against Murillo for handball. Talisca’s first-time effort cannoned against his left arm but it would have been extremely harsh.The heat only heightened after the restart when Gibbs-White put Forest in dreamland. Omari Hutchinson scooped the ball into Igor Jesus, played onside by Nelson Semedo, and the striker spied Gibbs-White in his peripheral vision. Gibbs-White, off balance, nudged the ball through the legs of Ederson.Gibbs-White celebrated as he usually does, putting his fingers to his ears. Forest had killed the game – and potentially the tie – inside 50 memorable minutes and emphatically muted Fenerbahce. Now the only sound was the sarcasticolésfrom the travelling support.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueFenerbahceNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The buildup has been marred by racist abuse on social media of the Ireland second row Edwin Edogbo, after the 23-year-old made his debut from the replacements’ bench intheir win against Italyin round two.Power points: scrum battle could be crucial in England v Ireland clashRead moreItoje said the abuse of Edogbo was “incredibly sad” and spelled out the danger of the online world, explaining why he believes the wider damage it is causing will become clear. “Social media has been a force for good in many ways but it’s also been a force for negativity in a lot of other ways,” Itoje said.“I think it’s really important for athletes, as well as ordinary people, not to live their life based on what social media says about them. Because it would be a horrible way to live your life. I would advise all top-level athletes not to spend too much time on social media because it’s really corrosive.“My hypothesis is we’re going to see in the coming years a huge amount of damage that has been done to us as humans, and as a society, as a result of social media in terms of brains and brain development.”Itoje also pointed to the modern media landscape being one of extremes, explaining that he tries to maintain a sense of perspective whether he is praised or criticised. “Social media is very dangerous because even when it is positive it can be corrosive,” he said.“While I have a huge amount of respect for everyone in this room, [in mainstream media] what tends to happen is the positive news is extremely positive, and the negative extremely negative. In reality, you’re always somewhere in the middle.View image in fullscreenEdwin Edogbo made his debut for Ireland in the win over Italy but suffered racist abuse on social media afterwards.Photograph: INPHO/Shutterstock“If you just go with what the headlines say, or what they say on social media, it’s a horrible way to live your life because you become a slave to what other people say about you.”Itoje said the abuse of Edogbo demonstrates the battle against racism must continue but that he also believes there is some progress being made. “The stuff around Edwin is incredibly sad,” he said. “It’s something no one should have to go through and it’s a reminder there is still work to do. While the stuff we’re seeing – whether it’sVinícius Júnioror Edwin Edogbo – is terribly sad and we as a community need to keep on stamping this type of thing out.“But I do also believe that we are moving in somewhat the right direction. But moving in the right direction is not a given. It takes work. I think we all need to constantly remind ourselves of the work that we need to do.”The Ireland head coach,Andy Farrell, has dropped the fly-half Sam Prendergast from his matchday squad to face England after their narrow victory against Italy in Dublin. Jack Crowley of Munster starts at No 10 with Leinster’s Ciarán Frawley providing cover on the bench after Farrell made five changes to his starting team. Jamison Gibson-Park returns to start at scrum-half, replacing Craig Casey, with Tadhg Furlong, Tadhg Beirne and Josh van der Flier restored to the pack.“Jack Crowley starts because of what we’ve seen and how he’s come through and performed,” Farrell said, before backing Prendergast to recover from his omission. “Sam’s a fantastic international player, he’s on a journey that’s obviously learning, like all of us. That will never stop. It’s the same for Ciarán Frawley. We’ve talked all along about the lads competing against one another, and the balance is right for this team this weekend.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamMaro ItojeIreland rugby union teamAndy FarrellSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Argentinian faces a 10-game ban if found guilty by Uefa.Mourinho accused of gaslighting for response to Vinícius’ allegation of racismRead moreBenfica’s manager, José Mourinho, appeared to suggest Vinícius had been provocative with his “stupid” goal celebration. Rosenior refused to comment on Mourinho’s views, citing the current investigation, but believes the Brazil forward “was upset for a reason”.“Any form of racism in society, let alone football, is unacceptable,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “What I would say is when you see a player upset, how Vinícius Júnior was upset, normally they’re upset for a reason.“II cannot speak about an incident where an investigation is ongoing. I won’t speak about that incident. ’ve been racially abused myself. I know people who have been racially abused. What people have to understand is when you are judged for something that you should be proud of, it is the worst feeling you can ever possibly imagine. There are historical things to racism. I need to, as manager of this unbelievable football club, make my statement on it. If any player or any coach or any manager is ever found guilty of racism, they shouldn’t be in the game. It’s as simple as that for me.”Asked what he had made of Mourinho’s comments, Rosenior said: “Again, it’s context. What I would say is regardless how a player celebrates, race should never come into it. That is an ongoing investigation. I don’t know the context of the situation. I don’t know the context in which José said what he said, and I won’t make a judgment on it. It’s the same thing. I won’t make a judgment until you get the facts.”Rosenior, who revealed it was his decision to tell Chelsea’s players to “get some sun” this week after an unrelenting schedule this season before they face Burnley on Saturday, blamed growing divisions in modern society on certain sections of the media “who make prejudgments on people”.“There are a lot of things that need to change in our society,” he said. “I’m not talking about football. There’s a lot of division. There’s a lot of people in the media who make prejudgments on people or how they behave or who they are based on a sexual orientation, what country they come from, what religion they are, what colour of skin they have.“It sickens me, to be honest. I think it’s a wider debate than just football. I think people need to be held a lot more accountable than they are at the moment in terms of social media, in terms of the press, to make sure that these things are stamped out, because everybody should be judged equally based on the content of the character.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaLiam RoseniornewsShareReuse this content"

That significant landmark for the club was fittingly accompanied by a special goal from Park, whose curling strike completed a 5-0 aggregate victory and boosted her chances of starting for England in March.Controversial Women’s FA Cup plans on hold after pushback from clubs, players and fansRead more“She genuinely is an incredible footballer,” said Skinner. “Jess just excites me, she excites the team, she excites the fans. As soon as it leaves her foot, you know it’s in. As soon as you know she’s in a space, you know she’s going to hit the target.“In the second half when [she] hit the post, it was beautiful football and that makes me feel good. The win makes me feel good, but when my team play with a flow and a vibe, and I can feel them interchange, that’s beautiful.”Skinner, who confirmed his side’s quarter-final home leg will be played at Old Trafford, added: “I think she’s incredible. I’m happy to be the one that’s helping her be unleashed this season.”Holding a commanding 3-0 lead after the first leg, United similarly took control during the first half of this game, when Julia Zigiotti Olme swept home the opening goal with a decisively struck, low finish after a move in which United passed their way through their opponents’ backline far too easily.Prior to that, the away side had actually made a bright start and they should have taken the lead, with Synne Jensen twice being denied by good saves from Phallon Tullis-Joyce, either side of a chance for Lea Schüller at the other end, where the United centre-forward chested a long ball down superbly to run through on goal but was denied by a strong save. Melvine Malard also had a swerving strike parried by Lola Gallardo before Zigiotti Olme eventually beat her.There was nothing the 32-year-old goalkeeper could do about Park’s sublime strike to make it 2-0 shortly before half-time, though. Receiving a short corner, Park opened her body up and bent a sumptuous effort into the far, top-right corner that drew gasps from the crowd at Leigh Sports Village.View image in fullscreenJulia Zigiotti Olme (left) and Jess Park can sleep easy after booking Manchester United’s quarter-final place.Photograph: Morgan Harlow/UEFA/Getty ImagesPark has come into form at the perfect time, before the Lionesses meet for their first camp of 2026, travelling to Turkey next week to prepare to face Ukraine in a World Cup qualifier on 3 March, before they host Iceland on 7 March.The United winger’s chances of featuring prominently have been aided by the absence of the Arsenal forward Beth Mead, and this may therefore be her chance to shine.She continued showing dazzling touches with her quick feet after half-time, looking increasingly relaxed with the ball at her feet, and she raced clear down the right flank and played a perfect square pass to the substitute Ellen Wangerheim, in space inside the area, but her shot was straight at the goalkeeper.Park would later strike the inside of the post, after skipping inside to shoot from a favourable angle, before being substituted to a standing ovation as she came off for a rest on 78 minutes.The visitors went down to 10 players late on when Xènia Pérez received a second yellow card for fouling Wangerheim, but the tie was won long beforehand and Skinner, while acknowledging that Bayern Munich would be the favourites for their quarter-final, says nobody will want to face Manchester United in this competition.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueManchester United WomenAtlético Madrid WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Until now.Hull KR’s rollercoaster ride from the depths to chance of World Club Challenge gloryRead moreAt the turn of the century, there very nearly wasn’t even a Hull KR. Crippled by financial ruin and with crowds barely exceeding 1,000 on occasions as they languished in the second and third tiers, the notion of nights like these ever becoming a reality was nothing other than impossible for a club suffocated by the grip of failure.Even more recently, Hull KR finished bottom of Super League in 2020 – spared from relegation only by Toronto Wolfpack’s demise due to the Covid-19 pandemic. And now? Little over five years later, Rovers are not only Super League champions, they are champions of the world, winners of the World Club Challenge for the very first time in their history.The way they did it was utterly spellbinding too. For almost an hour Rovers were practically faultless against a Brisbane side who were dubbed heavy favourites. They led 30-6 going into the final quarter and the notion of a landslide win against the NRL premiers seemed to be firmly on the cards.Of course, this Brisbane side, littered with world-class talent, would never completely roll over – and they almost threatened to complete one of the greatest comeback the game has ever seen. Three tries in five minutes made it 30-20 before Kotoni Staggs scored with three minutes left to leave a sell-out crowd on the edge of their seats.But Rovers dug deep and held on to become only the fifth Super League team in the modern era to win the World Club Challenge. “We were unbelievable for an hour,” Willie Peters, the man who has masterminded this rise, said. “We had a plan and while we lost it and the momentum, we had to find a way – and we did.”This was also a nice tonic for the English game after the disappointment of last year’s Ashes defeat; Super League teams have now won the last three World Club Challenge games. As Peters said, for almost an hour, the Super League champions were magnificent. Their kicking game spearheaded by the brilliance of Mikey Lewis.View image in fullscreenPeta Hiku scores Hull KR’s fifth try.Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/ShutterstockHe was instrumental in the early tries for Tom Amone and Elliot Minchella that made it 12-0 before Joe Burgess exploited a Brisbane error to make it 18-0 in the blink of an eye. The Broncos had been stunned, and the fact they managed to at least erode the deficit somewhat before the break with Gehamat Shibasaki’s clever try kept them in the game.But just like in the first half, it was the Super League side who started the better after the restart. Within nine minutes, another Lewis kick led to Oliver Gildart scoring before Tyrone May’s clever kick found Peta Hiku. With Rovers converting all five tries, it was suddenly 30-6 and the contest seemed like it was done.But the entertainment was just beginning. After a laborious opening hour, Brisbane came alive. Patrick Carrigan finished a long-range move before Deine Mariner broke from deep after the resulting kick-off. When the outstanding Reece Walsh’spass enabled Shibasaki to score his second two minutes later, the gap was suddenly down to 10 points.Hull KR held off any further Brisbane threat: until the final four minutes when Staggs finished another brilliant Broncos move. But Adam Reynolds missed the conversion, as he had earlier in the contest – meaning Rovers had a lead of six points. It was tense, it was nerve-shredding: but despite another late threat from the NRL champions in the final seconds, the Robins held on for rugby league immortality.Hull KR’s longstanding owner, Neil Hudgell – the man who has rescued them from financial disaster on several occasions in the past 25 years – warned last week that anyone fortunate enough to be in attendance should enjoy the moment, because you never know when it may arrive again.But, right now, it feels like the good times at this club, now the world’s greatest, will not come to an end any time soon.Explore more on these topicsHull KRBrisbane BroncosRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Made captain for the night by Mikel Arteta in the continued absence of Martin Ødegaard, Saka celebrated his rare headed goal by mimicking signing the lucrative contract to 2030, worth more than £300,000 a week, that was announced byArsenalon Thursday. But his broad smile had turned to a frown by the time he faced the television cameras in the tunnel at Molineux.Arteta accepts Arsenal ‘have to blame ourselves’ after blowing lead at WolvesRead more“I’m very disappointed with the result and especially how we played in the second half, it’s far from the level that we’ve set this season,” said Saka, who was substituted in the 73rd minute with Arsenal leading 2-1. “It’s time for us to reflect on the past few performances and just fix the issues immediately so we can get back to winning games and going on a run and build momentum because we’ve lost that a bit right now.”Asked whether he and his teammates are “feeling the pressure” in the title race, he added: “No, I don’t think about all of that. We need to just get back to our level, just do the basics right. We’ve got more than enough quality in this team to win games, especially the games where we’ve been dropping points recently.”Saka was right to recognise Arsenal’s growing tendency to squander leads. They have dropped seven points from winning positions since the turn of the year, compared with only two between August and December, and won only two of their past seven league games.Quick GuideArsenal announce new Saka contract to 2030ShowBukayo Saka has said he wants to \"win everything\" with Arsenal after signing a new contract to 2030 and believes the club will make history in the coming years. The academy product's deal had been due to expire in 2027 and his improved terms are worth more than £300,000 a week.\"I feel immense joy to continue my journey at this club,\" Saka told Arsenal's media channels. \"For me, it was an easy commitment and I just hope to win everything here. The journey that I've been on, from where I started to where I am now, and the journey the team's been on as well, is a special one. I believe the next few years are going to be the years that we get over the line, and we're able to win trophies and make history for this club. We're back where we belong, fighting for everything.”Arsenal have been Premier League runners-up for the past three seasons and threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Wolves on Wednesday. Saka said he was determined to reward the fans for their support.\"When I go out for dinner, when I go on holiday, no matter where I go, I feel that love, that energy. In my heart, I just want to repay that.\"Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Yet even if Saka says he does not think about it, there is no ignoring the deep scars that three successive runners-up finishes have left in Arsenal’s squad. It was noticeable how panic spread throughout the team when Hugo Bueno pulled one back for Wolves with half an hour to play.Of those who featured on Wednesday, only Saka, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhães, Leandro Trossard, Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli were around the last time Arsenal let slip a significant lead over City, back in 2023, after they had spent 248 days top of the table. But even Martín Zubimendi – who joined only last summer – Jurriën Timber and Declan Rice seemed to lose their composure as Wolves hunted an equaliser.The mix-up between the usually reliable David Raya and Gabriel that finally led to the teenager Tom Edozie’s goal on his memorable debut was symptomatic of the doubts that have crept into Arsenal’s recent performances.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta has overseen only two wins in Arsenal’s last seven league matches.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesArteta could not hide his anger afterwardsbut perhaps it is an indication of the delicate emotional line he is treading with his players that the Arsenal manager seemed wary of going too far. “It is very easy now, in the emotions, to start to say things that can damage the team,” he said. “That’s the worst decision that you can make, because everybody wants to do their best, nobody questions that. We were not at the level and the standards that are required. When you do that, and you want to be at this level, you have to take the hit.”What will concern Arteta even more is that City will have the chance to exert extra psychological pressure if they can beat Newcastle on Saturday and cut the lead to two points before Arsenal travel to face Tottenham on Sunday in the north London derby. Despite Arsenal leading the Premier League table since 4 October – 138 days and counting – if Pep Guardiola’s side were to win all 12 of their remaining matches, including their showdown with Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium in April, then they would be crowned champions again.That scenario does not bear thinking about for Arsenal’s supporters, although they will fear it is becoming increasingly more likely. City have shown remarkable consistency in the final third of the season that could prove decisive again. In 2023, they managed 31 points from 36 as Arsenal picked up only 21 to concede the title before holding off a strong challenge from Arteta’s side the following season by outscoring them 32 to 31.Even last year, when they suffered a mid-season meltdown and lost nine games out of 12 in all competitions, City managed 27 points from their final 12 matches compared with Arsenal’s 21 and finished just three behind Arteta’s runners-up to Liverpool in the end.Saka, who stated his desire to “win wearing this badge” last year having picked up only an FA Cup winner’s medal so far, must find a way to change the narrative.Explore more on these topicsArsenalBukayo SakafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Try one of our five alternativesWhat if games ended at 90 minutes, set-pieces goals were scrapped, or shots that hit the woodwork counted?ByOpta AnalystRyan BensonThu 19 Feb 2026 10.14 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAleague table is a pretty helpful barometer of each team’s fortunes. That’s why we use it to decide where teams finish at the end of the season. However, league tables do not tell us the wholestory. Arsenal are top in reality (just about), but they might not be in all of our alternativePremier Leaguetables.First half v second halfFootball is most certainlya game of two halves. It may not come as much of a shock to learn the table changes quite drastically when looking at first-half or second-half results in isolation.Some teams will be fitter or mentally stronger than others, and this may contribute to them being better in second halves. Similarly, others are more fired up in the first half and this can contribute to them running out of steam later.A good place to start is withManchester City. You might remember that, across their first six league games of 2026, they didn’t score a single goal in the second half of matches – they did score six first-half goals, however.That is very much in keeping with their first-half superiority over the whole season. If we only considered results at half-time, City would be nine points clear ofArsenalat the summit. But if we look at second halves in isolation, they would drop to sixth, 13 points behindArsenal.View image in fullscreenBut that’s not the starkest difference.Manchester Unitedgo from fourth in the first-half table to 13th in the second-half table; Aston Villa are 13th in the first, second in the second; West Ham slide all the way from 10th in the half-time table to 20th in the second-half standings (albeit with a game in hand on Wolves).It would seem there is a slight correlation between teams who do well in the second half and those that are younger; the top 10 of the second-half table (26 years, 91 days) are, on average, 224 days younger (starting XIs only) than those in the bottom 10 (26 years, 315 days). This might not be enough to jump to conclusions, though.There is also game state to consider. If a team is winning at half-time by at least two clear goals, they don’t need to ‘win’ the second half as well. For example, Manchester City led Fulham 3-0 at the break last week, which is how the game finishes, so they technically only drew the second half. With the three points already in the bag, the hosts did not need to bust a gut to score again.View image in fullscreenSay goodbye to stoppage timePremier League referees are adding more and more stoppage time at the end of matches. It’s no longer unusual to see eight, nine or even 10 minutes shown on the fourth official’s board around the 90th minute. But what if games ended on the 90-minute mark? Stoppage-time goals wouldn’t be a thing and that would impact certain clubs.Leeds, for instance, would be five places better off in 10th if we removed all goals scored after the 90th minute. That’s because they have conceded nine in the league this season, more than anyone else. Everton and Fulham, however, would each drop three places if their stoppage-time goals were suddenly taken away from them.Liverpool have had a problem with late concessions, but they have also scored a few, so they would only be two points better off if stoppage-time goals were removed. Still, that would be enough to put them fourth, trading places with Manchester United.View image in fullscreenOut with set piecesSet pieces are sotrendy at the moment, but what if teams just didn’t bother with them? Admittedly, we are requiring you to really stretch your imagination here, but that’s the point of our alternative tables.So, in this alternate universe, goals from set pieces and penalties aren’t a thing, and it probably won’t take you long to work out who would lose out the most in such a dimension.Arsenal’s points total would decrease by eight without goals from set pieces and penalties. After all, 21 of their 52 goals in the league this term have come from set plays and spot-kicks.Aston Villa would also be big losers, seeing their points total reduce by seven, while Everton and Sunderland would each miss out on six.The biggest winners would be Burnley as they have only scored nine set-piece or penalty goals but have conceded 19. Other beneficiaries would be Brighton and Bournemouth, the latter of whom have let in more set-piece/penalty goals than any other team this term (20).View image in fullscreen(Re)moving the goalpostsWhat if every shot that hit the post or crossbar actually went in? It’s a light-hearted hypothetical, so don’t take it too seriously. The point is to show how fine the margins are. After all, the width of a goalpost or crossbar is 12 centimetres, though the curvature of the goal frame means it’s slightly less in reality – as such, a team can feasibly miss out on a title, European place or safety by a matter of centimetres.Of course, teams also benefit from having their own post/crossbar struck, it’s not just a one-way street. But it doesn’t happen in equal measure.It stands to reason that the better teams might benefit more in our hypothetical woodwork table. Better teams generally have more shots and face fewer than the worst sides, so they’re more likely to hit the post/crossbar than their opponents.But Arsenal would be among the biggest losers in a world without goalposts. Fulham would lose the most points (five), followed by Aston Villa (four), but then it’s Arsenal (three). That would see them drop down to third in the table because we also have to take into consideration the outputs of other teams. Manchester City would gain four points to go top, and Manchester United earn an extra 10 points to shoot up to second, ahead of Arsenal on goal difference.View image in fullscreenUnited have hit the woodwork 18 times in the league this season, four more than any other team. Also, only Brentford (three) and Chelsea (six) have seen their own post/bar hit less often than United (seven).What does it all mean, then? Well, we put it somewhere between everything and nothing. The actual Premier League table will continue to reign supreme, though these alternatives at least serve to remind us of the sport’s rollercoaster nature and that there is often more to it than meets the eye.This is an article byOpta AnalystExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueGuardian Sport NetworkManchester CityArsenalManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her departure comes months after she unveiled a five-year creative vision for the Barbican.“We are writing as a group of global majority creative and cultural leaders and allies to express our profound disappointment and alarm at the decision to curtail Devyani Saltzman’s tenure,”the letter said.“Ms Saltzman was appointed with great fanfare as a senior artistic leader, with a mandate to shape the Barbican’s artistic vision and deepen its relationship with communities. Her departure, after a comparatively short time in post and coinciding with the arrival of a new chief executive, raises serious questions about the institution’s commitment to sustaining global majority leadership at the highest levels.”Saltzman will leave the organisation in May and there are no plans to replace her. In the last 18 months she had become the Barbican’s public face, laying out her vision in several interviews.She was vocal about the need for London’s cultural institutions to have leadership reflecting the diverse city they inhabit. “We are actually in a new wave of next-generation leadership that hopefully is going to shift the model,” she said in 2024.The Barbican has said it is unable to comment on individual staffing matters. But signatories of the letter, who also include the Grammy-nominated sitarist and composer Anoushka Shankar, the musician and producerNitin Sawhney, the American playwright David Adjmi and the Indian novelist Kiran Desai, said this was “not an ordinary HR issue”.“This is a major public cultural institution, funded and held in trust for the people of this city and country. A decision affecting its most senior artistic role, and one of the very few leaders of south Asian and racially diverse heritage in its history, has sector‑wide and community‑wide implications,” they said.Other signatories include the Pakistani-British novelist Kamila Shamsie, the Armenian-Canadian film-makerAtom Egoyan, the British curator Mark Sealy and the former British Council arts director Skinder Hundal. Many have worked with, in and around the Barbican over decades.Barbican arts director to leave, months after revealing creative vision for centreRead moreThey called on the Barbican board and the City of London Corporation to publicly clarify whether the role had been formally deleted, the processes that led to the decision, and how artistic leadership at the Barbican would now be configured.They also asked for the publication of data on the diversity of the Barbican’s senior leadership and governance.In a response seen by the Guardian, the Barbican’s chair, William Russell, reiterated that he was unable to comment on a confidential matter concerning a staff member, and he linked to the centre’spress statementcelebrating Saltzman’s contribution.The Barbican’s leadership has had several changes over the past five years. In 2021, Nicholas Kenyon resigned as managing director after 14 years after staff told the Guardian that the Barbican was“institutionally racist”. He was followed by the former BBC arts correspondent Will Gompertz, who left aftertwo yearsin the job.Saltzman joined during a row caused by the Barbicanbacking outof hosting a talk by Mishra about the Holocaust and allegations that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.The Barbican has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBarbicanLondonSalman RushdiePankaj MishraJohn AkomfrahNitin SawhneyAtom EgoyannewsShareReuse this content"

Blame for the West Kordofan attack has been directed at the Sudanese army; while the RSF has been accused of carrying out the strike in North Kordofan.Since April 2023, the RSF has been waging war against the army aftera falling outbetween its commander, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, and the army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, former allies who came to power after the 2019 Sudanese revolution ousted longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir.The RSF has been backed by the United Arab Emirates, a position the Gulf state denies despiteevidence compiledby the UN, independent experts and reporters.The group grew out of the Janjaweed militias, notorious for atrocities committed in the early 2000s in a ruthless campaign in Darfur that killed 300,000 people and drove 2.7 million from their homes.The war, the latest crisis in Sudan’s history of violence, has forced 11 million people to flee their homes and killed tens of thousands, triggering what the UN calls one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.View image in fullscreenSudanese refugee Jeda Abdullah is placed on a drip by a doctor at the Sudanese-run Hope and Haven for Refugees Association clinic in Adre, Chad.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThe fact-finding report said that after the seizure of El Fasher, the RSF inflicted “three days of absolute horror” and that thousands of people, particularly from the Zaghawa ethnic group, werekilled, raped or disappeared.Othman said: “The scale, coordination and public endorsement of the operation by senior RSF leadership demonstrate that the crimes committed in and around El Fasher were not random excesses of war. They formed part of a planned and organised operation that bears the defining characteristics of genocide.”View image in fullscreenGoods being transported between a Sudanese border town and Adre in Chad.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesInvestigators said RSF militiamen had acted with impunity and “with genocidal intent” and that as conflict’s focus shifts from Darfur to Kordofan, outside countries must act decisively to hold perpetrators to account “and bring an end to this senseless violence”.The mission interviewed 320 witnesses and victims from El Fasher and the surrounding areas, including in investigative visits toChadand South Sudan. It authenticated, verified and corroborated 25 videos.A Sudanese massacre foretold: the grim familiarity of the RSF’s rampage through El FasherRead moreThe report documents widespread sexual violence against girls and women aged seven to 70, including those who were pregnant. Survivors said they were attacked in front of family members, with the assaults often involving severe physical abuse.In one incident, a 12-year-old girl was raped by three RSF fighters as her mother watched, moments after her father was killed while trying to shield her. The girl later died from her injuries.According to the findings, such assaults frequently occurred at the same locations where mass killings had taken place, including El Saudi hospital and El Fasher University. Witnesses said RSF fighters also carried out public gang rapes of at least 19 women in rooms strewn with corpses, among them the bodies of the victims’ husbands.On Thursday the US announced that it was placing sanctions on three RSF commanders over their roles in the siege and capture of El Fasher. The US Treasury said the RSF had carried out “ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence” in the operation.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaChadUnited NationsUnited Arab EmiratesnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: 1100 FarmFaaborgs rail against oppressive industrial agricultural system with unexpected evolution into indie artisan food firmByTom DugginsThu 19 Feb 2026 07.45 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 09.58 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAs a sixth-generation Iowa farmer, Tanner Faaborg is all too aware that agricultural traditions are hard to shake. So when he set in motion plans to change his family’s farm from a livestock operation housing more than 8,000 pigs each year to one that grows lion’s mane and oyster mushrooms, he knew some of his peers might laugh at him. He just did not necessarily expect his brother to be chief among them.“My older brother has worked with pigs his entire adult life, managing about 70,000 of them across five counties,” Faaborg says. “But we got to a point where he went from laughing at me to saying: well, I guess maybe I’ll quit my job and help you out.”“Now he’s the most dedicated,” says Katherine Jernigan, director of the Transfarmation Project at Mercy for Animals, a non-profit that helped the Faaborgs make the switch and set up their new business,1100 Farm. “He’s the most in tune with which mushrooms are growing well.”Set up in 2019, the Transfarmation Project works with farms across the US that want to ditch industrial animal agriculture, which is typically done as contract work on behalf of big meat companies, and move toward a sustainable, fully independent business model.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Tammy, Rand, Tanner and Tyler Faaborg.Photograph: 1100 farmThey provide guidance on how to repurpose existing infrastructure for different crops, but also business advice on how to find the market, set up a website, establish a brand and sell directly to consumers. They also provide research and innovation grants that can help with the finances of making the transition. The Faaborgs now use their crop of functional mushrooms to create products such as tinctures and salts that are sold directly to consumers online.The idea is to move beyond a form of intensive farming that has a hugely detrimental impact on the environment, but also to protect the farmers themselves, many of whom find that the concentrated animal-feeding operation (Cafo) model takes a toll on their mental health. In that regard, the Faaborgs’ story is quite typical of a sector in which agricultural consolidation has had a negative impact on individuals and communities.“We used to have all these independent farms,” Faaborg says, “but people with money felt it was important to own every facet of the operation. Own the pigs, own the feed, own the distribution lines, but then contract out the work.View image in fullscreenThe farm now produces exotic mushroom varieties such as pink oyster.Photograph: 1100 farm“Our family used to have this homesteading lifestyle with some chickens and a big orchard, where we would go out and collect eggs in the morning, really living off the land … every animal had a name, we enjoyed the chores, harvesting, picking weeds.”That changed for the Faaborgs about 30 years ago when someone from one of the big meat companies knocked on their door. They were offered loans in order to build several large hog barns and adopt the Cafo model. The plan was to pay back the money over a decade and then have a higher household income. However, it came with a different, non-financial cost.“It became more: we have an employer, we have a job, we have to go out there and do these things to collect this check, to pay the bills and pay back the loan. That takes a toll on your mental health. It changes how you feel. It takes away your sense of pride and self-worth.”View image in fullscreenA rack of lion's mane mushrooms.Photograph: 1100 farmGovernment figures suggests that about 10 years ago, the population of rural, small-town America firstbegan to decline, with young people increasingly moving to urban areas for economic opportunities. Many farmers that the Transfarmation Project speak to have found themselves struggling with the large amounts of debt taken on in the Cafo model, which can become unmanageable. Much of their work lies in showing that a different model is possible, closer to the autonomy of old.“The bigger picture is not just to transition individual farms but to show that a different system is possible,” Jernigan says. “We hear from farmers who are in despair: they feel they are bad farmers or have done something wrong. But helping them see they are part of this system where it’s almost impossible for them to succeed … I can’t state how far that goes in helping them understand there are solutions out there.”For the Faaborgs, the switch has made them feel excited about their work and its connection to nature. They want others to know that a different future is possible.“Our family is not a likely candidate for this story and for this success,” Faaborg says. “We’re not like a hippy family, or a rich family who had spare money and said: ‘Yeah, this will be fun.’ My dad was a welder for about 40 years. We had the hog barns for more than 30 years. My parents were not into change. But if our family can do it, any family can do it.”Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesFoodFarmingMeat industrySustainable developmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For author Beth Gardiner, metal water bottles and canvas tote bags are not the solution. So what is?Thu 19 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 07.34 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleLike many of us who are mindful of our plastic consumption, Beth Gardiner would take her own bags to the supermarket and be annoyed whenever she forgot to do so. Out without her refillable bottle, she would avoid buying bottled water. “Here I am, in my own little life, worrying about that and trying to use less plastic,” she says. Then she readan article in this newspaper, just over eight years ago, and discovered that fossil fuel companies had ploughed more than $180bn (£130bn) into plastic plants in the US since 2010. “It was a kick in the teeth,” says Gardiner. “You’re telling me that while I am beating myself up because I forgot to bring my water bottle, all these huge oil companies are pouring billions …” She looks appalled. “It was just such a shock.”Two months before that piece was published, a photograph of a seahorse clinging to a plastic cotton bud had gone viral; two years before that England followed Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and introduced a charge for carrier bags. “I was one of so many people who were trying to use less plastic – and it just felt like such a moment of revelation: these companies are, on the contrary, increasing production and wanting to push [plastic use] up and up.” Then, says Gardiner, as she started researching her book Plastic Inc: BigOil, Big Money and the Plan to Trash our Future, “it only becomes more shocking.”Her research took her to Reserve, Louisiana, in the Lower Mississippi River, where she met Robert Taylor, an activist in his 80s who has spent much of his life living by an enormous plastics plant. “He is surrounded by illness, by all kinds of cancers. He only found out in 2016, as a result of federal action, that the levels of toxic gases had gone through the roof in his area, an overwhelmingly Black neighbourhood. He told me about all the illness in his family – affecting his wife and his daughter, his neighbours and his cousins. It was haunting. When we talk about plastic, we tend to think about the ways we experience it in our own lives, and we’re not as aware of the production and the impact it has on the people who live beside it.”View image in fullscreenActivist Robert Taylor’s neighbourhood in the Lower Mississippi River area is exposed to toxic gases from a plastics plant.Photograph: Emily Kask/AFP/Getty ImagesIn Indonesia, Gardiner visited a hill of dumped plastic. The material was “as far as the eye could see. I walked around on top of it, and picked up packaging from brands that I know, both in the UK and the US, and in European languages.” It had been dumped by a paper factory that imports waste paper, in bundles that are contaminated with plastic – possibly the plastic we think we are recycling. “It was very sobering to be on the other side of the world and see these brands.”Gardiner was not naive – an environmental journalist from the US, now based in London, she had written a book, Choked, on air pollution. She was well aware of the tactics and impact of the oil industry. But she was still shocked. “I think what stood out most is the deliberateness and intentionality over the years of pushing plastic into our lives,” she says. “If you look back to the 50s and 60s, when this model of disposability was being invented, there are speeches given at plastics industry conferences, saying: ‘We can make so much more money by selling a bottle that will be thrown out than selling a bottle that gets reused 20 or 40 times.’ I guess what shocked me the most is the deliberate way that they built this world that we live in. They understood the impact, the consequences, and they saw the profit that it offered and that overrode everything else.”double quotation markThey understand that that shift away from fossil fuels is a threat to their entire business model that has been so profitableIn the past 20 years, Gardiner writes, plastic production has doubled, and it will double again, perhaps triple, in the near future. Petrochemicals for plastic are, she says, “expected to be the largest single driver of oil demand in the decades to come. Obviously these oil companies can see what’s coming – they understand that that shift away from fossil fuels is a threat to their business model that has been so profitable for them.” Plastic, she says, “is a way for them to keep drilling and to keep making money. Putting their expertise and muscle into solar or wind power was not the way they wanted to go. It’s not as profitable as selling oil and gas, so they’re all in on the current model, and plastic is a way to perpetuate it. Which is why it is, I guess, even more catastrophic. Because if it’s enabling the industry to keep drilling, to keep selling oil and gas, that is a huge threat to the climate.”The extraction and transport of fossil fuels, and manufacturing and disposal of plastics, all create carbon emissions. According to the UN,in 2019, plastics generated 1.8bn tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions– 3.4% of total global emissions.Meanwhile plastic has contaminated the planet. Microplastics –created when plastic degrades – have been found in the deepest ocean and on top of Mount Everest. They’re in food, water and the air we breathe. Studies have shown the presence of microplastics in humans, and although the reliability of tests and the levelsfound has recently been questioned, the presence of microplastics isn’t in doubt.“The research on microplastics is very new, and this is science doing what science needs to do,” says Gardiner. “We don’t know everything we need to know about microplastics, but it’s important to understand that this is only one piece of the health harms. There’s a much longer history of research that is much clearer about the chemicals in plastic that leach into our food, drink, our environment, our bodies.” This includes chemicals that disrupt the endocrine and cardiovascular systems, and are linked to cancer. “We have to wait and see where the research shakes out on microplastics, but I don’t think that should distract us from the bigger picture. Microplastics is just one piece of the health harm that plastics are doing.”View image in fullscreenJustin Hofman’s photo of a seahorse clutching a cotton bud is entitled Sewage Surfer.Photograph: Justin HofmanPlastic is derived from fossil fuels, but the end products – the number of crisp packets I throw away each week, or the new trainers I want – are so far removed from the source that this fact barely registers. It was the same for Gardiner, she admits with a laugh, and she is an environmental journalist. “That inscrutability has been very beneficial to the industry.” Would it help if plastic was rebranded in the popular imagination as a fossil fuel product? “I think so. I guess what I’m trying to do with this book is help people understand the origins of this plastic mess that we’re in, and part of that is understanding who is driving it, and that it’s not us as individuals.”Ironically, plastics were developed in the mid-19th century as a response to environmental concerns, such as elephants being hunted for ivory. Early plastics, such as parkesine and celluloid, were derived from plant-based cellulose, and in the first decades of the 20th century, more plastics, or polymers, followed, the results of experiments with chemicals derived from fossil-fuel processing, and including polystyrene, nylon and PVC. The world’s most common plastic, polyethylene, was created by British chemists in 1933.double quotation markPlastic has always had this unique ability to reverse the relationship between supply and demand“Plastic is supply-driven rather than demand-pulled,” says Gardiner. “Plastic has always had this unique ability to reverse the relationship between supply and demand.” The materials being used were by-products of oil and gas processing. Companies were looking for uses for them – and realised they could make a profit. They wooed the public with promises of convenience and disposability. Plastic, says Gardiner, is “the foundational material of modern consumerism”. It is undoubtedly useful, and because so much was being produced, it is cheap and widely available. Products started appearing, from pens and cigarette lighters to nappies and cups, that used to be reusable. And disposability meant more profit.It wasn’t that the public ignored the harms. “There have always been these moments of potential crisis for the industry,” says Gardiner. “There was a panic over landfill space – that was a big issue in the US in the 70s and 80s. More recently, the David Attenborough [Blue Planet] documentaries and the videos of ocean plastic. These moments of public concern about the impact of waste have bubbled up regularly over the last 50-some years. They are a threat to the industry, and they have a lot of tactics for defusing them.”One of the most effective, she says, is to shift the focus on to individuals. “[People in the plastics industry] are very happy for us to look at ourselves and at each other, and not look at them,” says Gardiner. Plastic was framed not as an overproduction problem, but as a litter problem. In the US in the late 50s, food, drink, cigarette and packaging companies formed the organisation Keep America Beautiful, spending huge amounts on promoting themselves and the message to put rubbish in the correct places. “No one really knew the industry was hiding behind this anodyne name. Keep America Beautiful was widely understood as a civic-minded organisation of some sort.”View image in fullscreenFood, drink, cigarette and packaging companies were behind the Keep America Beautiful campaign.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockIt was a similar story with recycling. “Recycling has been a big part of their arsenal. I think the thing that was so shocking was to read these documents and conference transcripts, going back to the 70s, to see that they understood it is really hard to make plastic recycling work.” They also understood that an attempt at recycling would make consumers less guilty about the waste they were producing – a feeling I know well, every time I smugly dump a bag of soft plastics in a supermarket recycling bin. “They pushed so many myths and lies about recycling.”Recycling has value for materials such as cardboard, glass and cans – “even so, we should be using way less” – and for some plastics, such as PET drinks bottles. But for most plastic, it is inefficient and expensive, and releases harmful toxins. Meanwhile, the plastic degrades each time it’s recycled, simply delaying its eventual final resting place in landfill (or incineration). “They’ve worked very hard to muddy our understanding of what is possible and what recycling can offer,” says Gardiner. “Because the reality is: very little. It’s taking advantage of our desire to be more environmentally sustainable.”View image in fullscreenA mountain of rubbish in Indonesia. The country is now banning imports of plastic.Photograph: Jonas Gratzer/LightRocket/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Gardiner details how the fossil fuel and plastics industry – in many cases one and the same – has lobbied to prevent legislation and scupper bills that would regulate it.Last year, lobbyists flooded UN-hosted talksto derail the global plastics treaty to tackle plastic pollution. A post-Brexit Britain has separated itself from EU regulations on plastic. “The EU has been far from perfect, but they are the most aggressive regulator, both of these chemicals coming from plastics and of single use plastics,” says Gardiner. The US, she says, is “a whole other story”.There is, she says, “zero prospect for any kind of effective regulation of plastics under the Trump administration. Every environmental regulation is going backwards.” In the US, there has been local and state level action, such as in California, which has just extended its ban on plastic bags to include the thicker “bag for life” types, and laws to make plastic producers – rather than the taxpaying public – responsible for the life cycle of their products.View image in fullscreenTexas plastics campaigner Diane Wilson.Photograph: Goldman environmental prizeThere have also been the campaigns by communities and individuals, such as the 30-year fight by Diane Wilson, who took on the plastics giant Formosa which was contaminating the Texas coast with plastic pellets. In Europe, there’s the current battle against the building of what will bethe continent’s biggest plastics plant, in Antwerp. The way the industry retaliates against even the smallest actions shows how worried it is about the potential for knock-on impact, says Gardiner (she writes about the pressure applied to a small town in Arizona which tried to enact a bag ban). “That tells you that those actions matter. It’s hard to see very much optimism now on any environmental issue in the US, but there’s possibility for it.”‘It’s better than plastic and cheaper’: 20 sustainable swaps that worked (and saved you money)Read moreAnd the west is starting to have to deal with its own mess. In 2018, China banned the import of waste, including plastic. “There is this global cat and mouse game where the waste just ends up going somewhere else and it’s a very opaque industry,” says Gardiner. But other countries, such as Indonesia, are also banning the import of our plastic. “There are more recycling plants and incinerators being built in the UK and around Europe,” says Gardiner. “In the UK, a lot of it ends up getting burned. I see these trucks go by because there’s an incinerator nearby, they have this branding on the side, ‘waste to energy’ or something, and you’re supposed to think, ‘Great!’ But they’re burning it.” This creates electricity, but also huge carbon emissions and toxic gases (the plants are usually built in deprived areas).Gardiner still carries her reusable shopping bags, and water bottle. “They do matter, but I’ve shifted my focus. What I’m trying to do with this book is to help people look away from the personal and more towards the political because that is where the difference is to be made.”The thing is, a world before plastic is within living memory, and returning to aspects of it is hardly like going back to the stone age. “You only have to look back to our grandparents’ time, or even our parents’ time. We can use much less plastic without using no plastic, and that is unpicking another industry talking point – they will talk up the environmental benefits, that it’s part of solar panels, and it helps to make cars lighter so they’re more fuel-efficient, and do you want to live in a world with no hygienic syringes? It’s important to challenge that framing, because some of those things are true and we can keep the uses that are essential, but it doesn’t mean that we have to accept this tide of junk. We don’t have to look too far back into our collective memory to see ways that we could live that are less wasteful. It’s not impossible, because it existed.”Plastic Inc: Big Oil, Big Money and the Plan to Trash Our Futureby Beth Gardiner is published by Monoray on 26 February (£22).

They also found no evidence of deliberate misreporting.”The letter called on Miliband to set out what steps he would take to reassess Drax’s eligibility for future subsidies should the investigation by the City watchdog substantiate the concerns raised in the court documents. It also called on him to “take decisive action” to ensure that no further subsidy would be awarded if such practice was uncovered.Drax, which has a stock market value of about £3bn, has become an increasingly important supplier of electricity as the UK switches to intermittent renewable generation such as wind and solar.The tribunal documents were made available to journalists after Rowaa Ahmar, the company’s former head of public affairs, took Drax to court alleging that she was sacked after writing to the chief executive, Will Gardiner, in 2022 to say that the company was “misleading the public, government and its regulator” about the sustainability of the imported pellets.The Guardian revealed late last year that forestry experts believed the company hadcontinued to source 250-year-old treesfrom some of Canada’s oldest forests via the Burns Lake pellet plant as recently as last summer. At the time, Drax said it “does not source biomass from designated areas of old growth and only sources woody biomass from well-managed, sustainable forests”.Chris Hinchliff, one of the MPs to sign the letter, told the Guardian that the “explosive” documents “suggest Drax may have misled ministers, regulators and the public while taking billions in billpayer subsidies”.“That would be indefensible,” he said. “With the FCA now investigating Drax’s past claims, the government must suspend any future contracts until the truth is established. As ministers have already made clear, if Drax is found to be non‑compliant the subsidies stop. If that spells the end of Drax, it has only itself to blame.”The company’s senior leaders, including its chief executive, publicly denied allegations made in a 2022 BBC Panorama documentary that it had burned wood sourced from “old-growth” forests in Canada, and accused the broadcaster of repeating “inaccurate claims about biomass” from “ill-informed” critics.Meanwhile, senior colleagues raised concerns in internal emails and meetings that the company did not have enough evidence to back up the public sustainability claim, according to the tribunal documents.The MP Barry Gardiner, who also signed the letter, said Miliband was “absolutely right toset new sustainability standardsfor Drax” late last year, but added that the “standard of the company’s integrity and transparency” remained in question.“We now await the FCA investigation to see if Drax either lied directly, or deliberately misled the regulator, over its sourcing and sustainability practices. It cannot be right that public subsidy should be paid to the company if that were found to be the case, and suspending payments until the FCA review is concluded is a sensible precautionary step,” he said.“The scale of the Drax problem is enormous for Ed Miliband. Drax supplies 5.3% of UK electricity and is a key element of our commitment to decarbonise the entire power sector. That is the dilemma the secretary of state would face in acting to cut Drax adrift. But the directors of Drax should not fool themselves that they are too big to fail. Drax must clean up or close down,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “We will review the independent FCA’s findings when the investigation concludes. Drax will operate for less time under a clean power system and will need to use 100% sustainably sourced biomass, with not a penny of subsidy paid for anything less.”Explore more on these topicsDraxEnergy industryEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Theworld’s largest party,which ended on Wednesday, leaves a trail of sparkles in its wake.At one blocolast weekend, a huge sound truck and dancers in leopard print led thousands of revellers down the promenade at Flamengo beach. Among them was Bruno Fernandes, who had jazzed up an otherwise minimalist outfit of navy swimming briefs by smearing silver glitter over his body.“I just cast around for what I had at home before heading out,” says the 39-year-old consultant, the sun glinting off specks of glitter in his beard. “Glitter is the basics for getting dressed up with minimum effort.”“There has to be glitter,” says Lucia Dias, 22, wearing a metallic bikini and waving a glitter-encrusted fan. “If you don’t apply it at home, you do it on the way out.”View image in fullscreenRevellers celebrate at a street party on Flamengo beach in Rio de Janeiro, BrazilBut this glitter mania carries a heavy environmental toll, driving up pollution on the city’s seafront and leading to calls for the several million carnival-goers to find alternative ways to shine. Astudy on microplastics pollutionpublished last year found that contamination on a beach in Rio increased significantly during carnival, with glitter the main culprit.Researchers took samples of sand along Flamengo beach, a popular location for the street parties known asblocos, before, during and after the carnival, as well as a control sample eight months later, to measure the concentration of microplastics.View image in fullscreenTatiana Cabrini, left, and Gabriela Sodré take sand samples on Flamengo Beach to assess microplastics pollution earlier this week“During carnival, there is an infinitely higher concentration [of microplastics] than before and after,” says Tatiana Cabrini, a professor of ecology and marine resources at the Federal University of the State ofRio de Janeiro(Unirio) and a co-author of the paper.Gabriela Sodré, a Unirio student and the paper’s lead author, says: “You could see glitter clearly in the samples. Some looked like a constellation.”double quotation markThere has to be glitter. If you don’t apply it at home, you do it on the way outLucia DiasTypically made from a plastic called PET and coated in aluminium, glitter is a primary microplastic, which means the particles are manufactured to less than 5mm in diameter, or even microscopic. Larger pieces of plastic also break down into tiny particles eventually. This, along with the release of fibres from costumes and wigs, contributes to carnival pollution.View image in fullscreenBody glitter adds instant party vibes and is everywhere at carnival“People hug, people sweat, and this friction ends up releasing particles,” says Cabrini.“Outside of carnival, there will be plastic, microplastics coming from the water, from the land. Carnival puts huge pressure on the beach; it’s millions of people throughout the days.”The research was carried out when 18 blocos were held on Flamengo beach, of which three were “mega-blocos”, drawing more than 100,000 people.The microplastics on the beach can be carried into the sea by the tide and wind, where theyharm marine life and move up through the food chain, potentially carrying contaminants to the top of it.Cabrini says: “A mole crab might filter a fibre. It will be eaten by a fish. This small fish will be eaten by a larger fish. And if we eat this fish, we’ll also be consuming microplastics.”Microplastics have been found all over the planet, fromthe summit of Mount Everestto thedeepest point in the oceans, as well as in the human body.View image in fullscreen‘Carnival puts huge pressure on the beach’: a sample of the plastic found on Flamengo beachThere is still little research into the impacts of microplastics on human health, but there are associations with reproductive health harm andhigher risks of heart attack and stroke.“Plastic glitter should be banned,” says Cabrini. “If glitter must be used, it should be biodegradable.”Frances Sansão, a Rio set designer who founded one of Brazil’s first biodegradable glitter brands, Pura Bioglitter, in 2017, says: “Brazilians are a bit addicted to glitter.”View image in fullscreenFlamengo beach hosts many parties during carnival including mega-blocos that draw more than 100,000 peopleTheEU banned the sale of plastic glitter in 2023and other countries, including the UK, the US and Canada, have banned microbeads, another type of primary microplastics used in cosmetics. Public concern with the damaging impact of glitter has also led to aban by a number of music festivalsin the UK.But in Brazil abill banning the sale and use of plastic and metallic glitterhas been stuck in the lower house of congress since 2020.

Of course, everyone must do their bit, but when we see big business messing things up, we’re just a grain of sand,” she says.Sansão, who uses algae and minerals to make her bio-glitter, says: “I don’t think Brazil is as concerned with sustainability as European countries are.

It said it was working alongside Humberside fire and rescue, the Health and Safety Executive and East Riding of Yorkshire council.Peach said: “Whilst we are in the very early stages and the deaths at this time remain unexplained, we are exploring the possibility that they may be connected to carbon monoxide poisoning, with further enquiries continuing with our partner agencies.“Emergency services and partner agencies have attended all other properties on the site to offer advice, support and guidance and ensure everyone’s safety.“We know the shock and upset this will cause to the local community, and I want to offer my reassurance we will do all we can to determine exactly what has happened. Those living in the area will continue to see an increased police presence and we will provide further updates as soon as we are able to.”Liv Retreats, the travel firm that operates Little Eden holiday park, has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

That is core. That is British. That is something that was fought for and for Reform to say no more, under them we are to go back to old days when women not treated equally … I shudder to think what women think of anyone who wants to rip up that proposition.”Starmer said the act also protected people on grounds of race, and alluded to examples from the past when landlords would hang signs in their properties excluding individuals based on their race. “I believe passionately to be tolerant, compassionate and diverse is what it is to be British. [Reform’s plan] tears it up, I would genuinely like to see anyone from Reform defend the proposition that women should be treated differently.”Earlier this weekSuella Braverman, who was sacked twice as home secretary and defected to Reform earlier this year, was put forward by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, as the party’s spokesperson for education, skills and equalities.At a press conference announcing the appointment of Reform’s so-called “shadow cabinet”, Braverman said that on her first day in government she would abolish her own equalities brief and repeal the Equality Act.Munchetty asked Starmer about the position of Mountbatten-Windsor, who has come under increasing pressure to speak to police in the UK about his dealings with Epstein.The prime minister said: “Anybody who has any information should testify. So whether it’s Andrew or anybody else, anybody who has got relevant information should come forward to whatever the relevant body is, in this particular case we’re talking about Epstein, but there are plenty of other cases.“Anybody who has got information relating to any aspect of violence against women and girls has, in my view, a duty to come forward, whoever they are.”Starmer added: “One of the core principles in our system is that everybody is equal under the law, and nobody is above the law, and it is really important that is applied across the board. That is the principle. It’s a longstanding principle, it’s a very important principle of our country, our society, and it applies, and it has to apply in this case, in the same way as it would apply in any other case.”On council elections, which the government had planned to postpone in 30 separate authorities to allow a reorganisation of local government, the prime minister said he had followed legal advice, which led him to the decision to abandon the delay and reinstate the elections for May.Explore more on these topicsEquality Act 2010Keir StarmerReform UKInequalityWomenGenderRacenewsShareReuse this content"

I’d like the council’s response to that.”In response, the town’s mayor, Saffi Rabey, said: “This is not acceptable and you have every right to be furious. I didn’t know this existed and I am lost for words on what to say on this. This is not acceptable behaviour.”It is understood that the punchbag was put there by council staff, rather than by elected representatives.A council spokesperson said: “As this is a personnel matter, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time. We can confirm that an investigation is under way and will be dealt with accordingly.”McCann told the Guardian he was “obviously pretty shocked” when he was sent the picture of the desktop punchbag, which also carried the words “punch me”.He said: “You don’t expect to see yourself attached to a punchbag most days of the week. I think initially I looked at it and went: ‘That’s a really odd thing to do, that doesn’t make any sense.’”McCann initially thought it might have been a joke, but after speaking to colleagues he realised how unacceptable it was. “That’s a council,” he said, “they can’t be doing that, they can’t be having that on desks, it’s crazy.”He was also concerned by the wider implications of the incident. “Imagine that was someone who was a lot younger than me, who had just got into the industry? How would they feel?”McCann said his paper did not have any particular agenda against the town council, and described their work as “like the BBC” – reporting fairly and impartially on local government.“We’ve had some faux pas where they made decisions as a council that have not been very well received by the public,” he said, adding that council officers had decided to “shoot the messenger”.“It seems to me that they’ve gone down this route of looking at our articles and saying we’re at fault for highlighting it, rather than their own policies,” he added.McCann said that while he wouldn’t describe the incident as the “crime of the century”, it did play into increasing fears about journalists’ safety and the harassment reporters often face while doing their jobs.“I would say it builds into the picture that it’s OK to behave like this,” he said. “You look at America at the moment and you see the way that reporters are treated by some of the highest offices in the land, and we can’t let that start creeping in here.“Personally, my fear is that has already started happening slightly within this country,” he added. “It needs to be raised, people need to be aware of it, and it needs to stamped out as quickly as possible.”The title of the embedded video on this article was amended on 19 February 2026 to clarify that the video was of Melksham councillors.Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentLocal politicsJournalist safetyNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesWiltshireShareReuse this content"

Spanberger, a former undercover CIA officer who served three terms in Congress,became Virginia’s first female governorearlier this year, resoundingly winning an office previously held by a Republican. She won the race by a double-digit margin, campaigning on affordability and lowering costs for families.In a statement, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries and his counterpart, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer hailed Spanberger as a public servant with a record of holding Trump accountable – and winning races in competitive territory.“She stands in stark contrast toDonald Trump, who will lie, deflect and blame everyone but himself for his failed presidency on Tuesday evening,” Jeffries said in a statement announcing her selection. “As our nation marks its 250th anniversary this summer, Governor Spanberger embodies the best of America as a mother, community leader and dedicated public servant.”“Gov Spanberger will lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation,” Schumer added.Spanberger said she planned to use her rebuttal to address Americans’ concerns with “rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring”.“Next week, I look forward to laying out what these Americans expect and deserve – leaders who are working hard to deliver for them,” she said.In choosing Spanberger, 46, Democratic leaders are handing the spotlight to a battleground-tested moderate with national security credentials and a reputation for message discipline, particularly on economic issues and highlighting the impact of federal policies on everyday Virginians. Her 15-point victory in a purple state last November, alongside Mikie Sherrill in the New Jersey’s governor’s race, provided a jolt of optimism forDemocratsstill searching for an effective response to counter a president who dominates the political national conservation.As Trump contends with sagging approval ratings amid economic unease and a backlash to his deportation agenda, Democrats believe they are strongly positioned to win control of the House – and possibly even the Senate – in November.The rebuttal slot is typically reserved for a rising star – an ascendant figure the party believes can carry its message and showcase its next generation. Last year, Democrats chose Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin, another centrist figure with an intelligence background who won her seat even as Trump claimed the battleground state in 2024. But unlike Slotkin, Spanberger is not seen as a potential 2028 contender.Democrats also chose Senator Alex Padilla, to deliver the party’s Spanish language response. In a statement, the 52-year-old senator said he plans to discuss “a federal government that weaponizes enforcement agencies against immigrants and US citizens alike,” as well as the Trump administration’s “failed economic agenda” and its effort to restrict voting access.“Americans don’t need another speech from Donald Trump pretending everything is fine when their bills are too high, paychecks are too low, and masked and militarized federal agents are roaming our communities violating constitutional rights on a daily basis,” Padilla said in a statement.Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants and the first Latino to represent California in the Senate, was tackled to the ground by federal agents and handcuffed after attempting to ask the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, a question at a news conference in Los Angeles during the administration’s immigration crackdown in the city last summer.Democrats are heavily courting Latino voters who shifted toward Trump in the presidential election, but have soured on the president over his handling of the economy and his sprawling deportation campaign that has swept up long-settled immigrants, green-card holders and even US citizens.“As Donald Trump, Kristi Noem and MAGA extremists have tried to silence the voices of our Latino brothers and sisters, Senator Alex Padilla has consistently fought back and proven Democrats will not bend the knee to this out-of-control administration,” Jeffries said in a statement.Shrai Popat contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsState of the Union addressDonald TrumpTrump administrationDemocratsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The six survivors used the iPhone’s emergency SOS feature to help first responders find them as they waited under a tarp and discovered some of the bodies, according to the Nevada county sheriff. Apple’s feature, introduced in 2022, allows users to text law enforcement, even if there’s no cell service or wifi by connecting the phone to a satellite.First responders reached the skiers’ location and learned of the six survivors based on conversations held through the feature, Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a press conference on Wednesday.California office of emergency services law enforcement chief Don O’Keefe said his staff spoke with one of the stranded guides for more than four hours to relay information to the sheriff’s office, which was leading rescue efforts. O’Keefe’s agency said in an emailed statement that this communication occurred through a personal locator beacon that had the ability to text; these compact devices also tap into satellite signals to allow communication in an emergency.Law enforcement reported that a ninth person from the group of 15 is still missing, though presumed dead. Three were instructors with Blackbird Mountain Guides, and six were clients.The iPhone’s emergency SOS feature is free for two years after purchasing an iPhone 14 or any later model and activating it. If a call to emergency services doesn’t go through, the smartphone links with a satellite and allows users to text relevant agencies. Onscreen instructions can guide a user on how to connect.Apple notesthat users will have a better chance of doing so if they are “outside with a clear view of the sky and horizon”. Once connected, the iPhone shares key information with emergency responders, including Medical ID and emergency contact if that information is added before losing service, as well as location, including elevation and remaining battery life.This isn’t the first time Apple’s emergency SOS feature has helped users in crisis. The tech has reportedly been used to help law enforcement rescue a man who suffered aserious ankle injuryin a California forest,stranded hikers in OregonandColoradoand two people who were in acar crash in Canada.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyiPhoneAppleSmartphonesCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

This region of space is home to most of the known dwarf planets as well as comets and small, solid rubble heaps called planetesimals – the building blocks of planets.Not all of these planetesimals are rounded: indeed, astronomersestimate 10-25%of those found in the Kuiper belt, including Arrokoth, have two lobes, meaning they look a bit like a peanut or a snowman.Experts have previously said Arrokoth’s shape, composition and small number of craters suggests both lobes formed at the same time and in a non-violent way, proposing that this could have occurred through a process known asgravitational collapse. However, the details of just how this would have happened have been debated.Now researchers have used computer simulations to show that gravitational collapse can indeed produce such double-lobed objects, and to shed light on the mechanism.“It’s so exciting because we can actually see this for the first time,” said Jackson Barnes, the first author of the research, based at Michigan State University. “This is something that we’ve never been able to see from beginning to end, confirming this entire process.”As Barnes notes, the Kuiper belt is a remnant of the solar system’s primordial protoplanetary disk, within which vast rotating clouds of pebbles are thought to have formed. In the gravitational collapse scenario, gravitation forces within these clouds caused the pebbles to form into clumps, or planetesimals, of different sizes.Writing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Barnes and colleagues report how they ran 54 simulations involving an initial pebble cloud containing 105particles, each with a radius of about 2km (1.25 miles). This is a low-resolution model of the true situation as it is thought real pebble clouds would have contained about 1024millimetre-sized particles.The team found that in some cases two small planetesimals ended up orbiting each other, eventually spiralling inwards until, at velocities of about 5 metres a second or less, they touched and joined, forming a doubled-lobed planetesimal, or “contact binary”.“Some of the contact binaries in our model look strikingly like Arrokoth,” Barnes said.He noted that researchers had simulated gravitational collapse before but, unlike the new approach, they did not take into account the physics of how particles rest upon each other when they make contact. As a result, these simulations suggested any collision between smaller planetesimals would simply result in one larger, spherical object.Barnes said the new simulations were also important because they supported the long-held view that planetesimals in general were formed through gravitational collapse.Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute and principal investigator of Nasa’s New Horizons mission to the Kuiper belt, welcomed the study.“It’s in agreement with previous work and support[s] the hypothesis that Kuiper belt object Arrokoth, which New Horizons explored in a close flyby, is the result of gentle formation processes,” he said.Alan Fitzsimmons, an emeritus professor of astronomy at Queen’s University Belfast, noted that the simulations only suggested 4% of objects “out there” formed as contact binaries.“Telescopic surveys imply much higher fractions,” he said. “It may be that Mother Nature prefers other ways of making them, or that future even more complex simulations can close the gap between what is calculated and what we see.”Explore more on these topicsSpaceAstronomyPhysicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The permit is still in place, and Waymo’s plans for New York City are still likely to move ahead, as Hochul’s rescinded proposal governed areas outside the Big Apple.TheAlphabetsubsidiary, which offers paid driverless rides to the public in cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, along with parts of Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin, Atlanta and other cities, was hoping to grow its already sizable foothold in the robotaxi market and tap into a large pool of new users.Tesla avoids California sales ban by removing ‘autopilot’ from marketingRead more“While we are disappointed by the governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service toNew Yorkand will work with the state legislature to advance this issue,” a Waymo spokesperson said. “We hear from thousands of New Yorkers who have experienced Waymo in other cities and want access to it at home.”Self-driving operations already face a difficult path to commercialization, as the technology has been under heavy scrutiny over safety concerns after accidents, though Waymo’s safety record has not recorded major injuries like General Motors’ Cruise, which shut down after one of its cars dragged a woman through an intersection in San Francisco.“Autonomous vehicles are already driving down accident rates and improving pedestrian safety in Arizona, California and Texas.

His office called the case the first of its kind by a government agency over the distribution of child sexual abuse material on Apple’s data storage platform.“These images are a permanent record of a child’s trauma, and that child is revictimized every time the material is shared or viewed,” McCuskey said in the statement. “This conduct is despicable, and Apple’s inaction is inexcusable.”Apple responded with a blanket denial to the allegations: “At Apple, protecting the safety and privacy of our users, especially children, is central to what we do. We are innovating every day to combat ever-evolving threats and maintain the safest, most trusted platform for kids.” The company emphasized its controls that prevent children from uploading or receiving nude images, though West Virginia’s lawsuit aims at abusers’ use of Apple devices and services.In 2020, an executive in charge of fraud detection at Apple texted a colleague: “We are the greatest platform for distributing child porn.” The exchange was made public duringthe trial between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games.A group of victims of child sexual exploitation sued Apple in 2024, making similar allegations, for $1.2bn in damages. The suit is ongoing. The same year, the UK’s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty toChildren(NSPCC) accused Apple of vastly undercounting how often child sexual abuse material appeared in its products. In a year, child predators used Apple’s iCloud, iMessage and FaceTime to store and exchange CSAM in a higher number of cases in England and Wales alone than the company reported across all other countries combined, according to police data obtained by the NSPCC. Apple did not comment on the finding at the time.Apple routinely makes far fewer reports of CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) than Google or Meta, according to data published by NCMEC.UK watchdog accuses Apple of failing to report sexual images of childrenRead moreThe company has considered scanning images saved in private iCloud accounts butabandoned the approachafter concerns about user privacy and safety, including worries that it could be exploited by governments looking for other material for censorship or arrest.McCuskey’s office filed the lawsuit in Mason county circuit court. The lawsuit seeks statutory and punitive damages and asks to have a judge force Apple to implement more effective measures to detect abusive material and implement safer product designs.Alphabet’s Google, Microsoft and other platform providers check uploaded photos or emailed attachments against a database of identifiers of known child sex abuse material provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other clearinghouses.Until 2022, Apple took a different approach. It did not scan all files uploaded to its iCloud storage offerings, and the data was not end-to-end encrypted, meaning law enforcement officials could access it with a warrant.Reuters in 2020 reported that Apple planned end-to-end encryption for iCloud, which would have put data into a form unusable by law enforcement officials. It abandoned the plan after the FBI complained it would harm investigations.In August 2021, Apple announced NeuralHash, which it designed to balance the detection of child abuse material with privacy by scanning images on users’ devices before upload.The system was criticized by security researchers who worried it could yield false reports of abuse material, and it sparked a backlash from privacy advocates who claimed it could be expanded to permit government surveillance.A month later, Apple delayed the introduction of NeuralHash before canceling it in December 2022, the state said in its statement. That same month, Apple launched an option for end-to-end encryption for iCloud data.The state said NeuralHash was inferior to other tools and could be easily evaded. It said Apple stores and synchronizes data through iCloud without proactive abuse material detection, allowing such images to circulate.While Apple did not go through with the effort to scan images being uploaded to iCloud, it did implement a feature called Communication Safety that blurs nudity and other sensitive content being sent to or from a child’s device.Federal law requires US-based technology companies to report abuse material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Apple in 2023 made 267 reports, compared with 1.47m by Google and 30.6m by Meta Platforms, the state said.The state’s claims mirror allegations in a proposed class-action lawsuit filed against Apple in late 2024 in federal court in California by individuals depicted in such images.Apple has moved to dismiss that lawsuit, saying the firm is shielded from liability under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that provides broad protections to internet companies from lawsuits over content generated by users.In the US, call or text theChildhelpabuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visittheir websitefor more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

We are not going to meet those challenges by causing unnecessary economic damage to each other.”View image in fullscreenNick Thomas-Symonds said prioritising European-made products in public procurement ‘would risk impacting our deeply integrated supply chains’.Photograph: David Cruz Sanz/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThomas-Symonds’s intervention comes as Keir Starmer’s government has been looking to improve diplomatic and economic ties with the EU, Britain’s largest trading partner, since the“reset” deal was announced last May.In recent weeks,Starmer has signalledthat the UK may seek sectoral deals which would deepen access to the single market, beyond that agreed with EU leaders in May, by potentially aligning in other areas and keeping pace with EU regulation. Such a move would be likely to face objections from opposition parties.EU leaders agreed at a summit in Belgium earlier in February to move ahead with a “Buy European” policy, with the aim of securing the continent’s future amid geopolitical volatility.At the meeting, the leaders broadly agreed on the need to protect certain sectors, with the European Council president, António Costa, naming these as defence, space, clean tech, quantum, artificial intelligence and payment systems.The EU has long been concerned with Europe’s declining competitiveness, but those worries were intensified after the sudden loss of Russian gas in 2022, which resulted in higher energy costs, made the bloc more vulnerable at a time of declining investment and higher regulation.The 27 member states have been looking toboost Europe’s competitivenesscompared with the US and China at a time of economic uncertainty, following the Trump’s administration’s tariff agenda and China’s export of heavily subsidised goods to the continent.The draft “Made in Europe” plan includes the EU’s member states as well as members of the European Economic Area – Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein – but not Britain. The EU said, however, that other “trusted partners” could be added in future.The “Buy European” programme has long been promoted by France, but has faced some criticism by member states including Italy and Germany – whose automakers have global manufacturing operations – who have expressed concerns that the rules could be too narrow.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, have said in recent times they would like the EU to go further with its deregulation agenda.TheEuropean Commissionis due to publish its Industrial Accelerator Act later this month, which is expected to set targets for European content in a range of strategic products such as solar panels and electric vehicles.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTrade policyNick Thomas-SymondsEuropean CommissionEuropeEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

Households arefeeling “dismal”about their finances, while companies have been cutting staff amid rising cost pressures. However, some business surveys havesuggested a rise in optimismamong companies since the start of the year after uncertainty overthe government’s autumn budgetlifted.The CBI survey said the monthly order book balance for manufacturers stood at -28 in February, up slightly from -30 in January but well below the average of -14.Cameron Martin, a senior economist at the CBI, said: “Many firms continue to report customers holding back amid low confidence and elevated cost pressures.”The CBI survey asks manufacturing firms to state whether conditions are better, worse or the same on a variety of subjects, before taking a net position for responses.Factory output also fell over the three months to February, to a balance of -14, although this was an improvement from -25 in January. Manufacturers expect their output to decline at a broadly similar pace over the next three months.The survey’s gauge of expected prices over the next three months stood at +26, having risen to +29 in January, the highest reading since February 2023 when Britain was suffering an energy price shock after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Manufacturing makes up about 9% of the economy, and the Labour government has said removing barriers for the sector’s expansion is a key priority, believing it can play an important part in boosting long-term growth for the UK.In June last year, the government unveiled a new industrial strategy, which will include investing £2bn over the next four years to cut energy prices for thousands of manufacturing businesses.However, this scheme will not be introduced until 2027 and the CBI said it should be bought forward to help manufacturing firms now. “Tackling punitive energy costs will strengthen competitiveness, ease cost of living pressures, and help boost demand across the economy,” it said.The survey comes as the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), a lobby group, said many of its members were facing “unparalleled cost pressures” that could soon lead into “deeply uncharted territory in which small business viability may collapse”.Tina McKenzie, the policy chair at the FSB, has written to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, asking her to implement measures that would help “stem the tide of the rising bills due in April”.Explore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorConfederation of British Industry (CBI)EconomicsEconomic growth (GDP)Economic recoveryEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

Russell Crowe’s poem gets cut (2002)Typically, the Baftas have fewer memorable moments than, say, the Oscars. This is partly because the ceremony isn’t broadcast live, so viewers are essentially treated to edited highlights. However, when Russell Crowe won for A Beautiful Mind in 2002, it was his speech that got edited out. That was because he decided to recite thePatrick Kavanagh poem Sanctity, and it went on and on.When Crowe realised what had happened, he tracked down the show’s director at the afterparty, pinned him against a wall, called him a “cunt” and then allegedly kicked three chairs across the room.9. John Hurt punches a photographer (1989)In 1989, though, the awards were broadcast live. The most noteworthy moment came in the bar afterwards when John Hurt, apparently quite the worse for wear, screamed “Fuck off or I’ll kill you” at a pack of 30 photographers, who he then attempted to fight. It resulted in some spectacular photographs. Hurt himself was unrepentant, telling the Daily Express the following morning: “I’m a bad, bad boy, and I love it.”8. #BaftaSoWhite (2017, 2020, 2023)Being called out for lack of diversity is par for the course for awards shows, but the Baftas seem to get called out more than most. In 2017 (the year of Moonlight and Fences),only white people were nominatedin the best actor, best actress and best director categories, causing the hashtag #BaftaSoWhite to trend on Twitter (as it was then called). It trended again in 2020, which led Bafta to undertake a formal review of its processes, widening membership to more people from underrepresented backgrounds, implementing unconscious bias training for members and scores of other measures. But guess what? It trended again in 2023.7. ‘Babe’ attends (1996)View image in fullscreenThe unnamed piglet got its own seat, next to its handler, at the ceremony.Photograph: BaftaThe guest of honour at the 1996 awards was a pig. Ostensibly the reason for this is that Babe was released that year, which led many to believe that the piglet in attendance was Babe himself. However, that couldn’t be. Not only did the film use 48 different pigs during production, but they would all have grown to an unmanageably enormous size by the time of the ceremony. In other words, someone took a random pig to theBaftasand got away with it.6. Joanna Lumley’s anti-monologue (2019)Joanna Lumley is a national treasure, but not necessarily a natural comedian. This was the case in 2019, whenshe hosted the awardsand found herself having to perform the opening monologue, composed entirely of the scientific opposite of jokes. To Steve Coogan, who starred in Stan and Ollie: “That’s another fine dress you’ve got me into.” To Spike Lee, who made Blackkklansman: “I’m surprised it did so well at the Klan Film Festival.” The whole thing was delivered to such awkward silence, and Lumley received so many looks of genuinely sad pity from the nominees, that when Bafta came to upload it to itsYouTube channel, most of her routine was absent.5. Jack Nicholson’s acceptance speech (1975)1975 was a hell of a year for Jack Nicholson, who somehow managed to win the best leading actor Bafta for Chinatown and The Last Detail at the same time. Even more incredibly, he couldn’t make it to the ceremony because he was busy filming another classic:One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. However, as an apology he sent in the greatest acceptance video of all time. Dressed in character as Randle McMurphy and surrounded by his castmates, Nicholson smashes a window, acts increasingly perturbed and then gets hauled off by Nurse Ratched.4. The bubbly red carpet (2002)Inviting Hollywood’s great and good to wear skimpy outfits in London in winter – when it is always freezing and often raining – has always been one of Bafta’s sickest jokes. However, in 2002, the rain ended up reacting with the flame-retardant chemicals that had been sprayed over the red carpet, which resulted in the most famous people on earth having to walk through a chilly approximation of a provincial nightclub foam party. It has been said that the snafu ruined Dame Judi Dench’s shoes. For shame.3. Louis Malle is nice about British food (1975)Winners of an award typically use their speeches to reflect on their illustrious careers. Not so director Louis Malle who, upon winning in 1975 for best film, used the entirety of his 26-second speech to state that, although “about 265 people” had warned him that the food served at the Baftas would be “the worst meal of my life”, he had actually enjoyed what turned out to be “a very good meal”.2. The astronaut acrobats (2019)In 2019, the Baftas commissioned Cirque du Soleil to open the show with a breathtaking interpretive dance themed around the moon landing. This was presumably becauseDamien Chazelle’s First Manwas an early awards frontrunner. However, the film was shut out of most major categories, which meant that the show found itself lumbered with an expensive setpiece based on a film that was never going to win anything substantial. It was a mistake the Baftas would not make again – that is, unless Sunday’s ceremony opens with an expensive tribute toGabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie.‘Electric Malady? Marie, girl, what a slay’: deconstructing Ariana DeBose’s personalised Bafta rapRead more1. ‘Angela Bassett Did the Thing!’ (2023)Look, I only agreed to write this list so I could put this at No 1. Ariana DeBose’s spectacular, befuddling 2023 musical number remains my favourite moment of anything ever. To recap: at the start of the show, DeBose performed a song celebrating women in general. However, this segued into a custom rap where DeBose mentioned every female nominee by name. “Charlotte Wells we love Aftersun,” she began, to looks of bemusement from the crowd. But she pressed on. “Georgia, Helene, Blue Jean’s the one,” she continued, offering a snazzy shout out to the team behind a searing drama about Section 28. Shortly afterwards DeBose rhymed Electric Malady (a heartbreaking documentary about a man whose life has been ruined by electrosensitivity) with the phrase “What a slay.” And then, by this point visibly breathless and exhausted, she yelped the deathless phrase “Angela Bassett did the thing!” while convincingly mimicking a mosquito attack. The best thing ever to be televised, quite frankly.The 79th Bafta awards ceremony airs on 22 February on BBC One.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedBaftasAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s also a film about therapy and transference when there’s nothing left to transfer. Mary Bronstein is its writer-director, and her film-maker husband Ronald Bronstein serves as producer – as does Josh Safdie, whose influence, through movies such as Uncut Gems and Marty Supreme, can perhaps be detected in the sprint towards a nervous breakdown.Rose Byrne delivers a barnstormer as Linda, a psychotherapist whose husband is away, leaving her to deal with a sick infant daughter whose face is not shown until the very end, indicating perhaps the way in which the little girl’s identity is simply that of a gigantically blank all-pervasive problem to be managed. The girl is intubated via a feeding machine that must be carted around with her, especially to the day-care hospital whose brusque doctor in charge (played by Mary Bronstein in cameo) supervises group therapy sessions that blandly reassure the parents present that all this is not their fault, while curtly reprimanding Linda for her failure to turn up to appointments and to discuss her daughter’s failure to gain the weight necessary for the tube to be removed.Added to this, Linda has deep depression, managed through weed, wine and entirely unhelpful therapy sessions with her impatient colleague (Conan O’Brien) who has an office next to hers, in a hilariously incestuous arrangement. In these she behaves like quite as much of a screwup as any of her own patients, and at one stage concludes a conversation with him by quietly saying: “I love you.” Added to all of this, her apartment is flooded through a gaping hole in the ceiling – about which she has Freudian visions and dreams – meaning she and her daughter have to move into a scuzzy motel whose superintendent James (played by A$AP Rocky) is the only person who seems to care about Linda.It’s a terrific performance from Byrne as someone who as mother and therapist must present at all times as keeping it together, but who in fact is losing it every day. She lives in a world of professionalised empathy from caregivers who are eternally wary of giving too much and getting too close for fear of being overwhelmed by other people’s problems. There is plenty of brutal comedy here, especially the horror of seeing a hamster being run over and then cutting hard to a closeup of takeout food. Bronstein is brilliant at conveying mounting panic and a terrible, all-consuming sadness.If I Had Legs I’d Kick You is in UK and Irish cinemas from 20 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRose ByrneA$AP RockyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Man on the Run is composed of archive film, photos and audio recordings of McCartney and his late wife, Linda, his children and others. Some of McCartney’s overlaid commentary seems to be new, and some pre-existing.The film tracks his tense, complicated, fruitful career from the endgame of the Beatles in 1969 to the definitive demise of his next band Wings in 1981, a few months after John Lennon’s death – although what exact psychological role Lennon’s life and death played in Wings’ beginning and end is not explicitly discussed. (The film does, once again, show us that startlingly strange and casual-seeming interview McCartney gave after Lennon’s shooting, his shock resulting in an apparently cold attitude – but what he may really have been thinking is something else not explored here in detail.)When the Beatles broke up, McCartney appeared to be in retreat from the world, winding up in rural Scotland with his wife and children – working on music in a desultory way, but also amassing new songs on his four-track tape recorder. He made solo albums, including the poorly received Ram, whose perceived “diss track” slights towards Lennon resulted in yet more acrimony. While Lennon was spearheading the counterculture in New York, McCartney experimented with a new pop aesthetic of uncool, includinga bizarre TV specialof outrageously naff vaudeville song’n’dance. Later, alongside Christopher Lee and James Coburn, he would put Clement Freud and Michael Parkinson on the front cover of Band on the Run; strange, considering the calibre of celebrity he surely could have secured. The film’s title, incidentally, is a giveaway hint at how Paul, not the band, is really the star of this show.Paul McCartney’s greatest post-Beatles songs – ranked!Read moreThe musicians he recruited for Wings included – to press derision – his wife, Linda, who rose above the mockery with good humour: “I’m not here ’cause I’m the greatest keyboard player; I’m here because we love each other.” Fans understood the “family” ethos of Wings; the band played sellout tours, answered the post-Beatle naysayers with the colossally bestselling Mull of Kintyre and appeared to have settled very comfortably into a mainstream identity. However, the film doesn’t mention Wings’ highly political debut single Give Ireland Back to the Irish, released in 1972 and conceived in response to Bloody Sunday.The lineup of Wings changed a good deal (cue rueful Spın̈al Tap gags), and it now seems as if Denny Laine was really the third and only other Wing; the others were hardly more than session musicians, and perhaps the turnover suggests some unspoken resentment. You may find yourself wondering why we are going over this ground again, but it’s an engaging film, and there is always something mesmeric in McCartney’s face: cherubic, and yet sharp and watchful.Man on the Run is in cinemas from 19 February, and on Prime Video from 27 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPaul McCartneyLinda McCartneyJohn LennonreviewsShareReuse this content"

This week, that anticipation secures a pay-per-view release for this hour-long meat-and-potatoes primer, fashioned by Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s dad, Robin Bextor, out of much the same combo of talking heads, drone shots and fair-use clips you would normally encounter on free-to-air Channel 5.Uppermost in the edit is a recognition that Steven Knight’s creation was one of thosepeak TVshows that blurred the televisual and cinematic. Heaven’s Gate, The Godfather and Rio Bravo provide contextualising material; critic Michael Hogan positions the show as Knight’s Once Upon a Time in the West Midlands.The talk is widescreen, at least, even if the delivery format remains small screen. Bextor’s most illuminating inquiries come early on, addressing how Knight expanded on stories bequeathed by his parents, which inspired first a concerted attempt to recreate Birmingham’s working-class past and thereafter a modern pop-cultural phenomenon. Production designer Grant Montgomery recalls recycling sets in the show’s formative BBC days; Hogan hails the show’s “rebel music” – the anvil-smashing rock and pop – that helped to catch ears as well as eyes. Peaky Blinders was a popular sensation before it developed into a network-hopping brand, a subculture endorsed and sustained by the undercut sported by Cillian Murphy becoming visible everywherefrom Balsall Heath to Buenos Aires.Just as Knight’s show is emblematic of an unusually confident moment in British TV, this patchwork tribute indirectly reflects today’s mend-and-make-do arts coverage. (In previous eras, Knight’s cultural triumph would surely have merited the full Yentob treatment.)Bextor covers a fair bit of turf, taking irrepressible Brum historian Carl Chinn’s walking tour and paying a cautionary visit to the West Midlands Police Museum. Perfunctorily packaged though it all is, there’s even a lesson for the industry to heed; as Knight puts it, “If you don’t tell the stories of 70% of the population, you’re missing at least 70% of the country.”Peaky Blinders: The Real Story is on digital platforms from 23 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPeaky BlindersreviewsShareReuse this content"

Who are you picking?ShermanMLightKendrick Lamar. He’s one of the few people I’ve worked with in the hip-hop world who is an actual genius. He doesn’t get enough credit for being a producer as well – because he has such a clear perspective on what he wants in his music, he knows where every sound is supposed to be. Not every artist has that approach – most are more hands off. Working closely with Kendrick would make me a better producer. That would be a great meeting of the minds, as it was when we did our couple of tracks together.How was the experience of working with the great, late David Lynch [on the trackFire is Coming]?Stephenw1979A dream come true – someone who inspired my whole artistic path. He was exactly who I hoped he would be. I got to go over to his studio and hang a couple times, and it was really special. And he never seemed to get old.

It took five years, the whole process – maybe longer. It was hard, man, but it was so rewarding. When I saw all these little ideas I’d had start to emerge on screen, and the characters wearing the hair and outfits I’d imagined for them, in the room I’d helped design, and the special effects were going off, and the lightning was striking and everything was working, and the actors were killing it … Nothing like it, dude. And then you get to go back and edit it, and put sound and music to it ... It’s so much fun. [pauses] But I actually don’t recommend it. [laughs] Because making a movie can just eat your whole life away, your relationships, everything. It’s a huge sacrifice to jump into that world. At every turn, I wished all I had to think about was just doing the music. I’m going to continue making movies, but without abandoning the rest of my life while I’m waiting for a movie to get made.You came up with your artist name,Flying Lotus, while “lucid dreaming”, and yourUntil the Quiet Comesalbum was inspired by dreaming.

He had a whole bunch of music that we’d recorded and he kept asking me for more beats. I was like: “Dude, I don’t got any more beats!” But I know he recorded stuff over my beats, and it’s sitting wherever his last laptop currently is. I’ve heard one of the tracks; I know he was working on some amazing stuff.Was your aunt,Alice Coltrane, an influence on you as an artist, and how do you feel about how her legacy has been reappraised in the years since her death?pollymagooHonestly, that has been very moving for me. I wish people could have appreciated her in her time, though even if that had been the case, I don’t know if it would mean anything to her; she was beyond all that. But it’s just so awesome that she’s getting her love now. When I was coming up, people always asked her about John Coltrane this, John Coltrane that. Now it’sAlice Coltrane.I think everyone who makes art knows, deep down, no one’s going to really appreciate you until you’re dead [laughs].Will yourCaptain Murphyalterego ever resurface, and what current hip-hop artists are you inspired by?pollymagooAbsolutely, Captain Murphy will resurface. I would really like to do something with Westside Gunn, that would be fun. And Freddie Gibbs. We’ve done a track but we need to do something proper.How would you say your music has changed from release to release?ChivseyI remember when I started out how fun it was to wake up every day and everything felt brand new and uncharted. Now I’m a better musician, and I have a better understanding of what I’m doing and who I am as a person. It’s a balance between confidence, ability, innocence and understanding.‘Choosing happy is a hell of a process’: Thundercat on funk, lost friends and being fired by Snoop Dogg (possibly)Read moreYou’ve worked with some amazing vocalists. Who are some of your favourites to work with and why?steve__bayleyThundercat is always going to be my number one. In terms of newer people I’ve been working with, Dawn Richard is always kicking out cool ideas and is super inspiring, and I really liked collaborating with Devin Tracy on The Room; he has a great voice. Erykah Badu’s been such an inspiration, and the fact that she wanted to work with me was validating, like: OK, I deserve to be here. She was the real deal too – always cool ideas and a cool approach. And she introduced me to the concept of demoitis, where you fall in love with the scratch demo you made and don’t wanna change anything. Ilovedworking with Thom Yorke, just because I was a big fan of his too, but we never worked together in the studio – we’d email each other and it was a bit more remote. But I love that dude, and whenever we can get together it’s always been a nice time.The difference between good producers and great producers is knowing how to get an artist to do their best work. Every artist is going through something: they might have just broken up with their girlfriend, their mum might have just passed away. They’re trying to write a song, and they’re dealing with life at the same time. And you have to find a way to navigate all that, to get the best out of the moments you have with people. That’s the difference between just beat-making and actually producing.Have you now abandoned the LA beat scene style of music that you were initially known for or is it possible you might come back to a more glitchyboom bapsound?CoreSwayI do all those things still; I just don’t put them all out. But I feel like the whole “lo-fi beats” thing has become like Starbucks music. I have to make things that challenge myself – I want to try to do things I haven’t done before.

His music shows an inspirational gift for melody, a sensitivity to text and a knack for turning Lutheran doctrinal poetry into first-rate music drama. How JSB got his hands on JLB’s music is unclear – there’s no evidence the two ever met – but JSB’s meticulous copying out of his relative’s work has preserved a treasure trove of music that might otherwise have been lost to the sands of time.Unbelievably, Capella Sollertia’s thoroughly idiomatic performances represent the first ever recordings of these cantatas, nearly five-and-a-half hours of music, some of which could easily pass for the work ofJS Bachhimself. Indeed, the Easter cantata, Denn du wirst meine Seele nicht in der Hölle lassen, was once attributed to Johann Sebastian as BWV number 15. It’s a perfect example of what JLB does best: shapely Italianate arias that trip along with a Frenchified courtly grace and are packed full of imaginative word painting. Trumpets and drums, sensitively deployed, create a vivid sense of occasion.Johanna Soller’s conducting is incisive yet flexible, while her splendid lineup of fresh-voiced soloists basks in sumptuous sound thanks to Ricercar’s scrupulous engineering.

Pint in his right hand, mic in his left, he begins: “It was supposed to be so easy …” And just like that it’s 2004 again.Had he been trying to court a mass audience, Skinner wrote in his memoir, “I certainly wouldn’t have made a concept album about someone losing a thousand pounds down the back of the TV”.

Full-album shows can be hit and miss, but the picaresque nature of the record suits a recital, and an impressive live band reproduces its colourful sound world.The staging is semi-theatrical. Skinner, head to toe in Stone Island, remains in character for the time it takes to run through all 11 tracks. He doesn’t acknowledge the audience. His delivery is deadpan. Between verses, sitting in the bus shelter as backing singers bang out big choruses, he has the glum zen torpor of a snooker player awaiting his turn at the table.View image in fullscreenDeadpan … Mike Skinner and band.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThose vocalists are crucial to the show. Roo Savill, in particular, is fantastic in the role of Simone, the girlfriend in the album’s story: flirty on Could Well Be In, combative in Get Out of My House.After a brief interval, Skinner runs through a selection of other work. Breaking character, he raps into faces and phones. Given the earlier intensity, he seems happy to be playful. That works for Don’t Mug Yourself, but Never Went to Church, a beautiful song about the loss of his father, feels undermined by his goofing around.If this second act feels a little padded-out then that is perhaps because the first half was so strong. The show ends with Skinner crowd-surfing to Take Me As I Am and then bringing it full circle with an apt closing line: “It was s’posed to be soeeeeeasy…” Well, that was how he made it look.The Streets play Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow on 19 February;then tourthe UK and Europe from 6 JuneExplore more on these topicsThe StreetsPop and rockRapHip-hoplive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Her dazzling 2020 debut,Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line, was part caper and part social satire, set in an Indian shantytown. In The Last of Earth, she points her writerly compass towards the mountains of mid-19th-century Tibet – a region then closed off to European imperialists – to meditate on the chequered history of colonial exploration, cartography and the impermanence of human existence.“It’s in the nature of white men to believe they own the world, that no door should be shut to them.” For years, the British train, coax and bribe Indians to cross over, conducting surveying expeditions on their behalf; they also venture into the “Forbidden Kingdom of Tibet” in thinly veiled disguises. Intricately researched and meticulously plotted, this immersive novel is told through the alternating perspectives of two protagonists. Balram is an Indian schoolteacher and surveyor-spy who plays guide to an English captain, clumsily dressed as a monk and intent on being the first man to personally chart the route of the revered river Tsangpo and discover where it meets the sea. Meanwhile Katherine, of part Indian heritage, is on a mission to become the first European woman to reach Lhasa and set eyes on the Potala Palace after being denied membership of the all-male Royal Geographical Society in London.Each embarking on an epic, perilous odyssey, in “a strange country whose terrain changed every few miles”, their paths inevitably cross. The cast of characters find that “at eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, here they were closer to gods than mortals, but this proximity to the divine had brought them no blessings, only burdens”. Storms, snow leopards and soldiers, meandering rivers and the full force of the elements are but minor obstacles in their path to glory, to writing history and leaving their mark on the world. The true test will ultimately come down to human feelings and emotions: hubris, obsession, doubt, power, guilt and grief.Like many journeys, Anappara’s narrative is full of false starts and stops, digressions and revisions. In scale and architecture, it feels reminiscent of recent novels such as Janice Pariat’sEverything the Light TouchesandFuneral Nightsby Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih. Here, too, maps deceive. History deviates from the truth. The natural world is alive. Death is always looming around the corner. “The lines the captain drew on paper appeared to Balram to be no more than a child’s scribbles on mud. If the earth shrugged, mountains would cleave, rivers would surge, seas would swallow cities and fields alike, and every map would be rendered incoherent.”The greedy, dirty colonial enterprise swallows entire communities and landscapes whole. For “this was the way the world worked. The white man had a want and to sate it brown men gave up their lives. How many native men had died triangulating Hindustan for the Great Trigonometrical Survey? Balram didn’t know because no book, no map, recorded their names or numbers.” Balram often hears the voices of those left behind: his best friend Gyan, a fellow surveyor-spy rumoured to be imprisoned in Tibet, and his own wife and children. The death of Katherine’s sister Ethel both motivates and haunts her journey and journalling on the road. The Last of Earth is scrupulous in its excavation of our spooky, imperfect pasts.Late in the novel, Balram says that “the river wasn’t a blue spiral on a map but a living thing, a creature capable of renewal. It emptied itself into the sea and recast itself every few months.” With The Last of Earth, Anappara has shown that history, too, is often not what it seems; it is a living thing, which, when recast in a different light – a novelist’s light – can offer a renewal of sorts.The Last of Earth by Deepa Anappara is published by Oneworld (£14.99).

Squid Game.Photograph: No Ju-han/NetflixBooksReviewTrip to the Moon by John Yorke review – a storytelling handbook in dire need of an editA producer shares his tips for tight storylines, but they’re marred by verbal incontinence and hyperboleHouman BarekatThu 19 Feb 2026 04.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleCreative writing handbooks are almost an industry in themselves: the fledgling author, dramatist or screenwriter can choose from hundreds of titles, all offering to unlock the secrets of storytelling. These books are of limited utility for literary fiction, where plot is secondary, but if you’re writing for the screen or stage, or working on genre fiction, they can be helpful. Commercial, plot-driven storytelling is, this is an inherently formulaic business, and a working knowledge of narrative structure is a crucial foundation for an aspiring writer.In his bestselling 2014 treatise on the mechanics of narrative,Into the Woods, John Yorke demonstrated the uncanny prevalence of five-act structure (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement) in many popular movies, plays and television dramas. He reprises this theme in his new book, which starts with a lengthy disquisition on plot architecture. The five-act framework, Yorke explains, is elegantly conducive to an emotionally compelling journey, with the protagonist typically undergoing a transformative revelation at the story’s mid-point. He illustrates this with reference to hit TV programmes such as I May Destroy You, and films including Star Wars and Terminator 2.Yorke then proceeds to meditate on the broader social significance of story structure, touching on politics, philosophy and spirituality. He observes that the rhetoric of revanchist populism is built on a specious promise of renewal: Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan is “a masterclass in condensed narrative”. The success of Netflix’s Squid Game showed that “if you can tap into the reader or viewer’s subconscious damage or grievance … and from there show a path to healing, then you are mining the most powerful narrative seam of all”. Themes of healing and reinvention also feature prominently in the rhetoric of organisations like the Church of Scientology and Alcoholics Anonymous, which promise redemption through surrender to a higher force. Indeed, Yorke believes stories fill “a god-shaped hole” in all of us, a yearning for meaning and transcendence.A good story requires conflict, broadly defined. “Conflict isn’t just waving a spear around – it’s dissonance, of any size, of any shape, or any form.” Since life is all about solving problems, Yorke – a former producer on EastEnders, and sometime head of drama at Channel 4 – suggests story structure is a microcosm of all human existence: “Equilibrium, disruption, recognition of the disruption, repair of the disruption, new equilibrium.” Or, more simply: “We exist, we observe, we change.”These are thought-provoking lessons for the novice screenwriter, who is occasionally addressed in a pedagogic second-person. But the book is let down by verbal incontinence, which rather contradicts its emphasis on the importance of keeping your audience engaged. When holding forth on politics, Yorke’s authorial voice lapses from avuncular mentor into pontificating pub bore, taking potshots at “social justice warriors” and anti-racism activists alongside far-right conspiracy theorists.Yorke makes a conspicuous number of disparaging references to to Jeremy Corbyn. In one startling snipe, he likens the internal politics of “Corybnite Labour” to China’s Cultural Revolution, the Russian pogroms and the McCarthyite purges of the 1950s. Elsewhere, a journalist who wrote a flattering book about Mao Zedong in the 1930s is credited with helping bring about the deaths of 80 million people under communism. The combination of triteness and hyperbole in these passages makes it hard to take Yorke seriously as a thinker. To hammer home his point about the dangers of ideological purity, he bastardises Yeats: “The rigid binary is God-like: a rough beast slouching towards democratic consensus, with violence on its mind.”Despite moments of insight, Trip to the Moon – which takes its title from an early French sci-fi film – feels distinctly undercooked. Yorke’s exposition becomes wearingly repetitious as the book progresses, and the prose is sloppily casual in places, with an over-reliance on intensifiers masking diminishing intellectual returns. (At one point, the word “incredibly” appears five times in the space of six short paragraphs.) “I never intended to write a second book,” Yorke concedes in the acknowledgements. Alas, it shows.Trip to the Moon: Understanding the True Power of Story by John Yorke is published by Particular (£25). To support the Guardian order your copy fromguardianbookshop.com.

Now he’s back in his whites (and reds) with a charming new take on the sport that dials back the difficulty level and adds lots of fun modes and features, aiming to appease complete newcomers and Djokovic-esque veterans.At first, the range of options is almost bewildering. You can opt to play in one-off matches with up to three other players or NPCs, or enter a more structured tournament of singles or doubles play. Then there’s the extremely fun Mix It Up, which offers a range of fun tennis derivatives. These include Forest Court where piranha plants appear and gobble any balls that get close, and Pinball where bumpers and barriers pop up as you play. Trial Towers, meanwhile, presents a tower of increasingly tough tennis challenges which all have to be completed to open the next two buildings; fail more than three times and you’re sent back to the beginning – yes, it’s Mario Tennis: The Roguelike.View image in fullscreenA level playing field … Mario Tennis Fever.Photograph: NintendoThe least interesting option is Adventure mode, a glorified four-hour tutorial in which Mario and Luigi are transformed into babies and have to learn all their tennis moves again in order to save Princess Daisy, or something. It’s bright, silly stuff recalling the original Tennis Academy story mode from Mario Tennis on the Game Boy Color. As you go, you’re taught the range of shots available through various minichallenges, allowing you to level up Mario and unlock new characters. But the narrative is threadbare and it’s all a bit of a grind, as the move-set is pretty straightforward anyway.double quotation markThe most fun you’ll have is playing with a bunch of friends in the same roomAnd this is the real appeal of Mario Tennis Fever. You pick it up and five minutes later you’re playing pretty well. Top spin, flat and slice shots are on different buttons, while two-press combos result in lobs and drop shots to widen your arsenal. The skill is in the timing – which means striking your serve when the ball is at its highest, and boosting your returns with an early button press ensure the ball thunders over the net at top speed. You can also double tap the topspin button for more power, but less directional accuracy. As you gather confidence, you start mixing all this with the occasional slow-mo drop shot to send your opponent huffing around the court. There’s a lovely smooth feel to rallies, and while you play you learn to read player movement pretty well – even when you’re facing off against an ape or a giant man-eating plant.The game’s big new feature is an unlockable range of “fever rackets”, each offering a unique special move that can be powered up as a rally progresses. These might set fire to your opponent’s side of the court, or cover it in bananas so they slip over, or add mind-bending swerve to your shot. There’s a catch, however: if your foe can return the ball before it bounces – and you fail to do the same in return – the special effect is reversed against the originator. This leads to amusingly frantic rallies at the net as players battle to avoid being struck down with the accursed power.As with the various shells, lightning strikes and ink blots inMario Kart, the design philosophy behind these fever rackets is to level the playing field: if you’re falling horribly behind or are just a little inexperienced, a deftly used fever shot can get you back into competition. The brashly colourful cartoon-style visuals also add masses of appeal as the game’s cast of Mario superstars are immersed in a cacophony of flaming rocks and icy blasts.The most fun you’ll have is playing with a bunch of friends in the same room, but there’s also an online mode which offers ranked or friendly games. However you choose to play, the game exudes childlike charm while hiding layers of depth beneath its chaotic exterior. You can spend hours practising perfectly timed drop shots, mastering spin and getting your positioning just right, and figuring out which fever rackets best suit your style of play is an involving process. It is, in short, exactly what you want and expect from aNintendosports title – something for everyone, and then something more for those who decide to go pro.Mario Tennis Fever is available now, £58.99Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendoNintendo Switch 2Sports gamesSuper MarioreviewsShareReuse this content"

Originally intended to prop up a faltering Italian opera season, its orchestral novelties included a carillon – a keyboard imitating chiming bells – to celebrate the victorious Israelite army, a harp for the shepherd boy David, three trombones for the famous Dead March and a set of supersized kettledrums borrowed for the occasion from the Tower of London. When it premiered in 1739 it was the longest music theatre work ever written in English.Arcangelo, the London Handel festival’s principal ensemble in residence, seized on the music’s operatic intensity. Its founder Jonathan Cohen is one of the most expressive of Handelians with a keen ear for instrumental colour and a nose for drama. His pacing was urgent, though never excessively so, phrasing and dynamics were elegant and elastic, and the playing was outstanding (as you might expect for an orchestra packed with early music luminaries). An agile chorus of 30 sounded like double that number.A tale of dynastic rivalry, the oratorio follows David’s victory over the Philistines, his conflict with the resentful monarch Saul and his dealings with the dysfunctional royal family, including a hinted-at same-sex relationship with the king’s son, Jonathan. There’s even a Hammer Horror summoning scene where the ghost of the prophet Samuel, raised by the ambisextrous Witch of Endor, predicts Saul’s downfall.View image in fullscreenPerfect foils … Hugh Cutting as David and Jessica Cale as Micha.Photograph: Craig FullerChristopher Purves, who has commanded the title role on stage, didn’t just chew the scenery here, he swallowed it whole, snarling at the heavens as his grip on reality ebbed away. His forbidding baritone was coffin black. As the otherworldly David, Hugh Cutting was the perfect foil, his voice dripping with liquid honey. Accompanied by Oliver Wass on baroque harp, Oh Lord, Whose Mercies Numberless was a highlight.Jessica Cale’s high-flying lyricism suited the dewy-eyed Michal, contrasting nicely with Emőke Baráth’s spitfire soprano as the haughty Merab. Linard Vrielink displayed a bright, flamboyant tenor, casting long, lingering looks as the smitten Jonathan.

Una McKevitt’s black comedy brings members of the Thornton family together to mark the sale of their parental home. If family is the psychological battleground here, the house itself is alive with “triggering” elements, with designer Liam Doona’s faded decor and crammed furnishings playing a key part in the unfolding conflict.Having inherited the house from her grandmother, Sandra’s estranged daughter Kiera (Caroline Menton) now envisages a new life, free from caring responsibilities and the watchful eye of her grandmother from her full-length portrait, which dominates the room. Upstairs, unseen, Kiera’s uncle Terry is lying in a coma, and about to be moved to a nursing home. A second uncle, Daragh, arrives: “a character actor, in demand”, played with downbeat charm by Garrett Lombard, as Kiera ushers Rio (Jack Weise) out of the house, following a quick hook-up that is so contrived it clearly signals trouble.With Sandra’s whirlwind entrance from Los Angeles, spitting fury about her exclusion from the decision to sell the house, a showdown looks inevitable. Through McGuckin’s gleefully maniacal portrayal of Sandra the tone shifts from domestic realism towards farce. This glossy millionaire does not need the house, but wants it simply because she can’t have it.View image in fullscreenSpitting fury … Aislín McGuckin as Sandra.Photograph: Ros KavanaghWith a background indocumentary theatre, McKevitt has previously explored questions about caring for ageing relatives, and the balance between personal freedom and familial bonds. Here it is as if she can’t quite decide on the dramatic focus, and while the bickering about money and inheritance has the authentic ring of emotional resentment, it seems drawn-out and repetitive.As Sandra’s anger towards her dead mother drives her to extremes, the action takes a welcome swerve into absurd physical comedy, directed by Conall Morrison with fizzing energy, inventive use of a garlic crusher – and anything else to hand.

Daher’s effervescent cultural collage is a direct challenge to collective amnesiaThu 19 Feb 2026 08.47 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 11.43 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAt one point in Lana Daher’s filmDo You Love Me, a woman questions the repeated advice of those around her to simply forget Lebanon’s 15-year civil war that ended in 1990. Why does she insist on “digging into the past”, especially when “this war was no worse than the others”? Yet it is precisely her act of remembering – of knowing that she “did not dream” the actuality of war – that prompts her to dig “into the present”.The Lebanese director’s debut feature is itself a substantive feat of excavation,with more than 20,000 sources consultedin collaboration with the editor, Qutaiba Barhamji (who worked onThe Voice of Hind Rajab), to unearth the footage that would produce this 76-minute film. It is substantive also in the sense that this work was done in relation to a country that does not have a national archive.That fact – along with the film’s opening statement that contemporary history is not taught in Lebanese schools – is unsurprising when regarded in the context of the wider region. The Palestine Film Unit, which began as a small film-making collective in the late 1960s and took on a foundational role in Palestinian national cinema, had its archives removed by the Israeli army during the 1982 siege of Beirut. In similar fashion, Iraq’s state archives were confiscated by US forces in the aftermath of the American-led occupation of the country in 2003.Aside from war, limits on the freedom of expression by postcolonial states also play their part in cultural erasure. In another of Do You Love Me’s scenes, two women pore over newspapers and point at sections blanked out by the heavy hand of the censor – even the prime minister’s column is not immune.Elhum Shakerifar, a Bafta-nominated producer and curator who focuses on films from the region, said: “Archives the world over are curated. They’re choices, they’re fictions also. The access to them is selective. Sometimes, it’s down to whether you can afford to enter that archive or not.”View image in fullscreenImages as detritus in 2020’s Memories Lost, by Ayla Hibri.Photograph: PRSo, when Arabic cinema archives emerge out of the blue, or in the case ofMostafa Derkaoui’s banned 1974 film, About Some Meaningless Events, are found 42 years later as a film negative in Barcelona, the rediscovery can be as disorienting as it is miraculous. The state may be an unreliable narrator, but memories of the past remain diffused among those who lived through historical events – and are all the more real for it.Daher, who first started working on the film in 2018, says: “In a place likeLebanon, where the government fails you again and again, it’s the journalists, the writers, the musicians, the film-makers, they’re the ones who document history.”Since 2018, Lebanon has had to endure a lot of history. In that year, the country held a general election five years after it should have taken place. By October 2019, popular discontent erupted intolarge-scale proteststhat presented a serious challenge to the post-civil war order.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Martyrs’ Square in downtown Beirut, 27 October 2019.Photograph: Nabil Mounzer/EPAThe prime minister resigned but the ruling coalition, including Hezbollah and other parties allied to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, continued on regardless until theBeirut port disasterof August 2020. It is hard to overstate the psychological, let alone physical, impact that one of the world’s strongest ever non-nuclear explosions had on a population already hammered by the Covid pandemic.In perhaps the film’s most solemn scene, Daher addresses this “huge rupture in all our lives” but acknowledges that the toll of the event caused her to reassess the purpose of the project and “that was a moment where I wasn’t sure any more”.A presidential vacuum followed and a subsequent parliamentary election in 2022 yielded inconclusive results: Lebanon was in limbo, within a region ensnared by overlapping and unresolved conflicts. “It was very, very difficult because when we started editing the film, the war in Gaza had just started,” says Daher. “And bit by bit, things started to get much worse in Lebanon.”In October 2024, Israeli soldiers again crossed the Blue Line into southern Lebanon – having previously invaded in 1978, before occupying parts of the country from 1982 until 2000 – and launched a bombing campaign predominantly targeting areas largely inhabited by Shia Muslims, such as Dahieh in southern Beirut.“I thought 4 August [the Beirut port explosion] was the most traumatising until I had the experience of 80 tons of bunker busters exploding in Dahieh,” says Daher. “You know, my grandmother lives in Dahieh. I’m from the south of Lebanon, so my experience of all of it has been very difficult.”View image in fullscreenA still from 1985’s A Suspended Life (Ghazal el-Banat), by Jocelyne Saab.Photograph: PRThe impact of “so much tension and violence” leaves its own mark on cinema and the tolerance that Arab audiences have for Arabic films. “The last thing you want is that reality, even in a cinema theatre,” and so the task for Daher was to “approach things in a light way … [and] have a bit of humour at points”.She is adamant that “the Lebanese don’t need a history lesson”, although the film does not shy away from addressing “the cycles of violence and the repetitions in these cycles of violence – the repetitions in history – and how these things kind of affect our psyche and our society, rather than who did what and when things happened”.Instead of a strict, linear chronology, Do You Love Me gravitates towards certain themes as they re-emerge in Lebanon’s archival narrative over the past 70 years. Images of the sea are ubiquitous, as are the scenes of joy to be found in videos of wedding celebrations and siblings messing around with the family camcorder.View image in fullscreenA shot from Eliane Raheb’s Suicide, 2003.Photograph: PRResearching the project also sent Daher on an odyssey through private collections and abandoned archives, via universities and the state broadcaster. “I went to so many different places … it was like going through a garage sale or a Sunday market; you’re searching through random boxes, opening drawers, things are not labelled.”For an essay film of this nature, the barrier of intellectual property rights demanded a certain degree of creativity, with Daher going as far as to enlist her mother on a search along Beirut’s Corniche to secure copyright permission from a sole fisher, whose pithy comments in a 2020 documentary were deemed irreplaceable.The film shares its title with the name of a song by the Bendaly Family – a musical band of siblings who rose to fame in the Arab world during the late 1970s – which Daher recalls from her childhood; an uncommon reference point in 90s Lebanon, where the cultural diet was “American and French television … it was all foreign cinema”, with Arabic seen as being “not cool”.At a later point, Daher “became interested and I suddenly wanted to speak Arabic … [but] Lebanese cinema was not so accessible to me because a lot of it either wasn’t digitised or … there was just a little bit of it that was on DVDs”.View image in fullscreenThe Boombox, 1995, by Fouad Elkoury.Photograph: PRA significant amount of Do You Love Me consists of scenes from past Lebanese movies, therefore showcasing the country’s cinema – including the works of trailblazing female film-makers such as Jocelyne Saab and Heiny Srour – while also re-framing conventional narratives of its own image. “Taking that and creating our representation through these hundreds of other representations, for me, the form of that was also very important … making the film also transformed my relationship to Beirut and my relationship to home,” says Daher.Reflecting on the film, Shakerifar concludes: “Lebanon might not have a national archive, but there is something incredible about the way that Beirut in particular, but [also] the country has been archived through cinema. It’s a love letter to Beirut, but I think it’s also a love letter to the idea of cultural work that’s coming from a place of care and a place of love.”Do You Love Me is atthe ICA, London, from 19 February andat Bertha DocHouse, Londonon 22 and 25 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmLebanonMiddle East and north AfricainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Most of them deserve no more than one outingAmelia TaitThu 19 Feb 2026 05.54 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 05.55 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThough it aired almost two months ago, fans are still angry about theStranger Thingsfinale.So disappointing was the wrap to the five-season sci-fi that its cast are still having to deny that there is an upcoming secret final episode. I was not remotely disappointed, however. I thought the show ended perfectly: when I stopped watching it after season one, episode eight.I’m going to come out and say it, so that we can start fighting straight away. I believe that almost all recent TV shows should have been one season long.Stranger Thingshad a perfect eight-episode arc: a little boy disappeared into a hellish parallel dimension and his mum (who was Winona Ryder!) fought tooth and nail to bring him back. The show’s creators, the Duffer Brothers, seemingly knew this, as they originally pitched the series as an anthology featuring a different cast of characters each season. Netflix, naturally, said no – after all, you need a franchise with familiar faces if you want to sell customisable Stranger Things terrariums at two for £30. And so by the end, the show was stretched out beyond recognition and stripped of everything that made it groundbreaking and original. By all accounts, Ryder was left with nothing to do.View image in fullscreenSandra Oh in Killing Eve. Its finale received a 3.4 rating.Photograph: Anna Molnar/BBC AmericaBut didn’t I sayalmost allrecent shows? I did, thanks. Let me list them for you quickly, so the red mist can descend upon you and distract from everything that’s important in the world. TV shows that I believe should’ve been a one-and-done include: Industry,Killing Eve, Bad Sisters, Am I Being Unreasonable?, Your Friends and Neighbors and Nobody Wants This. But let me ruin my own credentials upfront: I am so committed to my stance that I haven’t even watched the second season of Fleabag.First, you must understand that I am not claiming thatevery show ever madeshould only have one season: The Simpsons should have 12; Mad Men, seven; Buffy, five. Largely, it’s only shows made in the last decade. The problem has arisen due to our unreliable and unpredictable media ecosystem. Commissions are being cut, budgets are being slashed, risks are being aversed. There’s more competition than ever before, and showrunners simply have no idea if their shows will be renewed.This environment encourages some creatives to bring everything to the table with the first season of their show, creating something original, tight and self-contained. Christopher C Rogers, co-creator of the tech drama Halt and Catch Fire, has almost admitted as much: “I think uncertainty reinforced a hold-nothing-back mindset in the storytelling that got us to our best work quickly,” he said in 2017. Conversely, “When you hold story back or try to draw it out, the audience can tell. Not knowing if there would be a metaphorical ‘tomorrow’ really saved us from that mistake.”View image in fullscreenScoot McNairy in Halt and Catch Fire … ‘its final season was considered its best’.Photograph: Tina Rowden/AMCIn the case ofHalt and Catch Fire, this all worked out in the end: the show’s fourth and final season is considered its best, with a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But this can’t always be the case. Because while budgets continue to buffer, something else is happening that results in diminishing returns.“We live in a world of IP [intellectual property], where the safest thing to do is reboot something that has an audience,” Breaking Bad creatorVince Gilligansaid last year. Meanwhile, fellow critically acclaimed writer David Simon (The Wire) has complained he “can’t get anything made now” because “I’ll never write anything that’s going to be a franchise”. The media’s obsession with IP means that once something is successful, it’s not allowed to die. Shows must be stretched out for maximum profits, regardless of what’s best for storytelling. Stranger Thingsis not just a terrarium: ithas also been turned into a Broadway play and series of novels, and will soon have an animated spinoff.In this environment, is it any wonder that one-off shows that prove successful are renewed for season two? It doesn’t matter that the central mystery of your murder mystery was solved – there’s money to be made! “It was set out as a limited series and, you know, it has an end,” Bad Sisters creatorSharon Horganonce said of the first season show – she even called its finale a “lovely, satisfying end”. I couldn’t agree more, which is why I didn’t bother pressing play when the show somehow suddenly returned for season two.View image in fullscreenTime for last orders? … Kristen Bell and Adam Brody in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: ERIN SIMKIN/NETFLIXI’m not alone in thinking less can often be more. Killing Eve’s first series ended with an episode IMDb users rated 8.3 out of 10, but its finale – three seasons later – scored just 3.4. Meanwhile, a headline on Cracked reads: ‘‘‘Nobody Wants This’ Didn’t Need a Second Season”. I’m probably alone in not wanting more Industry – but again, I felt I watched a satisfying and complete arc in season one. A graduate wanted a job and then she got it; I was invited to ponder at what cost. I personally don’t need three more seasons of cost-pondering, even if it’s fun to watch beautiful people be bad.Listen, I don’t want you to have a heart attack, so it’s probably time to admit: I haven’t seen Succession. From what I can tell, its four seasons were all equally successful at storytelling – so maybe it’s the exception I can use to prove my rule (don’t ask me how. I told you I haven’t seen it). But because life is nothing without strong opinions you can spout across the dinner table, let me reiterate: almost all recent TV shows should have been one season long. And if you think my opinions are stupid, you’re in luck: I’m only giving you one of them. You won’t have to suffer through two.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStranger ThingsKilling EveVince GilliganSharon HorganfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Francis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam war epic Duvall plays the commander of a helicopter squadron who flies into battle with Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries blaring from loudspeakers and utters the immortal line:“I love the smell of napalm in the morning.”Duvall’s scene-stealing portrayal earned him Bafta and Golden Globe awards for best supporting actor as well as an Oscar nomination in that category. What is less well known is that his character was based on a real officer who fought in Vietnam. Lt Col John B Stockton was hard to miss. Like Duvall in the movie, he wore a black Stetson and spurs on his boots. He carried his papers in leather saddlebags and even had his unit’s mascot, a mule called Maggie, smuggled into Vietnam despite a strict “no pets” policy. And he really did play Wagner from side-mounted speakers fixed to his helicopter when going into action.View image in fullscreenDuvall as Kilgore in Apocalypse Now.Photograph: United Artists/Moviestore/ShutterstockDuvall, the son of a rear admiral in the US navy, confirmed in interviews discussing his part in Apocalypse Now that he studied accounts of Stockton and similar characters when preparing to play Kilgore. Stockton’s style choices were not random. In his book Pleiku: The Dawn of Helicopter Warfare in Vietnam, military historian JD Coleman describes him as: “Balding, rawhide-lean, just under six feet tall, [Stockton] had the handlebar moustache of the old time cavalryman. When viewed without his headgear, he looked a lot like a Yul Brynner with facial hair.” Stockton was commander of1st Squadron, 9th Air Cavalry Regimentand was fixated on the word “cavalry”. To Stockton, the helicopter soldiers of Vietnam were a contemporary embodiment of US cavalry bluecoats from the frontier wars against Native Americans in the 19th century.View image in fullscreenLt Col John B Stockton, commander of the 3rd Battalion, 17th Cavalry Regiment, in 1965.Photograph: @USArmyThe familiarVietnam warimage of US infantry “grunts” being helicoptered into jungle clearings and paddy fields was in fact the outcome of a new tactical doctrine that emerged in the late 1950s, inspired by the speed and mobility of mounted cavalry from an earlier era. Helicopters were introduced into the US army during the Korean war, but mostly for carrying wounded soldiers to field hospitals, as in the 1970 movie M*A*S*H. The idea of using them to revolutionise infantry warfare is credited to Lt Gen James “Jumpin’ Jim” Gavin, a highly decorated second world war veteran who, by 1957, was head of research and development for the US army. Having experienced the pros, and especially the cons, of sending men into battle by parachute he formulated a new tactic: his “horses” would be troop-carrying helicopters capable of delivering soldiers to crucial points of a battlefield with speed and precision.The Air Cavalry began operating in Vietnam in 1965 and Stockton was not the only officer to lean into the horse soldier heritage. When the 1st Cavalry Division shipped to Vietnam many of its officers enthusiastically embraced the image of their hard-riding predecessors. Stetsons, cavalry moustaches, bullwhips, six-shooters and other accoutrements were routinely adopted, despite the best efforts of more conservative command elements.Disappointingly, Stockton is not recorded as having uttered the famous “napalm” line; Apocalypse Now’s screenwriter John Milius says the words came to him when he was working on the script in the late 1960s. Stockton never went on record about his portrayal as Lt Col Kilgore, but army colleagues said it amused him.View image in fullscreenThe body of a soldier is carried to an evacuation helicopter by troops from US 1st Cavalry Division in the Ia Drang Valley in November 1965.Photograph: Peter Arnett/APStockton’s subsequent career was marked by controversy. He was recognised as a pioneer of the new “air mobile” tactics and commanded his squadron with considerable daring and panache during the early phases of thebattle of Ia Drang, the first big US ground battle against North Vietnamese forces. During intense fighting in November 1965, he was told a US infantry company was about to be overrun and annihilated; he asked permission to send in reinforcements, only to be denied. Stockton went ahead anyway and dispatched helicopters with extra men. His action was credited with saving 100 US and allied lives, but because he had ignored a direct order he was removed from command. He kept his rank but played no further role in the conflict.‘His friendship changed my life’: 25 years of camaraderie with Robert DuvallRead moreDespite being officially disgraced, he retained the strong affection of the men who served under him. They saw him as standing up for the ordinary soldier against senior commanders who were often careless as to the fate of their men.

The film dramatised the friendship between the South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), who was murdered in police custody, and the journalistDonald Woods(Kevin Kline), who fought to secure an inquest into Biko’s death and was forced to flee the country.While Cry Freedom was being shot in Zimbabwe, Walker was preparing a rough assembly of the footage flown back to her in London.“I was very, very nervous about this,” she said. “I took my first few scenes out to Zimbabwe to let [Attenborough] see them privately to find out if I was on the right track. They didn’t have a proper screening room as such, it was just a hut lined with old egg-boxes for sound-proofing.” Attenborough insisted on viewing her footage with an audience: “He had invited everybody and I almost died.”The response was positive, and she was given free rein with the rest of the picture. “We seemed almost instinctively to agree on the tempo and intensity of sequence after sequence,” Attenborough said.Her most dramatic contribution to Cry Freedom was to shift Biko’s death from early in the film to the halfway point, thereby reducing though not eliminating the reliance on flashbacks.“Both Richard and I thought that the flashbacks were great, but there is no getting away from the fact that the audience would know Biko had gone and the emotional content seemed to float out the door,” she said.Walker received her third Bafta nomination for the film; her previous ones were for the 1981 television miniseries Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years and for Mona Lisa.She next collaborated with Attenborough on Shadowlands (1993), about the relationship between CS Lewis (Anthony Hopkins), author of the Narnia books, and the poet Joy Davidman (Debra Winger), whom he married following her cancer diagnosis.View image in fullscreenAlfred Molina and Margi Clarke in Letter to Brezhnev, 1985, edited by Lesley Walker.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyIt presented Walker with her biggest challenge. “The hardest thing in Shadowlands was in holding back the emotion,” she explained, likening it to “riding a horse, you rein it in a bit and then let it go”. Her initial assembly reduced Attenborough to tears. “He was a total mess at the end of the film, we all were. I still cry at it.”The tears felt well earned. “Lesley avoided sentimentality,” Kingsley said. “She actually disliked it in films and that made her stand out. She was a toughie. She’d take on directors and tell them what she thought. She wasn’t by any means a pushover. But she had a soothing effect on people, some of them strong, feisty, difficult men. They didn’t shout at Lesley. They respected her.”Gilliam first hired her on The Fisher King (1991), his warm-hearted mythical buddy movie about a manic, unhoused widower (Robin Williams) and a down-at-heel former DJ (Jeff Bridges).“I particularly wanted a woman editor, because I wanted a more emotional touch to the film,” Gilliam said. “This was partly to control me, to keep me from going down paths that I’d been down in the past. But I also needed her to support the sides of me that I wanted to reveal in this film. And that’s what Lesley did. She’s got a wonderful sense of character, and she developed an incredibly strong emotional side to the telling of the tale, so I was able to avoid the need to be ‘clever’.”The Fisher King duly became the sort of film that won over even those viewers previously immune to Gilliam’s eccentric charms.View image in fullscreenCathy Tyson and Bob Hoskins in Mona Lisa, 1986.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyWalker next cut his adaptation ofHunter S Thompson’s cult novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), starring Johnny Depp and based on the author’s drug-fuelled escapades.Complications ensued onThe Brothers Grimm, with Matt Damon andHeath Ledgerin the title roles. Throughout post-production in 2004, Gilliam was at loggerheads with Bob Weinstein, head of Dimension Films, who produced the movie. He repeatedly sent Gilliam and Walker back to the cutting room despite positive reactions at early test screenings. During this lengthy and arduous process, the director briefly put the movie aside in favour of a new project,Tideland, which Walker also edited. Both premiered in 2005.Her last film with Gilliam wasThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote(2018), the director’s long-gestating riff on Cervantes, which he had been forced to abandon unfinished in 1998 but which was now revived with Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce.Walker was born in Wimbledon, south-west London, to Gwyneth (nee Jones) and Frank, who ran a cafe, where Lesley later had a Saturday job. After leaving school at 15, she worked in the electrical department at Woolworths. Having answered a newspaper advertisement, she was employed as a receptionist at Studio Film Labs in London. While there, her range of tasks expanded and she developed an interest in the craft of editing.She was noticed by the editor John Bloom, and became his assistant on films including Georgy Girl, about the romantic imbroglios of a young Londoner played byLynn Redgrave, and Funeral in Berlin (both 1966), the second in the series of spy thrillers starring Michael Caine as Harry Palmer.Walker’s first lead editing job was onJoseph Strick’s adaptation of James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1977). She went on to edit the western Eagle’s Wing, and Derek Jarman’s version of The Tempest (both 1979), and two films for Mike Leigh: his state-of-the-nation masterpiece Meantime (1983), featuring early performances by Gary Oldman and Tim Roth, andAll or Nothing(2002), about the woebegone residents of a south London housing estate, with Timothy Spall, Lesley Manville and James Corden.View image in fullscreenMamma Mia!, 2008, with, from left, Julia Walters, Meryl Streep and Christine Baranski.Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarShe cut two literary adaptations for the director Douglas McGrath – Emma (1996), with Gwyneth Paltrow, andNicholas Nickleby(2002), starring Charlie Hunnam in the title role. For Stephen Frears, she edited Mary Reilly (1996), with Julia Roberts playing the maid to John Malkovich’s Dr Jekyll.Walker also cut three further but less distinguished pictures for Attenborough: In Love and War (1996), Grey Owl (1999) andClosing the Ring(2007). Her final film was the comedy-dramaMilitary Wives(2019), with Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan.The latter-day drift away from film to digital left her unfazed. “A lot of editors of her generation didn’t make the shift from celluloid,” Kingsley said. “But Lesley did. She said, ‘I miss the thinking time you had cutting on film but it’s the same craft.’”She is survived by a sister.Lesley Walker, film editor, born 27 July 1945; died 2 December 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryobituariesShareReuse this content"

That’s not hyperbole – you could breathe in and be drunk on it. The canals have frozen over, which only happens about once every 13 years, and couples are skating on them. You can see cosy bars from miles away because they’re strung with fairy lights – apparently not just a Christmas thing here. Everyone is beautiful.But none of that comes close to explaining why young Danes inDenmark, unlike gen Z across the developed world, are still having sex. Winter isn’t even their frisky season. “You feel the atmosphere in the springtime,” says Ben, 35, half-British, half Danish. His friend Anna, also 35, originally Hungarian, says: “Post-hibernation fever, you can feel the sexual energy. Everyone is on. Everyone swims in the canals, a lot of the women will be topless – they’re like herrings.” (Which is to say: they are typically Danish, they love the water and they don’t wear clothes … I think.) Ben and Anna are millennials, of course, rather than gen Z: they provide the outsiders’ perspective.Some of the data is starkly depressing:one US studyfrom 2023 found that 24% of adults aged 18 to 29 reported no sexual activity at all in the past year. Aglobal sex habits surveyby Feeld and Kinsey’s the following year found that 37% of gen Z reported no sex in the last month, compared to 19% of millennials and 17% of gen X.In the UK, only a quarter of people across all age groups said they had had sex in the past week in a 2020 YouGov poll – compared with the Danish figures of nearly half of straight men and 43% of straight women, again across all age groups (Denmark’ssurvey data on sexis, predictably, the best in the world). The trend has its own vocabulary – “heteropessimism”, “voluntary celibates”, “boy sobers” (that’s girls who have sworn off boys; the boys aren’t sober). In Denmark, the age of becoming sexually active has remained constant since the 1950s, at 16.4 (the age of consent is 15, in common with a lot of Scandinavian countries). Gen Z Danes are having no less sex than previous generations, and most people report satisfaction with their sex lives.“That’s the impression I get,” says Carl Christian, 23, a psychology student at the imposing University of Copenhagen, in the centre of the capital. “But I don’t know if it’s from the news or from my own life. At least, with the crowds I’m in, situationships are very common. Maybe in our early teens, if a girl lost her virginity, she’d be less likely to boast about it. But people don’t judge women in their 20s for being sexually active; we’d much rather celebrate when we hear that our female friends have met someone nice in a club.”People get laid more often, says Frida, also 23 and studying psychology, “because it’s more accepted that you might have an intimate connection with just a friend. It takes a lot to get people to settle into a committed relationship.” “Danish people drink a lot – that doesn’t hurt, either,” adds Christine, 24, a student of global development.View image in fullscreenFrida, a psychology student at Copenhagen University.Photograph: Valdemar Ren/The GuardianThere’s certainly an economic factor: only 11% of Danesstill live with their parentsat the age of 24, compared with 18%here in the UK. There’s no student debt in Denmark; students get paid more than €600 a month to study; it’s very common to take a year or often two out between school and university, so everyone’s more confident by the time they start studying. Frida spent last term at the University of California, Berkeley, and says, “I talked to US friends about a lot, including dating. I noticed that it felt like everything for them revolved around the school and studying. It’s easier to pause that when you don’t have to maximise every minute.”According to Katinka, 25, who is studying public health (she’s out in a bar with Christine; they were at primary school together), there has been a quiet revolution in sex education. When she was at school, they had a good practical grounding, she explains: they were taught how to put a condom on when they were 13. But now, “it’s become gradually more sex positive. There’s more focus on female pleasure. I would definitely say it was inclusive.”“It didn’t really focus much on women when we were at school,” Christine adds, “and it was very heteronormative. Maybe the more inclusive you are, the more you speak about it, and the more you realise that it should be pleasurable for everyone.” The chat-up culture isn’t patriarchal here. “Women pick,” Anna says. “The men are more timid.”That sex positivity runs across government departments. During Covid, the director of health announced: “Sex is good. Sex is healthy. Of course you can have sex in this situation.”“They were worried that social distancing was very hard for young people,” says Thomas Hübertz from Checkpoint, part of the Danish Aids foundation, which does sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and awareness-raising for young people. “In the year of Covid and the year after, we’ve never had that many sexually transmitted diseases, ever.” We’ll come back to chlamydia which, fair play,Denmark is the OECD hotspot for, by some margin.double quotation markWe wanted to stock things that were aesthetically pleasing … because when it’s beautiful it takes some of the shame out of itFirst, Peech: a sex shop in the centre of town, which looks like a cross between a nail bar and a boutique, and is absolutely open about what it sells. “We wanted to stock things that were aesthetically pleasing,” says 30-year-old co-founder Clara Filippa Andersen, “because when it’s beautiful it takes some of the shame out of it.”Sextoys, she says, used to be “either super kinky or because you had a problem that you needed to solve. So they’ve always been stigmatised. But I really love the product because I think it’s a way to get to know your own body, your own erogenous zones.”Denmark was the first country in the world todecriminalise pornography, in 1969, and the conversation here is more sophisticated than it is almost anywhere, picking a path pretty effortlessly between “all porn is dividing us from our authentic sexuality” and “everyone should have sex more like porn stars”. “Porn is not necessarily bad,” Andersen says, “but if we don’t know our own bodies and our own limits, it’s hard to make your own identity when you’re saturated with it.”As a result of that legislation, Scandinavian erotica was huge in Denmark in the 60s and 70s, Anna says. She volunteers at an arthouse cinema, Huset Biograf: “They show a lot of the worst movies in the world, and also a lot of sexploitation, weird porn cinema content from back in the day.” It’s somewhere between a cultural artefact and a part of the liberated DNA. They really talk about this stuff.“There’s a distinctive club culture in Copenhagen,” Anna continues. “A lot of dance clubs observe safer space rules: no homophobia, no transphobia, no misogyny, no crossing boundaries, no pictures – they have dark rooms.” In the UK you’d associate dark rooms and the rest only with sex clubs and gay clubs, not with mainstream straight clubbing. “Consent is a huge part of it,” she says. “They used to have groups of volunteers called the Club Mafia, explaining it to everyone. That’s really seeped into the culture of gen Z – they’re very sex positive.”If there was already a lot of cross-pollination between gay and straight culture, gen Z has accelerated it, according to Kathrine Graa, 31, store manager at Peech. “Gen Z and alpha are very fluid, no boxes at all. The whole reason we’re called Peech is that it’s emoji language for butt. And everybody’s got a butt.”Back at the university, in the actual hallowed Victorian halls, it’s nighttime, and the club in the students’ union has a chlamydia walk-by testing stand, staffed by Miranda, 29, and Nanna, 25. They work for Checkpoint, and are meeting a few needs. First, those left unaddressed by traditional GPs. Miranda explains: “You meet a lot of bias and a lot of stigma and ignorance. I’ve said before that I’m sexually active and not on birth control, and it’s like the doctor’s brain explodes – they cannot fathom what’s going on. It’s not even in their mind that you could have an active sex life without that being a heterosexual one. They test where theythinksex happens [based on assumptions about straight, vanilla sexual activity], but we test based on where you had sex – your mouth or your vagina or your anus.” Hübertz says GPs will say: “‘Why are you here? You were here last year?’ They don’t understand that young people are going out Thursday, Friday and Saturday and [maybe] having 10 sexual partners , so they need to be tested more than once a year. But overall, the Danish health authorities are very supportive.”View image in fullscreenNanna (left) and Miranda, who work for Checkpoint, running a chlamydia testing point at Copenhagen University.Photograph: Valdemar Ren/The GuardianSecond, as previously mentioned, there’s a lot of chlamydia. “I would say young people in Denmark are very bad at using condoms,” Nanna says. “I think maybe people feel fearless. A lot of women think: if I can’t get pregnant, I’m fine.” HIV has been more or less eradicated in Denmark – in 2024, 103 people were newly diagnosed (from a population of approximately 6 million), compared with 3,043 in the UK (from a population of approximately 70 million), where we also feel that it’s been eradicated.“It’s our first time trying the testing,” says Laurits, 23, who is on the student events committee. “People are not as ashamed as you’d think.” The only thing people complain about “is this one, for the penis”, says Miranda, holding up a swab that looks like a Covid test. “It goes up the urethra. People hype themselves up and then they hype each other up. But it’s only half a centimetre for three seconds.” I ask her if it hurts, thinking about the time my brother-in-law waved off the experience of childbirth as fine because it was quick, and my sister said she could cut his balls off in three seconds and it would still hurt. “Well, I don’t know. Obviously, I haven’t tried it,” she says, sunnily. “For this event, everybody has been so cute – they’re so happy we’re here. We had some stickers saying ‘real friends get tested together’ and we’ve run out.” AcrossEurope, public health authorities are trying to limit chlamydia testing to only people with symptoms, because they’re worried about antibiotic resistance, but 80% of women have no symptoms. The Netherlands has already instituted that reduction, and Belgium looks set to follow. “I can foresee potential challenges,” Hübertz says, carefully.The most common hypothesis for non-Danish gen Z’s sex drought is a combination of social media and dating apps; the first isolating everyone and draining them of their real-life capabilities, the second reducing everyone to a two-dimensional version of themselves, so that everyone’s “having very surface conversations, swiping people as if they’re not people,” Frida says. Denmark doesn’t seem to be immune to doom-scrolling: “A lot of people have trouble with addiction,” Christian says. Late last year, the government announced plans to restrict social media use for the under-15s, citing worries about access to harmful content. It just doesn’t seem to be killing anyone’s sex drive.It would be impertinent to come out with a pat answer, on this level of acquaintance, but if somebody said a combination of economic security, inclusivity, gender equality, straightforwardness, sex-positive education and policy, erotically experimental art, culture and commerce, and hedonism had all interacted to create a rabbit generation in a world ofpandas, I wouldn’t fall out of my chair.This article was amended on 19 February 2026 to include the populations of Denmark and the UK in order to better contextualise the relative number of HIV cases in each country. Also, it was Denmark’s director of health, not minister of health, who told Danes during Covid lockdowns that “sex is healthy”.Explore more on these topicsSexEuro visionsDenmarkEuropeAids and HIVPornographyEurovisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

First up waspancake day, which is always a whole-day affair in our kitchen, with both sweet and savoury stations, crepe pans and all the toppings (you can always rely on Felicity Cloake fora foolproof recipe). And, because of the way the calendars fall this year, we are also celebratingOrthodox Maslenitsa, or cheesefare, weekat the same time.OK, so the sentiment is pretty much the same (it’s the week before the start of Lent, when people ease into their strict fasting period), but these two celebrations can often be weeks apart (blame the battle of the Gregorian and Julian calendars). For those of Orthodox faith, last week was all about eating meat, and this week is all about dairy. Essentially, you are trying to consume all the animal products and get them out of the house in preparation for the 40-plus-day fast. And, whether or not you are religious, in my book any tradition that means you get to eat loads of cheese is a win.View image in fullscreenFreezer friendly … Reem Kassis’s za’atar and halloumi scones.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverThe third factor I am having to account for this week is that it is half-term, so any cheese and dairy consumption has to also consider small palates. Thankfully, my girls love halloumi as much as I do, so first up we madethese za’atar and halloumi sconesby Reem Kassis, which were ahugehit with everyone and, now that I think of it, would also be great in the freezer for an emergency snack or light lunch. We’ve also had a wonderfully messy time making Blanche Vaughan’spotato, thyme and taleggio galette, which was messy only because of the small hands involved, plus I find free-form galettes one of the most satisfying things of all to bake. The slight nuttiness from the wholemeal flour is glorious, and if you are truly using up remnants from the fridge, a mixture of whatever strong, oozy cheese you had would work well here. Another crowd-pleaser is my own recipe for simplifiedpimento cheese and pickle-loaded crisps, which is fun for playdates (and for guests young and old). I also love tubbing up the cheese spread for that, so it’s ready as a last-minute sandwich filling or bread topper.There is also all the yoghurt and milk to get through this week (and we havea lotof yoghurt in our fridge). Sami Tamimi and Tara Wigley’s recipe forma’caroneh bil labanis a staple for me, not least because it is after-work quick to make and so very deeply delicious; I highly recommend giving it a go if you’ve never tried a yoghurt-dressed pasta. It is also a week for baking, and Benjamina Ebuehi’sgrapefruit yoghurt loaf cakeis bang on seasonal trend: it ticks the February citrus box, as well as the need for yoghurt usage and dealing with the constant moans for an afternoon snack. I also have a batch offrozen yoghurtin the freezer pretty much at all times (and thanks, again, to Felicity Cloake), because it is an excellent, quick, delicious dessert. You can make it as elegant as you like (honey and pistachios for me, please) or as playful (smashed-up Smarties and strawberries for the small people). However you adorn your froyo, it is well worth rustling up a batch for the freezer, cheesefare week or otherwise.My week in foodView image in fullscreenPaint the whole world … Georgina Hayden’s rainbow jelly.Photograph: Georgina HaydenWibble wobble|Not a particularly serious contribution, but one that seems to have got a fair bit of attention for its silliness and fun, is this layeredrainbow jelly.

There’s something about this place on the lush intersection of the silk roads between Europe and Asia that gets under the skin. Perhaps it’s the combination of unpolished authenticity paired with profound generosity (guests are considered a gift from God and fed accordingly), all while being gently rocked in a cradle of civilisation, that make Georgian wine so beguiling. (My first visit in August 2023 – a khachapuri-fuelled reconnaissance for my book, Drinking the World: AWineOdyssey – lingered in my mind long after my flight touched back down on British tarmac.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.What I find most refreshing is that the country, and its wine, is completely itself, despite being hemmed in by empires with a proclivity for invasion (Persians, Turks, Mongols et al), as well as the decades spent under USSR rule, which between 1922 and 1991 switched the grape-growing focus to yield over quality. Today, you really feel the Georgian delight at flipping that old Soviet diktat on its head.The winemakers I met were laser-focused on nurturing their Georgian-ness, while the country’s 525-plus indigenous grape varieties result in kaleidoscopic left-field flavours. When John Wurdeman, the American co-founder ofPheasant’s Tears winery, came on to the scene in 2007, he gave Georgian wines a window to the world. Early adopters such asYotam Ottolenghihelped bring them into the mainstream, and their surging popularity (UK volume sales increased by 72% in 2024) runs in congruence with the rise of natural wine. In fact, you can hold this corner of the Caucasus accountable for the profusion of voguish bars proffering groovy-labelled orange wines, though the fermentation of skin-contact “amber” wine inqvevri(egg-shaped clay vessels buried underground) has been à la mode here since Neolithic times.For a wine enthusiast, Georgia is like tapping into the source code. The sommelier Honey Spencer sees it as “the final frontier”, whilenomadic winemaker Darren Smithdubs the country “the holiest of holies”. Hot, dry Kakheti in the east produces the lion’s share of Georgia’s wines, typically bold reds and ambers, and I was particularly wowed bya qvevri-aged saperavi(an inky-skinned red with heady notes of blackcurrant and leather) made by Orgo’s respected Giorgi Dakishvili. From the country’s west, meanwhile, expect bright, fresh wines. I loved the beautifully structured wines from Oda, set up by literary critic turned winemaker Keto Ninidze, while names to know in Imereti areArchil Guniavaand the Abuladze sibling trio behindBaia(where Smith made wines under hisThe Finest Wines Available to Humanity label), both of which embrace endemic varieties: the vermentino-like tsolikauri, the crisp, late-blooming krakhuna and tsitska’s herbal aromas.Spencer, ofSune restaurant in east London, recently masterminded the excellent wine list atDakaDaka, 2026’s most exciting Georgian opening. “When I was first trying these wines back in 2011, a lot of the reds were incredibly heavy and not really suited to the western palate,” she says. “That was a Soviet hangover. They have changed, though. There’s a lightness and a deftness of touch in most Georgian wines now.”A Georgian starter setPheasant’s Tears Rkatsiteli Bodbiskhevi 2023£22 Shrine to the Vine, 12.5%.

In fact, their design is not for domestic calm and onion basket or fridge drawer neglect, but for uncultivated wilds. In particular the limestone terrain of the Mediterranean, where their defining smells are hardcore chemical defences, with every small, tough leaf or needle loaded with enough volatiles to deter both predators and competitors.Rosemary is particularly kick-arse in this respect, with those volatiles (mostly organic compounds called terpenoids) synthesised and stored in minuscule glands that project from the surface of each dark green needle, which breaks when brushed against or bitten, releasing an intense, hot, bitter shot. It’s the evergreen equivalent of carrying personal defence spray. The needles also mark territory. By leaking their volatiles into the nearby soil, they inhibit the seeds of other plants (maybe even their own) from taking root and, in turn, taking space, water and precious minerals in a challenging environment.Challenging in another way is my onion and garlic basket, which, despite regular sorting, has a magnetic pull for clothes pegs, hairbands, coins, batteries, Lego, empty lighters and dust, and is where I keep the bay leaves and branches of rosemary I bring home from dog walks. While there are some dried branches under the onions, I neglected those further and picked two nice, bushy fresh branches for this week’s recipe, which is inspired by Joyce Molyneux’s chocolate pots in The Carved Angel Cookery Book and Ada Boni’s panna cotta fromIl Talismano della Felicità.An intense and balanced mix of pine, eucalyptus and camphor, rosemary is a strong-minded and complementary match for the dark roasted, fruity, malty, almost sweaty flavour of dark chocolate; two such strong elements, both of which are rounded by the cream. Another benefit of adding dark chocolate to panna cotta is that it negates a common and annoying problem: that the final set is rubbery rather than tender and wobbly. This is because the chocolate, diluted in a large amount of cream and dominating the gelatine, takes control of the panna cotta, setting into a thick, smooth, almost velvet texture. In order to infuse the cream with the rosemary, though, it is essential to warm it gently and slowly, so sit the pan on a low heat and watch it carefully – it should almost (but not quite) come to a boil.It is important to pull the tray out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before serving, so the consistency of the panna cotta is velvet-like, and that the pungent, resinous and delightful perfume of the rosemary comes through. To unmould, the best way to do this is first to use a slender-bladed knife to ease the top edge of the panna cotta away from sides. Next, pour about an inch of boiling water into a bowl and dip the base of each mould into the hot water, holding it there for about 20 seconds while shaking the mould gently. Invert (it should smootch out like wonderful brown sea anemones) on to plates, and decorate each panna cottawith a few sharp needles of fresh rosemary, which are also useful for fending off competitors.Chocolate and rosemary panna cottaMakes4-63 x 2g sheets of gelatine140g dark chocolate500ml single cream100g icingor fine caster sugar2 bushy sprigs fresh rosemary, plus extra for decoratingChoose four suitable moulds (ramekins, small cups or shot glasses) for the panna cottaandarrange them on a plate or small tray that will fit in the fridge.

I don’t like it when people ask where I’ve bought something because I like to be unique.My friends find it funny, but I think it’s important to have your own distinct style. This hasn’t been a point of contention until recently, when I bought a nice perfume. Elsa complimented me on it and asked what it was, then said she was going to buy it because she loved it so much.I expressed annoyance at that, which I think is justified, even if it confused Elsa. My reasoning is simple: if I have a unique scent that is personal to me, I don’t want my best friend to smell the same. We can’t go around wearing the same perfume; it’s weird.A personal scent is a very intimate thing. It’s not like a jumper or even a lipstick shade, which you put on and take off. When someone hugs me and says, “I like how you smell,” that means something and it’s personal. Elsa wanting to buy the exact same perfume feels like an erosion of my identity, and it also feels a bit lazy. Why can’t she find her own scent?double quotation markThe fact that she couldn’t understand why I’d be upset made me feel a bit dismissedThe one I have isn’t from a big designer brand, but a small French-owned website. I guess I want to gatekeep it because I did the research to find something that I really liked and feel that she should do the same. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to want to keep some things to myself.I don’t copy Elsa’s clothes or her haircut – in fact I actively avoid doing so because I respect her individuality. The fact that she couldn’t understand why I’d be upset made me feel a bit dismissed. She called me “shallow” in a jokey way, but I didn’t find it funny. My boyfriend, Ben, also sided with her, which annoyed me more.They have been quick to frame this as me being insecure, but I don’t think that’s fair. Wanting to feel distinct just means I value the small things that make us who we are. Algorithms nudge us towards the same things online, making us all less unique, so it’s increasingly important to hold on to our individuality.The defence: Elsadouble quotation markI’m not trying to copy her whole identity. Friends having similar tastes is just sharing the joyI find it funny that Marta thinks she and I can’t have the same scent. Perfume isn’t private property – it’s a product sold in shops to the general public. The idea that once Marta wears a scent it becomes off-limits to everyone else in her social circle feels absurd.Over the years, Marta has been quite defensive about people copying her style. When I bought a top she also owns without first informing her, she got annoyed. She doesn’t like it when people ask where her stuff is from because she wants to gatekeep her things. I find it funny, but a couple of times our mutual friends have expressed offence when she has tried to keep stuff from them.double quotation markWe are best friends, so is it really so horrible to share a fragrance?I also think it’s slightly immature. If someone is copying your whole identity, fine – it’s fair to get annoyed. But if it’s just a perfume or an item of clothing, what’s the problem?When I asked about the perfume, Marta got cold and standoffish. She eventually told me the brand, but I felt as if I’d accidentally crossed a line. When I pushed, she told me she didn’t want me to buy it. I laughed, but later realised she was serious. Her reaction made me feel like I’d stolen something from her when all I’d done was admire her.Also, perfume smells different on everyone. Body chemistry, soap and detergent all change how a scent settles, so the idea that we’d smell the same is just not true. And even if we did, so what? We are best friends, so is it really so horrible to share a fragrance?Friends influence each other all the time, and I’ve bought things Marta recommended to me before and she never seemed offended – but maybe it’s because she didn’t like the thing so much in the first place, and so didn’t mind sharing.Liking the same perfume doesn’t mean I want to be her. It means we have overlapping tastes, which after 14 years of close friendship is probably quite normal. Perfume is meant to be enjoyed not guarded. I think sharing joy is far more important than guarding uniqueness for the sake of it.The jury of Guardian readersShouldElsa come to her senses and find her own perfume?Marta doesn’t own the perfume, and reducing her identity to a scent is absurd. Most people won’t even notice – no one else is thinking about us as much as we think they are!Emily, 35Scents are some of the most subliminal sensory elements, natural or not. I do understand Marta – she takes great care with her persona, and invest a lot of time and effort. But she did tell Elsa where the fragrance was from. Now she can take solace in being an “influencer”.Laura, 62Sorry Marta, unless you extracted or blended that perfume yourself, your claim to it is pretty flimsy. The hipster notion of “authenticity” – buying obscure and niche products “before they were cool” – is as consumerist as any algorithmic trend.Josh, 42It seems to me that Marta prizes her individuality and holds her individual consumer choices to be integral to her identity. This will always be a shaky combination, because when you buy your identity, someone else can also buy it. Identity should derive from what you do, not what you buy. Perhaps Marta should take up a hobby?Victoria, 25Once a product is on the market, it is available to any member of the public. To suggest it is part of any single purchaser’s identity is deluded. If Marta is hoping to be unique, she will need to pay to have a custom scent created for her and ensure the recipe becomes her property.Ani, 71Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Elsa change her perfume?The poll closes on Wednesday 25 February at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherMabel should stop leaving piles of clothesall over the bedroom93%of you said yes –Mabel is guilty7%of you said no –Mabel is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsFriendshipYou be the judgeBeautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, much of that momentum is being crowded out of our minds by anxieties: a worsening affordability crisis, geopolitical instability and the specter of artificial intelligence looming over the workplace.For the tech CEOs leading the AI race and enriching themselves as they jostle for dominance, AI isn’t a phantasm at all, but a glimmering unicorn. When they predict AI isjust months awayfrom being able to do everything a software engineer does, or that it willone daytake over CEOs’ jobs, their excitement for the future is palpable. For the rest of us, it’s hard to feel confident in theiroffhand remarksabout how “some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs will be created”. A2025 Pew surveyfound that “64% of the public thinks AI will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”, which is probably why only 17% of Americans say AI will have a positive effect on the US over the same time period.Uncertain times like these call for scrutiny. Throughout 2026, the Guardian will publishReworked, a reporting series that centers the human stakes as AI disrupts our workplaces, in ways both thrilling and alarming. Like this essay, the stories in this series will focus on workers’ real-world power and plights as well as the realities and exaggerations of the hype surrounding AI’s transformative possibilities.So which version of the future of work awaits us? It is yet to be settled, which means there is still time to shift course.Dissolving divisionsBlue-collar workers, who have long grappled withalgorithmic surveillance and optimizationat work, are now worrying that technological advancements will only make their jobs more dehumanizing. “[For] lower-wage workers, there is concern about being replaced by robots. But on the other hand, there’s a lot of concern about beingturned intorobots,” Lisa Kresge, a senior researcher at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, told me.12-hour days, no weekends: the anxiety driving AI’s brutal work culture is a warning for all of usRead moreAnd white-collar workers are now wondering if their work will begin to resemble blue-collar labor – either because they will be similarly tracked and managed, or because they will need to switch to more manual work that’s resistant to being taken over by AI.It may seem that workers haven’t been this vulnerable in a long time. In some ways, that’s true. But this is also a pivotal moment, one in which something unexpected is happening: society’s collective anxiety over AI is catalyzing workers to push back.“It is creating an opportunity,” Sarita Gupta, the Ford Foundation’s vice-president of US programs and co-author of The Future We Need: Organizing for a Better Democracy in the Twenty-First Century, told me. “When you have a young Silicon Valley software engineerrealizethat their performance is tracked or undermined by the same logic as a working-class warehouse picker, class divisions dissolve, and larger working-class movements for dignity are possible. That is what we’re starting to see.”People across industries and income brackets are anxious and frustrated, quite like they were when the Covid pandemic placed punishing demands on frontline workers and erased the boundaries between work and life for everyone else. Those struggles prompted power shifts: at the same time that workers led unionization efforts at Amazon warehouses and Starbucks locations around the US, the Great Resignation saw a record number of employees quit their jobs, and the ones who remained in the workforce began negotiating for and gaining better pay and conditions.“It was not a pretty time for a lot of workers. And so part of the resurgence of labor organizing from that period of time was in response to a lot of fears,” Kresge said.She also sees the rise of AI as an opening for the labor movement to regain some of the power it has lost after decades of attacks from employers. “I’m hopeful about the opportunity for technology to lift up some of the issues that have been under way in our economy for decades … in terms of how workers are treated and how we are distributing the rewards of productivity,” she said.Perceptions of powerConditions for workers have been rough for a long while now. “Over time, unions have lost collective bargaining power, and a lot of that is due to the lack of laws that we need and enforcement of laws,” Gupta said. “For four decades, productivity soared while wages stayed flat, and unionization hit historic lows.” In 2025,only 9.9% of US workers were union members– the same percentage as 2024, but still the lowest numbers in almost 40 years.The bogus four-day workweek that AI supposedly ‘frees up’Read moreToday, the advent of AI is drawing the world’s attention to the extreme imbalance of power between employers and their employees – and people are getting worked up. Even if the outcomes are still undetermined, that’s a glimmer of possibility in bleak times.AI is still a nascent technology. Many of the predictions about what it will be capable of and how it will transform labor and the economy are just that – predictions. The question of worker power in the age of AI hasn’t been decided yet, even if billionaire CEOs with a vested interest in the unregulated dominance of AI keep implying that it has.“There is a concerted effort among many tech leaders to basically create mystification around AI as a tactic, to a large extent, to disempower workers, policymakers, and anyone who might be critical of the growing concentration of funding and resources in our society toward this goal,” Kresge told me.In other words, take what these billionaires say with a grain of salt. The rise of AI is already transforming society, the economy and our relationship to work, but a lot of these shifts are anticipatory, based on our belief in the potential of a technology that’s still being built.“We have to always remind ourselves that the direction of technology is a choice, right? We can use AI to build a surveillance economy that squeezes every drop of value out of a worker, or we can use it to build an era of shared prosperity,” Gupta said. “We know if technology were designed and deployed and governed by the people doing the work, AI wouldn’t be such a threat.”"

I mean the various opium fiends, international terrorists and child murderers who make up our colourful national tapestry (see the Coleridge Way, Drake’s Trail and the Richard III Trail). So perhaps a 30-mile weekend walk dedicated to the Mortimers, and their most notorious scion,Sir Roger, is an appropriate addition to the weave.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.After all, this is the man who allegedly slept with a reigning queen (Isabella), probably killed her husband (Edward II), and certainly becamede factotyrant of the realm for three turbulent years in the 1320s, feathering his own nest relentlessly during that time. They don’t make world leaders like that any longer, do they?View image in fullscreenA view towards Mortimer Forest.Photograph: Paul Weston/AlamyRoger’s stomping ground, however, was not where you might expect: he was a marcher lord on the Welsh border, and his family trail wends its way through tranquil countryside from Ludlow in Shropshire to the quiet Herefordshire border town of Kington, the perfect distance for a weekend hike. But can such a location, so peaceful and orderly today, live up to the outrageous standards of Sir Roger? TheMortimer Trailitself has existed for some years, but now a new guidebook and app have brought this magnificently horrid hero back into the limelight.I start then in Ludlow, a town now famous for its foodie traditions, but also a place that oozes history throughout its crooked lanes. Walking down Broad Street, I admire the bay window ofThe Angel, from which Horatio Nelson waved to the crowd in 1802, with his left hand, of course. Local legend has it that the hero of the Battle of the Nile leaned out the window and shouted, “Thank you for the oak,” to the adoring crowd below. Behind him stood Emma Hamilton, his mistress, and her husband, Sir William, the trailing third in a menage that would thrill the British public until Nelson died at Trafalgar in 1805. (The Angel restaurant is currently closed but will reopen soon.)double quotation markCan such a location, so peaceful and orderly today, live up to the outrageous standards of Sir Roger Mortimer?I get my lunch under the walls of the castle atCSONS, one of Ludlow’s celebrated cafes. There is a lot of good food in this town, plus an excellent farmer’s market and at least three “parlour pubs” – front room pubs marked only by a lamp outside and often serving only one type of beer from a cask.Thecastle in Ludlowis really the start of the trail, being the seat of English borderland power in medieval times and worth a detour. Look out for thesolar wing, built for Queen Isabella who stayed here in 1328. Sir Roger’s wife, Joan, was also in attendance, apparently, but slept in a different wing. History has not recorded where Sir Roger spent the night; no doubt Netflix will, when they get hold of the story.View image in fullscreenSalwey Lodge lodge is atmospheric and lined with ancient ancestral oil portraitsThe trail sets off across Dinham Bridge, climbing up into Mortimer Forest with great views back to the castle. Watch out for the deer and goshawks that are resident in this ancient woodland. My first night is inSalwey Lodgewhose farming owners, Arabella and Hugo, not only organise walks along the trail, but have devised their own handy guiding app. They also shuttle visitors around, so no car is needed (Ludlow is on the main railway line between Shrewsbury and Hereford).The lodge proves to be the perfect place to get into the ambience of a regicide like Sir Roger. An ancestor of the Salweys was sent to the Tower for anti-monarchial tendencies and was implicated in theFarnley Wood Plotof 1663. Richard’s Castle, close to the lodge, is where he is thought to have lived, but little remains, although there is a lovely decommissioned 12th-century church worth visiting. The lodge is atmospheric, lined with the type of ancient ancestral oil portraits that most families, including my own, inadvertently forgot to commission. The superlative food comes from the house’s vegetable garden, the farm and local suppliers.double quotation markI pass only a handful of people, but see plenty of reminders that this area was once a highly militarised and dangerous borderlandDay two of the walk takes me up through more woodland to fabulous views of the Shropshire countryside, notably from an iron age hill fort atCroft Ambrey, abandoned after six centuries of occupation at around the time of Emperor Claudius’s invasion in AD 43.I pass only a handful of people on the path during the entire weekend, but see plenty of reminders that this area was once a highly militarised and dangerous borderland. All through the middle ages, the Welsh kept up a sturdy resistance to the Norman conquerors, who responded with unwavering brutality. Sir Roger, of course, was right there in thick of it until the newly crowned Edward III had the insufferable upstart hanged at Tyburn. (The ruins of Roger’s main residence,Wigmore Castle, can be seen from Croft Ambrey, but rather inexplicably the trail does not go there. The closest diversion would add five miles.)View image in fullscreenThe Riverside Inn at Aymestrey.Photograph: Martin Birchall/AlamyThe path rolls along pleasantly, unveiling magnificent panoramas of the Welsh mountains, before dropping down to the River Lugg and an overnight stop at theRiverside Inn. The food here is excellent, serving the kind of breakfast that, without some self-restraint, could nail you to an early siesta rather than set up a big day of hiking.This starts with a long ramble by the river, then up into quiet woodlands and high heaths, with plenty of historical military madness. The serene church at Byton was sacked several times by angry Welsh nobles, including the last Welsh king, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and later Owain Glyndŵr. The Mortimers, of course, were always in the mix. Llywelyn was killed in 1282 by the forces of Edmund Mortimer, Roger’s father, and then another Edmund, Roger’s great-grandson, cocked a snook at Henry IV by marrying Glyndŵr’s daughter, Catrin, in 1402.It is possible to shorten this third day at a 12-mile limit, finishing at the church in Titley, but for me it’s much better to press on, rising up towards the Welsh border and a meeting with the ultimate symbol of militarisation and tribal anxiety, Offa’s Dyke. The path curls up across a featureless mountain pasture, and there it is – the formidable security wall of its day, designed to keep two irredeemably hostile peoples apart, now a little ripple in the earth which sheep use to see if there’s more grass in the next field. Sit down and ruminate on human folly before striding into Kington where there’s a decent cafe, the Border Bean, and wait for Arabella to collect you.The trip was supported byVisit Shropshire.

Lion heads made out of papier-mache are dotted around the lot and pairs of kids are jumping on to poles, tables or each other’s shoulders – all while connected at the hip.It’s a sticky night in Sydney’s west, but the 33C heat doesn’t faze these lion dancers, who are gearing up for their busiest period: lunar new year. The festivities continue well past the day itself, with more than 100 performances across three weeks. On the eve of lunar new year, the studio will start their performance at the temple in Bonnyrigg at 9pm and finish well past midnight.Lunar new year is not only a big deal for the studio but for the city – Sydney has one of the largest lunar new year celebrations in the southern hemisphere. It is also the year of the fire horse, a rare pairing that happens once every 60 years.“Rain, hail or shine, we still train,” says Long Huynh, who has been a lion dancer with the Qing Fong Dragon and Lion dance team for six years.View image in fullscreenAbove:Team instructor Jenny Cao and Long Huynh outside the hallBelow:Costumes wait to be put on for dance rehearsalsView image in fullscreenThe newer cohort of students are afforded some relief from the heat, training inside a small air-conditioned hall. Kelvin Tran, a co-founder of Qing Fong and team leader, yells directions over the thumping drum as the younger dancers move their bodies sharply to the rhythm.Tran’s teaching approach? “I tell my kids to be the lion and to feel the lion through themselves.” This is coupled with intensive training. At Qing Fong, they train at least twice a week for three hours at a time. These sessions begin with conditioning: running laps around the car park, dynamic stretching and circuit exercises.2:41So you think you can lion dance? – videoAfter their warmup, the students split off into groups to practise their routines. Each group comprises six people: four playing drums and cymbals and a pair of lion dancers, in full costume, where one person controls the head and the second controls the tail.View image in fullscreenAbove:The Chinese lion dancers spread out during their acrobatic routineBelow:The troupe’s dressing room filled with costumesView image in fullscreenAlthough the head gets more time in the spotlight, the tail feels the love too. The tails of the group tell me they get “lots of pats on the bum” from audience members. Team instructor Adelene Pham believes “people just see the lion, they don’t see the two people underneath”.There are a lot of moving parts: dancers need to move the head of the lion and their feet correspondingly, while creating the lion’s facial expressions by opening and closing its jaw and raising its ears using strings inside the head. This is all done in time to the music.The tail follows the head’s lead, so “if a head has a happy interaction with a crowd member, we tails wag our tails”, Huynh says. Once the costume comes on, “you can’t see what’s around you”. Inside the lion costume, the head and tail have poor vision. The only gap in the lion’s head is the mouth, and the tail is almost always in a squat with their chest facing the floor – unless they’re about to do a shoulder lift. Each dancer needs to know how their other half will move and it is this relationship between partners which brings lions to life.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenDancers take a break from the energetic dancing in hot costumesTran agrees: “You have to trust each other and you have to rely on each other in order for a performance to actually work out well.”Perhaps this is why most students in the troupe say their favourite part about dancing is the “family” they have found. Qing Fong has the demographics to match – the youngest member is 12 and the oldest is 40. “You watch each other grow up,” Tran says.Music is integral to lion dancing too – students are taught to play phrases which correspond to specific movements. According to one student, the music and lion “are synergised”. Nicky Phan, who has been a lion dancer for seven years, says the music represents the “heartbeat of the lion”.Culturally significant to Chinese communities around the world, lion dance performances are thought to ward off evil spirits, bringing prosperity and good luck for the coming year. Tran says that lion dancing has brought many of his students closer to their heritage.View image in fullscreenDance team instructor Adelene Pham and Dylan Kha practise their dance routine which culminates in Adelene chopping a watermelon in half with her bare handsView image in fullscreenKelvin Tran, co-founder and team leader of Qing Fong Dragon and Lion Dance teamBefore Nicky Phan became a lion dancer she describes her relationship to her Vietnamese-Chinese ethnicity as “broken”. But learning the history and significance of lion dancing made her appreciate her family’s history. “Being a lion … brings back something that you feel like you’ve lost for a very long time.”Though lunar new year is the peak season for the troupe, training continues well after all the red packets have been distributed. The moon festival in September is another busy month, but they also have one or two performances every week for weddings or business openings.A lot can go wrong in a performance, Tran says. A dancer may miss a move or drop their partner. But after those 12-hour days during lunar new year, the only constant is eating dinner together. “Whether it’s a small performance or a big performance, we always make sure we feed each other,” Pham says.View image in fullscreenYoung dancers watch final dance rehearsals outside the templeTheir training session ends with all 30 dancers squeezed into the hall. A box of doughnuts makes its way around the room and there is a frenetic, optimistic energy. For some, this was their first full dress rehearsal before the big lunar new year showcase.“It has just become a really big part of my life, and a very good part of my life,” Pham says.Explore more on these topicsLunar new yearAustralian lifestyleSydneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With roots in ancient lunar calendar traditions, the system places certain personality traits under various birth years.Alongside the animals, Chinese astrology incorporates the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These elements rotate with the zodiac animals, creating a 60-year cycle. Each element is believed to influence one’s traits and destiny.“The metaphysical theory is that everything on this Earth, including humans, are made up of these five elements and then within these elements, there are yin and yang versions,” the holistic Chinese astrologer Lydia Lee says.How and when does the fire horse occur?Once every 60 years, the fire horse is created by pairing the horse with the fire element.The Chinese zodiac system combines 12 animal signs with the 10 heavenly stems, or 10 symbols that represent the five elements, each in yin and yang forms.As the animal signs and elements rotate together year by year, every zodiac year is assigned an animal and element. A fire horse year is often described as being fast-moving and high-energy. The last fire horse was in 1966, when China’s Cultural Revolution began, a time of political and social upheaval.What are the personality traits of the fire horse?People born in horse years are forthright, strong in reasoning and alert, says Ming Shao, a Melbourne-based feng shui expert. “They are also eloquent … and known for being impatient, wilful [and] heroic individuals,” he says. Adding fire “intensifies” the horse’s characteristics including dynamism, energy, dedication and leadership, according to Shao.View image in fullscreenIt is said that the fire horse year can bring extreme success but can also be an extremely challenging period.Photograph: Fred Lee/Getty ImagesWhat is predicted for the fire horse year?Experts say the fire horse year is widely expected to bring intense, fast-paced change on a personal and global level.Xiaohuan Zhao, a professor in Chinese studies at the University of Sydney, says “rather than predicting disaster, traditional readings frame the fire horse year as a period where heightened energy needs to be managed wisely”.“Slowing down before making major decisions, staying grounded, and cultivating emotional steadiness are … key ways to navigate the year’s momentum”, he adds.Grace Niu, a Sydney-based feng shui consultant, also suggests caution, saying that the fire horse year amplifies every natural trait to an intense degree, resulting in “unstoppable drive [and] immense passion … but like a wildfire, that energy must be directed or it can burn through everything – including themselves”.Pan Wang, an associate professor of Chinese studies at the University of New South Wales, says that based on historical patterns, the fire horse year is predicted to be a challenging period marked by upheaval. “The fire element can manifest as instability and violence, as well as heated economic development and rapid, sometimes reckless, growth.”Could any industries, zodiac signs or age groups be especially affected?According to Zhao, industries “connected with movement, heat or rapid change such as technology, finance, transportation, energy and entertainment may feel the fire horse year’s fast and intense pace more strongly”.In Chinese astrology, the fire horse and those with rat signs are considered a challenging match: the horse’s impulsive, high-energy nature clashes with the rat’s cautious and strategic approach. Other zodiac signs expected to be most affected by the fire horse include the rabbit and the ox.But not all clashes are bad. For Lee, clashes in energy can bring vital change. “When we experience our lives being stagnant … we actually welcome clashes because it can be transformed into breakthroughs,” she says.Niu says people entering new life chapters, such as those turning 30, 42, or 60 years old, may find the energy creating a profound rite of passage.What's the best way to navigate the year?The key is to stay grounded. Balancing the fire with water-element practices such as slowing down, meditating and hydrating can help, the Sydney-based feng shui expert Mina Zheng says.Everybody will experience too much fire, she says, adding: “We need to drink a lot more water, more than before, and we also need to cherish water.”Zheng highlights the balancing power of the earth element to help offset fire. She recommends eating more earthy root vegetables like potatoes and carrots.Thierry Chow, a Hong Kong-based feng shui expert,suggests wearing certain colours. She says those born in the summer months should “wear more cool tones to help balance out the heavy fire … such as silver, gold, blue and white”.Is the fire horse something to fear?Definitely do not fear, Pan says. “I think the fire horse is a self-paradoxical year: it can bring extreme success, such as rapid career progression, but it can also be extremely challenging if one burns out or succumbs to anxiety, which may lead to failure. That said, if we harness the fire horse well, there’s nothing to fear. Embrace the challenge and find a balance!”Explore more on these topicsLunar new yearChinaAsia PacificexplainersShareReuse this content"

In windows, on walls, and staked on garden posts, Denton is awash with turquoise blue as the26 February byelectionlooms.Near the town centre, Ian Singleton and his wife, Irene, have one of Reform’s turquoise banners standing proudly in their front yard. Ian was born in Gorton, inManchester, but for the best part of the last three decades, the couple have lived on the other side of the constituency, in Denton.Since then, Ian, 68, who served in the army and used to work in the building trade, has seen the high street decline.“You’ve [only] got two pubs,” he said, adding that social spaces have been replaced with “more hairdressers, nail shops, takeaways and barbers”.Labour calls on Reform’s Matt Goodwin to reject aides’ ‘racist content’Read more“I think the government, between these and some of the Tories, they’ve killed the little businesses,” Ian said. “They’ve killed the pubs.”“Not only that, everything’s just gone so expensive as well, hasn’t it?” Irene, a 66-year-old former textile worker, added.The couple have two children, in their late 30s and early 40s, who are renting houses. “They find it virtually impossible to buy one,” Ian said.View image in fullscreenThe Gorton half of the constituency has seen rapid change in recent years – median house prices in the Levenshulme area rose at twice Manchester’s overall rate between 2013 and 2023.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAHe also thinksEnglandis missing a strong sense of identity, and national pride. “You look at the Welsh, you know when they’re Welsh,” he said. “Them flags and them dragons are flying high.”The Singletons’ disenchantment is symbolic of a community that is only six-and-a-half miles from Manchester city centre, but sometimes feels much further. Greater Manchester’s Metrolink system has bypassed Denton, the congested routes out of the town make buses slow, and the railway station was named Britain’s least-used for 2023-24, with only one return train service a week.Council tax rates have gone up, but bin collections have been cut, roads are scarred with potholes and streets near the centre are scattered with fly-tipped rubbish. It has all contributed to a sense of malaise, of Denton being left behind. “We are the forgotten little town,” one resident wrote on Facebook, noting that while seasonal decorations go up elsewhere, Denton misses out on lights at Christmas or poppies in November. “Nothing,” he wrote. “The little lost town. Forgotten. It’s just the way I feel. There are lots of good people in Denton who feel the same.”The Gorton half of the constituency has seen rapid change in recent years – median house prices in the Levenshulme area rose at twice Manchester’s overall rate between 2013 and 2023. With almost twice as many votes as Denton, it is playing host to a straight fight betweenLabourand the Greens, who each argue they are best placed to beat Nigel Farage’s party.But that division leaves an opportunity for Reform’s candidate, Matt Goodwin, if he can pile up votes on the Denton side. He has positioned himself as the person to come to residents’ aid as “a very loud champion who will draw attention to those issues” he said last week.“I used to be a staunch Labour supporter,” Ian said. “With Labour, it was the party of the working people, and it just turned its back.”At the same time, though, he is uncomfortable with some of the sentiment behind the St George’s flags that have been strung from buildings and lamp-posts since last year. “I think sometimes people who use it are racists, and are anti-foreign people,” he said.Another Denton resident, who did not want to be named, said it was the economy that had pushed him to back Reform, similarly nailing his colours to the mast with a poster in his garden.But he said a relative had warned him to“put it at the back, in the bush, because if people see it they’re going to think you’re a bigot or a racist”.“To bevery honest with you, hand on heart, there’s a lot of Reform’s policies that I’m not happy with,” he said. “For example environmental policies, and I don’t want to see people that are legally contributing to society being sent back.”“I’ve had to sacrifice some of my beliefs, I think, to support Reform,” he added.View image in fullscreenA woman walks through a Manchester shopping area. The decline of the high street is an issue that is important to many voters.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesThe Green candidate, Hannah Spencer, rejects the idea that only Reform can persuade Denton’s voters.“I don’t think any party has got any area in the bag,” she said. “And it was a mistake I think Reform made by assuming a white working-class community was just going to vote for them.”By the same token, there are pockets of support for Reform in Manchester, too. Flags that have started appearing since September have in some parts led to tensions, with hostile reactions in local Facebook and WhatsApp groups. “These streets belong to everyone who lives on them,” one resident wrote on WhatsApp, saying “flags that make people feel unsafe” have “no place” in Levenshulme.‘A pollster’s nightmare’: stakes are high in three-way fight for Gorton and DentonRead moreBut the rapid gentrification has, in some quarters, pushed people towards Goodwin’s party. “Reform all the way,” one resident wrote in a local Facebook group. “Leve [Levenshulme] was built with proper people, not you weirdo Chorlton [a leafy, high-income Manchester suburb] wannabes.”In the Levenshulme, one of those “normal, bog-standard” pubs that once filled the high street, one drinker said: “I’m voting for Farage, because we need a change, don’t we?”Another punter was also voting Reform and said “a lot of people I speak to are voting the same”.“All you see round here is all these Green [posters], I don’t know where they’re coming from, they seem to be in every garden,” he added. “Liberal lefties, they can all piss off back to Chorlton.”However, Robert Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said that finding their supporters in the area may prove tricky for Reform.View image in fullscreenReform candidate Matthew Goodwin at hustings in St Peter’s Church, Levenshulme, for the Denton and Gorton byelection.Photograph: Mark Waugh/The Guardian“I think the challenge for Reform is logistical and organisational,” he said. “How do you find those voices and engage them?“I mean, some of them may show up anyway,” he added. “These are areas where if you go knocking on doors you might find one receptive voter for every five or six hostile voters, and that’s potentially quite a bruising experience if you’re a canvasser.”In the end, Ford said, Reform’s path to victory could “come through the middle on a divided vote” – if support for Labour and the Greens splits evenly, “then Reform don’t need to win overall”.But he added: “Anyone who tells you what’s going to happen in the wee small hours of Friday morning two weeks from now is either a fool or a fanatic. There really is no way of knowing.”Whatever the overall picture, Ian Singleton is clear on his hopes: he views Goodwin as the most likely path to political change – as a “lad from around this area” who, along with his party colleague Lee Anderson could be “the voice of the working person”.“Let’s put it this way; I don’t think they can do any worse, I really don’t.”Explore more on these topicsGreater ManchesterManchesterReform UKLabourGreen partyLocal electionsLocal politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a workaround, several governments, including Italy and Greece, are sending observers.What is clear is that many of the founding member countries are run as military regimes or dictatorships, while others joined to appease Trump. Here is a list of several confirmed attenders, and where their countries are placed inan annual rankingon political rights and civil liberties, compiled by the democracy watchdogFreedom House.Middle EastEgyptian prime minister Mostafa MadboulyFreedom in the World Index score: (18/100) ‘Not Free’View image in fullscreenMostafa Madbouly.Photograph: Michele Spatari/AFP/Getty ImagesThelatest Freedom House reportpresents a negative image of Egypt’s rights situation, reporting an environment of tightly restricted civil liberties and press freedoms. “Security forces engage in human rights abuses with impunity,” it says.President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has, it reports, run Egypt “in an increasingly authoritarian manner” since taking power in a 2013 coup. “Meaningful political opposition is virtually nonexistent, as expressions of dissent can draw criminal prosecution and imprisonment,” it adds.Turkish foreign minister Hakan FidanFreedom in the World Index score: (33/100) ‘Not Free’View image in fullscreenHakan Fidan.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWhen announcing the creation of the board in January, Trump also unveiled plans to establish a Gaza Executive Board operating under the body, which would include the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan.He reports to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has,according to Freedom House, consolidated power “through constitutional changes and the imprisonment of political opponents, independent journalists, and members of civil society”.Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa’arFreedom in the World Index score: Israel (73/100) ‘Free’, West Bank (22/100) ‘Not Free’, Gaza (2/100) ‘Not Free’View image in fullscreenGideon Sa’ar.Photograph: Lev Radin/ShutterstockGideon Sa’ar will represent Israel on behalf of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.Freedom House divides Israel and the Palestinian territories it occupies into separate categories (other rights groupsaccuse Israel of running an apartheid system).While Israelis enjoy a “parliamentary democracy with a multiparty system and independent institutions”, the Freedom House report presents a dire situation for Palestinians under Israeli occupation. In Gaza,the index saysthe Israeli military has “consistently pursued a strategy” that resulted in “mass displacement and loss of life”. In the West Bank,it says, the Israeli occupation entails “restrictions on Palestinians’ political rights and civil liberties, and expanding Jewish settlements”.AsiaCambodian prime minister Hun ManetFreedom in the World Index score: (23/100) ‘Not Free’View image in fullscreenHun Manet.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersCambodia’s political system has been dominated by the Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) and its leader, Hun Sen, for more than three decades, Freedom Housesays. While Hun Sen stepped down in 2023, he did so only after facilitating “an undemocratic transfer of power to his son, Hun Manet”.The CPP-led government uses intimidation, politically motivated prosecutions and violence to maintain pressure on the opposition, independent media, and civil society, Freedom House says.Indonesian president Prabowo SubiantoFreedom in the World Index score: (56/100) ‘Partly Free’View image in fullscreenPrabowo Subianto.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersIndonesia has been a key member of the Board of Peace, and has offered up to 8,000 troops for deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian mission.The Freedom in the World indexsaidIndonesia had made “impressive democratic gains since the fall of an authoritarian regime in 1998” but added that significant challenges persisted, “including systemic corruption, discrimination and violence against minority groups … and the politicised use of defamation and blasphemy laws”.Kazakh president Kassym-Jomart TokayevFreedom in the World Index score: (23/100) ‘Not Free’View image in fullscreenKassym-Jomart Tokayev.Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/AFP/Getty ImagesFreedom House offersa blunt assessmentof the central Asian nation. “In Kazakhstan, parliamentary and presidential elections are neither free nor fair,” it says. “The dominant media outlets are either in state hands or owned by government-friendly businessmen. Freedoms of speech and assembly remain restricted and punished, and corruption is endemic.”Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who was handpicked for president by the former dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev, will travel to Washington for the Board of Peace meeting, and will also use the trip to “meet with executives of leading American companies”, his officesaid.Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz SharifFreedom in the World Index score: (32/100) ‘Partly Free’View image in fullscreenShehbaz Sharif.Photograph: Pakistan’s Prime Minister Office/AFP/Getty ImagesPakistani foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi told journalists in Islamabad that the country had joined the Board of Peace “in good faith”.Pakistan holds regular elections under a competitive multiparty system,Freedom House says. “However, the military exerts enormous influence over government formation and policies, intimidates the media, and enjoys impunity for indiscriminate or extralegal use of force.”Uzbek president Shavkat MirziyoyevFreedom in the World Index score: (12/100) ‘Not Free’View image in fullscreenShavkat Mirziyoyev.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesDespite some reforms under Shavkat Mirziyoyev,Freedom House says, “Uzbekistan remains an authoritarian state with few signs of democratisation.

Last year, the print edition of the Economist, which featured Tô Lâm on its cover, wasbanned in the country, part of a long series of acts of media censorship by authorities.“Freedom of expression, religious freedom, and civil society activism are tightly restricted,” Freedom Housesays. “The authorities have increasingly cracked down on citizens’ use of social media and the internet to voice dissent and share uncensored information.”EuropeAlbanian prime minister Edi RamaFreedom in the World Index score: (68/100) ‘Partly Free’View image in fullscreenEdi Rama.Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/APAlbania, which is led by the socialist artist-politician Edi Rama, was a founding member of the Board of Peace. Rama said this week it would not become a permanent member, which comes with a $1bn price tag.The European country is considered “partly free” by Freedom House, whichsaysAlbania has a record of competitive elections. “Corruption and bribery remain major problems, though the government is working to address corruption in the judiciary.”Hungarian prime minister Viktor OrbánFreedom in the World Index score: (65/100) ‘Partly Free’View image in fullscreenViktor Orbán.Photograph: Zoltán Fischer/Hungarian PM Press Office/EPAThe right-wing nationalist Viktor Orbán is one of Trump’s closest allies in the EU, and is seen as a hero to many Maga supporters for his hostility to migration. He has made several visits to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.Freedom Houseaccusesthe Orbán government of pushing through “anti-migrant and anti-LGBT+ policies, as well as laws that hamper the operations of opposition groups, journalists, universities, and nongovernmental organisations”.Kosovan president Vjosa OsmaniFreedom in the World Index score: (60/100) ‘Partly Free’View image in fullscreenVjosa Osmani.Photograph: Fermin Rodriguez/APPresident Vjosa Osmani​ is the only woman whowas a founding memberof Trump’s Board of Peace.​Freedom Housesaysthe small country of 1.5 million people in south-east Europe​ is partly free, holding what it said were “credible and relatively well-administered elections​”. ​“Many public institutions are undermined by entrenched corruption, though there are signs that a new generation of politicians are moving to confront corrupt practices through judicial and administrative reforms​,” it adds.South AmericaArgentine president Javier MileiFreedom in the World Index score: (85/100) ‘Free’View image in fullscreenJavier Milei.Photograph: Francisco Loureiro/ReutersArgentina receives a high score in the index, withFreedom House celebratingits “vibrant representative democracy with competitive elections, lively media and civil society sectors, and unfettered public debate”.However, the country is transforming under the 55-year-old former TV celebrity and liberatian president, Javier Milei, who along with other government officials has accused universities of “indoctrinating students with leftwing ideology”, according to Freedom House.

Local rights defenders reported that another strike on a market in nearby North Kordofan left 28 people dead. Blame for the West Kordofan attack has been directed at the Sudanese army; while the RSF has been accused of carrying out the strike in North Kordofan.Since April 2023, the RSF has been waging war against the army aftera falling outbetween its commander, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, and the army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, former allies who came to power after the 2019 Sudanese revolution ousted longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir.The RSF has been backed by the United Arab Emirates, a position the Gulf state denies despiteevidence compiledby the UN, independent experts and reporters.The group grew out of the Janjaweed militias, notorious for atrocities committed in the early 2000s in a ruthless campaign in Darfur that killed 300,000 people and drove 2.7 million from their homes.The war, the latest crisis in Sudan’s history of violence, has forced 11 million people to flee their homes and killed tens of thousands, triggering what the UN calls one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.View image in fullscreenSudanese refugee Jeda Abdullah is placed on a drip by a doctor at the Sudanese-run Hope and Haven for Refugees Association clinic in Adre, Chad.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThe fact-finding report said that after the seizure of El Fasher, the RSF inflicted “three days of absolute horror” and that thousands of people, particularly from the Zaghawa ethnic group, werekilled, raped or disappeared.Othman said: “The scale, coordination and public endorsement of the operation by senior RSF leadership demonstrate that the crimes committed in and around El Fasher were not random excesses of war. They formed part of a planned and organised operation that bears the defining characteristics of genocide.”View image in fullscreenGoods being transported between a Sudanese border town and Adre in Chad.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesInvestigators said RSF militiamen had acted with impunity and “with genocidal intent” and that as conflict’s focus shifts from Darfur to Kordofan, outside countries must act decisively to hold perpetrators to account “and bring an end to this senseless violence”.The mission interviewed 320 witnesses and victims from El Fasher and the surrounding areas, including in investigative visits toChadand South Sudan. It authenticated, verified and corroborated 25 videos.A Sudanese massacre foretold: the grim familiarity of the RSF’s rampage through El FasherRead moreThe report documents widespread sexual violence against girls and women aged seven to 70, including those who were pregnant. Survivors said they were attacked in front of family members, with the assaults often involving severe physical abuse.In one incident, a 12-year-old girl was raped by three RSF fighters as her mother watched, moments after her father was killed while trying to shield her. The girl later died from her injuries.According to the findings, such assaults frequently occurred at the same locations where mass killings had taken place, including El Saudi hospital and El Fasher University. Witnesses said RSF fighters also carried out public gang rapes of at least 19 women in rooms strewn with corpses, among them the bodies of the victims’ husbands.On Thursday the US announced that it was placing sanctions on three RSF commanders over their roles in the siege and capture of El Fasher. The US Treasury said the RSF had carried out “ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence” in the operation.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaChadUnited NationsUnited Arab EmiratesnewsShareReuse this content"

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said in November that more than 1,400 people from 36 African countries were fighting for Russia in Ukraine. Many are being held by Ukraine as prisoners of war.According to the intelligence report, Ichung’wah said, employment agencies were targeting former military personnel and police officers and civilians from their mid-20s to 50 years old “who are desperate for job opportunities abroad”.‘I didn’t know how to shoot’: how African men have been tricked into fighting for RussiaRead moreThe employment agencies were enticing Kenyans by promising them monthly salaries of about 350,000 shillings (£2,000), bonuses of between 900,000 shillings and 1.2m shillings and eventual Russian citizenship, the report said.It also accused the employment agencies of colluding with staff from several government agencies – the Directorate of Immigration Services, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and its Anti-Narcotics Unit, and the National Employment Authority – to prevent interception at Nairobi’s international airport, Ichung’wah said.It further claimed that the agencies worked with staff at the Russian embassy in Kenya and the Kenyan embassy in Moscow to get the recruits Russian visitor visas, he said.On Thursday, Russia’s embassy in Kenya denied it had been involved in recruiting Kenyans to fight in Ukraine, describing the accusation as part of “a dangerous and misleading propaganda campaign”.“The embassy refutes such allegations in the strongest possible terms,” it saidin a statement on X. “The government authorities of Russia have never engaged in illegal recruitment of Kenyan citizens in the armed forces of the Russian Federation.”The report noted that because of increased interception of recruits at the airport, they were now travelling through Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and SouthAfrica, Ichung’wah said.As of February, 39 Kenyans had been hospitalised, 30 had been repatriated, 28 were missing in action, 35 were in military camps or bases, 89 were on the frontline, one had been detained and one had completed their contract, according to the report.Kenya’s foreign minister, Musalia Mudavadi, is expected to visit Russia next month to discuss the “unacceptable and clandestine” recruitment of Kenyan nationals.On Wednesday, four South Africans returned to South Africa from Russia. They were part of a group of 17 South African and two Botswanan men who wereallegedly tricked into fighting for Russiaby Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, a daughter of the former South African president Jacob Zuma.South Africa’s foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, told the national broadcaster SABC: “It was a challenging process. It remains a challenging one for the ones who are still in the frontline, because they are alleged to have been lured by a private security contractor to the Russian government. So that really complicates the situation because they were not, according to the Russian government, recruited directly to the Russian army.”Explore more on these topicsKenyaUkraineRussiaAfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The surprise election, in which Balcázar beat the favourite, María del Carmen Alva, a conservative, came after lawmakersvoted to remove José Jerías president on Tuesday after just four months in office, due to a scandal oversecretive meetings with Chinese businessmen.Balcázar, from the leftist Peru Libre party, was sworn in as Peru’s head of congress on Wednesday after a four-hour session in which none of the four candidates managed to get a simple majority and lawmakers voted to elect Balcázar over Alva in a second round of voting.Balcázar’s election prompted finger pointing and recriminations among rightwing parties, as well as praise from sectors of the Peruvian political left.Balcázar’s previous remarks expressing approval of sexual relations between girls aged 14 and male teachers have dominated Peruvian news coverage after his unexpected election.In 2023, the former regional high court judge sparked controversy as the only lawmaker to criticise and vote against a measure to ban child marriage. He said the ban should be limited to those under 14 only.“From the age of 14 onwards, there should be no impediment; everyone has sexual relations, [male] teachers with pupils, female teachers with pupils, and between pupils too. That’s fine,” he told journalists after the vote in congress. He later said his remarks had been taken out of context.As the chair of the congressional education committee, he said it was common for teachers to have sex with their students, even saying the relations could be “beneficial” for the minor.In astatement at the time, Peru’s women’s ministry strongly criticised his remarks as justifying “sexual violence against school-age children and adolescents, a painful and despicable situation that profoundly affects their overall wellbeing and fundamental rights”.When questioned about those remarks in an interview for a national radio broadcaster on Thursday, Balcázar replied: “I will not change my mind, I am firm in my convictions.”In addition, Balcázar has been investigated for allegedly embezzling funds when he was head of the bar association in his native region of Lambayeque. He was expelled from the association in 2022 after a disciplinary hearing.Balcázar has gone on the record as saying he would release the jailed former leftist leader Pedro Castillo, who was sentenced by Peru’s supreme court in November to 11 years, five months and 15 days in prison fortrying to disband congressand rule by decree in December 2022.Balcázar is expected to preside over the country until 28 July, when a new president takes office. Peruvians will head to the polls on 12 April and a run-off vote is expected in June.Amid fears that Balcázar could exceed his role in leading the country to the elections, pro-democracy, business and rights organisations called for restraint.Álvaro Henzler, of the pro-democracy nonprofit group Transparencia Perú, said: “Out of respect for the stability of the country and in view of an exhausted citizenry, the new president’s mandate must be strictly limited to ensuring a transparent and orderly democratic transition and preventing a worsening of the institutional crisis we are currently experiencing.”Explore more on these topicsPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It won 2,269 more votes than the runner-up, the mahoenui giant wētā, one of the world’s largest insects.Other contenders included the wonderfully spiky hellraiser mite, the country’s heaviest spider – the black tunnelweb – and a giant earthworm that glows in the dark.TheArctesthes avatarmoth is from the Geometridae family and is endemic to New Zealand. It is a day-flying moth with brindled brown and marigold wings and lives only in the Denniston Plateau and nearby Mount Rochfort, on the South Island’s west coast.View image in fullscreenThe hellraiser mite (Neotrichozetes spinulosa).Photograph: Frank AshwoodThe moth was discovered in 2012 by the entomologist Brian Patrick during a “bioblitz” – an intense scientific survey to identify species within a specific area – run by the conservation group Forest & Bird. The organisation then ran a competition to name the moth, with the winner – Avatar – picked to highlight the moth’s plight.In the fictional world of James Cameron’s Avatar films, a unique ecosystem faces destruction from a mining company. In New Zealand, the ecologically significant Denniston Plateau issubject to a mining expansion proposalthat, if approved, would lead to a significant area being dug up for a large open-cast coalmine. The proposal is making its way through a new regulatory regime that could result indivisive miningand infrastructure projects beingfast-tracked for approval.“It is a species named Avatar – which was created to warn us about mining – now facing real-world extinction through fast-track approvals on public conservation land,” said Nicola Toki, who is Forest & Bird’s chief executive and backed the moth to win the country’s annual bug of the year competition.View image in fullscreenForest & Bird say the Avatar moth is facing real-world extinction through fast-track approvals on public conservation land.Photograph: Brian PatrickAlongside Forest & Bird, which has hundreds of thousands of online followers, groups and individuals took to social media to discuss the moth and highlight its precarious existence.“This is a special type of creature, no less important than akākāpōor panda, and we can’t just afford to write it off,” Toki said. “I think there is a point where New Zealanders feel very uncomfortable about planned extinctions.”The mining company Bathurst Resources, which is behind the proposal to mine the Denniston Plateau, says it would limit its impact on the landscapes and ecosystems, and would look to relocate species or “offset” biodiversity impacts. The resources minister, Shane Jones, haspreviously told the Guardianthat opening up New Zealand to more mining projects was necessary to boost the economy and boost employment, even if it resulted in environmental trade-offs.View image in fullscreenThe blue damselfly (Austrolestes colensonis) was also on the shortlist.Photograph: Frank AshwoodThe Entomological Society of New Zealand launched thebug of the yearcompetition in 2023, inspired by Forest & Bird’s wildly popularbird of the year competition.Toki said it was “delightful” other groups wanted to amplify New Zealand’s species.The popularity of the bug award is growing, with this year’s competition generating the highest number of votes so far. Each contender has “a champion” – volunteers including enthusiasts, museums or environmental groups, who promote their favoured bug.

The ISF is part of the newly created Board of Peace which is meant to govern Gaza. TheBoard of Peaceis chaired byDonald Trumpand led in part by his son-in-law Jared Kushner.The plans reviewed by the Guardian call for the phased construction of a military outpost that will eventually have a footprint of 1,400 metres by 1,100 metres, ringed by 26 trailer-mounted armored watch towers, a small arms range, bunkers, and a warehouse for military equipment for operations. The entire base will be encircled with barbed wire.The fortification is planned for an arid stretch of flatlands in southernGazastrewn with saltbush and white broom shrubs, and littered with twisted metal from years of Israeli bombardment. The Guardian has reviewed video of the area. A source close to the planning tells the Guardian that a small group of bidders – international construction companies with experience in war zones – have already been shown the area in a site visit.The Indonesian government hasreportedlyoffered to send up to 8,000 troops.Indonesia’s presidentwas one of four south-east Asian leaders scheduled to attend an inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington DC on Thursday.The UN security council authorized the Board of Peace to establish atemporary International Stabilization Force in Gaza. The ISF, according to the UN, will be tasked with securing Gaza’s border and maintaining peace within the area. It is also supposed to protect civilians, and train and support “vetted Palestinian police forces”.It is unclear what the ISF’s rules of engagement would be if there is combat, renewed bombing byIsrael, or attacks by Hamas. Nor is it clear what role the ISF is meant to play in disarming Hamas, an Israeli condition to proceed with Gaza’s reconstruction.While more than 20 countries have signed up as members of the Board of Peace, much of the worldhas stayed away. Although it was set up with the UN’s approval, the organization’s charter appears to grant Trump permanent leadership and control.Major European allies decline to join first meeting of Trump’s Board of PeaceRead more“The Board of Peace is a kind of legal fiction, nominally with its own international legal personality separate from both the UN and the United States, but in reality it’s just an empty shell for the United States to use as it sees fit,” said Adil Haque, a professor of law at Rutgers University.Expertssaythe funding and governance structures are murky, and several contractors have told the Guardian that conversations with US officials are often conducted on Signal rather than over government email.The military base contracting document was issued by the Board of Peace, according to a person familiar with the process, and prepared with the help of US contracting officials.The plans say there is to be a network of bunkers each 6 metres by 4 metres and 2.5 metres tall, with elaborate ventilation systems where soldiers can go for protection.“The Contractor,” says the document, “shallconduct a geophysical survey of the site to identify any subterranean voids, tunnels, or large cavities per phase.” This provision is likely referencing the large network of tunnels Hamas has built inGaza.One section of the document describes a “Human Remains Protocol”. “If suspected human remains or cultural artifacts are discovered, all work in the immediate area must cease immediately, the area must be secured, and the Contracting Officer must be notified immediately for direction,” it says. The bodies of about 10,000 Palestinians are believed to be buried under the rubble in Gaza,according to Gaza’s civil defense agency.It is unclear who owns the land where the military compound is set to be built, but much of the south Gaza area is currentlyunder Israeli control.

Yoon claimed he was rooting out “anti-state forces” and allegedelection fraudwithout providing evidence.2:02How the South Korean president's martial law declaration unfolded – videoWithin hours of the declaration, 190 lawmakers broke through military and police cordons to pass an emergency resolution lifting martial law. Parliament impeached Yoonwithin 11 days, and the constitutional courtremoved him from officefour months later.Outside the courthouse, hundreds of Yoon supporters – waving South Korean andUS flagsand chanting “Yoon again” – initially cheered when the judge dismissed some prosecution evidence but turned hostile as the ruling progressed. Some supporters shouted “political judge, step down” and hurled profanities at journalists.When the sentence was announced, some collapsed in tears, crying “the country is finished”. About 500 metres away, progressive groups erupted in cheers and embraced one another, though some expressed disappointment the death penalty had not been imposed.Yoon faces six additional criminal trials, two of which arise from the martial law crisis, including a treason charge alleging that he ordered drone incursions into North Korean airspace in an attempt to provoke a confrontation that could justify military rule. He has already been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for obstructing his own arrest.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Seoul hold a chained effigy depicting Yoon Suk Yeol during a rally calling for his resignation, in December 2024.Photograph: Han Myung-Gu/EPAThursday’s verdict follows a series of related rulings that formally established the events of 3 December constituted an insurrection.In January, the former prime minister Han Duck-soowas handed a 23-yearprison sentence in a ruling that described the martial law attempt as a “self-coup” by elected power that was more dangerous than traditional uprisings. The sentence far exceeded prosecutors’ 15-year demand, indicating judicial willingness to impose severe penalties.On 12 February, the former interior minister Lee Sang-minwas jailed for seven yearsfor his role in the insurrection, including relaying Yoon’s orders to cut power and water to media outlets.Legal experts saidthe rulings created a sentencing environment that made the most severe punishment more likely in Yoon’s case.The court also sentenced seven co-defendants: Kim Yong-hyun, the former defence minister, to 30 years; Noh Sang-won, a former intelligence commander, to 18 years; Cho Ji-ho, the former police chief, to 12 years; and Kim Bong-sik, the former Seoul police chief, to 10 years. Mok Hyun-tae, a police commander, received three years. Two defendants, Kim Yong-gun and Yoon Seung-young, were acquitted.View image in fullscreenAn anti-Yoon protester dressed as Batman in Seoul last April.Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty ImagesYoon’s legal team released a statement calling the verdict “a predetermined conclusion” and a “show trial”, saying they could not bring themselves to respect the judgment.They accused the judiciary of “kneeling to incited public opinion and political power” and applying double standards, pointing to President Lee Jae Myung’s suspended trials and opposition politicians acquitted on illegal evidence grounds.The legal team vowed to fight “to the end”, saying truth would eventually be revealed “in the court of history”. Yoon is expected to appeal.Life imprisonment carries no fixed release date, with parole theoretically possible after 20 years, on demonstration of good conduct and remorse.View image in fullscreenPark Geun-hye arrives at a court in Seoul in August 2017.Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/ReutersThe former president Park Geun-hye was initially sentenced to acombined 32 yearsin prisonfor corruptionand related offences in 2018.

Before 1998, the ocean smelled and looked terrible, with visible excrement on the rocks and surfers routinely emerging with ear infections and gastroenteritis.“I thought it was all done, and here we are back to where we were 30 years ago,” Ahipene-Mercer, of Ngāi Tara descent, said. “It’s a catastrophe.”On 4 February, an overnight electrical failure flooded the Moa Point wastewater treatment plant, destroying 80% of the equipment. Initially, raw sewage was being pumped directly out of a five-metre pipe near a beach at Tarakena Bay. Now, most sewage is being sent 1.8km offshore in the Cook Strait, after being screened for large objects such as tampons and wet wipes.Water management has long been a contentious issue in New Zealand, with legislation to centralise its control and overhaul outdated services thrown out by the National-led coalition government in favour of local reforms in early 2024.In Wellington, ageing pipes have caused issues with wastewater and stormwater flooding. The Moa Point plant is owned and overseen by two layers of local government and a council-owned water utility – Wellington Water – who contract the French-owned waste management company Veolia to run the plant.View image in fullscreenA general view of Moa Point Wastewater Plant, Wellington Airport and Lyall Bay.Photograph: Hagen Hopkins“It looked convoluted to me, and it wasn’t clear where actual authority lay,” the Wellington mayor, Andrew Little, who has been in the job four months, told the Guardian, adding that Wellingtonians were in a “state of shock”.A crown inquiry called by the local government minister, Simon Watts, will look into the causes of the disaster. “The public is owed the assurance that we understand what led to this failure and that we are taking steps to prevent it from happening again,” Watts told Radio New Zealand.He said that as part of the coalition government’s water reforms, a new entity, Tiaki Wai, would take over from Wellington Water in July, which he expected to improve services. Councils were responsible for underinvesting in water infrastructure, and new legislation would address this, he said.Little said he could not speculate on the causes due to the inquiry. Wellington Water did not respond to specific questions by deadline, and has said it could not comment publicly due to the ongoing inquiry. Veolia also declined to comment.Wellington Water chair Pat Dougherty previously told Radio New Zealand there had been underinvestment over a long period at Moa Point, and he backed an investigation. “I worry that there may have been some early warning signs that there were troubles with the discharge and we missed those. But everything needs to be on the table.”But for many, this is cold comfort. Locals say lower-level pollution has already marred the short Wellington summer, with recurring sewage discharges pointing to a deeper issue at the plant. Official reports showcontinuing issues and warnings about underfunding for years, and the authorities have said a fix could still be months away.“We are looking at generations of negligence, at a time where our climate is changing dramatically,” said Tamatha Paul, the Green party MP for Wellington Central and former city councillor who called this week’s meeting.View image in fullscreenPedestrians walk past a warning sign between Island Bay and Owhiro Bay.Photograph: Hagen Hopkins“The way this will affect really vulnerable, delicate species that are already endangered, the fact their entire habitat is being devastated is heartbreaking.”Central government help is crucial, she said.Local iwi [tribes] have long opposed any wastewater going into the ocean, Taranaki Whanui chair Te Whatanui Winiata said. “This is our source of sustenance, we are relations to the moana [ocean]. We have been crying about this from the start, saying this kind of sewage system just causes havoc. The response from our people is outrage, shock, and anguish.”As beaches remain closed and businesses report losses, the Victoria University marine biologist Christopher Cornwall said “huge numbers” of marine creatures who call the various reefs around the south coast home would be suffering the most.Continued pollution could cause a mass kelp die-off in the Taputeranga Marine Reserve – home to species such as mussels, kina, pāua, sea sponges, fish, crayfish, octopus and penguins – killing their homes and food sources, he said.View image in fullscreenThe Green MP Tamatha Paul.Photograph: Hagen HopkinsHuman-borne bacteria and viruses could make these sea creatures sick, along with accumulating in shellfish, making them unsafe to eat. Microplastics get into the stomachs of seabirds and penguins who eat human waste, making them think they are full so that they die of starvation.The Department of Conservation has said the extent of the damage is not yet known, but would be affected by the length and volume of discharge, ocean currents and wind.New Zealanders needed to rethink why wastewater was going into oceans in the first place, Cornwall said. “I have no idea why you’d put a pipe in between two reefs anyway, and now all those fecal materials are just getting swept right in. Why are we pumping sewage out on to a kelp forest? It’s clearly not OK, and we should never have been in this situation.”It’s a feeling shared by many. From her home in Island Bay, Kayla Henderson often watches dolphins playing in Taputeranga reserve. Outside the meeting this week, the young ocean lover felt helpless.“I just care about the environment,” she said. “And I want to have faith that we won’t have raw sewage and rubbish going into protected marine waterways. I didn’t think it would be that hard.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificWaternewsShareReuse this content"

They have got it wrong,” he said.“We’ve ended up in a situation where we’ve got inflation that has been led to be out of control. They’ve clearly misread inflation, so they’re clearly not putting enough emphasis on inflation.”Jonathan Kearns, the chief economist at Challenger and a former senior RBA official, says a central bank with an employment and inflation mandate is uncontroversial, and backed by history and research.“We have the dual mandate because monetary policy has an impact on employment as well as inflation. You want to target inflation, subject to avoiding significant costs on employment.”Luci Ellis, Westpac’s chief economist and a former head of the central bank’s economics department, says “it’s long been understood that even a central bank with only an inflation mandate would care about employment”.But Kearns says there is evidence that the RBA made an error of judgment last year by cutting interest rates three times, only to have toquickly reverse courseafter inflation ended 2025 back above 3%.“How you weigh inflation and employment is going to influence the path of monetary policy,” he says.But he fundamentally disagrees that the RBA is now structurally too focused on jobs over price stability.“A lot of what we might call policy errors have been more about judgment, not an inappropriate balance of inflation versus employment.”Ellis goes further.She says the change to the RBA’s agreement with the Albanese government on the conduct of monetary policy introduced a stricter interpretation of achieving the inflation goals by explicitly targeting the midpoint of the 2-3% target range.“My read on their [the RBA’s] policy decisions and rhetoric since the new statement is that, if anything, they have become even more focused on tiny deviations in the inflation trajectory.”Whether Wilson, in his heart of hearts, is an “inflation nutter” will remain an open question – and one his political opponents will be keen to ask every chance they get.Patrick Commins is Guardian Australia’s economics editorExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyTim WilsonCoalitionInterest ratesReserve Bank of AustraliaAustralian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Most of the11 suspects who have been detainedare from far-left movements.The prosecutor Thierry Dran told a press conference he had requested murder charges against seven men and recommended they remain in custody to avoid any “disturbance to public order”.The killing has fuelled political tensions before French municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally party is expected to have its best chance yet of winning the highest office.On Wednesday, Meloni said the killing of Deranque was “a wound for all of Europe”.Macron said there was no place inFrance“for movements that adopt and legitimise violence” and he called on all political parties to “clean up” their act. “Nothing can justify violent action – neither on one side nor the other, and not even in a head-to-head confrontation that is deadly for the republic,” he said.Macron also suggested that people should “stay in their own lane”, after Meloni lamented “a climate of ideological hatred”.View image in fullscreenQuentin Deranque, who died after being attacked on the sidelines of a far-right protest in Lyon on 12 February.Photograph: AFP/Getty Images“I’m always struck by the fact that people who are nationalists – who don’t want anyone bothering them at home – are always the first to comment on what is happening elsewhere,” Macron said while on a visit to Delhi.Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, hit back, saying the killing of the French activist was “a serious matter that concerns us all”. Tajani said on X that there had been similar incidents in Italy’s history and that condemning such violence aimed “to ensure that we do not return to a terrible past”.He said there had been “many Quentins in Italy, some during the darkest periods of the republic”.Macron was “closely monitoring” events, a member of his team said on Thursday, adding: “We must avoid any spiral of violence.”Eleven people – eight men and three women – were taken into custody over the killing. Dran said that of the seven men who could be charged with homicide, two had refused to speak while in custody.He said others acknowledged being at the scene and “some admit to having struck blows” but they had all disputed having had any homicidal intent. Four suspects had been released but more were being sought, he added.Among those originally detained are two parliamentary assistants to Raphaël Arnault, a MP with the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, as well as a former intern.A lawyer for Deranque’s parents said they called “for calm and restraint”. “The family condemns any call for violence. Any form of political violence,” Fabien Rajon told the broadcaster RTL.In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron’s supporters and the left, including the hard left, joined forces in an effort to bar the far right from power. But after Deranque’s killing, some high-profile politicians have sought to distance themselves from the hard left, ruling out any possible future alliance.The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, called on Arnault to “draw the consequences” if the judiciary “finds serious and consistent evidence concerning him or the aides he hired”.LFI’s national coordinator, Manuel Bompard, said Arnault would “certainly not” be suspended or excluded from the LFI group in the national assembly’s lower house.An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis has blamed the killing of the activist on an anti-fascist youth group calledLa Jeune Garde(Young Guard) that was co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronGiorgia MeloniItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The chief executive, Julie Sweet,has previously saidthis will “create opportunities for companies to reimagine their processes and operations, discover new ways of working, and scale AI solutions across the enterprise to help drive continuous change and create value”.The company’s aggressive push into AI highlights a wider industry trend of businesses using machine learning tools to help them with speeding up certain tasks so they can focus other resources elsewhere.Accenturereported better-than-expected resultsfor its first quarter in December, as it was boosted by demand for its AI-driven services.Its latest move linking use of AI tools to promotion potential comes only months after the New York-listed company begancalling its employees “reinventors”in an effort to position itself as a leader in artificial intelligence. The move was criticised by some as an example of corporate jargon.The reinventor label came amid a large reorganisation across Accenture last June, when it merged its strategy, consulting, creative, technology and operations divisions into a single unit called “Reinvention Services”.Sweet told investors in September that the company would “exit” employees who were not getting the hang of using AI at work.Older and more senior employees at the largest professional services companies are generally seen as more reluctant to incorporate use of AI tools into their work, while younger and more junior staff are more receptive.TheDublin-headquartered grouphas previously said that employees for whom “reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need” would be shown the door.Accenture announced in December that it had signed partnerships with theChatGPT owner, OpenAI,and its rival Anthropic, the owner of the Claude chatbot, as the consulting company has looked to capitalise on growing demand for AI services.A spokesperson for Accenture said: “Our strategy is to be the reinvention partner of choice for our clients and to be the most client-focused, AI-enabled, great place to work.

He wrote: “Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.”A pre-emptive strike onIranwould be unlikely to be in line with the UK’s interpretation of international law. US bases in the UK, like Fairford in Gloucestershire, the home for US B-2 bombers in Europe, are only used for military operations if the UK government agrees and they are considered legal.UK government sources said this was viewed as the reason for Trump to again turn against the Chagos plan.On Tuesday night, Starmer and Trump spoke in a conversation that covered the situation in Iran, although the Downing Street readout of the call made no mention of the Chagos plan.The hope in No 10 is that Trump will again change his mind. The bill setting out the Chagos agreement is due to return to the House of Lords soon.There has been speculation that the bill, which is nearing its final stages but was delayed last month amid continued uncertainty about the US position, might have returned to the Lords next week. However, it is now not expected for several weeks.Under parliamentary rules, if it is not passed before the end of the current parliamentary session in May, the bill would have to be presented again.One former government official who worked closely on the deal said he was concerned it might be scuppered. Ben Judah, who was until recently a special adviser to David Lammy, the former foreign secretary, told a Sun podcast: “It’s looking tricky for the government to get this deal through in the weeks and month ahead.”Map of US military bases near IranThe Conservatives are continuing to push the Trump administration to block the plan, which Downing Street has said can only go ahead with US buy-in.The shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, is giving a speech in Washington DC next week, and is expected to hold talks with US officials about the Chagos plan.In a statement, Patel said the deal was “now dead in the water”, adding: “It’s impossible for the deal to proceed without the support of our American allies, and Labour will soon run out of time to put anything before parliament.”A government spokesperson said: “As routine, we do not comment on operational matters. There is a political process ongoing between the US and Iran, which the UK supports. Iran must never be able to develop a nuclear weapon, and our priority is security in the region.”Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsDonald TrumpIranUS militaryMilitaryDefence policyKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

This is a tremendous group of powerful people.”Authoritarians, strongmen and dictators: who is on Trump’s Board of Peace?Read moreMaj Gen Jasper Jeffers III, the US officer appointed to command the future international stabilisation force (ISF), said the board planned to deploy 20,000 soldiers in five different sectors of Gaza, beginning with Rafah.He said its long-term objective was to deploy 12,000 police, with Egypt and Jordan committing to training officers in the future. Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto, said his country was ready to commit as many as 8,000 troops “or more if necessary”.The Guardian has revealed that the Trump administration plans tobuild a 5,000-person military baseover more than 350 acres in Gaza, , according tothe board’s contracting records.Aid workers have said an organisation established by the board, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, has been frustrated by a lack of direction and that an ISF office in the territory remains empty.It is unclear what the ISF’s remit or rules of engagement would be, meaning the lack of a political solution would be likely to frustrate efforts to rebuild the territory.Yakir Gabay, a Cypriot-Israeli billionaire heading the board’s planned reconstruction efforts, described plans to remove more than 70m tonnes of rubble and unexploded ordnance and develop the Gaza coastline into a “new Mediterranean Riviera with 200 hotels and potential islands”. The plan would all be subject to the full disarmament of Hamas, he said.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump uses a gavel during a signing ceremony at the board’s inaugural meeting.Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesThe board has been criticised as a shadow UN, and major European allies including the UK, France and Germany have declined to join it. The Vatican said this week that it would not take part.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under pressure from rightwing coalition allies to maintain a hardline position on Gaza, did not attend. His foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, emphasised Israel’s security concerns and said the plan included the “disarmament of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, demilitarisation of the Gaza Strip and deradicalisation of Palestinian society”. He said: “It’s the first plan to address the root of the problem.”In his opening remarks, Trump repeated his hyperbole about resolving eight wars since entering power, riffed about how he was not supposed to endorse foreign candidates and then backed Hungary’s Viktor Orbán in upcoming elections. He also joked about his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, renaming the DC venue for the meeting the Institute of Peace in his honour.The board met as the US has massed forces in the Middle East, including two aircraft carriers and dozens of warplanes, for a potential attack on Iran that could dwarf last summer’s US strikes on the country’s nuclear facilities.Addressing world leaders and delegates mainly from the Middle East and Asia, Trump said the US had brought peace to the Middle East by launching strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities and now “we’ll see where that goes”.“Now we may have to take that a step further, or we may not,” he said. “Maybe we’re going to make a deal. You’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.“Good talks are being had … It’s proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal, otherwise bad things will happen.

But he is widely read, as was his report that the US viewed the talks in Geneva on Tuesday as a “nothing burger”, and that a full-scale attack on Iran was far closer than most Americans realised. The story led to a spike in oil prices and front-page pieces in US newspapers saying Trump’s military preparationswould be complete by the weekend, with the president hinting a decision would be made “probably over the next 10 days”.Inevitably this, along with the armada, could be seen as another part of coercive diplomacy. The Trump team’s modus operandi often seems to be to “speak softly [to Axios] and carry a big stick”.Either way, Iran may claim it will not negotiate under duress – but that is precisely what it is being required to do.It has prompted the Iranian diplomatic class to push back against the claim that it is playing for time by insisting on indirect talks anddrafting “guiding principles”to be discussed at another meeting in a fortnight – or that the talks have not moved beyond generalities.The Iranian foreign ministry said that, on the contrary, Tehran’s team had been willing to stay in Geneva for days to continue the discussions but it had been Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who had foreshortened the talks because they needed to go to another venue to negotiate with Ukraine and Russia.For good measure Tehran pointed out that the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, had been on the phone to the UN nuclear weapons inspector, Raphael Grossi, to discuss details of how the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be able to visit Iran’s nuclear sites to verify what remained and to oversee the dilution of its 400kg stockpile of uranium, now enriched to more than 60%.Grossi sounded optimistic. “There has been some progress, but there is still a lot of work to be done, and the problem is that we don’t have much time,” he said. “It’s possible to have a dialogue that is really strengthening for the first time … We’re talking about specific issues and actions that we need to take.”View image in fullscreenIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi.Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/APHe said he sensed a desire on both sides to reach an agreement, but that doing so would be “extremely complex”.The outlines of the agreement are in view, even if Iran, still behaving as if it were involved in a traditional negotiation, is reluctant to spell out in public what concessions it is prepared to make.Its offer at heart is to suspend domestic uranium enrichment for a fixed period as long as five years, and downgrade its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% to 3-6%. The 2015 nuclear agreement required a 15-year suspension, and for Iran to keep its uranium stockpile under 300kg enriched to a maximum of 3.67%.The suspension offer is in part an acknowledgment of the reality that Tehran currently has working centrifuges to enrich uranium, and it would insist on retaining its right to enrich for civilian purposes as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.Iran is prepared to allow the IAEA back, even though it feels Grossi betrayed the agency’s neutrality by never condemning the US attacks on its nuclear facilities, despite their being under IAEA safeguards at the time.In an interview in Saudi Arabia, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said: “I am convinced that if the normal work of IAEA inspectors, as mandated by its founding documents, is restored, the Iranian side will certainly cooperate with them.” He made no mention of Iran’s excess stockpile being sent to Russia, an offer Moscow has frequently made.In return for suspension, Tehran is seeking the return of its frozen assets – estimates vary on the size – and the lifting of sanctions on banking and oil exports. A grand offer of a US economic partnership and wider access to Iranian markets has also been made, which could be the most novel part of the draft agreement and is loosely modelled on what Ukraine has offered the US.Nobody knows what would follow regime change in Iran – but what happened in 1979 offers some pointers | Jason BurkeRead moreTrump’s difficulty in running with Iran’s offer is threefold. It bears a striking resemblance to the 2015 nuclear deal that he derided and abandoned in 2018. It allows Tehran in principle to enrich domestically, and it contains nothing about limiting the range of its ballistic missile programme, a key Israeli demand. It would look as if he was repairing the wreckage he caused in his first term.Second, he would be giving succour to an Iranian regime that is at its weakest and most unpopular since the 1979 revolution, after assembling the largest US naval buildup in the Middle East since the start of the Iraq war in 2003.Third, he would make the Grand Old Duke of York look decisive, and after the Greenland fiasco his credibility is low.Omid Memarian, a senior Iran analyst at Dawn, a Washington thinktank focused on the Middle East, said Tehran was overplaying its cards and was not in as strong a position as last June.“The calculus of the military establishment is very different to ordinary Iranians,” he said. “They have a legitimacy crisis and lost a massive amount of their ability to deter outside attacks, but they think a US attack will rally their loyalists around the flag as it did last June, and that will give them an excuse to deal harshly with internal dissent. That is why they are giving so little in the negotiations.“They know this is going to be an existential threat and a much bigger US attack, but they do not think it can bring the regime to its knees, and that they can survive it.“Ali Khamenei’s tactics are to keep the base intact and energised, but we are starting to see cracks in the regime, and an external attack may provide more space for those criticising the regime in which to move. There is a lot of frustration with him amongst his inner circle.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyIranIran nuclear programmeTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Searches at the Royal Lodge in Windsor, Berkshire, his former address, were continuing.On an extraordinary day that could have profound effects for the royal family, unmarked police cars and plainclothes officers from the Thames Valley force were seen at Mountbatten-Windsor’s residence at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate at about 8am. They searched the Norfolk property as well as his former home in the Royal Lodge in Great Windsor Park.Hours later Charles gave his unqualified backing to the police investigation into his brother, who was arrested on his 66th birthday. The king said the “law must take its course”.“What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,” Charles said in a statement. “In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation.”In the glare of increased public scrutiny, the king and queen continued their royal duties with Charles attending three separate in-person audiences at St James’s Palace and Camilla visiting the Sinfonia Smith Square in Westminster for a lunchtime orchestral concert.Meanwhile, Princess Anne visited a prison, HMP Leeds, in her capacity as patron of the Butler Trust, a UK charity that promotes the work of staff in prisons, probation and youth justice.Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, thought to be the first time in modern history that a member of the royal family has been held by police, came only hours after the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said “nobody is above the law” when questioned about the former prince. He added that “anybody who has any information should testify”.View image in fullscreenAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor riding a horse in Windsor Great Park on 2 February.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThames Valley police said it had arrested “a man in his 60s from Norfolk” on suspicion of misconduct in public office and was carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk.Oliver Wright, one of the force’s assistant chief constables, said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office. It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”Two key decisions were made before the arrest of the king’s brother.The first was that inviting Mountbatten-Windsor in for an interview under caution would not be enough, with detectives believing arrest “was necessary to progress the investigation”, a source said.The second key decision was that there would need to be searches.The arrest would grant police search powers of properties linked to the former prince. That meant there was no need to separately apply to a magistrate for a search warrant.Norfolk police confirmed they were supporting Thames Valley’s investigation.It is understood neither the king nor Buckingham Palace was informed in advance of Andrew’s arrest.Police leaders informed the Home Office on Thursday morning that officers were going to arrest Andrew and carry out searches. The National Police Chiefs’ Council said in a statement: “In line with routine practice, the [NPCC] alerted operational colleagues within the Home Office of the arrest. This gave 30 minutes’ notice before Thames Valley police made the arrest.”Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing or accusations against him. Thames Valley is one of a number of police forces to have assessed allegations that resurfaced when the US justice department published the so-called Epstein files.The force said previously it was reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mountbatten-Windsor, and claims the former prince shared sensitive information with the disgraced financier while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.10:09Andrew arrested: is this the end for the royal family? | The LatestThe family of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Mountbatten-Windsor of sexually abusing her when she was 17 as part of a sex trafficking ring run by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell – allegations the former prince has denied – released a statement on Thursday.Her family members Sky and Amanda Roberts and Danny and Lanette Wilson said: “At last. Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty. On behalf of our sister, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, we extend our gratitude to the UK’s Thames Valley police for their investigation and arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you.”Wright said previously that information was evaluated during an assessment phase to determine whether a criminal offence was suspected and a full investigation required. “Allegations of misconduct in public office involve particular complexities and therefore an assessment must be conducted carefully and thoroughly,” he said at a press briefing last week.View image in fullscreenUnmarked cars at the Sandringham estate on Thursday.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesResponding to Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, the former prime minister Gordon Brown said: “I have submitted a five-page memorandum to the Metropolitan, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley and other relevant UK police constabularies.“This memorandum provides new and additional information to that which I submitted last week to the Met, Essex and Thames Valley police forces, where I expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women.”According to the Crown Prosecution Service’s website, misconduct in public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.Mountbatten-Windsor could also face questions about alleged sexual wrongdoing while under arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office, according to a lawyer who specialises in representing abuse survivors.In 2015, the retired Church of England bishop Peter Ball, an associate of the king, was jailed for 32 months for misconduct in public office after the court was told that he had misused his authority over young men for sexual gratification.Richard Scorer, the head of abuse law at Slater and Gordon, said: “If prosecutors build a case which convinces a jury that Andrew misused his position to have sex with young women, in my opinion he could be pursued on that basis.”Republic, a group that campaigns to abolish the monarchy, welcomed the arrest, which it claimed was in response to a crime report sent to Thames Valley police by its chief executive, Graham Smith. He said: “Republic’s lawyers will continue to investigate related alleged offences and provide information to the police over the coming weeks and months.”The allegations stem from documents released by the US justice department relating to Epstein and his links to the rich and powerful. Emails released appeared to show Mountbatten-Windsor sharing reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore.One email, dated November 2010, appeared to be forwarded by the former duke to Epstein five minutes after it was sent by his then special adviser, Amir Patel. Another, seemingly sent on Christmas Eve 2010, included a confidential brief on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand province, Afghanistan.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Critics of the current system say lopsided funding mechanisms leave hundreds of thousands of children with little or no support in mainstream schools, requiring their families to battle local authorities for help.But government officials are concerned that proposals to limit who has access to educational, health and care plans could prompt a backlash from parents’ groups and Labour MPs when it comes to a Commons vote.Some are particularly concerned about plans to test those who hold ECHPs according to the new tougher criteriawhen they move up to secondary school, while others want to make sure parents can make a legal appeal if they feel schools are not meeting their children’s needs.View image in fullscreenThere is concern that the plan to test children with ECHPs against tougher criteria when they reach secondary school could prompt a fierce backlash.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAMeg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said: “The key thing is trust. If parents think their support could be ripped away from them they will worry.”However, she added that unlike the welfare reforms, over which she led a successful rebellion last year, ministers had been at pains to consult Labour MPs and were not focusing the reforms on saving money.Another Labour MP said: “The government has got everyone very, very anxious. But the truth is everyone recognises the need for reform and not letting things continue as they are.”‘A social justice issue’: London school believes it has model for Send inclusionRead moreGovernment insiders say they are optimistic that a rebellion can be averted in part because the Treasury has been more generous with funding than expected.The full package of reforms will be phased in over a decade, with mainstream schools to make extra provision and support “ordinarily available” to any pupils.Those schools will also be expected to make “reasonable adjustments” to accommodate children with conditions such as autism, ADHD or mental health issues, or face potential legal action.That action could involve appealing to an independent ombudsman, or changing equalities rules to make disabled children’s rights more explicit.Children with special needs at mainstream schools will be eligible for individual support plans (ISPs), which offer enhanced legal rights and assurances without a child requiring an EHCP.But policymakers say the reforms could be derailed if the government fails to make clear the benefits of the new system, including continuing protections for EHCPs, which agree the needs and support for individual children between families and councils.The new format for EHCPs will affect children only from 2030 onwards, and will take into account the extra provision available in mainstream schools.Those involved with the negotiations told the Guardian: “If MPs hear there are protections for EHCPs and there’s more money [in the system], I think they will come onboard.”More than 480,000 children and young people at schools inEnglandhave EHCPs, and reports have concentrated on fears that EHCPs could be curtailed or taken away at the transition from primary to secondary school after 2030.The first tier equalities tribunal will still be available for appeals involving EHCPs although its role will be “refocused” and take account of the other legal routes available to families.Ministers will also introduce new price bands for independent special schools, which currently charge more than twice the cost of a state special school on average.Under plans announced on Thursday, private providers will be forced to comply with set price bands for certain services and will have to sign up to minimum service standards.Phillipson said: “We’re cracking down on providers who put profit before children. New standards and proper oversight will ensure every independent special school placement delivers real outcomes for children – not unreasonable bills for local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsChildrenEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Four non-native deer species – muntjac, Chinese water deer, fallow and sika – have been introduced into the wild and have thrived. Only two deer species present in England, the red and roe, are native.Overpopulation of deer causes problems for woodland: they eat leaves, buds and sapling stalks, and strip bark from mature trees, which can affect the trees’ health and make them susceptible to disease. Some deer, particularly the sika, rake their antlers against trees, which can kill younger wood.View image in fullscreenOverpopulation of deer affects woodlands as they eat leaves, buds and sapling stalks, and damage young trees with their antlers.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe government’s legally binding environment targets require it to regenerate woodland equivalent to a net increase of 43,000 hectares (106,255 acres), which will be difficult if the deer population continues to expand. Government figures show 33% of English woodlands are now in unfavourable condition due to the impact of deer, up from 24% in the early 2000s.The government has mostly focused on protecting trees with guards and fences rather than tackling the deer population. Now, it is announcing a change of approach. Under the plans, all publicly owned or managed land will have deer management plans within 10 years.National priority areas – where deer are extremely populous and are having a very detrimental impact on woodland – will be identified, with culls targeted there.There will also be a change to the grant system that pays landowners to shoot deer. Under the new scheme, landowners can be paid to shoot deer when the animals move out of wooded areas, making it easier to target a problematic population, said Emma Dear, the principal officer for tree establishment at Natural England.View image in fullscreenThe muntjac deer is listed as an invasive species, and along with the similarly non-native sika and Chinese water deer, deemed to be causing the most damage to woodland.Photograph: FLPA/Rex/ShutterstockShe told the Guardian: “This means we can have timely interventions when ecological damage is likely to be greatest. There is an issue because of the way deer move through the landscape and are not constrained to one patch. The grant system was only facilitated in the woodlands; the new strategy will address that.”Dear added that the lack of natural predators was driving the rise in the deer population across England. Wolves, bears, lynx and other apex predators were hunted to extinction many years ago. Climate breakdown is also a factor.“Deer are changing their behaviour because of warmer winters. They can overwinter in better conditions and the number of babies they have is higher when the winter is warmer,” Dear said.Defra sources said there would be a particular focus on reducing the muntjac population as these were listed as an invasive species, and the agency will assess sika and Chinese water deer to see if these can be added to the invasive species list and urgently targeted. These are the three deer species deemed to be causing the most damage.View image in fullscreenA red deer eats silver birch. ‘Our trees and native wildlife are under huge strain from deer damage,’ said Mary Creagh, the nature minister.Photograph: Mike Unwin/The GuardianThe nature minister, Mary Creagh, said: “Our trees and native wildlife are under huge strain from deer damage, including from non-native deer species. This government is helping landowners and farmers manage deer impacts more effectively so woodlands can flourish and crops are better protected. These new measures will also help restore nature, boost our homegrown timber industry and protect the millions of trees we are planting across the country.”The culled deer may be eaten, with Defra looking at how to market and safely get the meat into the supply chain.Dear said: “There is a section of the strategy that is looking at venison marketing and supporting that industry. Supporting the wild venison sector will hopefully reduce the cost of management.”Explore more on these topicsConservationWildlifeTrees and forestsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It was one of multiple scandals in the 1990s and 2000s involving the former duchess, who was widely considered an embarrassment to the royal family.Ferguson has stood by Mountbatten-Windsor through waves of allegations produced by his links toJeffrey Epstein, though she was yet to comment on his arrest on Thursday.She has previously described him as “amazing” and said they were “the happiest divorced couple in the world”, later rejecting the claims against him and calling his alleged victim Virginia Giuffre a liar.While Ferguson’s ties to Mountbatten-Windsor have kept her adjacent to the Epstein scandal, it is her own closeness to the convicted sex offender that is threatening to make her persona non grata in the public sphere as more details come to light.News of the former prince’s arrest came only days after it was revealed that six of Ferguson’s businesses are set to be struck off the register of Companies House, after becoming dormant. It is not clear what each of them did, but one appeared to be a public relations business, while another appeared to be in the retail sector.Ferguson, whose money problems have been well documented over the years, and who has struggled to be financially independent, exchanged many emails with Epstein, even after he was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.A string of revelations have uncovered Ferguson’s financial ties – even an alleged dependence – on Epstein. The allegations have also opened up questions about the funding of the lifestyles of her daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, now in their 30s, who were pictured going on lavish holidays during their 20s while working relatively low-paid jobs.Ferguson has been involved in several scandals that appeared to be attempts to cash in on her royal connections, including two tell-all memoirs, in 1996 and 2011, and in 2010 when she was exposed in a News of the World sting operation attempting to sell access to her former husband in return for £500,000. She told Mazher Mahmood, who was undercover as the “Fake Sheikh”, that she would “open any door you want”, promising him he would get his investment back tenfold.Later apologising for the scandal, Ferguson said it was “true my finances are under stress”.The Epstein files, the tranche of documents gathered by US authorities in the investigation into the disgraced financier, have shown some of the extent to which she financially depended on the friendship with him, including evidence he wired Ferguson $150,000 (£104,000) in 2001, which she said was for share options she had earned as an “ambassador” for Weight Watchers, which had gone public earlier that year.She initially claimed to have cut ties with Epstein as soon as she became aware of the allegations against him in 2006. However, emails contained in the US department of justice files showed she maintained her closeness with him.“Cannot wait to see you,” she wrote in one email in 2009. Another email between Epstein and his assistant showed he paid $14,080 to fly Ferguson and her two daughters, then 19 and 20, to the US for lunch.Days later she wrote to him: “Thank you Jeffrey for being the brother I have always wished for.”The following year, in another email, she wrote: “You are a legend.” Later in the same email, she added: “I am at your service. Just marry me.”Nine months later, Ferguson publicly apologised for her association with him, saying in an interview with the Evening Standard newspaper: “I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf.”But in private, the former duchess emailed Epstein to “humbly apologise” for denouncing him publicly, calling him “a supreme friend to me and my family”.Later, when the conversation became public, she told the media she had sent that email to him to “assuage Epstein and his threats”.When the US government released the first tranche of Epstein files in September last year, a number of charities associated with the then duchess cut ties with her, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the children’s hospice Julia’s House, both of which she was patron.The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation issued a statement saying the charity was “disturbed” to read her comments, and also dropped her as a patron.Nothing uncovered in the files has indicated any criminal activity by Ferguson, who appeared to stop using the duchess title when her ex-husband was stripped of his title, though it may be one scandal too many.Explore more on these topicsSarah FergusonJeffrey EpsteinanalysisShareReuse this content"

Botstein said he pursued the relationship “in fulfillment of my responsibilities as the chief fundraiser of the college”.He has also said in a letter to the campus community that Epstein was “not my friend”, according to reporting by WAMC News.Botstein has also alleged that he was ill and stayed by himself during a dinner that he attended on Epstein’s island in 2012, and that he went solely to attend a fundraiser there with the billionaire investor Leon Black.Is there a tip on this story?

Spanberger, a former undercover CIA officer who served three terms in Congress,became Virginia’s first female governorearlier this year, resoundingly winning an office previously held by a Republican. She won the race by a double-digit margin, campaigning on affordability and lowering costs for families.In a statement, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries and his counterpart, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer hailed Spanberger as a public servant with a record of holding Trump accountable – and winning races in competitive territory.“She stands in stark contrast toDonald Trump, who will lie, deflect and blame everyone but himself for his failed presidency on Tuesday evening,” Jeffries said in a statement announcing her selection. “As our nation marks its 250th anniversary this summer, Governor Spanberger embodies the best of America as a mother, community leader and dedicated public servant.”“Gov Spanberger will lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation,” Schumer added.Spanberger said she planned to use her rebuttal to address Americans’ concerns with “rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring”.“Next week, I look forward to laying out what these Americans expect and deserve – leaders who are working hard to deliver for them,” she said.In choosing Spanberger, 46, Democratic leaders are handing the spotlight to a battleground-tested moderate with national security credentials and a reputation for message discipline, particularly on economic issues and highlighting the impact of federal policies on everyday Virginians. Her 15-point victory in a purple state last November, alongside Mikie Sherrill in the New Jersey’s governor’s race, provided a jolt of optimism forDemocratsstill searching for an effective response to counter a president who dominates the political national conservation.As Trump contends with sagging approval ratings amid economic unease and a backlash to his deportation agenda, Democrats believe they are strongly positioned to win control of the House – and possibly even the Senate – in November.The rebuttal slot is typically reserved for a rising star – an ascendant figure the party believes can carry its message and showcase its next generation. Last year, Democrats chose Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin, another centrist figure with an intelligence background who won her seat even as Trump claimed the battleground state in 2024. But unlike Slotkin, Spanberger is not seen as a potential 2028 contender.Democrats also chose Senator Alex Padilla, to deliver the party’s Spanish language response. In a statement, the 52-year-old senator said he plans to discuss “a federal government that weaponizes enforcement agencies against immigrants and US citizens alike,” as well as the Trump administration’s “failed economic agenda” and its effort to restrict voting access.“Americans don’t need another speech from Donald Trump pretending everything is fine when their bills are too high, paychecks are too low, and masked and militarized federal agents are roaming our communities violating constitutional rights on a daily basis,” Padilla said in a statement.Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants and the first Latino to represent California in the Senate, was tackled to the ground by federal agents and handcuffed after attempting to ask the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, a question at a news conference in Los Angeles during the administration’s immigration crackdown in the city last summer.Democrats are heavily courting Latino voters who shifted toward Trump in the presidential election, but have soured on the president over his handling of the economy and his sprawling deportation campaign that has swept up long-settled immigrants, green-card holders and even US citizens.“As Donald Trump, Kristi Noem and MAGA extremists have tried to silence the voices of our Latino brothers and sisters, Senator Alex Padilla has consistently fought back and proven Democrats will not bend the knee to this out-of-control administration,” Jeffries said in a statement.Shrai Popat contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsState of the Union addressDonald TrumpTrump administrationDemocratsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

After Retes attempted to explain to agents blocking the roadway that he needed to get through to work, agents shattered his car window, removed him from the vehicle, and detained Retes without checking his identification. He was later held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles without a clear explanation of his detainment.“George’s rights were violated, and he is filing this lawsuit, not only to protect his own rights, but to have the rights of others be protected too,” Andrew Wimer, director of media relations at the Institute for Justice, told the Guardian. “What happened to George is clearly wrong. No one can be held for three days without being told what they’ve done wrong, without being charged with a crime. Americans deserve justice when their rights have been violated.”In anop-edfor the San Francisco Chronicle, Retes said he missed his daughter’s third birthday party. “Then I was just let go, with no charges, no explanation for why and no apology,” he added.The lawsuit was filed against the United States government, which oversees the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the detention center where Retes was held, ICE, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the US navy, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).Existing legislation allows individuals to sue state and local officials if those officials violate their constitutional rights. When it comes to federal officials, the process to file a lawsuit against them has become increasingly difficult. In recent decades, the supreme court has narrowed when lawsuits against federal agents can be brought.“We fully expect this government will claim various immunities, that they will try to get the case dismissed before it can really get started,” said Wimer. “These cases present a lot of difficulties, we know what we’re in for, and it might be a years-long fight, but because we’re a public interest law firm that will not be charging George, this is a fight that we can take on.”Retes’s case adds to the growing concern of arrests of US military veterans by federal agents. As the Trump administration ramped up its immigration crackdown in Minnesota, an army veteran was arrested while protesting a service at a church in St Paul,Mother Jonesreported. In October, the Guardianidentified eight caseswhere military veterans were prosecuted or sought damages after being detained by federal agents.The Guardian has reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS immigrationTrump administrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US politicsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Not so long ago, diversity, equity and inclusion was the favorite term of Fortune 500 CEOs and the political elite. More recently, it has been blamed for everything from thecollapseof the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and the deadly Los Angeleswildfiresto thecrashbetween a regional jet and a helicopter in Washington DC.“DEI means people DIE,” Elon Muskwrotelast year.Alongside culture-war attacks, DEI also became a legal liability after the US supreme courtoverturnedaffirmative action in higher education in 2023.Some of the mostpowerful companiesthat once touted their DEI policies have backed away from them. Webpages celebrating diversity have been taken down, teams dedicated to promoting diversity have dissipated and now there is seemingly no one left to defend DEI in its final days.That’s where Kenji Yoshino and David Glasgow, two law professors at New York University, are stepping in. Both are longtime experts in anti-discrimination law and have spent years consulting leaders on how to make their workplaces more inclusive.In their new book,How Equality Wins: A New Vision for an Inclusive America, Yoshino and Glasgow argue that the project of equality is far from over – but it’s in desperate need of a survival plan.Yoshino and Glasgow spoke to the Guardian recently about the new book and their hope that the essence of DEI can live past the political moment that killed it.View image in fullscreenHow Equality Wins: A New Vision for an Inclusive America.Photograph: Courtesy of Simon & Schuster“DEI itself, as an acronym, is dead,” Yoshino said. “But the underlying value of equality isn’t. Not by a long shot.”The authors outline several strategies for equality’s survival. One of the most important is understanding what advocates are actually fighting for and what they’re fighting against.Opponents say that DEI leads to incompetence. People are hired or given opportunities not because they are qualified, they say, but because of their race or gender.But the authors posit that reasoning ignores just how biased the hiring process can be. In 1970, before symphony orchestras used screens to hide a musician’s identity during auditions, only 5% of orchestra members were women. By 2016, that number jumped to 35%. That increase didn’t come from the orchestras giving explicit preferences to women, but from the screens, which helped them remove bias from the process. Yoshino and Glasgow call this lifting versus levelling.“A lot of Americans have been kind of deceived into believing that what DEI stands for is a version of race-based affirmative actions,” Yoshino said. “But that is only a part of DEI, and there are many forms of diversity, equity and inclusion that are completely consistent with the levelling approach, which removes bias from the system, as opposed to the lifting approach, which creates that targeted ramp up to a playing field.”Yoshino likes to point to a quote from US supreme court chief justice John Roberts, from his written opinion that overturned affirmative action. Roberts wrote: “Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it.”“I would actually happily sign on to that vision of America,” Yoshino said. “It’s just that it seems like his notion of symmetry is itself quite asymmetrical, that it gets trotted out as the American value when it benefits the dominant group, and not when it benefits the non-dominant group.”But despite the movement’s good intentions, Yoshino and Glasgow also encourage tough conversations about where DEI got things wrong, from fostering a culture of shame around disagreement to distracting debates on terminology.The DEI movement paradoxically ended up becoming exclusive, narrowly focusing on race and gender when allyship could be found across different groups.Opponents of DEI have been quite successful in “framing DEI as a set of unfair preferences that advantage some groups over other groups”, Glasgow said. “Even if you think that narrative is wrong, it could be very helpful to the cultural debate and the longevity of [equality] to show that actually, we are serious about benefiting everyone with this.”One strategy, “embrace universality”, points out that though the legal environment after the supreme court’s affirmative action case makes it harder to have targeted programs based on race and gender, programs focused on equality can still exist.Yoshino and Glasgow have for years offered a course to law students that emphasizes things not typically found in textbooks, like tips on negotiations and written communication. Though they open it to “all students with an interest in diversity and inclusion”, the vast majority come from marginalized backgrounds.This embodies a universality strategy they call “a shift from cohort to content”. Instead of limiting the course to a specific cohort, such as students from a particular race or gender, they focus on content restrictions, which are legally permissible. “This strategy has already proven to be an amulet against legal liability,” the authors wrote.Another strategy, “shift from cohort to character”, comes from a loophole the supreme court left universities in its affirmative action decision. The court said that universities could still consider “an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise”, particularly in a student’s essay.Yoshino and Glasgow point out this exemption allows organizations to get creative. They could, for example, openly ask candidates in interviews about how race has affected their life “be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise” – exactly as the supreme court allows it.These strategies and loopholes are more important than ever. DEI’s death is not just coming through the cultural wars, but also from litigation that is attacking the private sector and state and local diversity programs.Earlier this month, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which falls under Trump’s executive branch,announcedit was investigating Nike over discrimination against white employers. In January, Trump’s justice departmentsuedMinnesota over the state’s affirmative action program for its agencies.Glasgow said that “even in the worst-case legal [environment], there are still lots of concrete steps that organizations can take to promote fairness in ways that do not involve the kind of preferences or affirmative action that are subject to litigation”.Yoshino and Glasgow remain hopeful that DEI can still live on – maybe not by name, but by purpose – if people see it as something larger and more important than the cultural wars have framed it to be.“We worry that a lot of people associate DEI with just a set of technocratic HR practices, like a bias training when you get onboarded at your new job or having a celebration of a heritage month at your university,” Yoshino said, but DEI ultimately has its origins in the civil rights movement. “It’s all gone by different names throughout time, but it’s part of efforts to ensure … that the promise of civil rights is made real in people’s everyday lives and the opportunities they get.”Beyond the social case for equality, there’s also a resounding business case for inclusion in the workplace as the US gets more diverse. Research has shown the US will be a majority-minority country by 2040, a majority of college-educated workers are now women and 25% of gen Z identify as LGBTQ+, Glasgow noted.“It’s really hard to imagine that your workplace, your organization or your community could achieve any of its mission if it wasn’t able to teach its people to work across differences,” he said. “That means the skills of diversity and inclusion are here to stay.”Explore more on these topicsDEI policiesUS work & careersUS universitiesRaceGenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It recorded annual gross merchandise sales of about $1bn in 2025 and has been growing rapidly in the US, registering almost 60% year-on-year growth there last year.Peter Semple, Depop’s chief executive, said the deal was “testament to the significant growth we have delivered as we have evolved our product experience”.However, eBay has been struggling in recent times to keep pace with its fast-growing rivals Vinted and Depop, which tend to appeal to younger consumers. Itscrapped fees for UK private sellersof preowned clothing and most other items in 2024 amid growing competition from other platforms, which mostly charge buyers rather than sellers.Its purchase of Depop comes after the trade journal Retail Week reported that Vinted had become thethird-largest fashion retailer in the UK, after Primark and Next.Etsy’s 2021 purchase of Depop came at a time when it was aiming to attract younger consumers and was trying to build a “House of Brands” to fend off competition from other marketplaces, such as Amazon.Selling Depop will allow Etsy to “grow the Etsy marketplace in ways that matter most to our buyers and sellers”, according to the company’s chief executive, Kruti Patel Goyal.The deal has been unanimously approved by the boards of eBay and Etsy and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the year, provided certain conditions are fulfilled and it receives regulatory approval.Shares in eBay rose by 7% on the news, while shares in Etsy soared by more than 15% in after-hours trading following the announcement.Explore more on these topicseBayMergers and acquisitionsE-commerceRetail industryOnline shoppingEuropeConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Bears are looking at a tract of land near Wolf Lake in Hammond, Indiana.“The passage of SB 27 would mark the most meaningful step forward in our stadium planning efforts to date,” the team said in a statement. “We are committed to finishing the remaining site-specific necessary due diligence to support our vision to build a world-class stadium near the Wolf Lake area in Hammond, Indiana.”Republican governor Mike Braun and lawmakers in Indiana have been aggressive in trying to lure the NFL franchise across the state line amid a yearslong effort to build an enclosed stadium inIllinois. The Bears did not mention Illinois in their statement.In the modern NFL, $2.2bn won’t stop the Chicago Bears’ flight to the suburbsRead moreThe Illinois House Revenue and Finance Committee was scheduled to hold a hearing Thursday morning on a bill that would allow the Bears and any other developer of a large enough project to negotiate long-term property tax rates with local taxing bodies. But that got canceled.“Illinois was ready to move this bill forward,” Matt Hill, a spokesman for Illinois governor JB Pritzker posted on X. “After a productive three-hour meeting yesterday, the Bears leaders requested the (Illinois General Assembly) pause the hearing to make further tweaks to the bill. This morning, we were surprised to see a statement lauding Indiana and ignoring Illinois.”The Bears’ focus for a new home had fluctuated between a tract of land they own in Arlington Heights to theChicagolakefront, and then back to the suburb.They have said they plan to pay for the stadium construction on the site of a former racetrack about 30 miles northwest of their longtime home at Soldier Field, though they would need assistance to complete the project.According to a team consultant report released in September, they are seeking $855m in public funding for infrastructure in orderto build a stadium in Arlington Heightsthat could host Final Fours and Super Bowls. The Bears were also hoping the Illinois legislature would pass a bill last October to freeze property taxes for large-scale construction projects such as the stadium that would have allowed them to begin construction in 2025. But that didn’t happen.In September 2022, the Bears unveiled a nearly $5bn plan for Arlington Heights that also called for restaurants, retail and more, when they were finalizing the purchase of that site.Their focus moved toward building a new stadium next to Soldier Field after Kevin Warren was hired as president three years ago to replace the retiring Ted Phillips. The plan to transform Chicago’s Museum Campus got an enthusiastic endorsement from Mayor Brandon Johnson but a tepid reception from Pritzker and state legislators when it was announced in April 2024.Last spring, the team announced it was turning its attention back to Arlington Heights, citing “significant progress” with local leaders.Since moving to Chicago in 1921, the Bears have never owned their stadium, whether playing at Wrigley Field from 1921 to 1970 or Soldier Field since then.Explore more on these topicsChicago BearsChicagoIndianaIllinoisNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

That was really fun. I’ve been looking forward to this for a good few weeks. I was really excited to come here. I felt like it was going to happen today, it was just a matter of how fast I could go. It was really hard that last lap, but I am super happy. It’s nice to have a world record and to say about something I am the best to ever do it. That’s really exciting. And I’ve been working at it for a long time.“The last couple of years I have said I have really wanted it.

While she recovered to win a bronze medal at the world championships in Tokyo in September, it was clear that she was not at her best.But she has started the indoor season in superb form, and having gone through halfway in 55.56sec and through 600m in 1:25.06, she held her form enough to break the world indoor record – which WorldAthleticsnow call the short-track record – by 0.88sec.It is another extraordinary addition to her CV that now includes an Olympic gold and silver, as well as two silvers and a bronze at world championships. Hodgkinson will now target one of the few medals she has not won – at the world indoor championships in Torun in Poland next month.Explore more on these topicsKeely HodgkinsonAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a move for continuity ahead of the likely start in April of what figures to be contentious collective bargaining with team owners.Clark is a former All-Star first baseman who had headed the Major LeagueBaseballPlayers Association (MLBPA) since 2013. He resigned on Tuesday, just months ahead of the expected start of bargaining for a new labor contract. The current deal expires on 1 December.The MLBPA asked Clark to resign after an investigation by outside counsel discovered evidence he had an inappropriate relationship with his sister-in-law, who has been a union employee since 2023, a person familiar with the union’s deliberations told the Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because that detail was not announced. The relationship was uncovered when the union responded to a federal investigation into its finances and governance by hiring an independent lawyer. The lawyer discovered Clark’s relationship with his sister-in-law.“The information that really led to this came out within the last ... 72 hours or so,” Meyer said on Wednesday. “So this is not something that has been kind of sat on. When the information came out, the players on the subcommittee made their feelings known. And Tony, to his credit, he’s always been about the players first and Tony decided to take the action he did in the interest of the players.”Matt Nussbaum was promoted to interim deputy executive director from general counsel to assist Meyer.“Bruce and Matt are talented and experienced and respected by players,” said Scott Boras, an agent for many top stars. “Players trust their leadership to continue to advance to advance the longstanding positions of the MLBPA.”A 64-year-old veteran labor lawyer, Meyer joined the union staff in 2018 and led negotiations through a 99-day lockout that led to a five-year agreement in March 2022. The deal barely avoided what would have been the first loss of regular-season games since 1995. He was promoted to deputy executive director in July 2022. Meyer spent 30 years at Weil, Gotshal & Manges before joining the NHL Players Association in 2016 as senior director of collective bargaining, policy and legal.The start of the annual tour of spring training camps by union officials was pushed back a day and began Wednesday with the Kansas City Royals.“Just on a personal level I think we’re all fairly devastated by things that have happened in the last 48, 72 hours,” Meyer said. “I’m not going to go beyond that in terms of personal feelings, but it’s fair to say that we were all personally upset, concerned about Tony. But I think this was something that the players determined had to happen at this particular point in time.”MLB appears on track to propose a salary cap, which possibly could lead to a work stoppage that causes regular-season games to be canceled for the first time since 1995.“We don’t expect anything to change in terms of bargaining,” Meyer said. “We’ve been preparing for bargaining for years. Players have been preparing. Players know what’s coming. At the end of the day leadership is important and leadership comes and goes, but what remains is the players. At the end of the day, it’s the players who determine the direction of the union. At the end of the day, it’s the players who determine our priorities and bargaining. Those priorities obviously have not changed and will not change.”The union said it will resist a salary cap.“Our position and the historic position of this union for decades on a salary cap is well known,” Meyer said. “It’s the ultimate restriction. It’s something that owners in all the sports have wanted more than anything and in baseball in particular there’s a reason for that, because it’s good for them and not good for players.”Meyer wouldn’t directly address whether the union intends to restrict the hiring of family members.“I think it’s fair to say there are issues that will be addressed,” Meyer said. “There are various issues that will be evaluated, reevaluated with the advice of counsel and, as always, at the direction of players.”Explore more on these topicsMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Skating in a shimmering gold dress to Donna Summer’s MacArthur Park Suite, Liu cleanly landed all seven of her triple jumps, including three in combination, and drew a standing ovation before finishing with 226.79 points overall.‘If there was no one on Earth, I would still skate’: Alysa Liu on her remarkable figure skating comebackRead more“That’s what I’m fucking talking about,” Liu said as she left the ice.

I just thought, ‘I’m going do what I do best, which is enjoy skating’, and that’s what I did today.”But the night belonged to Liu, who skated third-to-last with the rollicking crowd in her thrall. By the time she closed with a graceful layback spin, the 12,000-seat arena was a white-hot wall of sound.

Liu burst on to the scene in 2019 as the youngest ever US national champion at the age of 13. She repeated the feat a year later, then competed at the 2022 Olympics and won bronze at that year’s worlds – before abruptly retiring that same spring, citing fatigue and burnout.She stayed away for nearly two years. But by mid-2023, she was back training in California, with eyes on rediscovering joy in her sport and possibly targeting theseWinter Olympics.Adeliia Petrosian, the three-time Russian champion entered as an individual neutral athlete and a dangerous flier for gold despite entering Thursday in fifth place. She had hopes of a medal due to her planned quadruple toeloop, but clattered to the ice on the potential difference-making jump. The protege of controversial coach Eteri Tutberidze still managed a fifth-best free skate score of 141.64 to finish sixth.“I feel a little ashamed,” Petrosian said, “for myself, for the federation, for my coaches and for the spectators that it went this way. I understand that it’s my own fault.”Liu became the eight US woman to win figure skating’s biggest prize before an audience that included former Olympic champion Tenley Albright, who became the first at the 1956 Cortina d’Ampezzo Games.Explore more on these topicsAlysa LiuFigure skatingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Out-fought and out-thought by their great rivals for much of this contest, the Americans were poised to lose to a team they had thumped 5-0 in the preliminary round only nine days earlier.Quick Guide2026 US Olympic women's hockey teamShowScheduleAll times Eastern.Thu 5 FebUSA 5-1 CzechiaSat 7 FebUSA 5-0 FinlandMon 9 FebSwitzerland 0-5 USATue 10 FebCanada 0-5 USAFri 13 FebQuarter-final: USA 6-0 ItalyMon 16 FebSemi-final: USA 5-0 SwedenThu 19 FebFinal: USA 2-1 Canada (OT)Roster breakdownThe 2026 US Olympic women's ice hockey team features 23 players, 13 forwards, seven defenders and three goaltenders, and boasts 21 returnees from the 2025 US women's national teamthat took home goldat the 2025 IIHF Women's World Championship in April.

I can’t say enough great things about her, and to cap off her Olympic career in this fashion, just so happy for her.”With barely two minutes left on the clock, Knight tipped a long-range shot from Laila Edwards past Ann-Renée Desbiens, the doughty Canadian goaltender, to level the score at 1-1 and send the final into overtime. It was Knight’s 15th Olympic goal, the most for an American woman in history, and it hurled the match into a berserk three-on-three period that was settled by a game-winner from Keller that sparked joy and despair inside the arena in equal measure.Winter Olympics women’s ice hockey final: USA beat Canada 2-1 in overtime to win gold – liveRead moreOdd as it sounds when discussing the most successful nation in Olympic women’s ice hockey history – a country that has appeared in all eight finals – a Canadian victory would have been a notable upset for a squad that has been outclassed by its biggest adversary of late.That 5-0 defeat to the US last week was not only Canada’s worst-ever Olympic loss but the first time they had failed to score in a match at the Winter Games. Canada’s lack of strength in depth during the tournament had stood in contrast with the Americans, who profited from important contributions from each forward line. John Wroblewski’s side outscored opponents 31-1 and found the net at least five times in all six of their prior matches in Italy.The defence wasn’t bad either. Before this game the US had last conceded a goal in their first fixture of these Olympics, a 5-1 victory over Czechia on 5 February. That was the day before the opening ceremony.In the broader context, though, Canada won five of the previous seven finals – including a 3-2 triumph over the Americans in Beijing in 2022 – with the US claiming the other two, in 1998 and 2018. And optimists north of the border might have argued that they were due a win against their old foes, having lost their past seven fixtures against the US - a streak of struggles dating back to the women’s world championship last April.Canada upped their level when it mattered most. They adjusted tactically, defended robustly, fashioned good opportunities and were no doubt inspired by the example set by Marie-Philip Poulin, their talismanic 34-year-old captain. In her fifth Olympics, Poulin missed two group stage games with a knee injury but scored twice in the 2-1 win over Switzerland in the semi-finals, breaking the women’s all-time Olympic record with her 20th goal.The US had a much easier time of it in the last four against Sweden, reaching the gold medal game with a5-0 victory. (Switzerland beat Sweden 2-1 in overtime earlier on Thursday to win bronze.)But the lack of challenge up to this point appeared to be a disadvantage when adversity struck; and perhaps the Americans, less experienced than their opponents, struggled to handle the magnitude of the occasion.The US scored their first against Canada inside four minutes last week, but this was different.Canada out-shot their opponents by six to eight in the opening period, though neither team could find a breakthrough, with the Americans resolutely fending off two power plays – first they had too many players on the ice, then Joy Dunne was penalized for a trip.Canada struck only 54 seconds into the second period with a terrific short-handed goal by Kristin O’Neill, feinting to deceive goalkeeper Aerin Frankel and score from close range after a pass from Laura Stacey. The US were in arrears for the first time in the tournament.Then came promising chances at both ends, with Desbiens called into action and Frankel making a sharp, scampering save to deny Sarah Fillier when she looked set to double the lead. But with Canada resolute and confident, and the US lacking inspiration unless Caroline Harvey had the puck, it remained 1-0 after the second period.The Americans ratcheted up the pressure as the contest reached its climax, and Canada’s Erin Ambrose briefly went off injured after being shoved into the boards by Britta Curl-Salemme. It threatened to be a desperately disappointing night for the Americans that recalled the 2002 final, when Canada ended an eight-game losing streak against the US with a 3-2 win in the gold medal game in Salt Lake City.But a slight deflection from Knight in front of the net, with Frankel pulled off the ice, saved her team.Then came Keller, cutting inside and unleashing a shot from close in that dribbled past Desbiens to ensure Knight’s Olympic career ended in triumph. Wroblewski was moved to tears, and he wasn’t the only one.It was compelling drama – and with the US facing Slovakia and Canada meeting Finland in the men’s semi-finals on Friday, there may be another cross-border clash to come.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsIce hockeyUSA Olympic teamCanada ice hockey teamUSA ice hockey teamUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Just not this one.The 21-year-old American was foiled in his bid for a third gold medal in eight days on Thursday, winning silver in the 1500m in a time of 1:42.75 after lowering the Olympic marksin the 1000mlast Wednesdayand the 500m on Saturdayand threatening to become only the second American to win more than two golds in any sport at a single Winter Games.China’s Ning Zhongyan was the surprise gold medalist, crossing in an Olympic-record time of 1:41.98sec – 0.77sec ahead of Stolz – after seizing the race with early aggression. Kjeld Nuis of the Netherlands, the two-time defending Olympic champion in his final Winter Games, came in 0.84sec off Ning’s pace for the bronze to the delight of another Dutch-heavy crowd.‘An Olympic miracle’: Twist in Conan Doyle’s skimo tale as Russian snares silverRead moreFor the 26-year-old Ning, already a bronze medalist in the men’s 1000m and the team pursuit, it was the first Olympic gold of his career and China’s first speed skating medal of these Olympics.View image in fullscreenZhongyan Ning celebrates as he crosses the line to win gold in the 1500m speed skating.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“When Jordan was skating in the last pair, I still did not think the gold was mine,” Ning said afterwards. “He has been in incredible form all season. Even after he crossed the line, I was still not completely sure. It was only when the result was confirmed that it started to sink in. It is an amazing feeling.”The 1500m in speed skating is known as the race of kings because it sits at the perfect crossroads of the sport’s demands. The race requires the raw pace of a sprinter and the endurance of a distance specialist, ruthlessly exposing any weakness in either facet.Many of the sport’s greatest champions have claimed the 1500m title, making it a proving ground where the most complete skater earns the crown. Only three of the 30 men’s 500m medalists from 1988 through 2022 even skated the 1500m.Dutch skater Joep Wennemars, perhapshard-done in the 1000m, laid down the early marker from the 11th pair with an Olympic-record time of 1:43.05, setting off a wall of noise in the banks of orange-clad supporters.Two heats later, while Stolz calmly made circuits on the inner warm-up lane, Ning lowered that mark with a brilliant display of front-foot skating, putting down second-best early splits of 22.99sec and 47.86sec before taking control at 1100m with a field-best 1:13.80 and never looking back. Nuis, skating head-to-head in the same pair, was fastest after 700m but his early aggression proved costly on the final lap.View image in fullscreenKjeld Nuis leads Zhongyan Ning.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianStolz went off in the final pair, his introduction eliciting deafening roars from a crowd braced for history. What followed was almost conservative. He completed the opening lap ranked fifth at 300m (23.36), where he remained at 700m (48.82), never chasing the blistering early pace set by Ning and Nuis. He closed in 27.60, faster than Ning, and the quickest final lap among the medalists, but it proved too little too late.He circled the oval slowly with his head bowed after his time flashed on the screen while Ning celebrated with his coaches before taking a victory lap wearing the Chinese flag as a cape. Wennemars finished fourth, despite briefly holding the best time in Olympic history, 0.26sec out of the medals.“When I saw Ning’s [time], I thought that was really fast,” Stolz said. “I thought, ‘I can skate that time in Inzell, at the last World Cup.’ But here, that’s a really fast time.“I just didn’t quite have the legs. The beginning part was a little slow. I thought I could maybe get it back, but I was just beginning to die off.View image in fullscreenJordan Stolz traverses a bend and had the quickest final lap among the medalists, but it proved too little too late.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“Ning had the race of his life. I didn’t have one of my best, but I am still happy with silver. I have two golds and I was actually really happy that Ning was able to pull it off. I really like Ning.”Stolz entered the Olympicsbeneath immense expectations, already a seven-time world champion and the favorite here across three individual distances. Had he completed 500-1000-1500 treble – as he did at two of the past three world championships – he would have become the first male speed skater to win three golds at a Games since Norway’s Johann Olav Koss did so at the Lillehammer Olympics in 1994.Stolz’s trajectory since Beijing 2022 has been meteoric. At 17 as an Olympic debutant, he finished 13th in the 500m and 14th in the 1000m. Four years later, he has won two golds and a silver with one last medal chance in Saturday’s mass start.Raised in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, and developed at the Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee, Stolz has concentrated on blade setup, ice density and aerodynamic efficiency in pursuit of what he calls “free speed”. The Milan track – a temporary Olympic venue that has already produced some of the fastest times in Olympic history – has played into that mindset.View image in fullscreenJordan Stolz is consoled by his coach Bob Corby after winning silver.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianNing’s win on Thursday marked the seventh Olympic record of the competition after Francesca Lollobrigida in the women’s 3000m, Norway’s Sander Eitrem in the men’s 5000m, Jutta Leerdam of the Netherlands in the women’s 1000m, Stolz in the 1000m and 500m, and Dutch star Femke Kok in the women’s 500m.“After the BeijingWinter Olympics, the level in speed skating just kept getting higher and higher,” Ning said. “It felt like there was a mountain in front of me, and no matter what I did, I just could not get past it.“But I never stopped believing in myself. I kept telling myself to stay patient, to keep putting in the work, to trust that all the effort would add up one day. Today was that day. Even now, it still feels a little unreal that I was able to do this.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Jordan StolzSpeed skatingWinter OlympicsUS sportsChina Olympic teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Imagine it as snow’s answer to triathlon. Only it’s more chaotic and over in about three minutes. First, the athletes’ power-ski up a steep slope. Then their skis are put in a rucksack as they run up a 40m staircase. After more uphill skiing to the top, they change the binding on their skis and whiz downhill to the finish.Athletes embrace it for its purity and romanticism, as the sport harks back to a different era before ski lifts became the norm. But there was also controversy as, for the first time in these Games, a medal was won by a Russian after Nikita Filippov emerged from the pack to take silver behind Spain’s Oriol Cardona Coll.Filippov, who was competing as a neutral athlete after the International Olympic Committee banned Russian and Belarusian athletes following the invasion of Ukraine, is said to have run away from a bear when he was six. But after winning his medal, he was quick to embrace another – the Russian one – by admitting he wished he had been wearing the colours of his country.View image in fullscreenNikita Filippov, wearing a neutral tracksuit, checks out his silver medal during the ceremony.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images“Of course it is difficult when you see guys from different countries wearing national jackets and boots,” he said. “But the Olympics is my childhood dream. It’s bad, but we should adapt and I hope next year that the Olympics, World Cups and all around the world there will be no neutral athletes and it will be just like in the past.”Naturally the Russian government was quick to celebrate their first medal of the Games, too. The medal was barely on Filippov’s neck when the country’s sports minister, Mikhail Degtyarev, awarded him the title of honoured master of sports of Russia.Filippov is famed for his strength, which he attributes partly to a workout that involves climbing two floors of a multistorey building while carrying two 24kg weights, putting the weights down and then hopping up two more floors. And doing it 25 times. It sounds extreme. But the Australian Lara Hamilton, who came last in her women’s heat, was quick to stress just how much strain skimo puts on the body.“The lungs, the chest, you feel deep burning,” she said. “The quads, the calves. It looks like a leg-dominant sport but there is a lot of pushing with your arms.” Hamilton, who had previously tried to get to the Olympics as a Nordic skier, 5,000m runner and surfer, described her experience as “trial by fire.”Meanwhile, the deep snow also proved to be a hindrance to another Australian, Phillip Bellingham, who had competed as a cross-country skier in three previous Games. “When there’s fresh snow on top, we’re sinking into it,” he said before admitting he was exhausted even before his semi-finals. “And because I’m a heavier guy, it’s more of a disadvantage.”View image in fullscreenAustralia’s Lara Hamilton (far left) says ‘you feel deep burning’ during skimo.Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty ImagesThere were, however, no British racers for a sport that Sir Arnold Lunn described as the “marriage of two great sports, mountaineering and skiing” nearly a century ago.Lunn, who came up with the idea of a slalom race in 1922 and was responsible for getting it and the downhill into the Winter Olympics in 1936, would have loved skimo. Even though he had a 100ft fall doing it in his youth, which left one leg two inches shorter than the other.At least there was a British presence here in the form of Emily Harrop, the favourite in the women’s race. The 28-year-old, who was born in France to English parents, was the British downhill champion as a teenager before switching to representing France. But having led most of the way up the mountain, she lost time on the second and third transitions and had to settle for silver behind Marianne Fatton of Switzerland.Not that she appeared too disappointed. “Our sport is beautiful; there is so much freedom and it’s an amazing way to find your limits – that’s why we love it,” she said. “If you enjoy freedom, if you enjoy the mountains, get into skimo. It’s fun but also hard.”But this day will be remembered for Russia’s silver medal too, which Fillipov’s father, Alexey, attributed to hard work, proper breathing and essential oils to help him relax under pressure.“What happened is an Olympic miracle, an Olympic fairytale, the kind you always want to believe in,” his father said. The Russians in Bormio duly celebrated. But not everyone here was as joyous.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Are those realistic expectations?Pablo Iglesias MaurerThu 19 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 11.17 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIn 1988, a full eight years before Major League Soccer debuted, it got its first “World Cup bump”.Fifa had just awarded the 1994 World Cup to the United States, but there was a stipulation. The US could host the tournament, but only if there was a competitive club league in place by the time it rolled around, something that hadn’t been true since the North American Soccer League collapsed in 1985. Tournament organisers missed that 1994 deadline, but two years later,MLSbecame a reality. Thirty years on, it is still here.MLS was in every way, shape and form a byproduct of that World Cup. Executives lured some of the tournament’s standout players to the league and ensured that many of its 10 teams were stocked with the US national team’s biggest names. It’s no exaggeration to suggest that MLS would not have been created without the tournament, and that it never would’ve survived without the initial excitement created by that World Cup.That particular World Cup bump was transformative, and every four years since, minds all over the American soccer landscape have attempted to capitalize on that very same idea: that the coming World Cup, which drives millions of non-soccer fans and casual viewers to the game, will lead to a surge in interest in MLS.MLS’s calendar flip is coming. Clubs are already planning how to exploit itRead moreWith the tournament coming to the United States this summer for the first time in the league’s history, MLS executives and cheerleaders have taken a particular interest in maximizing the World Cup’s effect. Commissioner Don Garber has frequently suggested the tournament will be a major catalyst in the growth of his league and the game as a whole in the US.“The next decade will redefine what’s possible for MLS and North American soccer,” Garber said in his“state of the league” address, this past December. “As the world turns towards North America, the 2026 World Cup will soon serve as rocket fuel for our entire ecosystem, and it will do so for MLS.”If Garber’s take feels lacking in detail, that’s possibly by design. Though the commissioner has at times suggested that the idea of a World Cup bump is statistically proven – in one interview, hesaidresearch has found a 15-to-20% increase in domestic league interest off the World Cup – many studies have shown otherwise. Oftentimes, whatever marginal bump any given league has gotten off the back of any given tournament is impossible to divorce from other variables such as preexisting growth, planned expansion and increased investment.It’s a question worth asking ahead of what’s been called the most pivotal moment in the history of American men’s soccer: is the World Cup bump even real?Few are more familiar with the phenomenon of the World Cup bump than University of Michigan professor Stefan Szymanski, who co-authored Soccernomics with British journalist Simon Kuper. The 2009 book, which has become a bit of a bible in its field, seems to get reprinted every World Cup, receiving a far more defined bump than any particular league.In 2020, Szymanskii published the result of his research on the effects of a major tournament on a country’s domestic league attendance, focusing on the World Cup and Euros from 1966 onwards. The research was exhaustive and detailed, and in the end did little to identify any conclusive truths surrounding the tournament’s effect.“[The data] varied significantly,” Szymanski told the Guardian. “Generally speaking the league attendance in host countries was already on an upward trajectory around the time when the international championship was hosted, and then there were different narratives.“There was a ‘step jump’ of sorts around the date of the event, which was true in various tournaments, and then an upward trend that was continuous across all seasons in other tournaments. Or one that starts around the time of the event. In several instances there was just a short-term spike.”View image in fullscreenMLS debuted two years after the US hosted the World Cup in 1994.Photograph: AI Project/Action Images/ReutersOther tournaments, such as the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and the 1984 Euros in France, had no effect whatsoever on league attendance. Some, such as the 2012 Euros in Poland and Ukraine and the 1990 World Cup in Italy, saw adecreasein post-tournament attendance.“Generally speaking there is some observable trend which is not guaranteed, but possible in many cases,” said Szymanski. “And then the obvious question here is, what should we expect in the case of MLS?”Garber and others are careful to frame a potential World Cup bump as being a boost in “relevance”, a nebulous metric open to interpretation. Focusing on attendance alone and leaving aside other factors, World Cups have generally proven positive for MLS. On average, attendance in the year after a World Cup has risen 9% throughout league history. In some cases, such as the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, the number remained more or less flat. In others it skyrocketed, as it did after the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.The issue with using total or even average attendance as a barometer for the bump is the ever-changing nature of MLS itself. 2007 was not just the year after a World Cup in MLS. It was the yearDavid Beckham arrivedand fundamentally changed the league, and the year Toronto FC, a well-supported expansion franchise, debuted. 2011 saw the addition of the Vancouver Whitecaps and Portland Timbers, two of the most historically well-supported teams.Relevancefeels much harder to measure than attendance, but league executives say they are focused on two specific metrics: brand interest and viewership, both in-person and via the league’s broadcast partners.“We have a sense of what we believe – with zero marketing investment – what we think the World Cup would do for us along those two metrics,” MLS chief marketing officer Radhika Duggal told the Guardian. “You have a baseline, and then you say ‘I’m going to do these eight things – my campaign is made up of these eight things, and we believe they will take our two metrics, for which we have quantifiable goals, and take them from the baseline to twice the baseline or whatever it is.”MLS last week rolled out its 2026 advertising campaign, a year-long effort that Duggal describes as being a “fully unified” approach across the league and its clubs. For the first time in the league’s history, Duggal said, most of MLS’s clubs are working with the league on specific marketing campaigns, and the league is supplementing those campaigns with in-market events before, during and after the World Cup. The league and its clubs are reportedly making an eight-figure investment into marketing efforts this year, the largest marketing spend in league history.“What we want consumers to really understand about us is that we arefun. It is super simple and super clear. The secondary thing we want consumers to understand about us is that we are welcoming. Anyone is welcome to experience us. That’s it. Those are two really simple messages.”“The one thing that we’re trying to do [with all of this],” added Duggal, “the calls to action we’re really focused on are ‘watch our matches’. It will be all about viewership and all about butts in seats at our stadiums, so that people can give us a try.”Some 50 to 60 MLS players –Lionel Messiamong them – will take part in the World Cup, which seems sure to give the league at least a short-term boost in brand awareness. It also feels certain enough that some fans, especially casuals, may turn to MLS after the World Cup ends in search of more soccer, whether they do so in person or on a screen.“My feeling is that it’s going to be a bit of a mess,” says Szymanski. “In some ways they’re already more or less at capacity or close to capacity [in stadiums]. And the other thing is that they just don’t have a television audience to sort of build and maintain momentum. In some ways what MLS needs is not more people going to games. What they need is more people watching it on TV.”MLS is in the fourth season of its $2.5bn media rights partnership with Apple TV, which airs all of the league’s matches. The league has tweaked its strategy with Apple this season,doing away with “MLS Season Pass”, the standalone subscription viewers needed to watch many MLS games on Apple TV. Despite this, nearly all of the league’s matches remain behind a paywall and are largely unavailable on linear television.View image in fullscreenOn average, MLS attendance in the year after a World Cup has risen 9% throughout league history.Photograph: Icon Sports Wire/Corbis/Getty ImagesTimes have changed, of course, and many consumers won’t even turn to traditional TV to begin with. Apple’s streaming platform is massive, with an estimated 45 million subscribers worldwide as of 2025, giving the league ample opportunity to expose its product to the uninitiated.And while the quality of play in MLS has grown exponentially in the last decade or so, there will likely still be a large drop-off between what a viewer sees at the World Cup and what they’ll see when they tune in to watch Colorado Rapids v Houston Dynamo on a Wednesday night.“That’s the big question,” says Szymanski. “Will this generate new television audiences? I doubt it because the quality of play is so low. If you had the World Cup in England now, with the Premier League, that’s comparable quality. If you had it in Spain or France or a lot of the other [more traditional footballing] countries, that would be true as well. It’s not necessarily true in a place like the United States.”The history of American soccer is full of tentpole events leagues and decision-makers have identified as catalysts for explosive growth. And while MLS’s own history is dotted with significant events that pushed it along – the arrivals of Beckham or Messi, for example – its own trajectory towards stability and success has been much more tempered and gradual.The language the league uses to talk about the World Cup has softened in recent weeks. In a conversation withSports Business Journalthis week, Garber seemed, for once, to forget the rocket fuel. Whether he intended to or not, his remarks seemed to temper some of the hyperbole league officials have employed for years now.The five most noteworthy MLS kits of 2026: Tie-dye, Tina Turner and moreRead more“I don’t think that the energy behind investing in this sport, at all levels, has been driven by the World Cup,” Garber said. “The World Cup gives us something to rally around and a great moment of truth, which will break through lots of different things going on in our country. But MLS would’ve continued to grow without the World Cup, and will continue to grow after the World Cup. We will continue our focus on player development, investing in facilities, growing a fanbase, ensuring that our teams are embedded in their community and that players view us as a league of choice.”After the World Cup, league executives won’t have to look far to find the next big event they can circle. The 2028 Summer Olympics will be in Los Angeles, and the United States will co-host the women’s World Cup three years later.Neither of those events feels like rocket fuel, so to speak, and in many ways the 2026 World Cup doesn’t either. MLS very badly needed its initial World Cup bump, which quite literally birthed it into existence. Three decades later, it could still use a boost in notoriety and quality.This summer’s World Cup may help, but it feels increasingly unlikely it will fundamentally change the trajectory of the league in any truly significant way.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a junior, I did some play-by-play for WKCR, the student-run radio station. There was a time long ago when I went to almost every Lions home game. I’m talking about the men. There wasn’t a women’s basketball team until 1984. For the past few decades, I’ve watched the men play once a year.When I enrolled at Columbia in September 1963, the Lions’ home games were played in University Hall – an antiquated gym with structural columns that impeded fans’ views and looked as though it had been built during the Age of Pericles. Columbia had suffered through six straight losing seasons. Two more followed.The Lions’ fortunes turned during the 1965-66 campaign. Led by 7ft Dave Newmark, the team posted an 18-6 record. The future looked bright. Then Newmark put his hand through a window in a freak dormitory accident and missed the entire 1966-67 season. Without him, the team went 11-14. Still, hopes were high. Freshmen were ineligible for varsity play in those years, but Columbia’s freshman team was led by Jim McMillian and Heyward Dotson, two of the best players ever to wear a Lions uniform. Three glorious seasons followed.Newmark was back for the 1967-68 campaign. McMillian turned out to be the greatest player in Columbia basketball history, and Dotson was superb. After three early-season losses, the Lions caught fire in December, beating West Virginia, Louisville (the No 2 team in the country) and St John’s in consecutive games to win the Holiday Festival tournament at Madison Square Garden. Those began a 16-game winning streak that culminated in an Ivy League championship and an appearance in the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16. At one point, the Lions were ranked No 6 in the nation. It’s unlikely that an Ivy League basketball team will ever be ranked that high again.McMillian’s departure from Columbia was followed by a series of losing campaigns. The Lions have completed only five winning seasons in the past 42 years. 1968 remains the last time the Columbia men’s basketball team was in the NCAA Tournament. In the five seasons preceding this one, the Lions had an Ivy League record of nine wins and 61 losses.Meanwhile, the Columbia women’s basketball team have been flourishing. The Columbia women had 28 losing seasons in the 29 years ending with the 2015-16 campaign. Enter Megan Griffith, who was named head coach in March 2016.Griffin graduated from Columbia in 2007. As a player, she averaged 10.1 points per game over the course of four seasons, captained the Lions for three years, and earned All-Ivy honors twice. But the team won just 38 games and lost 70. She then played basketball overseas and spent four years at Princeton as the recruiting coordinator and an assistant coach for the women’s team. She’s now 40 and has the bearing of the athlete she once was.“I thought about coaching men when I was at Princeton,” Griffith says. “I asked the men’s coach if he would ever hire me. And he said, ‘Absolutely! You’d be great with the mothers.’”That wasn’t precisely the answer that Griffith had been looking for. Would she coach men now?“Probably not,” she says.Griffith rebuilt the Columbia women’s program from the ground up. It wasn’t easy. Her first victory over an Ivy League team as head coach was a 91-88 quadruple-overtime triumph over Dartmouth on 27 January 2017. It took time to recruit good players and create a winning culture. But the results speak for themselves.In the four seasons preceding this one, the Columbia women had a regular-season Ivy League record of 50-6, and an overall ledger of 100-27. Griffith is the winningest coach in Columbia women’s basketball history and has been the Ivy League women’s basketball coach of the year in each of past three seasons. Her teams have beaten opponents from the Big Ten, Big East and Atlantic Coast conferences and have tied for or won the regular-season Ivy League title in each of the past three seasons. They have yet to win the league’s postseason tournament but were invited to the NCAA Tournament in each of the past two seasons. Putting icing on the cake, last March, Columbia upset Washington 63-60 to score their first-ever NCAA Tournament victory and send the Huskies home from the dance.Griffith knows how to teach fundamentals and motivate her players to get the most out of them. Coaches can spend hours expounding on their role, but Griffith says simply, “I see coaching as teaching and impacting positive change on lives. The players learn accountability, resilience, and how to do hard things together. Other than that, the game is as simple or as complicated as you want it to be.”Recruiting is a neverending task. Griffith calls it “the hardest part of my job”.The most talented high school seniors gravitate toward big-time basketball schools. The Ivy League doesn’t allow for revenue sharing with players. And even if it did, there wouldn’t be much revenue to share. The league does allow players to monetize their name, image and likeness, but there are no athletic scholarships. Moreover, a talented player may want to come to Columbia, only to be rejected by the admissions office.The core of Griffith’s recruiting pitch is: “Come to Columbia. You’ll be getting a great education in the best city in the world. It will be a transformative experience for you.”She could add, “We now play winning basketball.”That brings us to this year’s Columbia women’s team. The Lions have struggled at times. “In the last two years, I had the best basketball player [Abbey Hsu] and best leader [Kitty Henderson] I’ve ever coached,” Griffith says. “And both of them graduated. That’s hard to replace.”The Lions also played a challenging early-season schedule that included an 80-63 loss to nationally ranked North Carolina.Sometimes everything has seemed to go right for Columbia, as it did in an 89-32 drubbing of Dartmouth and a 73-67 upset victory on the road against 19th-ranked Princeton. But there have been times when everything seemed to go wrong, as was the case with upset losses to Cornell and Penn.“Those two losses showed us the maturity that we’re lacking as a team,” Griffith says. “Cornell and Penn played well. But if you’re an emotionally mature team like I think we’re becoming, you don’t lose those games. It taught us a lot.”View image in fullscreenThe victorious scene in the Lions’ locker room after Columbia upset Washington 63-61 in last year’s NCAA Tournament.Photograph: Joshua Wang/Photo courtesy of Columbia UniversityColumbia evened accounts with Cornell with an 80-55 road victory in Ithaca on 7 February. That gave the Lions a 6-2 Ivy League record, good for a second-place tie with Harvard, one game behind Princeton. This past weekend was pivotal, with back-to-back home games against Princeton and Penn. Princeton would be looking for revenge against the Lions on Friday night. One night later, Columbia would seek the same against Penn.Like many sports fans, I’ve followedGeno Auriemma’s accomplishments at UConnand took note when Caitlin Clark set the basketball world ablaze. I watch a handful of NCAA women’s tournament games on television each year and am familiar with names such as Dawn Staley, Kim Mulkey and Chris Dailey. But I’d never been to a women’s college basketball game. I decided to go to the Princeton and Penn games last weekend.Columbia’s main campus stretches from 114th to 120th Streets between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue and looks remarkably similar to how it did a half-century ago. There’s an aura of classical elegance. Fourteen massive columns rise to the facade of Butler Library where eight names are chiseled in stone: “Homer. Herodotus. Sophocles. Plato. Aristotle. Demosthenes. Cicero. Virgil.” Low Library is equally inspiring with a facade that tells of Columbia’s founding as King’s College in 1754.Levien Gymnasium, which opened in 1974, seats 2,700 fans for basketball. In Griffith’s first year as coach, the women averaged 627 fans per game and the men 1,625. Last season, the women averaged 1,602, reaching 2,307 for the season finale against Cornell that clinched the Ivy League regular-season title for Columbia.Before going to the games, I talked with Dave Kindred, the octogenarian sportswriter who has won enough sports journalism awards to hang a plaque on every wall in his home. In 2010, when his sportswriting days on the national stage came to an end, Kindred went to a high school basketball game to see the daughter of friends play. Before long, he was hooked. In 2023, My Home Team: A Sportswriter’s Life and the Redemptive Power of Small-Town Girls Basketball – possibly the best book ever written about women’s basketball – was published.“I saw a thousand men’s basketball games before I started watching the women,” Kindred told me. “And now, I actually like watching the women more. The basics are the same. The women know how to play. Their competitiveness and the desire to win are just as strong as with the men. They dive for loose balls with the same ferocity as the men. But the women play more of a team game“The men do things that the women can’t do,” Kindred continued. “They jump higher and run faster. The men play a vertical game. The women play a horizontal game. The men play in the air. The women play on the floor. The men can create plays by themselves. The women, except for a few superstars, need help. So what happens is, the women compensate by helping each other. They make three passes to get to the same point on the floor that a man gets to on his own. In a way, the women now play like the men used to play when I was young.”Those words rang true as I watched the Lions play on Friday and Saturday night.Columbia’s most complete player this season has been junior guard Riley Weiss – a five-time Ivy League player of the week who also leads the league in scoring with 19.7 points per game. Susie Rafiu and Perri Page are major contributors and the only seniors on the squad. Junior Fliss Henderson is the Lions’ leading rebounder. Like their teammates, these are formidable athletes – well-conditioned, fast and strong. And they understand technical intricacies of the game that most fans don’t even know exist.There was a sense of anticipation as tip-off for Columbia v Princeton neared on Friday. The betting spread favored Princeton by 4.5 points.The game started poorly for Columbia. The Lions’ shots weren’t falling. Rafiu picked up two fouls in less than seven minutes. Princeton led 20-11 after the first quarter and stretched their lead to 29-18. The margin narrowed to 31-25 at the half but Columbia were lucky to be that close. The Lions had shot a dismal 10-for-28 from the field. The Princeton defense had smothered Weiss, who was 1-for-7 from the floor. Ten points, five rebounds and stellar defense from Page had kept Columbia in the game.Then everything changed. Basketball is a game where the better team can beat the better players. Columbia began playing well as a team at both ends of the court. Weiss got hot, finishing the contest with 23 points on 7-for-9 shooting in the second half. Page had a career-high 25 points and dominated the boards in tandem with Henderson. Columbia outscored Princeton 22-10 in the third quarter. The fourth quarter brought the same. The crowd of 2,014 stood and roared its approval during the closing seconds. Final score: Columbia 70-56 Princeton.Saturday night was more of the same. Griffith had to keep the team focused. The Princeton game was in the past. This was Penn. But the Lions started with a vengeance, playing suffocating defense and opening a 27-7 lead midway through the second quarter. Columbia were doing most things right. And Penn were doing most things wrong. The Lions’ intensity faded as the game went on. “Second half, we were not very good,” Griffith acknowledged afterward. But they were good enough for a 69-56 victory.Columbia and Princeton (8-2) are tied for first place in the Ivy League, with Harvard and Brown a game behind at 7-3. Each team have four regular-season games to play and are all but certain to qualify for the four-team postseason tournament that will decide who gets the Ivy League’s automatic qualifying bid to the NCAA Tournament. Should the Lions fall short in the Ivy tournament, an “at large” bid to participate in the NCAA Tournament will still be possible.Beyond that, the future looks bright. Griffith says the freshman class that will enter Columbia this fall is “the best recruiting class we’ve ever had” with blue-chip prospects coming from California, England and Australia. Equally important, $8m out of a recent $10m gift from Jonathan and Jeannie Lavine to Columbia’s basketball program has been earmarked for the women. “That,” Griffith notes, “gives us long-term financial stability for the first time.”Griffith takes pride in the fact that, in all her years as head coach, not a single Columbia player has transferred to another Division I school. It speaks to the loyalty she inspires and the culture that she has created. She has built a good program, not just a good team. But there’s a question that has to be asked.Griffith is an exceptionally good coach. It’s inevitable that she’ll receive lucrative offers from big-time colleges. Will there come a time when she leaves Columbia?“I love change,” Griffith answers. “But I have a strong sense of pride in Columbia. I’ve grown up here. I’m a Columbia alumna in addition to coaching here. I love it that, every year, we have changed so much. And I haven’t accomplished everything that I want to do here. The job isn’t done yet.”Thomas Hauser’s email address isthomashauserwriter@gmail.com. The audio version of his memoir –My Mother And Me– was recently released. The reading is by Hauser’s good friend, Jim Lampley.In 2019, Hauser was selected for boxing’s highest honor – induction into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballColumbia UniversityCollege sportsUS sportsNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At least, it was until they travelled toa wet and windy Molineuxto play a match the Premier League surreptitiously slipped into the schedule like a worm tablet hidden in a dog’s dinner. In Wolves, Mikel Arteta’s side were facing a team who are not only the worst in the top flight by some distance, but one who have only recently begun battling to avoid going down as the most awful of all time. Having taken a two-goal lead, the only logical question centred around how many more Arsenal would spank past their hapless hosts. Instead, logic gave way to the objective hilarity of a collective on and off-field meltdown as the Gunners managed to turn what should have been a stroll into an inexplicable 2-2 draw.No stranger to defending the indefensible, even their head coach was unable to come up with any excuses for his side’s quite extraordinary capitulation to the Premier League’s bottom-dwellers. “I think any question, any criticism, any opinion, you have to take on the chin today,” said Mikel Arteta on the back of a draw it would be fair to say even the most measured and well-adjustedArsenalfans everywhere are viewing as two points dropped rather than a precious one gained. “That’s it. Any bullet, take it because we didn’t perform at the level that is required. So anything that anybody says can be right, because we didn’t do what we had to do.”And how! Having gone two goals up, Arteta’s side decided to belt up, button their braces and Arsenal their way to full-time by passing the ball sideways and backwards while wasting as much time as possible, an approach that was working just fine until Wolves went and scored. Apparently paralysed by the fear and anxiety emanating from their tightly wound micro-manager on the touchline, Arteta’s players went on to concede a late, late equaliser following a comical mix-up between David Raya and Gabriel Magalhães that unleashed a tidal wave of Gooner rage and gleeful “it’s happening again” memes.Either fairly or unfairly, Arsenal have a reputation as Premier League bottlers after finishing runners-up for the past three campaigns. In order to improve their chances of success this time around, they spent a fortune to bolster an already decent squad whose questionable mental fortitude was seen as the only perceived obstacle to them finally crawling over the line. Arsenal don’t just drop points, they perform elaborate, theatrical acts of self-sabotage that belong in a Victorian melodrama. Arteta and his players aren’t just “bottling it”, they are artisanal glassblowers, meticulously crafting the very vessel that may soon contain their own tears. They could still finish the season as champions, of course, but if last night’s performance is anything to go by, a sporting choke for the ages looks more on the cards.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEBigger Vase is back!

By the end, the yellow and navy stronghold had emptied and the Forest fans present savoured every moment. “Can we play you every week?” they sang, and then: “Where’s your famous atmosphere?”Evangelos Marinakis’s grand ambition at the outset of this season, before moving on to his fourth manager since August, was to win this competition across the Bosphorus at Besiktas in May and, for all of the chaos and valid criticism, on this evidence it is very much an achievable aim. Forest are in a position of power beforeFenerbahcevisit for the second leg next Thursday.Fenerbahce v Nottingham Forest: Europa League playoff, first leg – liveRead moreFor Pereira, who shared beers with Wolves supporters during happier times last season, it was a flask of ginger-infused tea post-match here. The Portuguese tapped his temples as he stressed the overarching factor he felt propelled Forest to victory.“When I analysed the squad, I accepted the job because I believe in the quality of the players,” he said. “I believe in the club, the president and the supporters. This is about confidence. The difference is the way they started the game. This is mental. It is what I asked them, that mentally they must be ready to face a team in this stadium with the passion of their supporters. We needed to send a message to them from the first minute.”Murillo is the buccaneering Brazilian centre-back with a penchant for shooting from distance and his fourth Forest goal and second this season opened the scoring in style. Igor Jesus headed in from a corner routine at the end of the first half and Morgan Gibbs-White capped the scoring on 50 minutes.By that point Forest should have led by a bigger margin. Midway through the second half Pereira had the luxury of being able to withdraw Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson, presumably with the bigger picture and Liverpool’s visit to the City Ground on Sunday in mind.View image in fullscreenVítor Pereira is off to a winning start.Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/ReutersPereira counts Fenerbahce among his 13 previous clubs but while this iteration are hunting a 29th Turkish league title, on the night they laboured and their experienced spine creaked, unable to cope with Forest’s zeal. Fenerbahce have never progressed from a major European tie when they have lost the first leg, going out on all 26 occasions, not that Pereira is getting carried away.“It was a good result but it is half-time and I know very well that Fener will be very tough in the second game,” the Forest head coach said. “We need to prepare mentally to face this team.”At first glance Murillo, back after missing Forest’s previous two matches, is an unlikely goalscorer but that would be to diminish the defender’s appetite to contribute at the other end of the pitch. He set the tone in his second Forest game, picking the ball up in the centre circle at Crystal Palace, whizzing past four opponents and hitting a stinging strike at opposition goalkeeper Sam Johnstone from the edge of the box.His only other goal this season, the opener at Anfield in Forest’s 3-0 win over Liverpool, was a significant occasion and a smart touch and finish, but this was in a different class. Murillo seized the ball just inside the Fenerbahce half and, blinkers on, set off with one thing in his mind. He brushed off N’Golo Kanté and then Jayden Oosterwolde, powering towards the edge of the box where his diagonal left-foot strike flew into the bottom corner of Ederson’s goal, via Milan Skriniar’s left boot. Domenico Tedesco, the Fenerbahce head coach who had lost only three matches since taking charge last September, shook his head in disbelief but more pain ensued.View image in fullscreenMurillo celebrates his goal in the first half to put Nottingham Forest ahead.Photograph: Raddad Jebarah/ShutterstockIgor Jesus doubled Forest’s lead from a well-worked corner approaching the interval. Forest had run through corners and free-kicks during the pre-match warmup: practice makes perfect?Gibbs-White did brilliantly at the front post to flick Anderson’s delivery towards the back post, where Igor Jesus leapt above Mert Muldur to head in.Tedesco threw off his jacket after half an hour and was booked for raging at the Swiss referee, Sandro Schärer, for not giving a first-half penalty against Murillo for handball. Talisca’s first-time effort cannoned against his left arm but it would have been extremely harsh.The heat only heightened after the restart when Gibbs-White put Forest in dreamland. Omari Hutchinson scooped the ball into Igor Jesus, played onside by Nelson Semedo, and the striker spied Gibbs-White in his peripheral vision. Gibbs-White, off balance, nudged the ball through the legs of Ederson.Gibbs-White celebrated as he usually does, putting his fingers to his ears. Forest had killed the game – and potentially the tie – inside 50 memorable minutes and emphatically muted Fenerbahce. Now the only sound was the sarcasticolésfrom the travelling support.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueFenerbahceNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Prestianni has denied racist abuse and Benfica have said he was a “victim” of a “smear campaign”. The Argentinian faces a 10-game ban if found guilty by Uefa.Mourinho accused of gaslighting for response to Vinícius’ allegation of racismRead moreBenfica’s manager, José Mourinho, appeared to suggest Vinícius had been provocative with his “stupid” goal celebration. Rosenior refused to comment on Mourinho’s views, citing the current investigation, but believes the Brazil forward “was upset for a reason”.“Any form of racism in society, let alone football, is unacceptable,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “What I would say is when you see a player upset, how Vinícius Júnior was upset, normally they’re upset for a reason.“II cannot speak about an incident where an investigation is ongoing. I won’t speak about that incident. ’ve been racially abused myself. I know people who have been racially abused. What people have to understand is when you are judged for something that you should be proud of, it is the worst feeling you can ever possibly imagine. There are historical things to racism. I need to, as manager of this unbelievable football club, make my statement on it. If any player or any coach or any manager is ever found guilty of racism, they shouldn’t be in the game. It’s as simple as that for me.”Asked what he had made of Mourinho’s comments, Rosenior said: “Again, it’s context. What I would say is regardless how a player celebrates, race should never come into it. That is an ongoing investigation. I don’t know the context of the situation. I don’t know the context in which José said what he said, and I won’t make a judgment on it. It’s the same thing. I won’t make a judgment until you get the facts.”Rosenior, who revealed it was his decision to tell Chelsea’s players to “get some sun” this week after an unrelenting schedule this season before they face Burnley on Saturday, blamed growing divisions in modern society on certain sections of the media “who make prejudgments on people”.“There are a lot of things that need to change in our society,” he said. “I’m not talking about football. There’s a lot of division. There’s a lot of people in the media who make prejudgments on people or how they behave or who they are based on a sexual orientation, what country they come from, what religion they are, what colour of skin they have.“It sickens me, to be honest. I think it’s a wider debate than just football. I think people need to be held a lot more accountable than they are at the moment in terms of social media, in terms of the press, to make sure that these things are stamped out, because everybody should be judged equally based on the content of the character.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaLiam RoseniornewsShareReuse this content"

Fans decided Kasper Schmeichel’s failure to keep out Jamie Leweling’s 57th-minute shot was a blunder too far. Schmeichel’s subsequent touches were jeered, albeit there was nothing he could do about the goal from Tiago Tomás in stoppage time that added gloss to Stuttgart’s position. The second leg feels like a fixture O’Neill could very much do without, coming days before a crucial visit to Ibrox.Nottingham Forest dominate Fenerbahce to give Vítor Pereira perfect startRead more“It is going to be very, very difficult obviously,” said O’Neill. “In time, Celtic will be able to compete deep into European competitions. It is just not there at this minute. This was a disappointing night for us.”O’Neill claimed he was unaware of Schmeichel’s treatment from the stands. “This is a team game and we all have to deal with it,” said the manager.View image in fullscreenMartin O’Neill had a bad night in his 1,00th match as a manager.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersThe evening had opened in unedifying style for Celtic. It was barely to improve. Only seconds after kick-off, supporters threw tennis balls on the pitch as a means of expressing dissatisfaction with the club’s board of directors. “Anybody who thinks that was a good idea needs their head examining,” said O’Neill. “It helps no one.” The protest felt half-hearted yet Uefa are likely to take a dim view of a delay in play that lasted for three minutes. One of umpteen fascinating aspects of this strangest of Celtic campaigns involves the split between supporter base and boardroom. This is a fractured club, held together where it possibly can be by a 73-year-old manager.O’Neill had done nothing to sugarcoat the scale of Celtic’s task, branding the Stuttgart games the toughest of the season for his team. This was hardly a bold call; the fourth-placed side in the Bundesliga were facing one who squeezed past Dundee, Livingston and Kilmarnock in recent matches. Should they be sufficiently motivated, Stuttgart should rank among theEuropa Leaguefavourites.With this in mind, the Germans barely needed the favours provided by Schmeichel. Celtic’s goalkeeping position has been a problem for months, with Schmeichel’s regular gaffes emphasising why he should have been replaced last summer. In the Dane’s first ragged episode of the evening, he floated a kick into Stuttgart possession before diving over what was a tame shot from Bilal El Khannouss. Deniz Undav is due credit for a cute flick into El Khannouss’ path but the goal was the doing of Schmeichel. O’Neill has a serious call to make over whether to retain faith in his custodian. This feels a miserable way for the 39-year-old’s career to wind down.Stuttgart decided to get in on the act of defensive generosity as the hosts equalised. Dangerous play between the goalkeeper Alexander Nubel and Atakan Karazor resulted in the latter taking a poor touch on his 18-yard line. Benjamin Nygren stole in, rounding Nubel before slotting home. Parity was the least Celtic deserved for their play in the game’s opening quarter.Nygren’s intervention stung Stuttgart into action. El Khannouss was the scorer as the visitors edged in front for a second time. Celtic were again slack by leaving the forward in splendid isolation as he headed Angelo Stiller’s deflected cross. Schmeichel was beaten at his near post. Stuttgart finished the first period firmly in the ascendancy without troubling Schmeichel.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Nygren gave Celtic some early hope by equalising in the 21st minute.Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/UEFA/Getty ImagesCeltic had shown elements of second half promise prior to the goal which surely settled the tie in Stuttgart’s favour. Schmeichel was again culpable, having misread a 20-yard shot from Leweling which was fierce but not particularly well placed. The anger of the Celtic support towards Schmeichel was now apparent. Stuttgart were only denied a rapid fourth by the interventions of the video assistant referee due to offside in the buildup to the excellent Ermedin Demirovic flicking over the advancing Schmeichel.Nubel saved excellently from Nygren as Celtic sought to claw their way back into proceedings. To their credit, in the face of such superior opposition, Celtic were refusing to wilt. The problem was, hope filled the air when Celtic attacked versus expectancy when Stuttgart did likewise.Tomás had already come close by the time he capitalised on more Celtic chaos to notch number four. Celtic have never won a competitive game in Germany. “We won’t make the mistake of thinking we are through,” said Stuttgart’s head coach, Sebastian Hoeness. Game number 1,002 could be grisly for O’Neill.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueCelticStuttgartmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But it has put the brakes on its plans after concerns were raised by a significant number of clubs, fan groups and players.Women’s FA Cup to have seeded teams and no draw after last 32 under radical proposalsRead moreThe FA had hoped to put a submission to its board in April after a period of consultation in February and March, in order for changes to be ratified for next season, but it has extended the discussions to give clubs, fans and stakeholders more time to consider the options.Next season’s FA Cup will proceed with the existing format and the earliest any revamp could be enforced would be for 2027-28. It is understood the ideas, including seeding four sides so they could not meet before the semi-finals, have not been abandoned but there is widespread agreement that more time needs to be taken to review the options.An FA spokesperson said: “While we will continue to review the Adobe Women’s FA Cup and the ways it can evolve, we have listened to the feedback and no changes will be implemented for the 2026-27 season.“We understand how much the competition means to clubs, players and fans across the pyramid, and it is important that all parties have enough time to share their views. As a result, we will be extending the consultation phase to allow for further engagement informed by the questions and comments raised.”Fans had been quick to condemn the idea of seeding teams after the Guardian revealed on 3 February that the proposals had been sent to participating clubs. A spokesperson for the Football Supporters’ Association said seeding was “something which fans feel goes against the traditions of the FA Cup”, and some clubs’ official supporter groups voiced concerns.The supporters’ club of Manchester City Women, one of the teams who would have been seeded, said: “We feel it goes against the very ethos of what the FA Cup represents. The whole idea of being able to draw anyone, home or away, throughout the entire competition, gives it a unique magic that supporters of all clubs appreciate and embrace.”This season’s fifth round begins on Saturday, with the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, fourth-tier Chatham Town travelling to St Andrew’s to face second division Birmingham City.Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupWomen's footballThe FAnewsShareReuse this content"

If shared equally it would amount to about £50,000 for every top-flight club in the world but, more than seven months after the Club World Cup’s conclusion, there is no sign of the money and no timescale for its distribution. The Guardian understandsFifais yet to determine how the money will be allocated.Champions League review: Bodø shock again, PSG escape and Mourinho’s dismal commentsRead moreThere is no suggestion that the windfall will go unpaid but clubs in smaller leagues are growing particularly impatient. The £740m set aside as prize money is understood to have been released;the winners, Chelsea, are thought to have earned about £84m. In comparison the solidarity sum may seem a drop in the ocean but the cash injection would make a significant difference to those in less glamorous settings.An executive from one of Europe’s smaller leagues told the Guardian there had been no clear answers about when their clubs will be paid despite continued inquiries. In environments where domestic television rights deals are increasingly precarious, and in certain cases nonexistent, a five-figure windfall has the potential to be a lifeline.Numerous clubs, including some on other continents, have painted a similar picture. In Europe there is a perception that Fifa has dragged its feet on reaching a final formula for the payments’ distribution. On some occasions Fifa is believed to have postponed meetings on the topic. Fifa has been in dialogue for several months with the powerful European Football Clubs body, which reached an agreement last year for about 13% of Club World Cup revenue to be reserved for solidarity payments. In some quarters there is sympathy for Fifa, acknowledging the complexity and political sensitivity of the task.One sticking point is that no formula has been determined for dividing the £185m between the six confederations, who were represented at the Club World Cup to wildly differing extents. In practice, clubs are highly unlikely to receive identical amounts. Additionally, most confederations do not have a mechanism for distributing such payments. Uefa has experience of handing out solidarity funds to clubs that do not qualify for the league phase of European club competitions and is likely to employ a similar formula when the final sums are known.Fifa sources said they were in regular discussions with the confederations and clubs about how the money will be distributed, and that they wanted all stakeholders to benefit from what they regard as successful tournament.A source from the Union of European Clubs (UEC), which represents more than 140 non-elite clubs around Europe, said none of its members had received any information about when payments might be received. “UEC as an organisation has not heard anything and no member clubs we have consulted with have heard anything either,” they said.The last-minute nature of Fifa’s funding deal for the Club World Cup is unlikely to have helped the process to run quickly. It was only in March, three months before the tournament, that the prize money and solidarity pots were agreed. That followed the £787m agreementwith the Saudi-backed streaming platform Dazn, reached in December 2024, to air all the competition’s games free of charge.Fifa was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFifaFootball politicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupFinancesnewsShareReuse this content"

That significant landmark for the club was fittingly accompanied by a special goal from Park, whose curling strike completed a 5-0 aggregate victory and boosted her chances of starting for England in March.Controversial Women’s FA Cup plans on hold after pushback from clubs, players and fansRead more“She genuinely is an incredible footballer,” said Skinner. “Jess just excites me, she excites the team, she excites the fans. As soon as it leaves her foot, you know it’s in. As soon as you know she’s in a space, you know she’s going to hit the target.“In the second half when [she] hit the post, it was beautiful football and that makes me feel good. The win makes me feel good, but when my team play with a flow and a vibe, and I can feel them interchange, that’s beautiful.”Skinner, who confirmed his side’s quarter-final home leg will be played at Old Trafford, added: “I think she’s incredible. I’m happy to be the one that’s helping her be unleashed this season.”Holding a commanding 3-0 lead after the first leg, United similarly took control during the first half of this game, when Julia Zigiotti Olme swept home the opening goal with a decisively struck, low finish after a move in which United passed their way through their opponents’ backline far too easily.Prior to that, the away side had actually made a bright start and they should have taken the lead, with Synne Jensen twice being denied by good saves from Phallon Tullis-Joyce, either side of a chance for Lea Schüller at the other end, where the United centre-forward chested a long ball down superbly to run through on goal but was denied by a strong save. Melvine Malard also had a swerving strike parried by Lola Gallardo before Zigiotti Olme eventually beat her.There was nothing the 32-year-old goalkeeper could do about Park’s sublime strike to make it 2-0 shortly before half-time, though. Receiving a short corner, Park opened her body up and bent a sumptuous effort into the far, top-right corner that drew gasps from the crowd at Leigh Sports Village.View image in fullscreenJulia Zigiotti Olme (left) and Jess Park can sleep easy after booking Manchester United’s quarter-final place.Photograph: Morgan Harlow/UEFA/Getty ImagesPark has come into form at the perfect time, before the Lionesses meet for their first camp of 2026, travelling to Turkey next week to prepare to face Ukraine in a World Cup qualifier on 3 March, before they host Iceland on 7 March.The United winger’s chances of featuring prominently have been aided by the absence of the Arsenal forward Beth Mead, and this may therefore be her chance to shine.She continued showing dazzling touches with her quick feet after half-time, looking increasingly relaxed with the ball at her feet, and she raced clear down the right flank and played a perfect square pass to the substitute Ellen Wangerheim, in space inside the area, but her shot was straight at the goalkeeper.Park would later strike the inside of the post, after skipping inside to shoot from a favourable angle, before being substituted to a standing ovation as she came off for a rest on 78 minutes.The visitors went down to 10 players late on when Xènia Pérez received a second yellow card for fouling Wangerheim, but the tie was won long beforehand and Skinner, while acknowledging that Bayern Munich would be the favourites for their quarter-final, says nobody will want to face Manchester United in this competition.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueManchester United WomenAtlético Madrid WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was a let-off for the Eagles, who struggled to create any real chances until Wharton clipped the crossbar with just under 20 minutes remaining.Karacic turned a Yeremy Pino effort behind his post and Richards directed a header off target before Zrinjski worked their way back up the pitch, where Henderson denied Matej Sakota.Confusion ensued after the rebound as the hosts initially thought they had won a penalty for a Muñoz handball. The defender, in an aerial challenge, found himself sandwiched in between Henderson and Kerim Memija. The referee was called to the monitor but disagreed that Muñoz deserved punishment – and Palace breathed another sigh of relief.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueZrinjski MostarCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Try one of our five alternativesWhat if games ended at 90 minutes, set-pieces goals were scrapped, or shots that hit the woodwork counted?ByOpta AnalystRyan BensonThu 19 Feb 2026 10.14 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAleague table is a pretty helpful barometer of each team’s fortunes. That’s why we use it to decide where teams finish at the end of the season. However, league tables do not tell us the wholestory. Arsenal are top in reality (just about), but they might not be in all of our alternativePremier Leaguetables.First half v second halfFootball is most certainlya game of two halves. It may not come as much of a shock to learn the table changes quite drastically when looking at first-half or second-half results in isolation.Some teams will be fitter or mentally stronger than others, and this may contribute to them being better in second halves. Similarly, others are more fired up in the first half and this can contribute to them running out of steam later.A good place to start is withManchester City. You might remember that, across their first six league games of 2026, they didn’t score a single goal in the second half of matches – they did score six first-half goals, however.That is very much in keeping with their first-half superiority over the whole season. If we only considered results at half-time, City would be nine points clear ofArsenalat the summit. But if we look at second halves in isolation, they would drop to sixth, 13 points behindArsenal.View image in fullscreenBut that’s not the starkest difference.Manchester Unitedgo from fourth in the first-half table to 13th in the second-half table; Aston Villa are 13th in the first, second in the second; West Ham slide all the way from 10th in the half-time table to 20th in the second-half standings (albeit with a game in hand on Wolves).It would seem there is a slight correlation between teams who do well in the second half and those that are younger; the top 10 of the second-half table (26 years, 91 days) are, on average, 224 days younger (starting XIs only) than those in the bottom 10 (26 years, 315 days). This might not be enough to jump to conclusions, though.There is also game state to consider. If a team is winning at half-time by at least two clear goals, they don’t need to ‘win’ the second half as well. For example, Manchester City led Fulham 3-0 at the break last week, which is how the game finishes, so they technically only drew the second half. With the three points already in the bag, the hosts did not need to bust a gut to score again.View image in fullscreenSay goodbye to stoppage timePremier League referees are adding more and more stoppage time at the end of matches. It’s no longer unusual to see eight, nine or even 10 minutes shown on the fourth official’s board around the 90th minute. But what if games ended on the 90-minute mark? Stoppage-time goals wouldn’t be a thing and that would impact certain clubs.Leeds, for instance, would be five places better off in 10th if we removed all goals scored after the 90th minute. That’s because they have conceded nine in the league this season, more than anyone else. Everton and Fulham, however, would each drop three places if their stoppage-time goals were suddenly taken away from them.Liverpool have had a problem with late concessions, but they have also scored a few, so they would only be two points better off if stoppage-time goals were removed. Still, that would be enough to put them fourth, trading places with Manchester United.View image in fullscreenOut with set piecesSet pieces are sotrendy at the moment, but what if teams just didn’t bother with them? Admittedly, we are requiring you to really stretch your imagination here, but that’s the point of our alternative tables.So, in this alternate universe, goals from set pieces and penalties aren’t a thing, and it probably won’t take you long to work out who would lose out the most in such a dimension.Arsenal’s points total would decrease by eight without goals from set pieces and penalties. After all, 21 of their 52 goals in the league this term have come from set plays and spot-kicks.Aston Villa would also be big losers, seeing their points total reduce by seven, while Everton and Sunderland would each miss out on six.The biggest winners would be Burnley as they have only scored nine set-piece or penalty goals but have conceded 19. Other beneficiaries would be Brighton and Bournemouth, the latter of whom have let in more set-piece/penalty goals than any other team this term (20).View image in fullscreen(Re)moving the goalpostsWhat if every shot that hit the post or crossbar actually went in? It’s a light-hearted hypothetical, so don’t take it too seriously. The point is to show how fine the margins are. After all, the width of a goalpost or crossbar is 12 centimetres, though the curvature of the goal frame means it’s slightly less in reality – as such, a team can feasibly miss out on a title, European place or safety by a matter of centimetres.Of course, teams also benefit from having their own post/crossbar struck, it’s not just a one-way street. But it doesn’t happen in equal measure.It stands to reason that the better teams might benefit more in our hypothetical woodwork table. Better teams generally have more shots and face fewer than the worst sides, so they’re more likely to hit the post/crossbar than their opponents.But Arsenal would be among the biggest losers in a world without goalposts. Fulham would lose the most points (five), followed by Aston Villa (four), but then it’s Arsenal (three). That would see them drop down to third in the table because we also have to take into consideration the outputs of other teams. Manchester City would gain four points to go top, and Manchester United earn an extra 10 points to shoot up to second, ahead of Arsenal on goal difference.View image in fullscreenUnited have hit the woodwork 18 times in the league this season, four more than any other team. Also, only Brentford (three) and Chelsea (six) have seen their own post/bar hit less often than United (seven).What does it all mean, then? Well, we put it somewhere between everything and nothing. The actual Premier League table will continue to reign supreme, though these alternatives at least serve to remind us of the sport’s rollercoaster nature and that there is often more to it than meets the eye.This is an article byOpta AnalystExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueGuardian Sport NetworkManchester CityArsenalManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At nine o’clock on Thursday morning, Great Britain’s men’s curling team didn’t even know whether they would be in the Olympic semi-finals. By nine o’clock on Thursday night, they had won themselves a place in Saturday’s final against Canada by beating the undefeated Swiss team 8-5.The British, who scraped through the round robin only because the Italian team lost their last group stage game to the Swiss on Thursday morning, had promised that they would be an entirely different proposition if they got to the knockout rounds, and they were as good as their word.Winter Olympics 2026: GB men win curling semi-final, figure skating and more – liveRead more“An emotional rollercoaster is probably the way to describe this whole week, never mind just that game,” said Hammy McMillan. “I guess I’m still in a little bit of shock, because we had to really fight extremely hard in that game. We started off pretty slow and the Swiss guys really took advantage of that.”It was a hell of a game, played in front of a rowdy crowd, the loudest of them a happy band of mad Scottish curling fans who had come along with a repertoire of songs written especially for the four men on the team. There was a lone bagpiper in there somewhere too, and even someone playing a kazoo.“They were amazing. If they can bring that exact same energy on Saturday, it’ll spur us on,” McMillan said. “Any time you hear the bagpipes, you get goosebumps.” Well, yes, that’s one way of describing it.The game started to go their way in the sixth end, which the British managed to steal when Switzerland’s vice skip missed a tricky hammer shot. But it really turned on an improbable shot by Bruce Mouat in the seventh end. The curlers call it a “run back triple takeout”, but the rest of us might understand it better as a feat of geometry in which Mouat managed to hit one of the opposition’s stones into a second in such a way that the second scudded into a third. The Swiss, who had been expecting to reap at least three points and move into a 7-4 lead, suddenly found they needed to make a draw just to score one.View image in fullscreenBruce Mouat on the tense final end against Switzerland which Britain won to seal the passage into Saturday’s final.Photograph: Issei Kato/ReutersMouat judged it one of the best shots he has ever made in competition. You could tell he liked it because he even allowed himself to celebrate with a little fist pump. “In my opinion Bruce is one of the best shotmakers in the world, if not the best shotmaker in the world,” McMillan said. “You know, for the last 18 months he’s been incredible, and as long as we do our job, we’ve got 100% confidence in Bruce he’s going to finish it off.” Britain were able to score two in the next end, which meant they led 6-5 going into the 10th.Mouat and the Swiss skip Yannick Schwaller have a friendly rivalry that runs right back to their matches in the world junior championships a decade ago. Schwaller won the first games they played but Mouat has had much the better of it in the years since, and led 22-10 in their head to head coming into this semi-final, including their last four games straight. Last April the British beat the Swiss 5-4 in the world championship final.But it was around that time that the Swiss brought in the legendary Canadian curler Glenn Howard, a four-time world champion, as their national coach. Howard has built the Swiss team into the machine that was unbeaten in the round-robin stage of these Olympics, and during the time-out he came on to the side of the ice to try to steer his team through the final shots they needed to make to take that 10th end. But Mouat’s team had their measure. The Swiss missed with their final stone, and the British broke out into such wild celebrations that Bobby Lammie nearly clattered the referee with his broom when he threw it into the air.Now Mouat, who has played 16 days straight at these Olympics, has one game left. “It’s going to be a tough game,” says McMillan. “We play Canada a lot. We beat them in the semi-final of the world championships last year, and we know it’s going to be a battle. On paper this week they’ve been the second best team behind Switzerland. So we know we’ve got to bring the way we played in the last four or five ends there today for all 10 ends. We haven’t probably quite had a full A+ 10-end game yet. So it’s time to bring it on Saturday.”The British women weren’t so lucky. They beat Italy 7-4, their third-straight victory, to give them a 5-4 record for the tournament, which was good enough to get the men through, but they needed Switzerland to beat the USA too if they were going to make it. The Swiss came a couple of inches away from doing it, which seemed pretty unlikely when the US team were 6-3 up going into the 10th end. The Swiss skip pulled off an improbable shot to equalise the game with the final stone, only for the US to win in the extra end.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBCurlingnewsShareReuse this content"

The buildup has been marred by racist abuse on social media of the Ireland second row Edwin Edogbo, after the 23-year-old made his debut from the replacements’ bench intheir win against Italyin round two.Power points: scrum battle could be crucial in England v Ireland clashRead moreItoje said the abuse of Edogbo was “incredibly sad” and spelled out the danger of the online world, explaining why he believes the wider damage it is causing will become clear. “Social media has been a force for good in many ways but it’s also been a force for negativity in a lot of other ways,” Itoje said.“I think it’s really important for athletes, as well as ordinary people, not to live their life based on what social media says about them. Because it would be a horrible way to live your life. I would advise all top-level athletes not to spend too much time on social media because it’s really corrosive.“My hypothesis is we’re going to see in the coming years a huge amount of damage that has been done to us as humans, and as a society, as a result of social media in terms of brains and brain development.”Itoje also pointed to the modern media landscape being one of extremes, explaining that he tries to maintain a sense of perspective whether he is praised or criticised. “Social media is very dangerous because even when it is positive it can be corrosive,” he said.“While I have a huge amount of respect for everyone in this room, [in mainstream media] what tends to happen is the positive news is extremely positive, and the negative extremely negative. In reality, you’re always somewhere in the middle.View image in fullscreenEdwin Edogbo made his debut for Ireland in the win over Italy but suffered racist abuse on social media afterwards.Photograph: INPHO/Shutterstock“If you just go with what the headlines say, or what they say on social media, it’s a horrible way to live your life because you become a slave to what other people say about you.”Itoje said the abuse of Edogbo demonstrates the battle against racism must continue but that he also believes there is some progress being made. “The stuff around Edwin is incredibly sad,” he said. “It’s something no one should have to go through and it’s a reminder there is still work to do. While the stuff we’re seeing – whether it’sVinícius Júnioror Edwin Edogbo – is terribly sad and we as a community need to keep on stamping this type of thing out.“But I do also believe that we are moving in somewhat the right direction. But moving in the right direction is not a given. It takes work. I think we all need to constantly remind ourselves of the work that we need to do.”The Ireland head coach,Andy Farrell, has dropped the fly-half Sam Prendergast from his matchday squad to face England after their narrow victory against Italy in Dublin. Jack Crowley of Munster starts at No 10 with Leinster’s Ciarán Frawley providing cover on the bench after Farrell made five changes to his starting team. Jamison Gibson-Park returns to start at scrum-half, replacing Craig Casey, with Tadhg Furlong, Tadhg Beirne and Josh van der Flier restored to the pack.“Jack Crowley starts because of what we’ve seen and how he’s come through and performed,” Farrell said, before backing Prendergast to recover from his omission. “Sam’s a fantastic international player, he’s on a journey that’s obviously learning, like all of us. That will never stop. It’s the same for Ciarán Frawley. We’ve talked all along about the lads competing against one another, and the balance is right for this team this weekend.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamMaro ItojeIreland rugby union teamAndy FarrellSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

I sell ’em, $2,000 worth, for about $1,200-$1,500 cash.” Another Black woman ranted about taxpayers’ responsibility to her seven children with seven men, and yet another melted down after her food stamps were rejected at a corn-dog counter.Visible watermarks stamped some videos as AI-generated – apparently, too faintly for the racist commentators and hustlers more than happy to believe the frenzy was real. “You got people treating it like a side hustle, selling the stamps, abusing the system,” the conservative commentator Amir Odom whinged. Fox Newsreported on the Snap deepfakesas if they were authentic, beforeissuing a correction. Newsmax anchor Rob Schmittclaimedpeople were using Snap “to get their nails done, to get their weaves and hair”. (Lost in the outrage was a basic fact: white Americansmake up37% of Snap’s 42 million beneficiaries.)‘Pretty revolutionary’: a Brooklyn exhibit interrogates white-dominated AI to make it more inclusiveRead moreThe fake videos are mere shards in the widening mosaic of digital blackface, a pattern that’s spiked in the past two years as generative AI video tools have become widely accessible. “There’s been a massive acceleration,” says Safiya Umoja Noble, a UCLA gender studies professor and author of Algorithms of Oppression, which focuses on digital biases against Black women in particular. “The digital blackface videos are really pulling from the same racist and sexist stereotypes and tropes that have been used for centuries.” The net effect is a patina of Blackness stripped of cultural obligation or stewardship – minstrelsy in a nutshell.Coined in a 2006 academic paper, the term digital blackface describes a form of Black cultural commodification repurposed for non-Black expression online. Examples run the gamut: posts in African American Vernacular English, the use of darker-skinned emojis, reaction memes featuring Beyoncé, Katt Williams and other exemplars of Black cool.“The early research that was done on digital blackface started with white gamers using bitmojis of a different race and changing their vernacular to represent themselves,” says Mia Moody, a Baylor University journalism professor whose forthcoming book, Blackface Memes, links the role of Black users in starting and spreading online trends to subsequent digital blackface. “That’s part of the cultural appropriation, gaining the cultural capital. Maybe you’re a nerdy white guy, but if you use this cool avatar of a Black guy with dreadlocks, people will give you respect. You’re interesting all of a sudden.”During memeology’s expansion into short-form video, Black expression has increasingly been divorced from authorship, context or consequence. Internet culture scholars say some non-white online creators use AI-generated avatars modeled on familiar Black faces – the beauty influencer, the culture podcaster, the man-on-the-street interviewer; they slip into feeds alongside real Black content creators. Large language models scour digital spaces that gained cachet from Black speech and humor, absorbing their tone and slang. Hume AI is one of many firms that offer synthetic voices for podcasts and audiobooks such as “Black woman with subtle Louisiana accent”, or “middle-aged African American man with a tone of hard-earned wisdom”. In most cases, creators whose speech is scraped from YouTube, podcasts and social media receive no compensation, much less even know their personalities shaped these models.The Snap reaction clips, however, were a notable escalation in the mainstreaming of digital blackface – less blending in, more weapons-grade stereotyping. Many of those videos were created with OpenAI’s text-to-video appSora. As Sora’s popularity surged in 2025, users exploited its hyperrealism tosully Martin Luther King Jr’s image, sparking ethical debate around “synthetic resurrection”. Deepfakes showed him shoplifting, wrestling Malcolm X, and swearing through his I Have a Dream speech. Conservative influencers swamped feeds with AI-generated embraces between King andCharlie Kirk, conflating their clashing legacies and cultural martyrdom. Bernice King, MLK’s daughter and the director of his Atlanta-based non-profit, criticized the slopaganda as “foolishness”.double quotation markIf you have an authoritarian regime in power, they can use your systems to facilitate propagandaSafiya Umoja NobleInevitably the Trump White House has gotten into the act. In January the official White House X account posted adoctored photoof Minnesota activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, darkened and weeping, in the wake of her arrest at a non-violent anti-ICE demonstration. Earlier this month an image portraying theObamas as apeswas circulated via Trump’s own Truth Social account.Blackface abides at the underbelly of American mass media even as it evolves at breakneck pace. Its roots trace to the minstrel revues of the early 19th century; white performers smeared grease paint made from charred corks on their faces and plastered on oversized white lips to caricature Black features, and performed exaggerated routines of Black laziness, buffoonery and hypersexuality. Thomas D Rice, a Manhattan playwright, shot to fame in the 1830s playing a loping trickster named Jim Crow – a name that quickly became shorthand for the forced racial segregation policies in the American south that endured until the 1964 Civil Rights Act.In their heyday, minstrel shows werethedominant form of American entertainment – reflected in newspaper cartoons and the enormously popular Amos ‘n’ Andy radio shows. After the civil war, Black performers were largely forced into adopting minstrel elements, at the expense of their personhood once more, just to gain any footing on stage. “The objectives were, first, to make money to help educate our younger ones, and second, to try to break down the ill feeling that existed toward the colored people,”explainedTom Fletcher, a vaudeville minstrel and actor for almost 70 years who died in 1954.Even as minstrelsy faded from the spotlight by the early 20th century, its toxic residue lingered in American culture – from the shuffling crows of Disney’s Dumbo, to Ted Danson’s infamous 1993 blackface roast of Whoopi Goldberg, to the annual parade of white Halloween revelers in racial masquerade. A decade ago, when the internet was still a black box of sorts, researchers such as Noble and MIT’sJoy Buolamwiniwere sounding the alarm about the inherent racial biases in the coding of algorithms related to medical treatment, loan applications, hiring decisions and facial recognition. Now it’s out in the open, smearing wider and deeper than any burnt cork routine ever could.Tech firms have made some effort to stem the tide of digital blackface. Bowing to public backlash, the King family and more prominent estates, OpenAI, Google and the AI image generator Midjourney disallowed deepfakes of King and other American icons. In January 2025, Meta deleted two of its own AI blackface characters – a retiree called Grandpa Brian and Liv, described as a “proud Black queer momma” and “truth-teller” – after allegations of their non-diverse development team fueled atempest of criticism. Instagram and TikTok and more have made some attempts to scrub viral digital blackface videos,to tepid results. Last summer, efforts to replicate Bigfoot Baddie – the AI avatar of a Black woman as a human-yeti hybrid in pink wigs, acrylic nails and hair bonnets, created by Google’s Veo AI – erupted into a full-blown social media craze, with some users even hustling how-to courses. The avatar is still on socials.Black in AI and the Distributed AI Research Institute (Dair) are among the handful of affinity groups that have pushed for diversity and community input in AI model-building to address programming bias. The AI Now Institute and Partnership on AI have highlighted the risks of AI systems learning from marginalized communities’ data and noted that tech companies could provide mechanisms such as data opt-outs to help limit harmful or exploitative uses. But widespread adoption has been glacial.“YouTube alone has something like 400 hours of content per minute being uploaded,” Noble says. “With AI generation, these tech firms cannot manage what’s coming through their systems. So they don’t. Or they do what’s absolutely imperative to the US government. But if you have an authoritarian regime in power, they can use your systems to facilitate propaganda.”Are AI-powered ‘virtual rappers’ just a strange new form of Blackface? | Akin OllaRead moreAlthough the precise impact of AI-generated digital blackface is difficult to quantify, its use by theTrump administrationhighlights its potential as a powerful tool of official disinformation. The Obama Truth Social entry revived a slur that has festered for years in darker online corners, and one that rhymes with Trump’s sustained efforts to denigrate the former first family. (Trump disclaimed direct responsibility and refused to apologize for that post, which was taken down.) Meanwhile, the White House’s doctored image of Armstrong, altered from an actual photo taken by the Department of Homeland Security and published on their official Twitter account, scanned as a psyop by a government working closely with tech firms to track activists and other perceived enemies of the state.Beyond laundering bigotry as news, digital blackface exposes Black users to a level of personalized abuse and harassment that harkens to a minstrelsy heyday when racists were fully empowered to express their bigotry unbidden. And then just as now, it seems there is little that can be done to curb the vitriol. “We are living in a United States with an open, no-holds-barred, anti-civil-rights, anti-immigrant, anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ, anti-poor-policy agenda,” Noble says. “Finding the material to support this position is just a matter of the state bending reality to fit its imperatives. And that’s easily done when every tech company lines up behind the White House.”Even so, Moody remains hopeful that the current fascination with digital blackface will soon be as outdated and uninviting as the analog variant. She has seen this play before, after all. “Right now people are just experimenting with AI technology and having a ball seeing what they can get away with,” she says. “Once we get beyond that, then we’re going to see less of it. They’ll move on to something else. Or they’ll be up for a job, and it’ll be embarrassing. Just look at the history.”"

Instead, much of that momentum is being crowded out of our minds by anxieties: a worsening affordability crisis, geopolitical instability and the specter of artificial intelligence looming over the workplace.For the tech CEOs leading the AI race and enriching themselves as they jostle for dominance, AI isn’t a phantasm at all, but a glimmering unicorn. When they predict AI isjust months awayfrom being able to do everything a software engineer does, or that it willone daytake over CEOs’ jobs, their excitement for the future is palpable. For the rest of us, it’s hard to feel confident in theiroffhand remarksabout how “some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs will be created”. A2025 Pew surveyfound that “64% of the public thinks AI will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”, which is probably why only 17% of Americans say AI will have a positive effect on the US over the same time period.Uncertain times like these call for scrutiny. Throughout 2026, the Guardian will publishReworked, a reporting series that centers the human stakes as AI disrupts our workplaces, in ways both thrilling and alarming. Like this essay, the stories in this series will focus on workers’ real-world power and plights as well as the realities and exaggerations of the hype surrounding AI’s transformative possibilities.So which version of the future of work awaits us? It is yet to be settled, which means there is still time to shift course.Dissolving divisionsBlue-collar workers, who have long grappled withalgorithmic surveillance and optimizationat work, are now worrying that technological advancements will only make their jobs more dehumanizing. “[For] lower-wage workers, there is concern about being replaced by robots. But on the other hand, there’s a lot of concern about beingturned intorobots,” Lisa Kresge, a senior researcher at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, told me.12-hour days, no weekends: the anxiety driving AI’s brutal work culture is a warning for all of usRead moreAnd white-collar workers are now wondering if their work will begin to resemble blue-collar labor – either because they will be similarly tracked and managed, or because they will need to switch to more manual work that’s resistant to being taken over by AI.It may seem that workers haven’t been this vulnerable in a long time. In some ways, that’s true. But this is also a pivotal moment, one in which something unexpected is happening: society’s collective anxiety over AI is catalyzing workers to push back.“It is creating an opportunity,” Sarita Gupta, the Ford Foundation’s vice-president of US programs and co-author of The Future We Need: Organizing for a Better Democracy in the Twenty-First Century, told me. “When you have a young Silicon Valley software engineerrealizethat their performance is tracked or undermined by the same logic as a working-class warehouse picker, class divisions dissolve, and larger working-class movements for dignity are possible. That is what we’re starting to see.”People across industries and income brackets are anxious and frustrated, quite like they were when the Covid pandemic placed punishing demands on frontline workers and erased the boundaries between work and life for everyone else. Those struggles prompted power shifts: at the same time that workers led unionization efforts at Amazon warehouses and Starbucks locations around the US, the Great Resignation saw a record number of employees quit their jobs, and the ones who remained in the workforce began negotiating for and gaining better pay and conditions.“It was not a pretty time for a lot of workers. And so part of the resurgence of labor organizing from that period of time was in response to a lot of fears,” Kresge said.She also sees the rise of AI as an opening for the labor movement to regain some of the power it has lost after decades of attacks from employers. “I’m hopeful about the opportunity for technology to lift up some of the issues that have been under way in our economy for decades … in terms of how workers are treated and how we are distributing the rewards of productivity,” she said.Perceptions of powerConditions for workers have been rough for a long while now. “Over time, unions have lost collective bargaining power, and a lot of that is due to the lack of laws that we need and enforcement of laws,” Gupta said. “For four decades, productivity soared while wages stayed flat, and unionization hit historic lows.” In 2025,only 9.9% of US workers were union members– the same percentage as 2024, but still the lowest numbers in almost 40 years.The bogus four-day workweek that AI supposedly ‘frees up’Read moreToday, the advent of AI is drawing the world’s attention to the extreme imbalance of power between employers and their employees – and people are getting worked up. Even if the outcomes are still undetermined, that’s a glimmer of possibility in bleak times.AI is still a nascent technology. Many of the predictions about what it will be capable of and how it will transform labor and the economy are just that – predictions. The question of worker power in the age of AI hasn’t been decided yet, even if billionaire CEOs with a vested interest in the unregulated dominance of AI keep implying that it has.“There is a concerted effort among many tech leaders to basically create mystification around AI as a tactic, to a large extent, to disempower workers, policymakers, and anyone who might be critical of the growing concentration of funding and resources in our society toward this goal,” Kresge told me.In other words, take what these billionaires say with a grain of salt. The rise of AI is already transforming society, the economy and our relationship to work, but a lot of these shifts are anticipatory, based on our belief in the potential of a technology that’s still being built.“We have to always remind ourselves that the direction of technology is a choice, right? We can use AI to build a surveillance economy that squeezes every drop of value out of a worker, or we can use it to build an era of shared prosperity,” Gupta said. “We know if technology were designed and deployed and governed by the people doing the work, AI wouldn’t be such a threat.”"

Amodei split from OpenAI in 2021 over differences over how to manage safety risks.View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi poses with the CEOs of several AI companies, with Sam Altman and Dario Amodei the only two not clasping hands.Photograph: APOn Wednesday, the White House’s senior AI adviser, Sriram Krishnan, renewed the Trump administration’s criticism of AI regulation, singling out the EU’s AI Act. He told delegates he would continue to “rant” against legislation that was not “conducive to an entrepreneur who wants to build innovative technology”.But Macron told the intergovernmental summit: “Opposite to what some misinformed friends have been saying,Europeis not blindly focused on regulation. Europe is a space for innovation and investment, but it is a safe space, and safe spaces win in the long run.”Research published this monthby Unicef and Interpol across 11 countries found at least 1.2 million children reported having their images manipulated into sexually explicit deepfakes in the past year. In some countries, one in 25 children – the equivalent of one child in every classroom – had been affected.“There is no reason our children should be exposed online to what is legally forbidden in the real world,” Macron said. “Our platforms, governments and regulators should be working together to make the internet and social media a safe space. This is why, in France, we are embarking on a process to ban social networks for children under 15 years old.”Among the tech executives attending was Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, which is facing a legal challenge from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who took his own lifeafter discussing suicide with ChatGPT.View image in fullscreenThe Anthropic chief, Dario Amodei (left), and Emmanuel Macron at the summit.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty ImagesAltman told delegates the rapid pace of AI development meant “by the end of 2028, more of the world’s intellectual capacity could reside inside of datacentres than outside of them”. He also stressed the urgent need for “regulation or safeguards” and called for the creation of a body akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency to oversee the international coordination of AI.Dario Amodei, the co-chief executive of Anthropic, said he was “concerned about the autonomous behaviour of AI models, their potential for misuse by individuals and governments and their potential for economic displacement”.Modi said it was “imperative that AI is child safe and family-guided”, likening the emergence of AI to the discovery of fire and calling it a “profound transformation in human history”.India is seeking to position itself as the world’s third AI power behind the US and China, with Google this week announcing a $15bn investment in datacentres and subsea cables linking India to the US and other countries.0:52Should we be impressed or worried by China's humanoid robot display? – videoModi said there must be “established levels of authenticity for content within the digital world … people must know what is authentic, and what has been generated by AI”.The interventions come amid growing public concern about the societal risks of AI, as the most advanced models remain largely controlled by about four US companies and a handful of Chinese rivals.Modi set out an alternative vision, leveraging India’s 1.4 billion population as a huge growth market for tech firms. He said: “We must prevent an AI monopoly. Many nations consider AI to be a strategic asset, and therefore it is developed confidentially and its availability is carefully managed.“However, our nation India holds a different perspective. We believe that technology, like a I will only truly benefit the world when it is shared and when open source code becomes available.”His comments appeared to be directed at the US, where leading AI models are not open-source and cannot be used or adapted without permission. By contrast, China’s leading systems, such as DeepSeek and Qwen, are broadly open-source.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Emmanuel MacronGrok AIComputingInternet safetyEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Now that money is seriously threatened and a large part of it is already gone, putting into jeopardy internet freedoms around the world.Managed by the US state department and the US Agency for Global Media, the programme – broadly called Internet Freedom – funds small groups all over the world, from Iran to China to the Philippines, who built grassroots technologies to evade internet controls imposed by governments. It has dispensed well over $500m (£370m) in the past decade, according to an analysis by the Guardian, including$94min 2024.Then came Doge, Donald Trump’s department of government efficiency, tasked with reducing the size of US government agencies and initiatives. Career employees who staffed Internet Freedom resigned or were sacked in 2025 as part of larger reductions. Many of its programmes were cut permanently; its main granting office issued no money in 2025. The Open Technology Fund (OTF), a nonprofit that works with the government to direct roughly half of this money, won alawsuitto get some of this funding restored in December; the Trump administration isnowappealing against that ruling.Meanwhile, the Trump administration this Januarywithdrewfrom the Freedom Online Coalition, a global alliance set up by the US to defend digital rights.The cuts risk curtailing technologies that helped Iranians to coordinate during recent anti-government protests, and that allowed videos and images of massacres to reach the outside world. They could have a major impact in other nations too; the efforts of groups in Myanmar to get past the junta’s “digital iron curtain”, and the ability of users in China to avoid surveillance.“The programme was effectively gutted,” said a former US official. “They didn’t issue any grants this year.”“I would like to live in a world where a single US programme is not such a linchpin, such a load-bearing programme, but it has been. It’s hard to deny it has been,” said one digital rights expert based in Europe who has worked on a number of projects forInternetFreedom.To report this story, the Guardian spoke to 10 people with knowledge of Internet Freedom, including six of its grantees, and reviewed documents related to its operations and budget.The US Department of State has been approached for comment. The OTF declined to comment.The purpose of the programme was to make it extremely difficult to do what North Korea has accomplished through decades of censorship efforts, and what Iran succeeded in doing this January during a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests: cut an entire population off from the global internet.The US aimed to circumvent this by funding groups capable of building and harnessing technologies that evade such restrictions and censorship. These include familiar tools, such as the encrypted messaging service Signal and the Tor browser, which allows users to be anonymous online.They also include far more powerful tools. Advanced circumvention technologies can make it possible to get past even extremely powerful censorship regimes – to leap the firewall in China, for example, or to obtain international news in Iran even when mobile phone networks are out, through methods like satellite datacasting, in which data is broadcast in a similar way to television signal.Another technology has allowed Iranians to securely communicate during recent anti-government protests, alerting each other to shootings and police presence, even as the rest of the internet has been cut off.The soft-power aim behind this was to keep the internet as it is: mostly accessible, mostly a global commons. The groups it funded made censorship costly and difficult. “When you challenge censorship, the long-term effect is that oppressive governments must either open their internet, or to go in the direction of North Korea,” said the former US official.“But because each of those options is costly for them, they’ll keep trying to censor their networks so as to have the economic benefits of the internet without the drawbacks of freedom of speech and access to information. So the fight continues.”“Internet Freedom funded the development of many of the censorship-circumvention technologies that millions of people around the world depend on to maintain a link to the outside world,” said Doug Madory, an internet infrastructure expert who works closely with many of these groups.Their makers are “often operating on a shoestring and passion. They believe in the cause. There’s no fancy offices, they’re working out of their apartments. It’s not a moneyed industry.”Most recipients of this money keep it quiet; it’s a dangerous thing, in some places, to take state department funds. But even as the funds run out, more and more organisations – journalists, activists, and civil society – are seeking out these technologies, and the groups that build them.Censorshipregimes are getting worse worldwide.“It’s a massive blow. The need is bigger and other funding is also gone. Organisations that provide these tools are being overwhelmed,” said the digital rights expert. “It’s not sustainable.”Some of the groups working on these technologies have laid off staff; others are continuing without pay. A few hold out hope that some money can be restored – although they fear that the Trump administration might more overtly politicise its aims. While a recent appropriations bill contains a budget line for Internet Freedom, it names no specific programmes as recipients of this cash.Others say they’re existing in a brief grace period as the rest of the funds run out.“Everybody’s just waiting right now, to be honest. But at the same time, wait at your own risk,” said an Iranian technologist funded through Internet Freedom.Meanwhile, censorship tech is growing cheaper and easier to access. Chinese companies haveexportedsophisticated middleboxes – devices that sit on network cables and allow authorities to monitor internet traffic –to countries across Africa and Asia in the past year. These allow regimes such as Iran’s to fine-tune their control over the domestic internet – allowing commerce to continue, for example, while communication is throttled.Several recipients of the US money expressed hope that Europe might fund these technologies in the future; some have already petitioned EU officials for funding.The cuts “make it easier to build a ‘digital iron curtain’. It makes it easier for the Kremlin to put Russians in a digital information bubble that reinforces specific narratives about people outside of Russia. This makes it easier for China to do this. For Iran to do this,” one said.A state department spokesperson said it “consistently pushes back on censorship and digital repression”, and that it is “reviewing and realigning US foreign assistance to move faster, operate more effectively, and innovate”.They added that the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), one of the main administrators of Internet Freedom, was “refocused under the reorganisation” but continues to coordinate with other offices to support the development of anti-censorship technology.Explore more on these topicsCensorshipInternetSurveillancenewsShareReuse this content"

It has led to some concerns about the platform’s dominance in children’s TV, as well asthe kinds of shows its algorithm serves up.However, TV sets became the first-choice device for YouTube viewing for over-55s in October 2023, for those between 35 and 54 in April 2024 – and finally for 16- to 34-year-olds in December 2024.Despite YouTube’s rise, the Barb data suggests traditional television viewing is far from dead. It found live TV still made up 45% of all identified viewing on TV sets in December 2025.Last year’s live TV viewing was driven by sporting events such as the Women’s Euro 2025 final and entertainment including BBC One’s Celebrity Traitors and Channel 4’s Gogglebox.“Commentary about television is too often based on a binary premise: nobody watches live any more, young audiences have vanished and platforms have replaced programmes,” said Justin Sampson, Barb’s chief executive.“What emerges from the evidence is not a paradigm shift, but a rebalancing. Live viewing remains a substantial part of the mix, even among younger audiences.“YouTube, too, resists easy categorisation. It is neither simply ‘TV’ nor something entirely separate from it … What is true is that the TV set is now the primary way YouTube is watched in homes around the country.”YouTube has become increasingly dominant, hosting podcasts and short-form videos, as well as content from traditional broadcasters. It marks an astonishing rise for a platform founded only 21 years ago.Its impact has been so marked in recent years that the media regulator, Ofcom, has urged“endangered” public service broadcasterslike the BBC and ITV to place more of their content on the platform.The BBC has since announced plans to produce tailor-made content for YouTube. The corporation has previously posted clips and trailers for BBC shows on YouTube, but under the deal it will make fresh programming for its online rival.YouTube’s cultural importance is also being acknowledged: the Victoria and Albert Museum in London hasturned an early version of YouTube’s “watch page” into part of an exhibition. The page will feature the first video uploaded to the site,Me at the zoo, filmed by one of its founders, Jawed Karim. The museum said it was “a vital piece of internet history”.Visitors will be able to see the page playing as internet users would have done 20 years ago. It features Karim at San Diego zoo, talking about elephants. The 19-second clip has been viewed more than 380m times since it was posted in April 2005.Neal Mohan, YouTube’s chief executive, said Karim’s video “became a new way for people to share their stories with the world”.Explore more on these topicsYouTubeTelevision (Technology)Television (Television & radio)Television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Now he’s back in his whites (and reds) with a charming new take on the sport that dials back the difficulty level and adds lots of fun modes and features, aiming to appease complete newcomers and Djokovic-esque veterans.At first, the range of options is almost bewildering. You can opt to play in one-off matches with up to three other players or NPCs, or enter a more structured tournament of singles or doubles play. Then there’s the extremely fun Mix It Up, which offers a range of fun tennis derivatives. These include Forest Court where piranha plants appear and gobble any balls that get close, and Pinball where bumpers and barriers pop up as you play. Trial Towers, meanwhile, presents a tower of increasingly tough tennis challenges which all have to be completed to open the next two buildings; fail more than three times and you’re sent back to the beginning – yes, it’s Mario Tennis: The Roguelike.View image in fullscreenA level playing field … Mario Tennis Fever.Photograph: NintendoThe least interesting option is Adventure mode, a glorified four-hour tutorial in which Mario and Luigi are transformed into babies and have to learn all their tennis moves again in order to save Princess Daisy, or something. It’s bright, silly stuff recalling the original Tennis Academy story mode from Mario Tennis on the Game Boy Color. As you go, you’re taught the range of shots available through various minichallenges, allowing you to level up Mario and unlock new characters. But the narrative is threadbare and it’s all a bit of a grind, as the move-set is pretty straightforward anyway.double quotation markThe most fun you’ll have is playing with a bunch of friends in the same roomAnd this is the real appeal of Mario Tennis Fever. You pick it up and five minutes later you’re playing pretty well. Top spin, flat and slice shots are on different buttons, while two-press combos result in lobs and drop shots to widen your arsenal. The skill is in the timing – which means striking your serve when the ball is at its highest, and boosting your returns with an early button press ensure the ball thunders over the net at top speed. You can also double tap the topspin button for more power, but less directional accuracy. As you gather confidence, you start mixing all this with the occasional slow-mo drop shot to send your opponent huffing around the court. There’s a lovely smooth feel to rallies, and while you play you learn to read player movement pretty well – even when you’re facing off against an ape or a giant man-eating plant.The game’s big new feature is an unlockable range of “fever rackets”, each offering a unique special move that can be powered up as a rally progresses. These might set fire to your opponent’s side of the court, or cover it in bananas so they slip over, or add mind-bending swerve to your shot. There’s a catch, however: if your foe can return the ball before it bounces – and you fail to do the same in return – the special effect is reversed against the originator. This leads to amusingly frantic rallies at the net as players battle to avoid being struck down with the accursed power.As with the various shells, lightning strikes and ink blots inMario Kart, the design philosophy behind these fever rackets is to level the playing field: if you’re falling horribly behind or are just a little inexperienced, a deftly used fever shot can get you back into competition. The brashly colourful cartoon-style visuals also add masses of appeal as the game’s cast of Mario superstars are immersed in a cacophony of flaming rocks and icy blasts.The most fun you’ll have is playing with a bunch of friends in the same room, but there’s also an online mode which offers ranked or friendly games. However you choose to play, the game exudes childlike charm while hiding layers of depth beneath its chaotic exterior. You can spend hours practising perfectly timed drop shots, mastering spin and getting your positioning just right, and figuring out which fever rackets best suit your style of play is an involving process. It is, in short, exactly what you want and expect from aNintendosports title – something for everyone, and then something more for those who decide to go pro.Mario Tennis Fever is available now, £58.99Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendoNintendo Switch 2Sports gamesSuper MarioreviewsShareReuse this content"

I shared a prayer with the family and listened to Jesse Jr talk about how he had heard his father breathe his last breath in the middle of the night. When he called his mother to the room, he told me, she reached toward his father and said: “A mighty lion has fallen.”In Africa’s savannas, the lion is respected because he has a power that all the other animals recognize, even if they do not understand it. Theresponsesto Jackson’s death have proven him to be a lion in this sense – remembered with respect by people from every walk of life, even those who did not understand him. Though Donald Trump has built a political career by opposing almost every policy Jackson worked for in public life, he recalled Jackson as a “force of nature”. Trump recognized his power, even if he didn’t understand it. Anyone who wants to help reconstruct the America that Jackson worked for should take time to understand the source of this mighty lion’s strength.Born poor and Black in Greenville,South Carolina, Jackson heard an empowering truth inDr Martin Luther King Jr’s message of nonviolence. “I am somebody” became Jackson’s personal mantra long before it was acall-and-responseline in his stump speech. If broken systems or imperfect people treated him as less than a beloved child of God, that did nothing to diminish the fact that the source of all life had loved him into existence. Jackson internalized the message shared by gospel preachers and practitioners of nonviolence: love is the most potent force in the universe, not least because it is an unlimited resource. He was relentless in finding ways to unleash the power of love through collective action.A historic force to be reckoned with, a giant to be mourned. Our panel pays tribute to the Rev Jesse JacksonRead more“Direct action” was a nonviolent tactic Jackson learned from the civil rights movement’s sit-ins, freedom rides and voter registration efforts, but he was constantly innovating new tactics to understand how love could unite people to uplift all of humanity. When corporate greed was the obvious obstacle to human flourishing, he organized boycotts that exposed companies’ need for brand loyalty and forced them to the negotiating table. When division among poor people prevented them from owning their collective power, he built rainbow coalitions to tap into the political power of fusion. When religion was distorted to incite fear and division, he exhibited a moral leadership that appealed to the best of people’s values – from Iowa farm country to the Mississippi Delta – to grow a moral movement. Jackson showed us how love can always be a potent force in public life.I first met Jackson when I was president of the student government association at my alma mater in North Carolina, during his presidential campaign in 1984. As students, my classmates and I saw in his campaign the issues that mattered and the energy that was needed to bring new voters into politics. It wasn’t about Democrat or Republican. We were thinking about how people could have enough to survive and thrive in this society – and what we could do to make that more possible.Most of us had come from poor eastern North Carolina. We knew what it was like for people not to have living wages and health insurance. And here came this figure, rising to reignite the ending of the Second Reconstruction and maybe even bring us toward the promise of a Third Reconstruction.double quotation markJackson showed us that love wasn’t soft, but when put into action it could transform American politicsWhen I was a young man volunteering on his campaign, Jackson could make me so angry. I will never forget the time when, after five days of non-stop campaigning, I messed up the facts in a presentation. He made me stay up all night to study and show him I could get it right. “I am somebody” wasn’t just an inspirational slogan. It was a faith that demanded the best from people. He showed us that love wasn’t soft, but when put into action it could register millions of new voters and transform American politics. “My constituency is the damned, disinherited, disrespected, despised,” Jackson said. “They are restless and seek relief. They voted in record numbers, they have invested faith, hope and trust in the US”When American voters repudiated the politics of fear and division after Trump’s first term, during a global pandemic, Trump lied and said the 2020 election was a fraud. Everyone knew he was lying, but Trump made acceptance of the big lie a loyalty test for Republicans across the country. In Texas in 2021, the Republican-controlled legislature gerrymandered the voting maps to dilute the power of the fusion coalitions that Jackson spent his whole life building.I went to Texas with my organizationRepairers of the Breachto lead a walk to the state capitol that summer. On that hot asphalt under the Texas sun, I remember looking up and seeing Jackson, whose disease was already advanced, sweat dripping down his face. “You don’t have to be out here,” I told him, but he shushed me. “Champions run through the tape,” Jackson said. While his physical strength was diminished, his love for the people and for justice was stronger than ever. Jackson showed us how a mighty lion of love can grow stronger with age.I got the call that Jackson had finished his work on this earth just after finishing another march, this time across North Carolina to challenge the gerrymander Trump ordered here to try to hold control of the House in this year’s midterms. In this hour when the promise of a multi-ethnic democracy is imperiled, we need the witness of this lion of love more than ever.Jackson’s life is a testimony that love is stronger than the strongest strongman because any strongman can only keep as many people down as his limited resources will allow him to coerce or deceive. But love can rise up from within each of us. Love can keep you alive when all the world is fashioned against you. Love can unite us across every line that’s drawn to divide, every dollar that’s spent to fuel hate, every piece of propaganda that plays to pit us against one another. And love can grow stronger even as our physical strength is diminished. May we honor the Rev Jesse Jackson’s legacy by coming together in the power of love to become the America we’ve never yet been.Explore more on these topicsJesse JacksonOpinionCivil rights movementMartin Luther KingRaceUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

As president, he has deployed the power of the state to expand his personal brand,adding his nameto the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the US Institute of Peace, a class of new navy warships, and even investment accounts for millions of children.Trump is now eyeing yetmore grandiose targets in his self-aggrandizement spree. He wants Congress to rename New York’s Penn Station and Washington Dulles international airport in his honor. But there’s a catch:Trump reportedlytold Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, that he would unfreeze billions of dollars in federal funding for a major infrastructure project in the north-east – if Schumer supported renaming the two sites.The presidentseemingly threatenedto hold federal funding, which had already been approved by Congress, hostage in his relentless campaign of self-promotion. Even by the standards that Trump set after a year back in the White House, when he has systematically dismantledanti-corruption lawsbuilt over decades and used the presidency toenrich himself and his family, trading naming rights as a political favor is a new low. Trump appears to have tried to leverage a $16bn transportation project to build a rail tunnel under the Hudson River, connecting New York and New Jersey, for his personal glorification.Over the past few weeks, Trump and his aides offered shifting explanations regarding whether he sought to extract naming rights in exchange for restoring federal funds – and why the administration had suspended the project’s funding in the first place.After reportsof the quid pro quo surfaced this month, Trump said it was Schumer who had suggested renaming Penn Station after the president – a claim that the New York Democratquickly deniedas an “absolute lie”. On 10 February, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,contradicted Trump’s accountwhen she responded to a question about whether her boss had asked Schumer for help renaming the train station and airport. “About the renaming, why not? It was something the president floated in his conversation with Chuck Schumer,”Leavitt said.In October, at the start of last year’s 43-day US government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it wouldwithhold fundsfor the sprawling infrastructure program, known as the Gateway project, until it concluded a review into whether diversity practices had played a role in selecting the project’s contractors. But in astatement last month, the administration shifted its argument for suspending the funds, saying it was because Schumer and other Democrats had refused to negotiate with Trump, especially on immigration policies. “There is nothing stopping Democrats from prioritizing the interests of Americans over illegal aliens and getting this project back on track,” said a White House spokesperson, Kush Desai.The administration’s changing rhetoric – railing about diversity and “illegal aliens” – is ultimately a bureaucratic weaponization of culture war grievances to mask a presidential shakedown. On 6 February, afederal judge orderedthe Trump administration to release overdue payments for the project while a lawsuit by state officials in New York and New Jersey winds its way through the courts. By 18 February, the administrationhad released$205m in federal funds owed to the project since it withheld funding in October. Construction work on the Gateway tunnel could resume next week, after it was stopped earlier this month because funds had run out. But the US transportation departmenthas appealedthe judge’s order, and it could freeze payments once again if other courts rule in its favor.For now, Trump has failed to use the cudgel of federal funding to expand his presidential branding opportunity. But he’s still eager to satiate his impulse as a real estate mogul, trying to use his second term to slap his name on as many monuments, buildings and federal projects as possible. And Republicans in Congress are keen to flatter their leader by plastering his moniker on a range of landmarks. One Republican Congress member last yearproposed renamingDulles airport as “Donald J. Trump International Airport”, while anotherintroduced a billrequiring the National Park Service to add Trump’s face to Mount Rushmore, the monument in South Dakota which features sculptures of the US presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.Trump is alsolobbying ownersof the NFL’s Washington Commanders team to name their planned $3.7bn stadium after him, and he’sreportedly pressingUS government bodies that must approve the project to pave the way for such a tribute when the stadium opens in 2030. (When asked about these reports, Leavitt, the White House press secretary,responded: “That would surely be a beautiful name, as it was President Trump who made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible.”)No previous US president has tried to put his name on so many buildings or monuments, especially while still in office. Most leaders havewaited years or decadesfor such honors, which are usually initiated by subsequent presidents or legislators. One exception was John F Kennedy, who was memorialized shortly after his assassination in 1963, with a federal building and the Kennedy Space Center named after him. In 1964,Congress renameda planned national cultural center in Washington in JFK’s honor – and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has served as a “living memorial” to him since it opened in 1971.In December, Trump’s name wasadded to the Kennedy Centerafter a vote by its board of trustees, a majority of whom were appointed by Trump last year, when he purged the board and installed himself as its chair. That decision promoted outrage and alawsuit by a Democraticlawmaker, arguing that only Congress has the authority to change the institution’s name. If a new US administration, or a Democratic-controlled Congress, takes power, it’s very likely to remove Trump’s name from the center.The US has drafted a coin featuring Trump. Here’s a better way to immortalize him | Robert ReichRead moreThe Kennedy Center’s renaming backfired on the president in other ways, with a cascade of high-profile artists and groups declaring that they wouldcancel performances. On 1 February, Trump abruptly announced that he plans toclose the centerfor two years of renovations, starting in July. It seems Trump decided to avoid the embarrassment of keeping open a cultural institute that now bears his name but fails to attract enough high-level programming.Many Americans are also getting tired of Trump’s endless self-promotion and narcissism. ACNN pollreleased last month found that 58% of the US public thinks Trump has “gone too far” in using the power of the presidency. In response to another question about Trump’s “changes to cultural institutions such as the Kennedy Center and the Smithsonian”, 62% of Americans said he had “gone too far” on that as well. But among the mostdamaging responseswas that only 37% of those surveyed said Trump “puts the good of the country above his personal gain” – meaning that nearly two-thirds of respondents think the president is mostly out for himself.The recent CNN poll,among others, show that Americans are put off by Trump’s brazen attempts toprofit from the presidencysince he returned to office. But the potential conflicts around Trump’s campaign to enrich himself and his family are complicated, especially as the White House insists Trump hasno conflictsof any kind. It’s easier for Americans to see through the hypocrisy of a leader who claims to be addressing deep economic problems while spending a lot of time building – or renaming – monuments to himself.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS CongressUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Our leaders are playing alongShada IslamPeople like me were targets of the Islamophobia that gripped the west after the US-led ‘war on terror’. Now I fear a chilling sequel is on the wayThu 19 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 03.22 ESTShareTwenty-five years ago, George W Bush persuaded European leaders to back his “war on terror”. That disastrous project cost millions of lives and caused mass displacement of people from across the Middle East. It normalised racism and hatred for Muslims, refugees and racialised minorities in the US and Europe. I fearMarco Rubio’s speechat the Munich Security Conference, with its calls to defend white, western, Christian civilisation against supposedly contaminating racialised migrants – and the standing ovation he received from European elites – may mark a chilling sequel.Rubio’s language of a shared and superior American and European civilisation differs from that of his bosses, Donald Trump and JD Vance. His tone is more emollient but his outreach is conspiratorial. Rubio talks of migration and identity and civilisational anxiety, rather than terrorism and hard security threats as Bush once did. In his Munich speech, Rubio flattered Europeans about the continent’s colonial past. He denied preaching a message of xenophobia or hate, and instead framed his call to defend national borders as entirely respectable, dutiful and a“fundamental act of sovereignty”.The message of nativist exclusion, however, remained unchanged. Havinglived throughand reported on the aftermath of 9/11, I am acutely aware of the racist subtext and Islamophobic dog whistles that lurk behind such white-supremacy-tinged discourse, and the fears and even violence this can unleash.The anxious debates that were triggered all those years ago on Islam’s place inEurope, about loyalty and belonging and about Muslims representing an impossible-to-integrate “other”, continue to haunt European Muslims today.This is not alarmism. At a time of geopolitical precarity, not least over Ukraine, European leaders are understandably anxious not to alienate an already unpredictable US ally. But racism, however coded and cloaked as natural and virtuous, must be called out. Judging by the applause Rubio received in Munich, I fear that too many European leaders have already signalled their readiness to play along, either because they share Trump’s worldview or because it feels geopolitically expedient to do so.Yet, if we want to protect multiparty liberal democracy and push back against the far right, we should be far more wary not only of toxic speeches from across the Atlantic but of Trump’s close ties to Europe’s xenophobic parties and the many ways in which the US’s Maga politicians are legitimising far-right ideologies. The fact that the US state department may soon be fundingpolicy-aligned European thinktanksand charities should be ringing alarm bells across the continent.When I hear Trump, Rubio and their European acolytes, I wonder why so few of the EU’s political elite dare to say out loud that we have heard this stigmatising language of exclusion before – and we know where it can lead. That we are not going to follow the US’s lead. That colonialism was not a glorious enterprise but caused immense death and destruction. That once, Jews, too, were portrayed as a threat to white Christian Europe and accused of weakening nations from within.That today, the targets of what the British author Hanif Kureishi calls Europe’s “collective hallucination” about the power of unwanted outsiders to colonise and contaminate may be migrants, Muslims, and black and brown people. But the narrative about who belongs, and who does not, is dangerous and corrosive for all of us.It is difficult to swim against the tide. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, a rarity among European leaders in that he is trying to talk facts rather than fiction about migration, has run into strong opposition not only from the far right but from senior EU policymakers who portray hisdecision to regularise500,000 undocumented migrants and asylum seekers as undermining the EU’s deterrence message. The EU migration commissioner, Magnus Brunner, a conservative Austrian politician, haswarned that Spain“must ensure [its] decisions do not have negative consequences in other parts of the union”, conveniently ignoring the fact that hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants are already embedded in Europe’s labour markets, and that many EU states are signing labour-mobility agreements with countries in the global south even as they engage in migrant-bashing in public.Instead of recognising these uncomfortable facts, Brussels is focused on securing European parliament backing for Brunner’s “simpler and more effective return procedures” to step up and accelerate the deportations of undocumented people, including potentially sending them to offshore centres in non-EU countries. These plans,according to rights groups, would expand and normalise ICE-like immigration raids and surveillance measures across the continent.Why Marco Rubio’s ‘reassuring’ speech to Europe was nothing of the kind | Nathalie TocciRead moreEurope’s leaders really should know better. Instead of being seduced and reassured so easily by Rubio’s faux flattery, they should find the moral courage to stand up to Maga’s divisive discourse and ask, asSánchez didrecently: “When did recognising rights become something radical? When did empathy become something exceptional?”I know it is easy to fall in line with the dominant narrative and how difficult it is to stand up for one’s values. Soon after 9/11, a colleague took me aside and said that if I wanted to “succeed in Europe”, I should stop denouncingIslamophobiaand align with the emerging dominant narrative of Muslims as inherently violent or, better still, condemn Islam itself as backward and barbaric. The alternative, he warned, would be very difficult.He may have been right about the difficulty. But what still strikes me, more than two decades on, is how shocking that suggestion felt at the time. The idea that a European identity and a Muslim one were fundamentally incompatible was not yet mainstream. That today the same sentiment, voiced by Rubio, is met with applause rather than rebuttals in Munich is a troubling sign of how bias and prejudice – when they are not called out – can become embedded in Europe’s discourse and its politics at every level.Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs.

These families have escaped oppression after supporting our military engagement in their country. Now they are proud Australians making an outstanding contribution to the state.Therefore I find it very difficult to accept the musings from certain conservative commentators this week, including those within my party, questioning the value of multiculturalism and a society that cherishes diversity.I’m talking of course about comments such as those from Tony Abbott, who said he has “serious concerns” about multiculturalism, preferring how our immigration policy was run in the “50s, 60s, and 70s” – during the White Australia policy. “Our character is essentially Anglo-Celtic and Judaeo-Christian. That’s what has made our country attractive to migrants, and we should keep it that way,” he said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailMore recently we have had the pronouncements of the new Liberal leadership which talks of “Australian values” that must be adopted before you can enter our country. On face value this is absolutely right. However, it is not right if, as some fellow travellers have implied, these “values” extend to migrants having to agree to a “way of life” akin to that of the 1950s.Then there is the recent uttering of Pauline Hanson. I will not repeat them here. This thinking, that all in the Muslim community must be viewed with suspicion, is the inevitable ugly destination for seeking the primacy of one culture and belief system, to the denigration of others.Race commissioner calls on Pauline Hanson to apologise amid condemnation of ‘reprehensible’ Muslim commentsRead moreCommentary about the superiority of certain cultures takes us to dangerous places in our public discourse, when used to stoke anxiety and justify dramatic changes to the longstanding philosophies that underpin who we invite and how we welcome and settle them in this country. The current public discourse has given me cause to reflect on the Liberal party’s moral compass and the bearing we should follow.In a noisy world saturated by disparate views, the loudest and the most populist often dominate. Community leaders must lead public opinion not just follow and adopt what is popular. It is incumbent on leaders to strongly and unequivocally condemn racist rhetoric. This is the direction that I have decided to journey and I believe the Liberal party must do likewise. It is no longer acceptable (if it ever was) to indulge or overlook the moral challenges presented by certain groups (eg Advance) that seek to create fear and anxiety around migration levels or single out a particular community for political advantage.It is not controversial to demand that all those who settle in Australia must accept the inherent values of our nation. This principle is founded on the importance of displaying mutual respect and courtesy to one another. However, it is another thing again to suggest, as some self-proclaimed guardians of conservatism have done, that once settled and enjoying citizenship these Australians must henceforth always ascribe to “Australian values” or the “Anglo-Celtic” view.As a Celt I am always bemused by the liberal use of the term “Anglo-Celt” and especially the recent attempted descriptions of its characteristics. For me it does not describe my character or that of the nation I served in conflict. My family left the coast of Scotland to escape the hard crofting life. My experience and that of my ancestors is in many ways similar to the many who find themselves on our shores today.How a hardline ‘Trump-style’ Liberal immigration policy to ban migrants from Gaza and Somalia was developedRead moreTherefore it is my view that the better way forward is to take the wisdom inherent in all cultures and imagine together the future we desire. So while I agree that it is important to debate the idea of what Australia is and should be, I believe we should not be guided by the nostalgia and sentimentality of a select few. Otherwise we will make our lodestar the past and tragically forsake the better path; that of aspiring to be a community that thrives from a collective aspiration as well as defends itself because of our mutual obligations and ties to one another.All of us in the body politic have a responsibility to speak the truth and resist popularity for its own sake. To do otherwise is to take the path of the demagogue. While change is inevitable, it will advance our nation if we always remember that our society flourishes not from uniformity but rather from valuing justice and decency. It is my hope that it is these virtues that always guide our public discourse and our behaviours.If the Liberal party is to return to favour with the Australian public, we must clearly demonstrate we can govern for all in our nation. The party must not succumb to surfing populist opinion. The party was founded to not only cherish conservative virtues but also be progressive in their application. To cut racist rhetoric from the body politic is both conservative and a progressive act. But it is so much more than that. It is moral leadership.Andrew McLachlan is a Liberal senator in South AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

And despite Jessie Buckley’s incredible performance in Hamnet, I am firmly on Rose Byrne’s teamThu 19 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 09.02 ESTShareEvery year around this time, I become like a cliche TV husband who disappears from his wife and children’s lives in order to follow footy season. I do that as well but, in this case, it’s movie awards season. A sport for people who like sitting down and being quiet.I know it’s not a unique characteristic to have but I love movies and I’m not afraid to admit it. I love watching them, I love discussing them and I love listening to hours and hours of podcasts where other movie lovers and experts discuss them. This time of year is prime movie dissection time. We are deep into the season. The most talked-about movies of the year compete in a series of awards shows before the grand final in a few weeks at the Oscars.The mother of all meltdowns: Rose Byrne on playing a parent cracking up in her taboo-busting new filmRead moreLeading up to the big day there is an overflow of discussion about the awards, who is competing, who was snubbed, who is most likely to win and why. At this point in the season there is still debate over some categories, which keeps things interesting, meaning we can hope for some surprises on the night. However, most people agree that one award is on lock, and unfortunately it just happens to be the one I desperately want someone else to win. No offence to Jessie Buckley in Hamnet, who gives an incredible performance and is the heavy favourite – but I thinkRose Byrnein If I Had Legs I’d Kick You should take the best actress statue instead. Not just because I think her performance is amazing – but because I really want her to have an Oscar in her house.I am not the first person to talk about how talented Byrne is, who has shone in many things for many years. As soon as Australia saw her in Two Hands (RIP beautiful Heath), we knew she had something special. However, I think for too long she has flown under the radar as one of our actualgreatestactors. She is getting her flowers now, winning a Golden Globe and being Oscar-nominated for an intense performance that carries an entire movie, much of it in a close up on her face, where she conveys an immense range of emotion.Range and consistency are the keywords that come to mind when defining Byrne as a movie athlete and the reason I think she has been underrated for a lot of her career. She began acting at 13, was rejected from every major drama school in Australia including Nida and Waapa (oops you guys), and was only 18 years old when she was cast in Two Hands. She did stage, movies and then the work that I personally first discovered her true brilliance in – the legal thriller Damages. That show rested on the chemistry between the two leads, meaning Byrne had to stand toe-to-toe with the giant Glenn Close, and she did it with confident ease. She went on to star in the Insidious franchise, requiring her to be scared of ghosts, which she did with aplomb. She was in an X-Men movie, doing superhero stuff really well, I assume (I haven’t seen this one), and in Troy (doing Trojan princess stuff epicly). All of that is evidence enough of her range but then comes what tips her into the “great” territory – her skill as a comedy actor.Oscar nominations 2026: the full listRead moreShe blew people away with her breakthrough role in Bridesmaids, where she showed her hilarious comedy chops against the great Kristen Wiig. She was one of the best parts of Bad Neighbours, shining against a comedy stalwart like Seth Rogen. And in the underrated Rose Byrne film I recommend most, Spy, she plays a Russian arms dealer, a fully formed comedic character who gets more laughs than Melissa McCarthy. Even in a movie as dramatic as If I Had Legs, she delivers dark humour perfectly. To excel in thrillers, romances, dramas and horror is impressive in itself – but to be just as excellent at comedy as well is special, and rare.On top of this, Byrne has seemingly not lost her Australian accent – she’s still one of us. Every comments section under every interview has people exclaiming they never knew she was Australian. Or, if the poster is American, exclaiming they never knew she was British. I have to admit that Jessie Buckley is also talented enough to switch between genres and I know that she has also mastered the American accent.But still. I want Rose Byrne to win. She’s my home team and so I will be spending the next few weeks watching movies, listening to people talk about movies and hoping for an underdog upset at the big game.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsRose ByrneOpinionOscars 2026ActingcommentShareReuse this content"

The novel, which remains a GCSE set text, has been a staple of secondary school English departments almost since its publication in 1954. The decision to include a diverse cast, including the excellent Winston Sawyers who plays Ralph, will probably be viewed by many as a progressive move, ensuring that not only white actors are offered roles and not only white people are represented on screen. But for all its progressive aspirations, an adaptation like this obscures some of the most interesting themes discernible in the book.It’s important to state at the outset that I am certainly not suggesting there are too many Black and Asian people on television. The opposite is often true. Instead, I’m questioning what aspects of Golding’s original story are obscured by the inclusion of Black and Asian actors in the series.A key trope of the “Robinsonade” genre, that takes its name from Daniel Defoe’s 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe, is white English men finding themselves on an island where they encounter non-European Others. If you’re not thinking about this, it is hard to understand Piggy’s declaration in Golding’s text: “We’ve got to have rules and obey them. After all we’re not savages. We’re English; and the English are best at everything.”The colour-blind approach to casting at the expense of story is not new, nor is the issue undiagnosed. Writing about Bridgerton in 2022, Gary Youngedescribedthe decision to employ a diverse cast as offering “the depiction of racial difference in the absence of racial inequality”. In the US, Ishmael Reed wrote the play The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda in response to Hamilton, drawing attention to how an inclusive cast obscured a racist past. The same might be said of another of Thorne’s projects, his 2020 film The Secret Garden.What is lost by this approach to adaptation and storytelling? For one thing, Golding’s tale loses some of its original potency, and meaning, when abstracted away from the context of British colonialism and racism.Golding envisaged Lord of the Flies as something of a response to RM Ballantyne’s The Coral Island, a Robinsonade boys’ adventure story that glorified British civilisation and treated racial hierarchies as natural. Robinsonades, which also include films such as Swiss Family Robinson, The Admirable Crichton, Lost in Space and The Martian, depict people (men, in the main) finding themselves in inhospitable climates, remote islands, where they are forced to survive by dint of their ingenuity and sure moral compass. Often, these survivors have their humanity brought into sharper focus through encounters with racialised others. This is the vision conjured up by Piggy’s reference to savages, a trope that can be traced right back to Defoe’s book and which even finds its way into the US Declaration of Independence in uneasy tension with the claim that “all men are created equal”, and suggesting that those labelled savages are not in fact to be regarded as fully human.The original edition of Golding’s book contained usage of the N-word, which was replaced in subsequent editions with the word “Indians”. These terms are used to indicate a racial hierarchy and in the traditional Robinsonade, this racial hierarchy is usually, and unapologetically, endorsed (spoiler: white European men are always at the top). Golding’s novel is certainly not unproblematic, but through irony and self-reflection, it opens itself up to be read as an anticolonial text. Informed by the events of the second world war, he departs from the Robinsonade tradition in suggesting that the “savagery” in fact lies within these upper-class white English boys. Is the same true for Thorne’s adaptation? It has clearly provided opportunities for actors of colour, which is important – but in rehabilitating a monocultural “classic” through diverse casting, it has also obscured important readings.Thorne has taken characters that are classed, gendered and raced in Golding’s book and decided that only two of those three identities are of consequence in his series. A story often viewed as dystopian becomes a racial utopia. At a time when so much racism is articulated through patriarchal notions of asserting dominance and protecting “our women” from those not like us, this feels like a curious retreat – a white flight, if you will – from how notions of masculinity are deeply entangled with both gender and racial hierarchies.Darren Chetty is a writer and academic, and co-author with Karen Sands O’Connor ofBeyond the Secret Garden: Racially Minoritised People in British Children’s BooksDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But Labour has good plans – and with the political landscape fragmented, it could yet prevailThu 19 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 07.52 ESTShareIn the summer of 1992 John Major was riding high. Selling himself as the everyman leader voters could relate to, Margaret Thatcher’s successor as prime minister had just won an election against the odds and had a few months when all seemed well.ThenBlack Wednesdayhappened,the 1992 sterling crisis, and after George Soros and his fellow speculators ousted Britain from the European exchange rate mechanism it was never the same again. Major became the man with the reverse Midas touch. He could do nothing right. He became a figure of fun. The press was merciless.Keir Starmer is the new John Major. True, there has been nothing as totemic as Black Wednesday in the past 18 months, merely a drip feed of bad news.Voters who expected Starmer to be a fresh start after 14 years of Conservative incompetence and sleaze have suffered from a bad dose of buyer’s remorse, with the Green party and Reform UK the beneficiaries of rapid public disillusionment.Once a prime minister has a reputation for being hapless, the impression is hard to shift.Major lost the 1997 electionby a landslide even though the economy had performed strongly in the five years after Black Wednesday. Starmer doesn’t even have that going for him.Growth is weakand this week there was news thatunemployment has risento its highest in almost five years.The fragmented state of British politics means it is still just about conceivable that Labour will win the next election. For that, though, four things need to happen. First, Starmer has to go. Voters feel he is not up to the job of being prime minister and he will remain in office only until the Labour party agrees on who should succeed him. Then the axe will fall.Second, the government needs to stop shooting itself in the foot. Labour was guilty of unforced errors when it came to power and has performedU-turn after U-turn. The uncertainty created by the 2024 and 2025 budgets has meant businesses have been hesitant about investing. The increase in employers’ national insurance contributions was what it says in the economics textbooks – a tax on jobs. Life isparticularly tough for young peoplelooking for work.Third, a successor to Starmer needs to show he or she has a coherent strategy. Here, if you look hard enough, there is material with which to work because – contrary to the current conventional wisdom – Labour was broadly in tune with the public mood at the 2024 election. It knew voters wanted extra investment in the NHS, more money spent on Britain’s clapped-out infrastructure, a shift in the workplace balance of power in favour of employees, a boost to manufacturing, higher taxes on the rich and an improvement in living standards.Labour has delivered on most of these things. Rachel Reeves’s first budget providedextra cash for the NHSandchanged accounting rulesso that the government could increase public investment. There is an industrial strategy focusing on eight specific potentialgrowth sectors, and a bill to provide workers with fresh rights.Now, it could be argued that this has not gone far enough and that focus has been lost due to the constant screw-ups. That’s true, but even so, higher public spending paid for by a mixture of borrowing and taxes, a plan to boost manufacturing output and an attempt to end the worst excesses of the labour market could form the kernel of a centre-left programme.Where Labour has failed to deliver is on growth, and in particular on growth in living standards, whichfell in the second half of 2025. After more than a decade and a half in which incomes per head rose only marginally and the state of the public realm deteriorated, Labour has so far offered more of the same. Patients are stillwaiting for treatment on trolleysin hospital corridors. The roads are stillfull of potholes. Starmer says that change will take time, but there is no point in saying the public needs to be patient. The public has had it with being patient.So the final condition for a Labour recovery is that the economy starts to motor. There is no real prospect of a return to the rapid growth of the mid-1990s, but things should get better from here. If nothing else, the sluggishness of the economy will force the Bank of England tocut interest rates.Internationally, things should also be calmer than they were during the first year of Donald Trump’s second term. Despite the dire predictions, tariffs have not proved to be a wrecking ball for the global economy.The conditions are ripe for business investment to pick up.Inflation will soon be back to its 2% targetand interest rates are coming down. The impacts of past shocks that helped delay capital spending – Brexit, the pandemic, the war in Ukraine – have faded. Tax breaks for investment announced by the Conservatives combined with the measures Labour has introduced – higher employer NICs and above-inflation increases in the minimum wage – have made capital spending relatively less expensive and hiring labour relatively more expensive.After years in which it has repeatedly done worse than forecast, the economy is now poised for a period of higher investment, higher productivity and higher living standards. The pick-up won’t be spectacular and it will be too late for Starmer.

The posting of non-consensual intimate images is part of that crisis, and it must stopThu 19 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 03.21 ESTShareTackling violence against women and girls is not just a priority for my government. It is central to who I am.Before entering politics, when I led the Crown Prosecution Service as director of public prosecutions, I worked with victims of rape, domestic abuse and sexual violence, and I saw, up close, the lifelong damage these crimes cause. And I learned that when systems fail victims, the harm does not end, it deepens.Justice must begin with listening to victims. They are why I refuse to accept that abuse is inevitable. And they’re why I made halving violence against women and girls a central commitment of this government.That is an ambitious goal. Having spent the best part of two decades trying to drive up prosecutions, I know the challenges we face.But let me be clear: this is a national emergency. It requires an immediate and uncompromising response.And it also requires an honest conversation about the causes of abuse. Because violence does not exist within a vacuum. Our work cannot begin only when violence occurs – it must start much earlier.That means confronting an uncomfortable truth: misogyny is woven into the fabric of our institutions and stitched into every aspect of modern life. And it continues to cause real harm.Despite the brave actions of victims, campaigners and my fellow parliamentarians, too often, misogyny is excused, minimised or ignored. The arguments of women are dismissed as exaggerated or “one-offs”. That culture creates permission. It tells some men that boundaries are negotiable and accountability is optional. And it teaches young boys, watching from the sidelines, that disrespect can be rewarded.It exists in sport, culture, law and beyond. And, of course, in our politics. No institution can pretend it is immune.That is why I am determined to transform the culture of government: to challenge the structures that still marginalise women’s voices. And it’s why I believe that simply counting how many women hold senior roles is not enough. What matters is whether their views carry weight and lead to change.Others want to take us backwards. This week,Suella Braverman announcedthat Reform UK would scrap theEquality Actif it got into government. A piece of legislation developed by my colleagueHarriet Harmanto address decades of discrimination. Against working people. Disabled people. Pregnant women. A reckless decision that would undoubtedly put power back into the hands of the already powerful.So I am determined to lead from the front. Because if we want to change culture, leadership matters. But our work must stretch much further than Westminster. Not just into our workplaces around the country, but on to our phone screens too.Because in the digital age, misogyny spreads faster, travels further and does more damage than ever before. Platforms that were meant to connect us have too often become spaces of intimidation and exploitation. Keyboard cowards commit violence without having to leave the comfort of their own sofa.One of the most devastating examples is the sharing of non-consensual intimate images. The type of story that, as a parent, makes your heart drop to your stomach.Too often, those victims have been left to fight alone – chasing takedown of harmful content site to site, reporting the same material again and again, only to see it reappear elsewhere hours later. That is not justice. It is failure. And it is sending a message to the young people of this country that women and girls are a commodity to be used and shared.So today, my government is changing that. We are putting tech companies on notice: any non-consensual intimate image that is flagged must be taken down within 48 hours. We must create a system where a victim reports once, and it’s removed everywhere, on multiple platforms, and automatically deleted if it is reuploaded.We are also designating creating or sharingthese images as a priority offence underthe Online Safety Act, so they are treated with the seriousness they deserve.These measures build on ourviolence against women and girls strategy, published before Christmas, with more than 200 commitments across prevention, victim support and prosecution.They reflect a simple principle: the burden of tackling abuse must no longer fall on victims. It must fall on perpetrators – and on the companies that enable harm.This is a national emergency. But it is also a test of our values. I am determined that this country will meet it.Keir Starmer is UK prime ministerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Posed by modelsOpinionConsumer affairsIt seemed like a cold day in hell before my fridge would be finally delivered. Then there was a miraclePaul DaleyA tetchy exchange with an irascible removalist was just the beginning of a week of broken whitegoods promisesWed 18 Feb 2026 22.36 ESTLast modified on Thu 19 Feb 2026 11.12 ESTShareAs far as mundane domestic tasks go, replacing an old refrigerator with a new one seemed pretty straightforward.First, go to a whitegoods store with measurements of the cavity into which the new refrigerator must fit. Then choose an appliance. Next, confirm that the store can arrange for the removal of the old fridge when the replacement is delivered. Pay. Arrange for the date of delivery and retrieval.We settled on the big day.Two men arrived in a truck. The “team leader” (as he referred to himself) asked to see the fridge that had to be removed before the replacement could be put in its place.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsImportant context: the new fridge was for a granny flat above a garage, accessed by a single flight of stairs leading to a standard doorway beyond which the ceiling tapers downwards. The store was informed of this on the delivery instructions. Nine years ago, when we moved in, the removalists had no problem getting the existing fridge in.I showed the team leader the old fridge.“We’ll never get that down the stairs. It’s too big,” he said.“But removalists managed to get it up the stairs no problem.”“Do we look like removalists?”They did. Still, I wasn’t sure quite how to answer this question, so I suggested instead, “How about you just give it a try?”“Are you saying I’m lying to you?”This situation felt like it was a) gettingKafkaesque, and b) unnecessarily escalating. I didn’t answer.Tim Dowling: I’ve already used up all my optimism for the year. What now?Read moreTeam leader broke the silence: “Where do you want the new fridge then?”“In the space, right there, that will be vacant when you remove the old one.”“How about we just leave it downstairs in the garage.”“How about you just take it back to the warehouse and I’ll telephone the store!”Told that these deliverymen had been out of figs to give when it came to this fridge swap, the people at the store were helpful. They assured me a new team of “polite and helpful” delivery people would return with the fridge next morning.This team was nice. But they looked at the staircase, the doorway and the old fridge and told me that the fridge in the truck would never fit.But I’d measured carefully, I assured them. They showed me the dimensions of the fridge they were delivering. It was indeed way too big. Because they had brought the wrong appliance. They would, they said, take it back and return with the correct one.I didn’t want to take any chances. So I called the store whose staff member was yet again apologetic. I cancelled the original order and then ordered another significantly smaller refrigerator so there could be no further problem.Family members started asking me what was happening with the new fridge. When would it finally arrive? I mean, how hard could this possibly be?Another delivery duo arrived next morning with the significantly smaller fridge.The team leader (I was wondering by this stage how many people constitute a team) asked where was the other fridge that had been delivered yesterday? I explained it had been returned to the store.“It says here that you’ve still got it. I’m sorry, but we can’t deliver the new one until you give us the one that we are exchanging it for.”“But I don’t have it.”“I know you don’t. But it says hereexchange. So, you see, I can’t leave the new one unless yesterday’s delivery comes back with us. And anyway, just looking at that old fridge, we’ll never get it out of the flat and down the stairs.”The store said they’d straighten it out. It would all be fixed the next day.That night family members started making fridge jokes. “How many dads does it take to get a new fridge delivered?”I tried to explain. That night I dreamed of fridges.The next day the same thing happened again. I felt teary. Confused. Angry.Like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. I talked incessantly about fridge deliveries.Come Day Five of Waiting for Whitegood, I was wondering if this was what the rest of my life looked like. The fridge was supposed to come that day. But the team and the fridge never did.The next day the store rang me. A team would come, remove the old fridge, unpack the new one and put it in place.“I’m sorry but I just don’t believe you,” I said.But then it actually happened. It was a seamless operation on the day.I still can’t really laugh about it when family members say, “So, tell us the story about the new fridge.”Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsConsumer affairsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

The city’s bus station, the largest in Europe when it opened in 1969, is a brutalist masterpiece. Next month, a new public building opens opposite the bus station built with similar aspirations to transform local lives: a youth centre.To a generation raised whencuts had gutted services– between 2010-11 and 2023-24,local government spending on youth services fell by 73%andmore than 1,000 youth centres closed– the idea of a place designed just for young people may seem as anachronistic as coach travel, but 2026 brings big changes to youth services in the UK.View image in fullscreenHaçienda heritage … Vault Youth Zone in Preston.Photograph: Gareth GardnerThe government’sYouth Matters strategy, launched in December 2025, is the first national youth strategy in 15 years. It promised £500m investment over a decade to rebuild the service with a priority of creating 50 Young Futures (YF) hubs, with eight pilot schemes in Nottingham, Manchester, Birmingham, Brighton and Hove, Bristol, Leeds, Tower Hamlets in London and Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.It’s hoped that YF hubs will provide integrated support for mental health and employment skills in one place, room for sports and arts activities and a digital and physical safe space where young people “feel like they belong”. It’s a utopian check list that forces the question: what will these specialist places for young people look like?ForJohn Puttick, the architect behindPreston’s Youth Zone(now called Vault, a name chosen by local people), that space has to be something that young people are proud of. Puttick hasn’t worked on the YF hubs, but his practice has created community buildings throughout the UK, including youth centres in Grimsby and Blackburn with another slated for Thurrock. He works with the charityOnSidewhich creates centres for people between eight and 18 years old (or up to 25 with additional needs), in economically disadvantaged areas.“In Preston, we wanted the Vault to feel like a new civic presence, prominent, something that young people identify with. We spent a long time thinking about how to make the building playful and welcoming, but aspirational,” says Puttick.Externally this means yellow and black columns under a folded concrete facade, which mirrors the lauded bus station. Inside, Vault feelsswaggeringly aspirational.A double-height, open-plan central space houses a cafe and a gaming area with clear sightlines to a football pitch, kitchen, music rooms, climbing wall and sports hall – fostering a sense of community and flooding the space with as much natural light as Preston has to offer in February.View image in fullscreenSwaggeringly aspirational. … indoor football pitch at the Vault Youth Zone.Photograph: Gareth GardnerAnd if the interiors zoned by colour, columns and diagonal striped fittings bring a flicker of nostalgia to some of the parents and grandparents dropping off their children, there’s a reason: the scheme was created byBen Kelly, designer of Manchester’s fabled Haçienda nightclub. It’s not such an archaic reference as you might think. Preston’s younger people are familiar with Kelly thanks to the late fashion designerVirgil Abloh’s fascination with Factory Records.Emma Warren, author of the 2025 bookUp the Youth Club, a history of UK youth services, says that the UK has periodically bestowed beautiful buildings on the young. While the philanthropic desire to help young people goes back centuries, the 1960Albemarle reportfounded the modern understanding of youth provision, leading to the construction of 300 purpose-built centres between 1960 and 1968.View image in fullscreenYesterday’s utopia … exterior of theAbbey Wood estate youth club in Woolwich, London.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesFor an idea of how these places transformed lives, Warren recommends watching the beautiful short film about Lewisham’sGrove Park Youth Club, which was created by the London county council architecture team underSir Hubert Bennett(and a team also responsible for the Hayward Gallery, Queen Elizabeth Hall and Crystal Palace National Recreation Centre).Of course, the cultural landscape now is very different from these halcyon days. Warren says thatrecent researchfound that half of the UK’s young people spend most of their free time in their room.“People talk about youth workers getting kids off the streets, but it strikes me that a lot of youth work now is about getting kids out of their bedrooms,” she says. “Parents need to understand that having their young people isolated from their peers is deeply unsafe.”Larry Botchway is the co-founding director of the award-winning design practicePOoR Collective, which focuses on architecture and education for young people. He says: “Safe, free places outside the home are essential for connection and growth. Dedicated spaces show that young people are valued members of the community, not a problem to be managed.”While buildings like Preston’s Vault give a powerful signal, not every community has the finance or land to create such impressive monuments for the next generation. That isn’t always a negative thing. Tower Hamlets in London is one of the areas picked as a pilot for the new youth strategy.View image in fullscreenSafe space … participants at the Tower Hamlets girls’ youth centre.Like the others, it was chosen due to high measures of antisocial behaviour and knife crime. But Tower Hamlets was focused on the needs of its young population before the government’s intervention. The borough has the youngestmedian age of any area in the country, with one in two children living in low-income families – and the council has been working to open a youth space in every ward over the last two years. After discovering that users of the centre were 70% male, theyopened a girls-only clublast month as a priority.The girls’ centre is simple – a suite of rooms in a modern high-street community centre – but local girls made all the decisions here. Through a survey, they chose how it was furnished, what activities are on offer and even the centre’s name. On opening night in January, the centre had the pastel colour scheme they asked for and a sofa with cushions and fairy lights in a gaming area.Some of the girls get selfies with Lutfur Rahman, the executive mayor, as he tours the facility to officially open the club – bringing with him an enormous celebration cake decorated with the logo for Young Tower Hamlets. Rahmansays that this is the only time he’ll be allowed in.Fourteen-year-old Amaira Katyal, deputy young mayor of Tower Hamlets, took the survey which informed the youth club’s design and said she had a real throwback moment when she walked into the centre. “I remember filling out the form in June last year and now it’s finally come true. Spaces for young women have been overlooked, and it feels amazing to have this place where they can come and just be.”The idea of safe spaces for young people comes up constantly in reports and conversation. Maium Talukdar, who is deputy mayor of Tower Hamlets and lead cabinet member for education, youth and lifelong learning, says that is because it’s a recurring request from young people.View image in fullscreenCritically needed … 68 Erith Hub community centre in Greater London.Photograph: Jim Stephenson“But a safe space means very different things to different people,” says Warren. “An example I talk about in my book is the 1970s group theLondon Gay Teenage Group. They used to hang out with and feel protected by some ferocious punks; that felt safe to them. I think to adults or some institutional actors, safe is often conflated with safeguarding. That has its role, but it also has limits. My guess is safety is somewhere where you’re well supported, where you feel less anxious, and where you might even have a laugh.”Caspar Rodgers is director ofAlma-Nacarchitects, the studio behind 68 Erith Hub, a new community centre in Greater London. Rodgers’ concern with the government’s policy is the expectation that spaces promote social outcomes.“Design can make community spaces more likely to be adopted, but it can’t solve issues on its own. The YF hubs have the potential to be critically needed additions to their communities. On first read, they sound like highly managed provisions which, while potentially brilliant, does tie success to the quality and funding of its management. I hope the designs focus equally on creating great places for young people to simply spend time together as much as on their agenda of crime reduction and volunteering opportunities.”For some areas, any provision will be an improvement. Puttick’s next youth centre is in Tilbury, Essex, where he grew up. “There’s basically nothing to do there, it’s a very tough environment; delivering a building there will make a huge difference.”Of the six people interviewed for this feature, at least four attended youth centres as kids and have continued to support that system as grownups.Warren not only attended a club as a kid but is a volunteer youth worker now. She thinks these experiences do make a difference. “I imagine a lot of people with structural power didn’t go to a youth club because their parents paid for their leisure activities. They missed out on those connective effects – and on all the jokes.”Mayor Rahman is someone who is in on the joke. In his short speech before handing the new centre over to the young women of Tower Hamlets he describes his experience.“I grew up round here in an overcrowded household with no space to do my homework, so I’d go to a youth centre. It helped me so much – I worked hard but I got to spend time with my friends and play at the same time.” He looks admiringly down at the vast sheet cake in front of him. “We, though, never had this kind of big cake.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Russell Crowe’s poem gets cut (2002)Typically, the Baftas have fewer memorable moments than, say, the Oscars. This is partly because the ceremony isn’t broadcast live, so viewers are essentially treated to edited highlights. However, when Russell Crowe won for A Beautiful Mind in 2002, it was his speech that got edited out. That was because he decided to recite thePatrick Kavanagh poem Sanctity, and it went on and on.When Crowe realised what had happened, he tracked down the show’s director at the afterparty, pinned him against a wall, called him a “cunt” and then allegedly kicked three chairs across the room.9. John Hurt punches a photographer (1989)In 1989, though, the awards were broadcast live. The most noteworthy moment came in the bar afterwards when John Hurt, apparently quite the worse for wear, screamed “Fuck off or I’ll kill you” at a pack of 30 photographers, who he then attempted to fight. It resulted in some spectacular photographs. Hurt himself was unrepentant, telling the Daily Express the following morning: “I’m a bad, bad boy, and I love it.”8. #BaftaSoWhite (2017, 2020, 2023)Being called out for lack of diversity is par for the course for awards shows, but the Baftas seem to get called out more than most. In 2017 (the year of Moonlight and Fences),only white people were nominatedin the best actor, best actress and best director categories, causing the hashtag #BaftaSoWhite to trend on Twitter (as it was then called). It trended again in 2020, which led Bafta to undertake a formal review of its processes, widening membership to more people from underrepresented backgrounds, implementing unconscious bias training for members and scores of other measures. But guess what? It trended again in 2023.7. ‘Babe’ attends (1996)View image in fullscreenThe unnamed piglet got its own seat, next to its handler, at the ceremony.Photograph: BaftaThe guest of honour at the 1996 awards was a pig. Ostensibly the reason for this is that Babe was released that year, which led many to believe that the piglet in attendance was Babe himself. However, that couldn’t be. Not only did the film use 48 different pigs during production, but they would all have grown to an unmanageably enormous size by the time of the ceremony. In other words, someone took a random pig to theBaftasand got away with it.6. Joanna Lumley’s anti-monologue (2019)Joanna Lumley is a national treasure, but not necessarily a natural comedian. This was the case in 2019, whenshe hosted the awardsand found herself having to perform the opening monologue, composed entirely of the scientific opposite of jokes. To Steve Coogan, who starred in Stan and Ollie: “That’s another fine dress you’ve got me into.” To Spike Lee, who made Blackkklansman: “I’m surprised it did so well at the Klan Film Festival.” The whole thing was delivered to such awkward silence, and Lumley received so many looks of genuinely sad pity from the nominees, that when Bafta came to upload it to itsYouTube channel, most of her routine was absent.5. Jack Nicholson’s acceptance speech (1975)1975 was a hell of a year for Jack Nicholson, who somehow managed to win the best leading actor Bafta for Chinatown and The Last Detail at the same time. Even more incredibly, he couldn’t make it to the ceremony because he was busy filming another classic:One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. However, as an apology he sent in the greatest acceptance video of all time. Dressed in character as Randle McMurphy and surrounded by his castmates, Nicholson smashes a window, acts increasingly perturbed and then gets hauled off by Nurse Ratched.4. The bubbly red carpet (2002)Inviting Hollywood’s great and good to wear skimpy outfits in London in winter – when it is always freezing and often raining – has always been one of Bafta’s sickest jokes. However, in 2002, the rain ended up reacting with the flame-retardant chemicals that had been sprayed over the red carpet, which resulted in the most famous people on earth having to walk through a chilly approximation of a provincial nightclub foam party. It has been said that the snafu ruined Dame Judi Dench’s shoes. For shame.3. Louis Malle is nice about British food (1975)Winners of an award typically use their speeches to reflect on their illustrious careers. Not so director Louis Malle who, upon winning in 1975 for best film, used the entirety of his 26-second speech to state that, although “about 265 people” had warned him that the food served at the Baftas would be “the worst meal of my life”, he had actually enjoyed what turned out to be “a very good meal”.2. The astronaut acrobats (2019)In 2019, the Baftas commissioned Cirque du Soleil to open the show with a breathtaking interpretive dance themed around the moon landing. This was presumably becauseDamien Chazelle’s First Manwas an early awards frontrunner. However, the film was shut out of most major categories, which meant that the show found itself lumbered with an expensive setpiece based on a film that was never going to win anything substantial. It was a mistake the Baftas would not make again – that is, unless Sunday’s ceremony opens with an expensive tribute toGabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie.‘Electric Malady? Marie, girl, what a slay’: deconstructing Ariana DeBose’s personalised Bafta rapRead more1. ‘Angela Bassett Did the Thing!’ (2023)Look, I only agreed to write this list so I could put this at No 1. Ariana DeBose’s spectacular, befuddling 2023 musical number remains my favourite moment of anything ever. To recap: at the start of the show, DeBose performed a song celebrating women in general. However, this segued into a custom rap where DeBose mentioned every female nominee by name. “Charlotte Wells we love Aftersun,” she began, to looks of bemusement from the crowd. But she pressed on. “Georgia, Helene, Blue Jean’s the one,” she continued, offering a snazzy shout out to the team behind a searing drama about Section 28. Shortly afterwards DeBose rhymed Electric Malady (a heartbreaking documentary about a man whose life has been ruined by electrosensitivity) with the phrase “What a slay.” And then, by this point visibly breathless and exhausted, she yelped the deathless phrase “Angela Bassett did the thing!” while convincingly mimicking a mosquito attack. The best thing ever to be televised, quite frankly.The 79th Bafta awards ceremony airs on 22 February on BBC One.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedBaftasAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

McLeod will pull pints for punters, there’s a dartboard where you can take aim at images of Thatcher or Trump, and visitors can explore his mixed-media artworks, spanning print, sculpture and sound, and swing by to catch drag acts, DJs and panel discussions.“I’ve even got a fruit machine that spits out chocolate coins,” he says. “Which is a comment on how these machines rinse working-class pockets for their own gain. Whereas with this work, everyone’s a winner.”View image in fullscreen‘I grew up in pubs – weddings, birthdays, funerals, disputes’ … Trackie McLeod.Photograph: @maxcgrangerUtopia takes place at Factory International’s Aviva Studios inManchester, and was commissioned by its Young Curators team. Touching on themes of nostalgia, class, identity and gentrification, it is also an ode to pubs and working men’s clubs as vital community hubs.“I grew up in places like this,” McLeod says. “All our family occasions were there – weddings, birthdays, funerals. It’s where all the disputes happened. Spaces that were cheap and cheerful but championed character and comfort. I’m trying to bring back a sense of togetherness that we’re lacking at the moment.”McLeod – whose nickname, Trackie, is based on his propensity, when younger, for bringing out a fresh tracksuit to put on when a party ran into day two – is having a very busy run. After two successful exhibitions, Fruit (2024) and Fruit II (2025), he now also has Soft Play running at the Charleston in Lewes until mid-April, where he has recreated an outdoor play park in the exhibition space. It explores “the awkward transition from childhood into teenager”, he says. “When you’re playing as an adult in these spaces – like drinking and vandalising – but are still really a kid.”View image in fullscreenExploring toxic masculinity … Nancy Boy 2024, by Trackie McLeod.Photograph: Courtesy the artistMcLeod struggled at school and didn’t connect with the art curriculum and its focus on “dead painters”, but one day an ex-student came in to give a talk. “He looked like me and sounded like me,” he recalls. “He spoke about Andy Warhol, Basquiat and Keith Haring. That was my introduction to art that wasn’t just necessarily painting. A real turning point.”He still failed art: he is dyslexic and struggled with the essays. But he “accidentally” ended up at college studying design, and then at university, trying to find his groove. “I’ve been chipping away at this for a long time,” he says. “It hasn’t been a linear path. There have been lots of ups and downs.”By the time of Fruit – which featured a whole car painted in a Burberry check, and a dovecote installed in the gallery – he felt he had found his stride; blending Scottish patter, popular culture, graphic design, 00s nostalgia and explorations of class. “It all came together,” he says.It also coincided with McLeod exploring his personal life in more depth. He had already been looking at toxic masculinity, and began to intersect it with his own experiences of growing up queer inGlasgow. In one piece – funny and absurd, but also quietly powerful and moving – he framed a long list of things that were deemed gay in school, including using gel pens, reading and crossing your legs. “It was only putting it out like that that you realise: fucking hell, that was ridiculous,” he says. “The things I would do to change myself to try and fit in at the time.”View image in fullscreen‘With this he found his stride’ … McLeod’s Burberry-clad car.Photograph: Courtesy the artist/ Matthew BarnesMcLeod has stayed in Glasgow, avoiding the frenzy of London, which he feels is “oversaturated”. He remains unrepresented by a gallery and happily part of a DIY scene. Despite his growing success, he has previously had to fund his own exhibitions to make them happen, sleeping on sofas at friends’ houses. For all the talk of representation, diversity and inclusion in the arts, that hasn’t been his experience as a working-class artist.“A lot of these galleries say they are championing underrepresented voices and most of the time they don’t,” he says. “They don’t practise what they preach. It’s just rich folk with limited life experience, pumping money into rich folk with limited life experience. The art world feeds on nepotism, privilege and the bank of mummy and daddy. There’s definitely a glass ceiling for working-class artists.”It’s been a slog for McLeod, but doing things on his own terms seems to be paying off and he now welcomes people to swing by Utopia for a pint and a chat. “I don’t have the answers, but I’m living proof that you can mark out your own path and it is possible,” he says. “But we need more working-class voices, more queer voices, and more POC voices, because it makes for more interesting art.”Trackie McLeod: Utopia is atAviva Studios, Manchester, 19-21 February. Soft Play is atCharleston, Lewes, until 12 April.Explore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsInstallationManchesterGlasgowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Who are you picking?ShermanMLightKendrick Lamar. He’s one of the few people I’ve worked with in the hip-hop world who is an actual genius. He doesn’t get enough credit for being a producer as well – because he has such a clear perspective on what he wants in his music, he knows where every sound is supposed to be. Not every artist has that approach – most are more hands off. Working closely with Kendrick would make me a better producer. That would be a great meeting of the minds, as it was when we did our couple of tracks together.How was the experience of working with the great, late David Lynch [on the trackFire is Coming]?Stephenw1979A dream come true – someone who inspired my whole artistic path. He was exactly who I hoped he would be. I got to go over to his studio and hang a couple times, and it was really special. And he never seemed to get old. Twin Peaks: The Return was one of his best works, and it was the last thing he did.View image in fullscreen‘I have to make things that challenge myself’ … Flying Lotus.Photograph: Robby Klein/Getty Images for IMDbWas it a huge step-upmaking a fairly big-budget sci-fi movie [2025’s Ash, FlyLo’s debut feature]?steve__bayleyIt was the most challenging, creative thing I’ve ever done in my life. It took five years, the whole process – maybe longer. It was hard, man, but it was so rewarding. When I saw all these little ideas I’d had start to emerge on screen, and the characters wearing the hair and outfits I’d imagined for them, in the room I’d helped design, and the special effects were going off, and the lightning was striking and everything was working, and the actors were killing it … Nothing like it, dude. And then you get to go back and edit it, and put sound and music to it ... It’s so much fun. [pauses] But I actually don’t recommend it. [laughs] Because making a movie can just eat your whole life away, your relationships, everything. It’s a huge sacrifice to jump into that world. At every turn, I wished all I had to think about was just doing the music. I’m going to continue making movies, but without abandoning the rest of my life while I’m waiting for a movie to get made.You came up with your artist name,Flying Lotus, while “lucid dreaming”, and yourUntil the Quiet Comesalbum was inspired by dreaming. Are there any dreams you can’t forgetor that you’d like to?harkmammalEven if I have a dream I’d like to forget, I’m just grateful to have had it and remembered it. I don’t really remember my dreams much these days, probably because I smoke weed before I go to bed. Sometimes I’ll be in a nightmare and I’m like: “Ooh, that was great pacing. That wassowell directed.” I have to give it up for my subconscious.View image in fullscreenFlying Lotus in Los Angeles California, in 2008.Photograph: Evan Hurd/AlamyIs there any chance of your collaboration withMF Doombeing released?AcidHouseI would love to release that stuff, but I haven’t been able to get in touch with his estate to make it happen. He had a whole bunch of music that we’d recorded and he kept asking me for more beats. I was like: “Dude, I don’t got any more beats!” But I know he recorded stuff over my beats, and it’s sitting wherever his last laptop currently is. I’ve heard one of the tracks; I know he was working on some amazing stuff.Was your aunt,Alice Coltrane, an influence on you as an artist, and how do you feel about how her legacy has been reappraised in the years since her death?pollymagooHonestly, that has been very moving for me. I wish people could have appreciated her in her time, though even if that had been the case, I don’t know if it would mean anything to her; she was beyond all that. But it’s just so awesome that she’s getting her love now. When I was coming up, people always asked her about John Coltrane this, John Coltrane that. Now it’sAlice Coltrane.I think everyone who makes art knows, deep down, no one’s going to really appreciate you until you’re dead [laughs].Will yourCaptain Murphyalterego ever resurface, and what current hip-hop artists are you inspired by?pollymagooAbsolutely, Captain Murphy will resurface. I would really like to do something with Westside Gunn, that would be fun. And Freddie Gibbs. We’ve done a track but we need to do something proper.How would you say your music has changed from release to release?ChivseyI remember when I started out how fun it was to wake up every day and everything felt brand new and uncharted. Now I’m a better musician, and I have a better understanding of what I’m doing and who I am as a person. It’s a balance between confidence, ability, innocence and understanding.‘Choosing happy is a hell of a process’: Thundercat on funk, lost friends and being fired by Snoop Dogg (possibly)Read moreYou’ve worked with some amazing vocalists. Who are some of your favourites to work with and why?steve__bayleyThundercat is always going to be my number one. In terms of newer people I’ve been working with, Dawn Richard is always kicking out cool ideas and is super inspiring, and I really liked collaborating with Devin Tracy on The Room; he has a great voice. Erykah Badu’s been such an inspiration, and the fact that she wanted to work with me was validating, like: OK, I deserve to be here. She was the real deal too – always cool ideas and a cool approach. And she introduced me to the concept of demoitis, where you fall in love with the scratch demo you made and don’t wanna change anything. Ilovedworking with Thom Yorke, just because I was a big fan of his too, but we never worked together in the studio – we’d email each other and it was a bit more remote. But I love that dude, and whenever we can get together it’s always been a nice time.The difference between good producers and great producers is knowing how to get an artist to do their best work. Every artist is going through something: they might have just broken up with their girlfriend, their mum might have just passed away. They’re trying to write a song, and they’re dealing with life at the same time. And you have to find a way to navigate all that, to get the best out of the moments you have with people. That’s the difference between just beat-making and actually producing.Have you now abandoned the LA beat scene style of music that you were initially known for or is it possible you might come back to a more glitchyboom bapsound?CoreSwayI do all those things still; I just don’t put them all out. But I feel like the whole “lo-fi beats” thing has become like Starbucks music. I have to make things that challenge myself – I want to try to do things I haven’t done before.

Its raging alt-rock is a more robust take on the lo-fi fuzz of her third album Bury Me at Makeout Creek, while UK listeners might detect a certain Britpoppy swing about its rhythm, and it ends with a guitar solo so jarringly distorted it sounds as if something is wrong with the stream. It was accompanied by a video that featured the singer as a headscarf-sporting rural mother, trying to protect her family from the attentions of the outside world with increasing violence: a milkman gets attacked, her daughter’s potential suitor is beaten bloody. It’s both funny and unsettling: there are references to Rapunzel,Grey Gardens, Grant Wood’s American Gothic and Shirley Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle – a litany of the wilfully isolated.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Nothing’s About to Happen to Me.The visuals set the tone for the rest of Nothing’s About to Happen to Me, an album on which you’re never far from its author expressing a longing to disappear; to be, as she puts it on Instead of Here, “where nobody can reach”. On opener In a Lake, she extols moving to the city from a small town, not in search of bright lights and excitement, but obscurity, a means of obliterating your own history: “Some days you just go the long way to stay off memory lane.” On I’ll Change for You, she hymns bars – “such magic places” – precisely because of their anonymity: “You can be with other people without having anyone at all.” And on Rules, she’ll “get a new haircut … be somebody else”. All this is set to beautifully crafted music that splits the difference between alt-rock, country-infused acoustic lamentation and grander ambition: the brilliance of Rules lies in the disparity between the hopelessness of its lyric and the thickly orchestrated, perky, early 70s easy listening backing.Mitski’s relationship with celebrity is fraught – enough that herWikipedia pagehas a section ominously headlined “views on her fanbase” – and was possibly not helped by her 2023 singleMy Love Mine All Mine, which was dreamily understated but sold 4m copies in the US and made the Top 10 everywhere from the UK to the UAE. In fact, the album’s yearning for anonymity and solitude seems to have less to do with fame than a failing relationship, its awkward silences and sense of desperation sketched in painful detail on Cats and If I Leave. That central theme also seems timely and relatable regardless of the state of your love life: over the past 12 months, who hasn’t been at least temporarily been gripped by the urge to cut yourself off completely, to disconnect from the unremitting barrage of horror that constitutes the news cycle?One thing the world isn’t suffering from in 2026 is a drought of self-examining millennial singer-songwriters, publicly picking at their neuroses to a backing that sits somewhere between pop and indie, rich with references to music of the late 60s and early 70s. But that scarcely seems to matter while Nothing’s About to Happen to Me is playing, simply becauseMitskiis better at this stuff than her peers: stronger with melodies, more skilled at creating atmospheres that seep out of the headphones and into your bones, possessed of a way with lyrics where affecting lines – “I’ve been trying to start trying to be like someone you’d still like / Maybe if I could, you already would” – are balanced out by a mordant humour that undercuts any accusations of navel-gazing narcissism.The 50 best albums of 2023, No 5 – Mitski: The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are WeRead moreDead Women is alternately horrifying and hilarious, its author picturing herself as a ghost, looking on equivocally as friends and former lovers rewrite the story of her life, entirely incorrectly, in heroic terms. That White Cat, meanwhile, spins an existential where-do-I belong crisis from the sight of said cat marking out its territory in her garden: “It’s supposed to be my house, but I guess, according to cats, now it’s his house.”The album’s 35 minutes are variously thought-provoking, wrenching and lol-inducing listening. There’s a lot of unhappiness here – Mitski has talked aboutEric Carmen’s disconsolate 1975 soft rock hit All By Myself as a touchstone – but what’s emerged from said unhappiness is strangely delightful and rewarding. If misery loves company, then Mitski’s company is worth keeping.Nothing’s About to Happen to Me is released on 27 February.This week Alexis listened toThe Scratch – Pullin’ Teeth (ft Kevin Rheault)Sounds awful in theory – Irish traditional music meets heavy rock – but works to bracing effect in reality, further bolstered by Kevin Rheault’s raw-throated rapping.Explore more on these topicsMitskiAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

I was not remotely disappointed, however. I thought the show ended perfectly: when I stopped watching it after season one, episode eight.I’m going to come out and say it, so that we can start fighting straight away. I believe that almost all recent TV shows should have been one season long.Stranger Thingshad a perfect eight-episode arc: a little boy disappeared into a hellish parallel dimension and his mum (who was Winona Ryder!) fought tooth and nail to bring him back. The show’s creators, the Duffer Brothers, seemingly knew this, as they originally pitched the series as an anthology featuring a different cast of characters each season. Netflix, naturally, said no – after all, you need a franchise with familiar faces if you want to sell customisable Stranger Things terrariums at two for £30. And so by the end, the show was stretched out beyond recognition and stripped of everything that made it groundbreaking and original. By all accounts, Ryder was left with nothing to do.View image in fullscreenSandra Oh in Killing Eve. Its finale received a 3.4 rating.Photograph: Anna Molnar/BBC AmericaBut didn’t I sayalmost allrecent shows? I did, thanks. Let me list them for you quickly, so the red mist can descend upon you and distract from everything that’s important in the world. TV shows that I believe should’ve been a one-and-done include: Industry,Killing Eve, Bad Sisters, Am I Being Unreasonable?, Your Friends and Neighbors and Nobody Wants This. But let me ruin my own credentials upfront: I am so committed to my stance that I haven’t even watched the second season of Fleabag.First, you must understand that I am not claiming thatevery show ever madeshould only have one season: The Simpsons should have 12; Mad Men, seven; Buffy, five. Largely, it’s only shows made in the last decade. The problem has arisen due to our unreliable and unpredictable media ecosystem. Commissions are being cut, budgets are being slashed, risks are being aversed. There’s more competition than ever before, and showrunners simply have no idea if their shows will be renewed.This environment encourages some creatives to bring everything to the table with the first season of their show, creating something original, tight and self-contained. Christopher C Rogers, co-creator of the tech drama Halt and Catch Fire, has almost admitted as much: “I think uncertainty reinforced a hold-nothing-back mindset in the storytelling that got us to our best work quickly,” he said in 2017. Conversely, “When you hold story back or try to draw it out, the audience can tell. Not knowing if there would be a metaphorical ‘tomorrow’ really saved us from that mistake.”View image in fullscreenScoot McNairy in Halt and Catch Fire … ‘its final season was considered its best’.Photograph: Tina Rowden/AMCIn the case ofHalt and Catch Fire, this all worked out in the end: the show’s fourth and final season is considered its best, with a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But this can’t always be the case. Because while budgets continue to buffer, something else is happening that results in diminishing returns.“We live in a world of IP [intellectual property], where the safest thing to do is reboot something that has an audience,” Breaking Bad creatorVince Gilligansaid last year. Meanwhile, fellow critically acclaimed writer David Simon (The Wire) has complained he “can’t get anything made now” because “I’ll never write anything that’s going to be a franchise”. The media’s obsession with IP means that once something is successful, it’s not allowed to die. Shows must be stretched out for maximum profits, regardless of what’s best for storytelling. Stranger Thingsis not just a terrarium: ithas also been turned into a Broadway play and series of novels, and will soon have an animated spinoff.In this environment, is it any wonder that one-off shows that prove successful are renewed for season two? It doesn’t matter that the central mystery of your murder mystery was solved – there’s money to be made! “It was set out as a limited series and, you know, it has an end,” Bad Sisters creatorSharon Horganonce said of the first season show – she even called its finale a “lovely, satisfying end”. I couldn’t agree more, which is why I didn’t bother pressing play when the show somehow suddenly returned for season two.View image in fullscreenTime for last orders? … Kristen Bell and Adam Brody in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: ERIN SIMKIN/NETFLIXI’m not alone in thinking less can often be more. Killing Eve’s first series ended with an episode IMDb users rated 8.3 out of 10, but its finale – three seasons later – scored just 3.4. Meanwhile, a headline on Cracked reads: ‘‘‘Nobody Wants This’ Didn’t Need a Second Season”. I’m probably alone in not wanting more Industry – but again, I felt I watched a satisfying and complete arc in season one. A graduate wanted a job and then she got it; I was invited to ponder at what cost. I personally don’t need three more seasons of cost-pondering, even if it’s fun to watch beautiful people be bad.Listen, I don’t want you to have a heart attack, so it’s probably time to admit: I haven’t seen Succession. From what I can tell, its four seasons were all equally successful at storytelling – so maybe it’s the exception I can use to prove my rule (don’t ask me how. I told you I haven’t seen it). But because life is nothing without strong opinions you can spout across the dinner table, let me reiterate: almost all recent TV shows should have been one season long. And if you think my opinions are stupid, you’re in luck: I’m only giving you one of them. You won’t have to suffer through two.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStranger ThingsKilling EveVince GilliganSharon HorganfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His music shows an inspirational gift for melody, a sensitivity to text and a knack for turning Lutheran doctrinal poetry into first-rate music drama. How JSB got his hands on JLB’s music is unclear – there’s no evidence the two ever met – but JSB’s meticulous copying out of his relative’s work has preserved a treasure trove of music that might otherwise have been lost to the sands of time.Unbelievably, Capella Sollertia’s thoroughly idiomatic performances represent the first ever recordings of these cantatas, nearly five-and-a-half hours of music, some of which could easily pass for the work ofJS Bachhimself. Indeed, the Easter cantata, Denn du wirst meine Seele nicht in der Hölle lassen, was once attributed to Johann Sebastian as BWV number 15. It’s a perfect example of what JLB does best: shapely Italianate arias that trip along with a Frenchified courtly grace and are packed full of imaginative word painting. Trumpets and drums, sensitively deployed, create a vivid sense of occasion.Johanna Soller’s conducting is incisive yet flexible, while her splendid lineup of fresh-voiced soloists basks in sumptuous sound thanks to Ricercar’s scrupulous engineering.

Her departure comes months after she unveiled a five-year creative vision for the Barbican.“We are writing as a group of global majority creative and cultural leaders and allies to express our profound disappointment and alarm at the decision to curtail Devyani Saltzman’s tenure,”the letter said.“Ms Saltzman was appointed with great fanfare as a senior artistic leader, with a mandate to shape the Barbican’s artistic vision and deepen its relationship with communities. Her departure, after a comparatively short time in post and coinciding with the arrival of a new chief executive, raises serious questions about the institution’s commitment to sustaining global majority leadership at the highest levels.”Saltzman will leave the organisation in May and there are no plans to replace her. In the last 18 months she had become the Barbican’s public face, laying out her vision in several interviews.She was vocal about the need for London’s cultural institutions to have leadership reflecting the diverse city they inhabit. “We are actually in a new wave of next-generation leadership that hopefully is going to shift the model,” she said in 2024.The Barbican has said it is unable to comment on individual staffing matters. But signatories of the letter, who also include the Grammy-nominated sitarist and composer Anoushka Shankar, the musician and producerNitin Sawhney, the American playwright David Adjmi and the Indian novelist Kiran Desai, said this was “not an ordinary HR issue”.“This is a major public cultural institution, funded and held in trust for the people of this city and country. A decision affecting its most senior artistic role, and one of the very few leaders of south Asian and racially diverse heritage in its history, has sector‑wide and community‑wide implications,” they said.Other signatories include the Pakistani-British novelist Kamila Shamsie, the Armenian-Canadian film-makerAtom Egoyan, the British curator Mark Sealy and the former British Council arts director Skinder Hundal. Many have worked with, in and around the Barbican over decades.Barbican arts director to leave, months after revealing creative vision for centreRead moreThey called on the Barbican board and the City of London Corporation to publicly clarify whether the role had been formally deleted, the processes that led to the decision, and how artistic leadership at the Barbican would now be configured.They also asked for the publication of data on the diversity of the Barbican’s senior leadership and governance.In a response seen by the Guardian, the Barbican’s chair, William Russell, reiterated that he was unable to comment on a confidential matter concerning a staff member, and he linked to the centre’spress statementcelebrating Saltzman’s contribution.The Barbican’s leadership has had several changes over the past five years. In 2021, Nicholas Kenyon resigned as managing director after 14 years after staff told the Guardian that the Barbican was“institutionally racist”. He was followed by the former BBC arts correspondent Will Gompertz, who left aftertwo yearsin the job.Saltzman joined during a row caused by the Barbicanbacking outof hosting a talk by Mishra about the Holocaust and allegations that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.The Barbican has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBarbicanLondonSalman RushdiePankaj MishraJohn AkomfrahNitin SawhneyAtom EgoyannewsShareReuse this content"

Squid Game.Photograph: No Ju-han/NetflixBooksReviewTrip to the Moon by John Yorke review – a storytelling handbook in dire need of an editA producer shares his tips for tight storylines, but they’re marred by verbal incontinence and hyperboleHouman BarekatThu 19 Feb 2026 04.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleCreative writing handbooks are almost an industry in themselves: the fledgling author, dramatist or screenwriter can choose from hundreds of titles, all offering to unlock the secrets of storytelling. These books are of limited utility for literary fiction, where plot is secondary, but if you’re writing for the screen or stage, or working on genre fiction, they can be helpful. Commercial, plot-driven storytelling is, this is an inherently formulaic business, and a working knowledge of narrative structure is a crucial foundation for an aspiring writer.In his bestselling 2014 treatise on the mechanics of narrative,Into the Woods, John Yorke demonstrated the uncanny prevalence of five-act structure (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement) in many popular movies, plays and television dramas. He reprises this theme in his new book, which starts with a lengthy disquisition on plot architecture. The five-act framework, Yorke explains, is elegantly conducive to an emotionally compelling journey, with the protagonist typically undergoing a transformative revelation at the story’s mid-point. He illustrates this with reference to hit TV programmes such as I May Destroy You, and films including Star Wars and Terminator 2.Yorke then proceeds to meditate on the broader social significance of story structure, touching on politics, philosophy and spirituality. He observes that the rhetoric of revanchist populism is built on a specious promise of renewal: Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan is “a masterclass in condensed narrative”. The success of Netflix’s Squid Game showed that “if you can tap into the reader or viewer’s subconscious damage or grievance … and from there show a path to healing, then you are mining the most powerful narrative seam of all”. Themes of healing and reinvention also feature prominently in the rhetoric of organisations like the Church of Scientology and Alcoholics Anonymous, which promise redemption through surrender to a higher force. Indeed, Yorke believes stories fill “a god-shaped hole” in all of us, a yearning for meaning and transcendence.A good story requires conflict, broadly defined. “Conflict isn’t just waving a spear around – it’s dissonance, of any size, of any shape, or any form.” Since life is all about solving problems, Yorke – a former producer on EastEnders, and sometime head of drama at Channel 4 – suggests story structure is a microcosm of all human existence: “Equilibrium, disruption, recognition of the disruption, repair of the disruption, new equilibrium.” Or, more simply: “We exist, we observe, we change.”These are thought-provoking lessons for the novice screenwriter, who is occasionally addressed in a pedagogic second-person. But the book is let down by verbal incontinence, which rather contradicts its emphasis on the importance of keeping your audience engaged. When holding forth on politics, Yorke’s authorial voice lapses from avuncular mentor into pontificating pub bore, taking potshots at “social justice warriors” and anti-racism activists alongside far-right conspiracy theorists.Yorke makes a conspicuous number of disparaging references to to Jeremy Corbyn. In one startling snipe, he likens the internal politics of “Corybnite Labour” to China’s Cultural Revolution, the Russian pogroms and the McCarthyite purges of the 1950s. Elsewhere, a journalist who wrote a flattering book about Mao Zedong in the 1930s is credited with helping bring about the deaths of 80 million people under communism. The combination of triteness and hyperbole in these passages makes it hard to take Yorke seriously as a thinker. To hammer home his point about the dangers of ideological purity, he bastardises Yeats: “The rigid binary is God-like: a rough beast slouching towards democratic consensus, with violence on its mind.”Despite moments of insight, Trip to the Moon – which takes its title from an early French sci-fi film – feels distinctly undercooked. Yorke’s exposition becomes wearingly repetitious as the book progresses, and the prose is sloppily casual in places, with an over-reliance on intensifiers masking diminishing intellectual returns. (At one point, the word “incredibly” appears five times in the space of six short paragraphs.) “I never intended to write a second book,” Yorke concedes in the acknowledgements. Alas, it shows.Trip to the Moon: Understanding the True Power of Story by John Yorke is published by Particular (£25). To support the Guardian order your copy fromguardianbookshop.com.

Her dazzling 2020 debut,Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line, was part caper and part social satire, set in an Indian shantytown. In The Last of Earth, she points her writerly compass towards the mountains of mid-19th-century Tibet – a region then closed off to European imperialists – to meditate on the chequered history of colonial exploration, cartography and the impermanence of human existence.“It’s in the nature of white men to believe they own the world, that no door should be shut to them.” For years, the British train, coax and bribe Indians to cross over, conducting surveying expeditions on their behalf; they also venture into the “Forbidden Kingdom of Tibet” in thinly veiled disguises. Intricately researched and meticulously plotted, this immersive novel is told through the alternating perspectives of two protagonists. Balram is an Indian schoolteacher and surveyor-spy who plays guide to an English captain, clumsily dressed as a monk and intent on being the first man to personally chart the route of the revered river Tsangpo and discover where it meets the sea. Meanwhile Katherine, of part Indian heritage, is on a mission to become the first European woman to reach Lhasa and set eyes on the Potala Palace after being denied membership of the all-male Royal Geographical Society in London.Each embarking on an epic, perilous odyssey, in “a strange country whose terrain changed every few miles”, their paths inevitably cross. The cast of characters find that “at eighteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, here they were closer to gods than mortals, but this proximity to the divine had brought them no blessings, only burdens”. Storms, snow leopards and soldiers, meandering rivers and the full force of the elements are but minor obstacles in their path to glory, to writing history and leaving their mark on the world. The true test will ultimately come down to human feelings and emotions: hubris, obsession, doubt, power, guilt and grief.Like many journeys, Anappara’s narrative is full of false starts and stops, digressions and revisions. In scale and architecture, it feels reminiscent of recent novels such as Janice Pariat’sEverything the Light TouchesandFuneral Nightsby Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih. Here, too, maps deceive. History deviates from the truth. The natural world is alive. Death is always looming around the corner. “The lines the captain drew on paper appeared to Balram to be no more than a child’s scribbles on mud. If the earth shrugged, mountains would cleave, rivers would surge, seas would swallow cities and fields alike, and every map would be rendered incoherent.”The greedy, dirty colonial enterprise swallows entire communities and landscapes whole. For “this was the way the world worked. The white man had a want and to sate it brown men gave up their lives. How many native men had died triangulating Hindustan for the Great Trigonometrical Survey? Balram didn’t know because no book, no map, recorded their names or numbers.” Balram often hears the voices of those left behind: his best friend Gyan, a fellow surveyor-spy rumoured to be imprisoned in Tibet, and his own wife and children. The death of Katherine’s sister Ethel both motivates and haunts her journey and journalling on the road. The Last of Earth is scrupulous in its excavation of our spooky, imperfect pasts.Late in the novel, Balram says that “the river wasn’t a blue spiral on a map but a living thing, a creature capable of renewal. It emptied itself into the sea and recast itself every few months.” With The Last of Earth, Anappara has shown that history, too, is often not what it seems; it is a living thing, which, when recast in a different light – a novelist’s light – can offer a renewal of sorts.The Last of Earth by Deepa Anappara is published by Oneworld (£14.99).

There lurks an elfin knight who will take the virginity of any golden-haired maiden who passes through. The next day Janet, who is possessed of golden hair and a rebellious spirit, sets off for Carterhaugh. At the well, she picks a double rose which summons Tam Lin.

Una McKevitt’s black comedy brings members of the Thornton family together to mark the sale of their parental home. If family is the psychological battleground here, the house itself is alive with “triggering” elements, with designer Liam Doona’s faded decor and crammed furnishings playing a key part in the unfolding conflict.Having inherited the house from her grandmother, Sandra’s estranged daughter Kiera (Caroline Menton) now envisages a new life, free from caring responsibilities and the watchful eye of her grandmother from her full-length portrait, which dominates the room. Upstairs, unseen, Kiera’s uncle Terry is lying in a coma, and about to be moved to a nursing home. A second uncle, Daragh, arrives: “a character actor, in demand”, played with downbeat charm by Garrett Lombard, as Kiera ushers Rio (Jack Weise) out of the house, following a quick hook-up that is so contrived it clearly signals trouble.With Sandra’s whirlwind entrance from Los Angeles, spitting fury about her exclusion from the decision to sell the house, a showdown looks inevitable. Through McGuckin’s gleefully maniacal portrayal of Sandra the tone shifts from domestic realism towards farce. This glossy millionaire does not need the house, but wants it simply because she can’t have it.View image in fullscreenSpitting fury … Aislín McGuckin as Sandra.Photograph: Ros KavanaghWith a background indocumentary theatre, McKevitt has previously explored questions about caring for ageing relatives, and the balance between personal freedom and familial bonds. Here it is as if she can’t quite decide on the dramatic focus, and while the bickering about money and inheritance has the authentic ring of emotional resentment, it seems drawn-out and repetitive.As Sandra’s anger towards her dead mother drives her to extremes, the action takes a welcome swerve into absurd physical comedy, directed by Conall Morrison with fizzing energy, inventive use of a garlic crusher – and anything else to hand. While a later twist is over elaborate, by this point there is no turning back, with Lombard’s brilliantly droll Daragh finally seizing his moment in the spotlight.AtAbbey theatre, Dublin, until 28 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageAbbey theatreTheatreIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

I mean the various opium fiends, international terrorists and child murderers who make up our colourful national tapestry (see the Coleridge Way, Drake’s Trail and the Richard III Trail). So perhaps a 30-mile weekend walk dedicated to the Mortimers, and their most notorious scion,Sir Roger, is an appropriate addition to the weave.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.After all, this is the man who allegedly slept with a reigning queen (Isabella), probably killed her husband (Edward II), and certainly becamede factotyrant of the realm for three turbulent years in the 1320s, feathering his own nest relentlessly during that time. They don’t make world leaders like that any longer, do they?View image in fullscreenA view towards Mortimer Forest.Photograph: Paul Weston/AlamyRoger’s stomping ground, however, was not where you might expect: he was a marcher lord on the Welsh border, and his family trail wends its way through tranquil countryside from Ludlow in Shropshire to the quiet Herefordshire border town of Kington, the perfect distance for a weekend hike. But can such a location, so peaceful and orderly today, live up to the outrageous standards of Sir Roger? TheMortimer Trailitself has existed for some years, but now a new guidebook and app have brought this magnificently horrid hero back into the limelight.I start then in Ludlow, a town now famous for its foodie traditions, but also a place that oozes history throughout its crooked lanes. Walking down Broad Street, I admire the bay window ofThe Angel, from which Horatio Nelson waved to the crowd in 1802, with his left hand, of course. Local legend has it that the hero of the Battle of the Nile leaned out the window and shouted, “Thank you for the oak,” to the adoring crowd below. Behind him stood Emma Hamilton, his mistress, and her husband, Sir William, the trailing third in a menage that would thrill the British public until Nelson died at Trafalgar in 1805. (The Angel restaurant is currently closed but will reopen soon.)double quotation markCan such a location, so peaceful and orderly today, live up to the outrageous standards of Sir Roger Mortimer?I get my lunch under the walls of the castle atCSONS, one of Ludlow’s celebrated cafes. There is a lot of good food in this town, plus an excellent farmer’s market and at least three “parlour pubs” – front room pubs marked only by a lamp outside and often serving only one type of beer from a cask.Thecastle in Ludlowis really the start of the trail, being the seat of English borderland power in medieval times and worth a detour. Look out for thesolar wing, built for Queen Isabella who stayed here in 1328. Sir Roger’s wife, Joan, was also in attendance, apparently, but slept in a different wing. History has not recorded where Sir Roger spent the night; no doubt Netflix will, when they get hold of the story.View image in fullscreenSalwey Lodge lodge is atmospheric and lined with ancient ancestral oil portraitsThe trail sets off across Dinham Bridge, climbing up into Mortimer Forest with great views back to the castle. Watch out for the deer and goshawks that are resident in this ancient woodland. My first night is inSalwey Lodgewhose farming owners, Arabella and Hugo, not only organise walks along the trail, but have devised their own handy guiding app. They also shuttle visitors around, so no car is needed (Ludlow is on the main railway line between Shrewsbury and Hereford).The lodge proves to be the perfect place to get into the ambience of a regicide like Sir Roger. An ancestor of the Salweys was sent to the Tower for anti-monarchial tendencies and was implicated in theFarnley Wood Plotof 1663. Richard’s Castle, close to the lodge, is where he is thought to have lived, but little remains, although there is a lovely decommissioned 12th-century church worth visiting. The lodge is atmospheric, lined with the type of ancient ancestral oil portraits that most families, including my own, inadvertently forgot to commission. The superlative food comes from the house’s vegetable garden, the farm and local suppliers.double quotation markI pass only a handful of people, but see plenty of reminders that this area was once a highly militarised and dangerous borderlandDay two of the walk takes me up through more woodland to fabulous views of the Shropshire countryside, notably from an iron age hill fort atCroft Ambrey, abandoned after six centuries of occupation at around the time of Emperor Claudius’s invasion in AD 43.I pass only a handful of people on the path during the entire weekend, but see plenty of reminders that this area was once a highly militarised and dangerous borderland. All through the middle ages, the Welsh kept up a sturdy resistance to the Norman conquerors, who responded with unwavering brutality. Sir Roger, of course, was right there in thick of it until the newly crowned Edward III had the insufferable upstart hanged at Tyburn. (The ruins of Roger’s main residence,Wigmore Castle, can be seen from Croft Ambrey, but rather inexplicably the trail does not go there. The closest diversion would add five miles.)View image in fullscreenThe Riverside Inn at Aymestrey.Photograph: Martin Birchall/AlamyThe path rolls along pleasantly, unveiling magnificent panoramas of the Welsh mountains, before dropping down to the River Lugg and an overnight stop at theRiverside Inn. The food here is excellent, serving the kind of breakfast that, without some self-restraint, could nail you to an early siesta rather than set up a big day of hiking.This starts with a long ramble by the river, then up into quiet woodlands and high heaths, with plenty of historical military madness. The serene church at Byton was sacked several times by angry Welsh nobles, including the last Welsh king, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and later Owain Glyndŵr. The Mortimers, of course, were always in the mix. Llywelyn was killed in 1282 by the forces of Edmund Mortimer, Roger’s father, and then another Edmund, Roger’s great-grandson, cocked a snook at Henry IV by marrying Glyndŵr’s daughter, Catrin, in 1402.It is possible to shorten this third day at a 12-mile limit, finishing at the church in Titley, but for me it’s much better to press on, rising up towards the Welsh border and a meeting with the ultimate symbol of militarisation and tribal anxiety, Offa’s Dyke. The path curls up across a featureless mountain pasture, and there it is – the formidable security wall of its day, designed to keep two irredeemably hostile peoples apart, now a little ripple in the earth which sheep use to see if there’s more grass in the next field. Sit down and ruminate on human folly before striding into Kington where there’s a decent cafe, the Border Bean, and wait for Arabella to collect you.The trip was supported byVisit Shropshire.

In fact, their design is not for domestic calm and onion basket or fridge drawer neglect, but for uncultivated wilds. In particular the limestone terrain of the Mediterranean, where their defining smells are hardcore chemical defences, with every small, tough leaf or needle loaded with enough volatiles to deter both predators and competitors.Rosemary is particularly kick-arse in this respect, with those volatiles (mostly organic compounds called terpenoids) synthesised and stored in minuscule glands that project from the surface of each dark green needle, which breaks when brushed against or bitten, releasing an intense, hot, bitter shot. It’s the evergreen equivalent of carrying personal defence spray. The needles also mark territory. By leaking their volatiles into the nearby soil, they inhibit the seeds of other plants (maybe even their own) from taking root and, in turn, taking space, water and precious minerals in a challenging environment.Challenging in another way is my onion and garlic basket, which, despite regular sorting, has a magnetic pull for clothes pegs, hairbands, coins, batteries, Lego, empty lighters and dust, and is where I keep the bay leaves and branches of rosemary I bring home from dog walks. While there are some dried branches under the onions, I neglected those further and picked two nice, bushy fresh branches for this week’s recipe, which is inspired by Joyce Molyneux’s chocolate pots in The Carved Angel Cookery Book and Ada Boni’s panna cotta fromIl Talismano della Felicità.An intense and balanced mix of pine, eucalyptus and camphor, rosemary is a strong-minded and complementary match for the dark roasted, fruity, malty, almost sweaty flavour of dark chocolate; two such strong elements, both of which are rounded by the cream. Another benefit of adding dark chocolate to panna cotta is that it negates a common and annoying problem: that the final set is rubbery rather than tender and wobbly. This is because the chocolate, diluted in a large amount of cream and dominating the gelatine, takes control of the panna cotta, setting into a thick, smooth, almost velvet texture. In order to infuse the cream with the rosemary, though, it is essential to warm it gently and slowly, so sit the pan on a low heat and watch it carefully – it should almost (but not quite) come to a boil.It is important to pull the tray out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before serving, so the consistency of the panna cotta is velvet-like, and that the pungent, resinous and delightful perfume of the rosemary comes through. To unmould, the best way to do this is first to use a slender-bladed knife to ease the top edge of the panna cotta away from sides. Next, pour about an inch of boiling water into a bowl and dip the base of each mould into the hot water, holding it there for about 20 seconds while shaking the mould gently. Invert (it should smootch out like wonderful brown sea anemones) on to plates, and decorate each panna cottawith a few sharp needles of fresh rosemary, which are also useful for fending off competitors.Chocolate and rosemary panna cottaMakes4-63 x 2g sheets of gelatine140g dark chocolate500ml single cream100g icingor fine caster sugar2 bushy sprigs fresh rosemary, plus extra for decoratingChoose four suitable moulds (ramekins, small cups or shot glasses) for the panna cottaandarrange them on a plate or small tray that will fit in the fridge.

There’s something about this place on the lush intersection of the silk roads between Europe and Asia that gets under the skin. Perhaps it’s the combination of unpolished authenticity paired with profound generosity (guests are considered a gift from God and fed accordingly), all while being gently rocked in a cradle of civilisation, that make Georgian wine so beguiling. (My first visit in August 2023 – a khachapuri-fuelled reconnaissance for my book, Drinking the World: AWineOdyssey – lingered in my mind long after my flight touched back down on British tarmac.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.What I find most refreshing is that the country, and its wine, is completely itself, despite being hemmed in by empires with a proclivity for invasion (Persians, Turks, Mongols et al), as well as the decades spent under USSR rule, which between 1922 and 1991 switched the grape-growing focus to yield over quality. Today, you really feel the Georgian delight at flipping that old Soviet diktat on its head.The winemakers I met were laser-focused on nurturing their Georgian-ness, while the country’s 525-plus indigenous grape varieties result in kaleidoscopic left-field flavours. When John Wurdeman, the American co-founder ofPheasant’s Tears winery, came on to the scene in 2007, he gave Georgian wines a window to the world. Early adopters such asYotam Ottolenghihelped bring them into the mainstream, and their surging popularity (UK volume sales increased by 72% in 2024) runs in congruence with the rise of natural wine. In fact, you can hold this corner of the Caucasus accountable for the profusion of voguish bars proffering groovy-labelled orange wines, though the fermentation of skin-contact “amber” wine inqvevri(egg-shaped clay vessels buried underground) has been à la mode here since Neolithic times.For a wine enthusiast, Georgia is like tapping into the source code. The sommelier Honey Spencer sees it as “the final frontier”, whilenomadic winemaker Darren Smithdubs the country “the holiest of holies”. Hot, dry Kakheti in the east produces the lion’s share of Georgia’s wines, typically bold reds and ambers, and I was particularly wowed bya qvevri-aged saperavi(an inky-skinned red with heady notes of blackcurrant and leather) made by Orgo’s respected Giorgi Dakishvili. From the country’s west, meanwhile, expect bright, fresh wines. I loved the beautifully structured wines from Oda, set up by literary critic turned winemaker Keto Ninidze, while names to know in Imereti areArchil Guniavaand the Abuladze sibling trio behindBaia(where Smith made wines under hisThe Finest Wines Available to Humanity label), both of which embrace endemic varieties: the vermentino-like tsolikauri, the crisp, late-blooming krakhuna and tsitska’s herbal aromas.Spencer, ofSune restaurant in east London, recently masterminded the excellent wine list atDakaDaka, 2026’s most exciting Georgian opening. “When I was first trying these wines back in 2011, a lot of the reds were incredibly heavy and not really suited to the western palate,” she says. “That was a Soviet hangover. They have changed, though. There’s a lightness and a deftness of touch in most Georgian wines now.”A Georgian starter setPheasant’s Tears Rkatsiteli Bodbiskhevi 2023£22 Shrine to the Vine, 12.5%.
