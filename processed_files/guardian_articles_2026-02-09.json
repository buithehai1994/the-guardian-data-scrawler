Cathy is a primped belle quivering in the presence of Heathcliff, who himself is a moody, long-haired, bearded outsider, as if Scarlett O’Hara were going to melt into the arms of Charles Manson. However, he does get substantially Darcyfied up later on, rocking a shorter and more winsome hairstyle, his gossamer-thin shirt never dry.As a child, young Cathy Earnshaw (Charlotte Mellington) is a pert miss, indulged by her roistering old twinkly eyed squire of a dad, in which role Martin Clunes pretty much pinches the whole film.Fennellincidentally abolishes the character of Cathy’s elder brother Hindley from the book (along with his wife and son) reassigning Hindley’s ruinous boozing and gambling to the father; Fennell also, in line with traditional WH adaptation, loses the next-gen second half of the novel, about the grownup children of Cathy, Hindley and Heathcliff. She also very feebly erases the issue of Heathcliff’s dark skin – and maybe those inverted commas are intended to shrug off issues of “authenticity”.On a lordly whim, Mr Earnshaw rescues a young scallywag from the streets of Liverpool while there on business, and adopts him as a step-brother to Cathy; this, of course, is Heathcliff, played as a pinch-faced boy byOwen Cooper(the young star of Netflix’saward-winning drama Adolescence). They run around ferally together as kids, but as adults of the near-aristo and servant class respectively, there seems no way to consummate or even acknowledge their feelings for each other.The family’s fortunes being in dire straits, Cathy marries wealthy milquetoast neighbour Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif), thus breaking the heart of Heathcliff, who storms off; he returns, wealthy, after a few years and has a passionate affair with Cathy, who learns the truth about why he left. When he ends up spitefully marrying Edgar’s simpering sister Isabella (played by Alison Oliver, amusingly channelling Sophie Thompson). Fennell makes light of his cruelty to her by casting Isabella as a smirkingly consenting sub.View image in fullscreenA luxurious pose of unserious abandon … Margot Robbie in Emerald Fennell’s adaptation.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyAs for the all-knowing housekeeper Nelly Dean (played by Hong Chau), she is the trickiest figure in the book, the person through whose eyes almost all the action is seen. Nelly is English literature’s uncrowned queen of the unreliable narrators, the deadpan witness-instigator of the central catastrophic misunderstanding that destroys Heathcliff and Cathy’s happiness. Interestingly, Fennell does get Cathy to confront Nelly on this point. At some stage, of course, things get real and a tsunami of tears is uncorked; it’s all in a frantically, exhaustingly Baz Luhrmann-esque style and the movie begins to resemble a 136-minute video for theCharli xcxsongs on the soundtrack.Wuthering Heights doesn’t have the live-ammo impact of Fennell’s earlier filmsSaltburnandPromising Young Womanor, indeed,Andrea Arnold’s flawed, brilliant, primitivist takeon Brontë’s novel from 2011, which really did believe in the passionate truth of Cathy and Heathcliff’s love. For Fennell, it looks like a luxurious pose of unserious abandon. It’s quasi-erotic, pseudo-romantic and then ersatz-sad, a club night of mock emotion.Wuthering Heights is out on 12 February in Australia and 13 February in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmMargot RobbieEmerald FennellJacob ElordiMartin ClunesFilm adaptationsEmily BrontëreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the biggest of guns still came out, from Spielberg to Ghostface to theMinions…The Mandalorian and GroguDisney’sStar Warsstrategy – decrease quality of movies, increase amount of TV shows – hasn’t really been paying off all that well, Andor aside. While there is a fanbase forThe Mandalorianand his little baby Yoda friend, it remains to be seen if a big enough audience is excited enough to see this as something other than an extended episode of something they’re used to watching on their smartphone. I do appreciate a specially made – or at least freshly packaged – big game teaser, though, not purely reliant on the same cocktail of clips, and let’s hope such invention suggests more much-needed creativity in the series to come.Disclosure DayArriving at just the right time for increasingly energised UFO conspiracy theorists,Steven Spielberg’s big return to the sci-fi genre is still looking like a whole bunch of question marks (Good or bad aliens? Bad CGI? Why is every American played by a Brit?) but it is thrilling to have a summer blockbuster that’s actually original once again. The latest spot shows a giant ship emerging through clouds, Independence Day-style, and some more questionable accents. Time will tell.Minions & MonstersA pretty smart new direction for the consistently popularMinionsfranchise (perhaps the most reliable animated series Hollywood now has?), which sees them aim for movie stardom. As one would expect from a Minions trailer, there is little to no understandable dialogue here (maybe kids would figure out more words after endless rewatches of the previous films) but it looks like another sure Disney-enraging thing.Scream 7Poor old Sidney Prescott. It’s almost been 30 years of menacing phone calls, non-lethal stab wounds, severed relationships (some literally), unwanted press attention, and now, as theScreamfranchise continues to be more commercially successful than ever before (thesixth chapterwas a record-breaker), here comes Ghostface threatening her teenage daughter. But as Sidney’s bad luck continues, Neve Campbell’s does the opposite. The actor waslured backafter taking one film off over a pay dispute, and it’s her most substantial role – and we assume salary – to date. The new spot offers more of the same, keeping the film’s long list of back-from-the-dead cameos under wraps, but the repetition is almost reassuring, the biggest secrets not being spoiled just yet.The Adventures of Cliff BoothWhile most of the trailers last night were either confirmed by the studio or predicted by those in the know, no one really saw this one coming. It makes sense really, a surprise reveal of footage from a film that felt like a shock when it was announced, aQuentin Tarantino-pennedsequelto Once Upon a Time in Hollywood directed byDavid Fincherfor Netflix. The first tease ofBrad Pitt’s return as Cliff Booth looks as stylish as one would expect (despite his move to the streamer, Fincher has remained well outside of the dreaded Netflix murk) while poking fun at what can’t be shown on network TV at such an hour. It’s a fascinating match of auteurs that should make for one of the year’s most unusual films.Project Hail MaryEven if I remain a little disappointed with Ryan Gosling’sReese Witherspoon-likedeclarationthat he will no longer be delving into darker territory, Project Hail Mary is looking like a smart, safe use of his post-Barbie career bump.The Fall Guymightnot have setthe box office alight, but this sci-fi adventure (which is essentially The Martian but with a cute alien pal) feels like an easier win. The third trailer offers more of the same (thankfully it’s the “final” trailer) and with a budget of $150m, expectations are high, but with a concept less reliant on his global star power and more on effects-heavy space antics, this could be a much-needed leading man hit.HoppersPixar, a company that used to turn the wildest premises into both critical and commercial gold, has been struggling to impress either side in recent years. AfterEliowas a historicflopfor them, they’re hoping Hoppers might turn the tide, and they might have a safer hit on their hands. It’s a fun, grabby premise – tech that allows humans to masquerade as animals – and while there’s not that much here in this big game spot, here’s hoping the recent billion-dollar success ofZootopia 2’s animated animals will help nudge it along.The Super Mario Galaxy MovieIt’s gonna be a Disney-crushing year for Universal, with both a new Minions movie and a sequel to their Mario smash, which made over $1.36bn back in 2023. One could argue that maybe the novelty factor for those on the older, nostalgia-seeking side has weakened given the quality of the first but that might not matter with the younger superfans who are now that much more Nintendo-pilled, eager for another film to quote on a loop. The big game tease was just the reveal that Baby Mario and Baby Luigi will be appearing along with a dinosaur (Universal crowbarring in a Jurassic Park tie-in?) but even if ad spend for this one was kept to a minimum, it’d still be another $1bn in the bank.SupergirlTechnically this one didn’t actually air during the telecast but rather the Puppy Bowl, which is a) cheaper and b) a smart way to appeal to a female fanbase who might not have been watching anincredibly dull game. There’s not much here we haven’t seen before, other than predictably more dog shots, and I’m a little cautious of the post-Guardians “superhero but rock’n’roll” tone (especially from the director ofI, Tonya). But given how surprisingly necessary last year’sSupermanfelt, there’s potential here.Explore more on these topicsFilmSuper BowlSuper Bowl LXSteven SpielbergDavid FincherJosh O'ConnorBrad PittfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Sunday it was Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, who took one for the team by resigning over the Peter Mandelson appointment. On Monday, No 10’s head of communications,Tim Allan, did likewisewithout offering much by way of an explanation.Presumably it was another effort to delay the inevitable. “We need a futile gesture, chaps.” No matter that most normal people won’t have heard of either of them. Let alone be able to identify them in a police lineup.It’s a war of attrition inside Downing Street. It can’t be long before a couple of cleaners also resign because they too feel a bit guilty about not warning Starmer that they had misgivings about Mandelson. Then Keir will be left on his own to rattle around inside No 10, with only the echoes of his own voice to keep him company. That’s assuming he is still on the Mary Celeste, of course.Come Monday afternoon, Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, became the most prominent party figure so far todemand that Starmer stand down. Not that he had any idea who should replace him. Just that enough was enough, and Labour would have a marginally better chance of not being wiped out in the May elections without him. Better the chaos you don’t know rather than the chaos you do.A spokesperson for Starmer insisted he was going nowhere and was committed to running the country. He didn’t sound altogether convincing. Or reassuring. Sometimes, you wonder if we’d do better with no one. Just let the civil servants get on with it. Belgium went 652 days without a government in between December 2018 and October 2020 and no one seemed to notice the difference.You can’t also help feeling that the Mandelson scandal is playing havoc with the minds of the entire political class as its members pretend to be concerned about the women and girls who were Jeffrey Epstein’s real victims while scrabbling around for their own advantage.Amnesia and revisionism are the new order of the day. Almost no one in any party – or in the media – raised any concerns about Mandelson’s Epstein links when he was first appointed as UK ambassador to Washington. Which is not to excuse Starmer. Rather that those in glass houses etc …Most of the British establishment held Mandy close to their heart. He was one of them. One of the chosen few. A brilliant schmoozer and negotiator. Something must be done for Peter. Too good to be left on the sidelines. If there were concerns, it was whether he could somehow combine being ambassador with chancellor of the University of Oxford. He was a regular on the Times podcast. Michael Gove considered him to be a brilliant appointment. These voices have melted into the background over the last week.Though not Kemi Badenoch. The Tory leader was one of many who didn’t mention Epstein’s links when Mandelson was first appointed US ambassador. Now she seems to be under the impression that she broke the entire story.You could sense the astonishment in Nick Robinson’s voice on Monday morning as Badenoch declared on the Today programme that it was only thanks to her performance at last week’s PMQs that we had discovered that Mandelson stayed in Epstein’s flat after his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a child.It’s as if Kemi now thinks she is a third-rate Marvel hero whose superpower is to believe that everyone will buy whatever she wants to be true. Who has no idea we all know the story had been out in the open for years but that Westminster had chosen to ignore it. In KemiWorld nothing ever happens without her say so. She is in control of everything. No one has yet dared to introduce her to the truth.Still, Kemi’s fantasy land is probably a more comfortable and kinder place than the reality in which Labour’s cabinet find themselves. On Sunday, Pat McFadden – Starmer’s most loyal retainer – had been sent out to face the media. It wouldn’t make sense for McSweeney to resign, he repeatedly said. Just hoursbefore Mc Sweeney resigned. Pat needed two or three extra diazepam to recover from the shame of that.So on Monday morning not a single member of the cabinet could be found to speak up for Starmer. An urgent appointment at the hairdresser. If Keir didn’t feel abandoned before, he did now. It was left to the junior minister Jacqui Smith to take the flak. I guess as she is already in the Lords, she probably considers herself more or less untouchable. She will still pick up more than £300 a day even if the worst happens.Fair to say she crashed and burned. Who wouldn’t? Trying to explain why McSweeney had done the right thing by resigning for giving duff advice – while Starmer had also done the right thing by not resigning for taking the wrong decision – would have stretched the ability of someone far sharper than Smith.The left warned that Starmerism would end like this. Now all of Britain faces the fallout | Owen JonesRead moreBy mid-afternoon the revisionism was well into overdrive. Cabinet ministers who had declined to support the prime minister in the morning offered their undying support on social media. Well, their undying support for the rest of the day. About as much as you could hope for. This is, as they say, a fast moving crisis.Yvette Cooper, Darren Jones, Bridget Phillipson, Ed Miliband, Peter Kyle and McFadden all declared Starmer to be a thoroughly good bloke. The best prime minister in the best of all possible times. Other ministers gave short interviews saying much the same. As did Angela Rayner. No one was going to stab Keir just yet.Then came a Commons statement from Darren Jones on standards in public life. Darren is always unbelievably pleased with whatever Darren does, and today was no exception. Even in a crisis there’s not a hint of a crack in his self-confidence. One of Labour’s great survivors.Jones had come to tell MPs that rogue peers would be kicked out of the Lords – some in the upper chamber won’t be pleased about that – and tighter vetting procedures would be put in place to stop people such as Mandelson getting appointed. Which rather missed the point. Mandy’s relationship with Epstein was a matter of public record. All that was needed to stop the appointment was already known.None of this stopped Jones from acting as if he was doing everyone a favour. The shadow minister Neil O’Brien merely observed that the government appeared to be collapsing and it was time for Starmer to resign.At which point Darren got into a bit of competitive sleaze. Labour wrong’uns were far superior to Tory wrong’uns. Emily Thornberry suggested the government could have spared itself a world of pain by having allowed the foreign affairs committee to interrogate Mandelson before he sloped off to Washington. She had a point.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerPeter MandelsonMorgan McSweeneyAnas SarwarnewsShareReuse this content"

But the new musical director is up for a challenge. We meet the man with the hardest job in musicMon 9 Feb 2026 11.22 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 12.23 ESTShareAndré de Ridder is either brave or stupid. He has accepted the role as the music director of English National Opera – its chief conductor and keeper of its musical flame. He will take up the role formally in 2027. The post has been empty for several anguished years, sparked byArts Council England’s 2022 announcementthat the company would lose all its funding unless it moved out of London. Amid a fightback that, to cut a long story short, resulted in the company retaining a foothold in the London Coliseum, but partially moving to Manchester, De Ridder’s predecessor, Martyn Brabbins, abruptly quit in 2023, saying that the company was heading into “managed decline”. Brabbins’s predecessor, Mark Wigglesworth, had also resigned suddenly in 2016, saying ENO was evolving into “something I do not recognise”. It was beginning to sound like an opera plot.Bluebeard’s Castle, maybe. A murdered conductor behind every door in the mansion.And yet: De Ridder’s enthusiasm is irrepressible. For some, it would be daunting to come into a company whose world-class orchestra and chorus have had their full-time contracts slashed to seven months of the year; from which the chief executive has just resigned; where morale (insiders tell me) is rock bottom. But the Berlin-raised 54-year-old sees only the opportunities. From his perspective, the shake-ups are in the past.View image in fullscreen‘Make-or-break feeling’ … André de Ridder.Photograph: Drew Forsyth/(c) English National Opera“I like this construction of London andManchester,” he tells me, at the Coliseum. “And I like the spirit of pioneering, of becoming an opera company in a city that previously hasn’t had a resident opera company.” We are speaking before rehearsals of the show he’s conducting, Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill’s rarely performed morality tale about rapacious capitalism.He feels a strong connection to Manchester: he studied at the Royal Northern College of Music for two years, and was later assistant to Mark Elder at the Hallé. The new setup presents a “great chance for an opera company and a great chance for opera at large” to develop a new audience inGreater Manchester, “and maybe one that has no preconceived ideas of what opera is”. Opera North regularly visits Salford (and, a fact seemingly overlooked by the Arts Council, was set up in the 1970s to be ENO in the north). But the more the merrier, he thinks. The scene “should just get richer and richer”.He knows his predecessors well – including Edward Gardner, who did the job brilliantly from 2007 to 2015. The two actually studied together inLondon, and took classes from Brabbins, who was a guest teacher on their conducting course. So was Elder, who was music director of ENO in the 1980s and 1990s. De Ridder says of Gardner and Brabbins: “I love them both dearly, and admire them greatly as conductors, but for the moment, I’ve chosen to not speak to them because I wanted a clean beginning, no baggage. I just want to make up my own mind about how things are standing.”Manchester makes us rethink what opera means, what it can beHe talks about the Manchester plans ENO recently announced – among them the UK premiere ofAngel’s Bone, by Chinese-American composer Du Yun, which will be staged at Aviva Studios in May. With works like this, its subject modern slavery and human trafficking, there is a chance to expand the boundaries of the form, he says. “Du Yun is a modern example of the kind of thing Kurt Weill did 100 years ago,” he says, “incorporating punk and cabaret in classical contemporary music in a new way”. He adds: “The opera world can be quite an inward-looking and closed-up sort of place, a famous museum. Manchester makes us rethink what opera means, what it can be.”The orchestra for Angel’s Bone will be the Manchester-based BBC Philharmonic. But surely ENO is by definition a company: it consists of its chorus and its orchestra, its backstage staff, its people. If you produce work in Manchester without the company, is it really ENO at all? On the other hand, bringing London-made ENO productions to Manchester is not only expensive but a little imperialistic. Is there not a fundamental problem with the dual-centre theory? “It’s not just a one-way street,” says De Ridder. Work created in Manchester may come to London, while “we are trying to find ways to present work with our core ensembles in Manchester”. (One example is a semi-staged performance of ENO’s Così Fan Tutte at Bridgewater Halllater this month.)De Ridder has, above all, history with ENO. As a student in 1996, he watched shows such as Bernd Alois Zimmermann’s vast operaDie Soldatenat the Coliseum. (He would love to see ENO in the future similarly performing landmark near-contemporary works that have never been seen in the UK before – Messiaen’s Saint François d’Assise, say, or Kaija Saariaho’s Adriana Mater.) Most importantly, 20 years ago, when he was in his early 30s, he conducted the premiere of Gerald Barry’s remarkable operaThe Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, based on Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 1972 film.View image in fullscreen‘The buzz in the room was incredible’ … rehearsing Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny.Photograph: Tristram Kenton“ENO schooled me, ENO formed me as an artist on the operatic stage,” he says. “It was a lucky time and place. Richard Jones was directing, one of the greats, and Barbara Hannigan [Canadian soprano and now conductor] was making her operatic debut in the UK.” There were “seven or eight intense weeks in the rehearsal room”, he remembers. “The togetherness, the vision, the knowing that we’re doing something quite special, how everybody pulled together – I was spoiled for life by this experience. And I tell you, it’s not the same everywhere. I expected it to be like this everywhere. It wasn’t, and it’s not. And so when this job came up and we started talking, I thought, ‘I have to put my hat in the ring.’”It’s not the same now, though, is it? The musicians and choristers are depleted. He’s getting three, not eight, rehearsal weeks for Mahagonny, and only three performances. But he still believes. “The core of the orchestra is there. The chorus is there. And the spirit of ‘Let’s do it’ is there.” A couple of days after we speak, he messages me. “It wasn’t, nor would it have been, my choice to shorten contracts of the core performing groups of ENO,” he clarifies. “I’ve come in after this was decided and resolved, and I can only imagine how tough that must have been. But now my brief is to hold up ENO’s excellence and goals for everyone.”He talks passionately about Weill – whose numbers, such as Alabama Song, long ago took on a life of their own thanks to, among others, theDoorsandDavid Bowie. Mahagonny comes out of the heady musical melting pot of 1920s Berlin – the city, too, of Schoenberg and Hindemith. “Kurt Weill is often seen as the guy who did the jazzy thing and the sassy thing. But in this piece, you can see he grew up through the school of Schoenberg and using old forms – canons, fugues, chorales, and some of the tonal-based, modal framework that Hindemith ended up with. You see all these influences, but also ragtime, tango, American blues music. There are moments of pure Gershwin.” His own father used to conduct the opera, along with other Brecht and Weill masterpieces, in West Berlin in the 1980s. He’s using his dad’s score.View image in fullscreenA morality tale about rapacious capitalism … rehearsals for Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny.Photograph: Tristram KentonDe Ridder is currently music director of the opera in the German city of Freiburg. Why exchange comfortable funding and long rehearsal periods for ENO’s shaky situation in a cash-strapped country that may well get a far-right government after the next election? He laughs. “I think we’re far closer to getting a far-right government in Germany than you are,” he says. “It’s not the reason I’m leaving Germany, but you just said the word ‘comfortable’, and that’s the operative word. It is comfortable, yes, maybe a little bit too comfortable.”When we speak, he has just been working at 3 Mills Studios in east London. “There were three ENO productions being rehearsed there at the same time, Così Fan Tutte, Mahagonny and a brush-up of [Gilbert and Sullivan’s] HMS Pinafore – and the buzz in the building was incredible. It felt like life and death.”He adds: “I love working in Germany. I love that in every city there’s an opera house. But people are comfortable.” He looks around the Coliseum and says: “That make-or-break feeling I had when I first came here? I love it.”Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonnyis at the London Coliseum, 16-20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsEnglish National Opera (ENO)Classical musicOperaManchesterGreater ManchesterLondoninterviewsShareReuse this content"

I fought to change the Labour party to allow us to win an election again. People told me I couldn’t do it.“I have had my detractors every step along the way, and I’ve got them now. Detractors that don’t want a Labour government at all, and certainly not one to succeed.“But I’ll tell you this, after having fought so hard for the chance to change our country, I’m not prepared to walk away from my mandate and my responsibility to my country, or to plunge us into chaos, as others have done.”‘Rayner for leader’ site proves race to succeed Starmer is well under wayRead moreMPs leaving the meeting said there had been a genuine mood shift, lifted by Starmer’s promises to remake his relationship with MPs, acknowledgment of past mistakes and his clear lines of attack on Reform UK, which he described as the “fight of our times”.But others said that with Labour trailing behind Nigel Farage’s party in the polls, and the cost of living crisis still biting, they doubted whether Starmer could turn things around. One cabinet minister said MPs had been galvanised by the “common enemy” but did not think “we are out of the woods yet”.The ambush by Sarwar appeared to be a serious threat to the prime minister, coming after months of Labour figures privately questioning Starmer’s authority, but after cabinet ministers and Labour MPs publicly rallied round, it became clear he would fight another day.View image in fullscreenScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar during a press conference calling for Keir Starmer to resign as prime minister.Photograph: Robert Perry/PAAt a hastily arranged press conference in Glasgow earlier in the day, Sarwar said there had been “too many mistakes” by No 10 since Starmer came to power and that while the prime minister was a “decent man” he was undermining Labour’s ability to win the Scottish parliament elections in May.The Scottish party leader is said to be furious that the UK government’s decisions have severely damaged support for Scottish Labour, with the SNP’s John Swinney now appearing to be on course to stay in Bute House.Recent opinion polls show Labour trailing in third place behind the Scottish National party and Reform. Sarwar and his advisers have calculated it will be impossible for Starmer to recover after the scandal overPeter Mandelson’s links to Jeffrey Epstein.MPs said it was made abundantly clear to them that they should tweet their loyalty to Starmer. “It was a ‘tweet or we’ll have your fingers’ moment,” one said. One Labour source even claimed that No 10 had threatened them with the sack unless they went public with their support. No 10 denied this.But several MPs said that it was a genuine moment of clarity after Sarwar called for Starmer to go. “I think they saw what the abyss looks like,” one MP said. Another said: “It looked more and more insane as it went on.”Is Britain about to lose another prime minister?Read moreRayner, Starmer’s former deputy, urged Labour colleagues to “come together, remember our values and put them into practice as a team”, but just moments before the Guardian revealed an unfinished website claiming to launch her leadership campaign was published temporarily in January.Meanwhile, the domain name angelaforleader.co.uk was registered within minutes of the apparent publishing error, at 9.48am on 27 January, with the same company – Webfusion – as her official parliamentary site.Rayner denied any links to the website, with her team dismissing it as a “fake”, while one ally described it as a “false flag” operation. But there was no indication the site had been deliberately shared or leaked to journalists or political figures.In what appeared to be an effort to ready himself for a potential leadership contest,Streeting published private WhatsApp messages between the pair, including his prediction he would be “toast” at the next general election.The publication of the exchanges, in which Streeting said the government had no growth strategy and questioned Starmer’s communications skills, came after the friendship threatened to be a significant liability to his ambitions.However, the health secretary publicly supported Starmer, saying that “people should give him a hearing”. His allies rejected suggestions that he had been coordinating with Sarwar, who is also close to McSweeney.On a day of turmoil insider Downing Street, and less than 24 hours after McSweeney stood down, Tim Allan, Starmer’s director of communications, quit. “I have decided to stand down to allow a new No 10 team to be built. I wish the PM and his team every success,” he said.Allan appeared to have swiftly changed his WhatsApp profile to a picture of a golf ball with the caption “Out of Office. Gone Golfing.” It leaves Starmer looking for his fifth communications chief since he took office in July 2024.The Guardian also revealed that Chris Wormald, the most senior civil servant in Downing Street, is negotiating his exit as part of a wider shake-up of Starmer’s operation, adding to the sense of turmoil at the top of government.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourWes StreetingAngela RaynerPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

Council leaders had said that without intervention these debts would push90% of councils into effective bankruptcyby 2028.Debt write-offs will be conditional on local authorities agreeing to local plans to implement Send updates in line with government plans expected to be outlined in an imminent white paper.While councils welcomed the move, several authorities with high overspends such as Hampshire county council will still be left with tens of millions of pounds of debt. English councils’ total accumulated Send debts at April are expected to be £6bn.It is unclear how billions of pounds of expected Send overspends between April 2026 and April 2028 will be handled. Ministers said they would “continue to take an appropriate and proportionate approach, though it will not be unlimited”.Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, which represents councils acrossEngland, said the partial write-off of Send debts removed the immediate threat of insolvency for many councils.She said: “This is recognition that these costs are not of councils’ making and have accrued due to a broken system that is urgently in need of reform. However, fully writing off historic and future high needs deficits remains critical.”Worcestershire’s Reform leadership has admitted its finances are in “a mess”. As well as having large council tax rises, it has applied to the government for permission to borrow £71m from April in a bid to avoid effective bankruptcy. It has blamed previous Tory mismanagement for the crisis.Attempts by Reform-led Warwickshire county council to push through a lower-than-expected 3.89% council tax riselast week failedafter opposition parties said this would lead to more cuts to services, and could putthe viability of the councilat risk.Sir Stephen Houghton, chair of the Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities, welcomed the uprated recovery grants, saying: “We strongly welcome the additional money being targeted to places with significant deprivation and needs.”Explore more on these topicsWorcestershireLocal governmentReform UKSpecial educational needsEnglandCouncil taxnewsShareReuse this content"

The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.The release of documents includes emails indicating that on 7 October 2010, the then Prince Andrew sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong. After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.It is unclear if the documents contained market-sensitive information about British trade deals or whether the then prince had signed the Official Secrets Act.Government guidance stresses that the role of a trade envoy carries a duty of confidentiality regarding sensitive information. This may include “sensitive, commercial, or political information shared about relevant markets/visits”, the guidance reads. “This duty of confidentiality will continue to apply after the expiry of their term of office. In addition, the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1989 will apply.”Earlier on Monday William and Catherine, the Prince and Princess of Wales, were said by a spokesperson to be “deeply concerned” by continuing revelations from the Epstein files.In a statement, a Kensington Palace spokesperson said: “I can confirm that the Prince and Princess of Wales have been deeply concerned by the continued revelations. Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.”William arrived on Monday in Saudi Arabia for a three-day tour of the country, and Kensington Palace is said to have wanted the position of the prince and princess to be known to allow William to focus on the tour. Much of the work of the royal family has been overshadowed since the release by the US Department of Justice ofmore than 3m documents associated with Epstein.‘I am always on your team!!’: how Andrew’s aide kept close ties with Epstein right to the endRead morePreviously disclosed emails have suggestedthat the former duke had lobbied on behalf of Epstein during an official visit to the United Arab Emirateswith his parents,Queen Elizabeth IIand Prince Philip, in 2010.The messages concerning overseas trips were sent after the financier’s 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution. Others appear to have been sent after the December 2010 date that Mountbatten-Windsor said in a BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 that he had cut off contact with Epstein.On Christmas Eve 2010, Andrew looped Epstein in on a confidential brief on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand province, Afghanistan,the Telegraph reported.In one email, with the subject line “Afghanistan International Investment opportunities”, Mountbatten-Windsor is said to have written: “I am going to offer this elsewhere in my network (including Abu Dhabi) but would be very interested in your comments, views or ideas as to whom I could also usefully show this to attract some interest.”In another, on 9 February 2011, Mountbatten-Windsor appeared to tell Epstein he had visited a private equity firm the week before and “thought of you as =ou [sic] were looking for somewhere for money to go. A”.Mountbatten-Windsor, who served as the UK’s special representative for trade and investment between 2001 and 2011, has always denied any wrongdoing. He has been approached for comment.Graham Smith, the chief executive of anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said he had reported the allegations to police. “I cannot see any significant difference between these allegations and those against Peter Mandelson,” he said in a post on X.The former prince features numerous times in the latest release of documents, including images that appear to show him crouched over an unidentified woman in what appears to be Epstein’s New York mansion, while another document appears to confirm thatthe picture of him with Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Mountbatten-Windsor had sex with her three times while she was a teenager, is real.Prince Edward was the first royal to speak publicly since the Epstein documents were released, saying last week that it was important to “remember the victims” when asked how he was coping since the revelations.William’s visit, at the request of the UK government, will include talks with the crown prince ofSaudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman.The visit aims to strengthen ties with one of the UK’s closest Middle East allies, with London and Riyadh hopeful the two men, who have met before, will develop a connection.Prince Mohammed is a controversial figure to the west, as the de facto head of an absolute monarchy whose regime has been accused of human rights violations. His reputation was badly damaged by a US intelligenceclaim he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which he denied.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorMonarchyPrince WilliamCatherine, Princess of WalesJeffrey EpsteinSaudi ArabiaKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

While buying supplies at a hardware store on 9 September 2025 he was arrested in a random immigration sweep, according to Okoye, of BOS Legal Group inMassachusetts.Culleton entered the US in 2009 on a visa waiver programme and overstayed the 90 day-limit but, after marrying a US citizen and applying for lawful permanent residence, he obtained a statutory exemption that allowed him to work, Okoye told the Guardian. “He had a work-approved authorisation that is tied to a green card application,” she said.Culleton’s detention prevented him from attending the final interview in October, she said. “It’s inexplicable that this man has been in detention. It does not make sense. There’s no reason why the government shouldn’t just release him and allow him to attend the interview that will confirm his legal status.”After being held in ICE facilities near Boston and in Buffalo, New York, he was flown to a facility in El Paso, Texas, where he is sharing a cell with more than 70 men. Culleton said the detention centre was cold, damp and squalid, and there were fights over insufficient food – “like a concentration camp, absolute hell”, he told the Irish Times, whichfirst reported the storyon Monday.Culleton said that when he was arrested he was carrying a Massachusetts driving licence and a valid work permit issued as part of an application for a green card that he initiated in April 2025. He has a final interview remaining.When asked at the Buffalo facility to sign a form agreeing to deportation, Culleton said he refused and instead ticked a box expressing a wish to contest his arrest, which he intended to do on the grounds that he was married to a US citizen, Tiffany Smyth, and had a valid work permit.At a November hearing a judge approved his release on a $4,000 bond, which Smyth paid, but authorities continued to detain Culleton, initially without explanation.When his attorney appealed to a federal court, two ICE agents said that in Buffalo Culleton had signed documents agreeing to be deported. Culleton said he did not agree and that the signatures were not his. “My whole life is here. I worked so hard to build my business. My wife is here.”The judge noted irregularities in ICE’s court documents but sided with the agency. Under US law Culleton cannot appeal but he wants handwriting experts to examine the signatures and believes a video of his interview with ICE in Buffalo would prove he refused to sign deportation documents.Irish woman detained by US immigration released after 17 days in custodyRead morePrevious high-profile cases involving people from Ireland includeCliona Ward, who had a green card but was detained by ICE for 17 days over a criminal record from more than 20 years ago. A visiting Irish tech worker who overstayed his visa by three days and agreed to deportation wasjailed for about 100 days.Culleton told the Irish Times he did not know what would happen next and that the uncertainty was “psychological torture”. Facility officials tried to get him to sign a deportation order last week but he refused, he said.Okoye said the US government had discretionary power to release her client and was acting in an inept and capricious manner towards an immigrant who was following the green card process. “He’s never been arrested.

However, until now, there was a lack of evidence about whether this link existed for infectious diseases in general.To fill that evidence gap, the study used data from 67,000 adults in two studies in Finland and 470,000 adults in the UK Biobank dataset to look at the relationship between obesity and severe infectious disease.Participants had their body mass index (BMI) assessed and were followed for an average of 13 to 14 years. The average age at the start of the study was 42 for the Finnish group and 57 in the UK cohort.Thestudy, published in the Lancet,found that people with obesity, defined as having a BMI of 30 or higher, had a 70% higher risk of hospital admission or death from any infectious disease compared with people with a healthy BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. The risk increased as body weight increased.The study’s lead author, Prof Mika Kivimäki, of UCL, said: “Our finding that obesity is a risk factor for a wide range of infectious diseases suggests that broad biological mechanisms may be involved.“It is plausible that obesity weakens the immune system’s ability to defend against the infectious bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi, therefore resulting in more serious diseases.“Evidence from trials of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs fits with this, as reducing obesity also appears to lower the risk of severe infections, alongside many other health benefits. That said, additional research is required to confirm the mechanisms underlying these associations.”The chances of dying differed between countries. About one in six infectious disease deaths were linked to obesity in the UK and one in four in the US, thestudy found. Vietnam had the lowest proportion, with obesity linked to 1.2% of infection deaths.There were limitations to the research – which was funded by Wellcome, the Medical Research Council and the Research Council of Finland – including that it relied on observational data and could not confirm causality.The study’s co-author, Dr Sara Ahmadi-Abhari, of Imperial College London, said: “Estimates of the global impact give a sense of how large the problem may be, but they should be interpreted with caution.”Explore more on these topicsObesityInfectious diseasesHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Political figures such as former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau called her a “beloved Canadian icon”, while the country’s current leader, Mark Carney, said Canada had “lost a legend”.Even the Westminster dog show felt the loss. O’Hara was especially beloved in dog-show circles for portraying Cookie Fleck, a Norwich terrier owner, in Christopher Guest’s 2000 mockumentary Best in Show. Organizers of the showpaid tributeto O’Hara with a video montage played on the jumbotron in New York City’s Madison Square Garden.O’Hara was born in Toronto in 1954, where she joined the legendary comedy theater Second City, alongside Eugene Levy, with whom she would collaborate throughout her career, including on the smash TV series Schitt’s Creek.Her break into movies came in 1980 with Double Negative – also alongside Eugene Levy, and John Candy.In 1988, she played Winona Ryder’s stepmother in Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice. She would later marry the film’s production designer Bo Welch. The couple had two sons, Matthew and Luke.But it was in 1990 that she became widely known to a global audience, as the mother of Culkin’s Kevin in Home Alone.She would reprise the role in the film’s sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, which featured a cameo from Donald Trump, decades before he would become US president.In 1993, she collaborated again with Burton on The Nightmare Before Christmas.The versatile comedian appeared in Guest’s other mockumentaries that revel in silly spectacles of Americana, such as the vain folk singers in A Mighty Wind, and award-hungry actors in For Your Consideration.Her role in Schitt’s Creek brought her an Emmy for best lead actress in 2020. She was also awarded a Golden Globe and a Sag award.Explore more on these topicsCatherine O'HaraUS televisionTelevisionWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Her cries of pain could be heard clearly on the television broadcast and spectators and her fellow athletes were visibly shaken as she was airlifted to hospital.She was competing on Sunday while dealing with a ruptured ACL she had suffered a week earlier.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever,” she wrote in an Instagram post on Monday.Vonn added that she had “no regrets” about her decision to race. “Knowing I stood there having a chance to win was a victory in and of itself. I also knew that racing was a risk. It always was and always will be an incredibly dangerous sport,” she wrote.Some users on social media said she should not have been racing only a week after injuring her knee. However, those who know the risks of skiing best supported Vonn’s decision.“People that don’t know ski racing don’t really understand what happened yesterday,” Vonn’s US teammate Keely Cashman said on Monday. “She hooked her arm on the gate, which twisted her around. She was going probably 70mph, and so that twists your body around.”Cashman, who suffered a heavy crash of her own five years ago, said Vonn’s crash had “nothing to do with her ACL, nothing to do with her knee”, and people who think otherwise are “totally incorrect”.Lindsey Vonn’s crash is violent but honest ending to an unprecedented Olympic bidRead more“I think a lot of people are ridiculing that, and a lot of people don’t [know] what’s going on,” Cashman added.Vonn had been in the middle ofa remarkable comeback, coming out of a six-year retirement in 2025 after knee replacement surgery. There were doubts the 41-year-old could compete at the highest level again but she reached the podiumin all five World Cup downhill racesshe entered in the run-up to the Olympics, including two victories. However,the crash at the end of Januarythat ruptured her ACL made some question whether she was risking her life as she sought to win her second Olympic gold medal.Italy’s Federica Brignone, a two-time world champion, dismissed that criticism. “It’s her choice,” Brignone said. “If it’s your body, then you decide what to do, whether to race or not. It’s not up to others. Only you.”Another of Vonn’s US teammates, downhill specialist Kyle Negomir, also had no problem with her decision to try to replicate her gold medal performance from the 2010 Olympics.“Lindsey’s a grown woman and the best speed skier to ever do this sport. If she made her decision, I think she should absolutely be allowed to take that risk,” Negomir said. “She’s obviously good enough that she’s capable of pulling it off.”However her father, who has skied competitively himself, said he believes she should retire from racing.“She’s 41 years old, and this is the end of her career,” Alan Kildow told the Associated Press on Monday. “There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.”Kildow and Vonn’s three siblings have been at her bedside as she recovers from her injuries in hospital in Treviso.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Is there any way out?Rising GDP continues to mean more carbon emissions and wider damage to the planet. Can the two be decoupled?Alex ClarkMon 9 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 11.19 ESTShareDuringCop30negotiations in Brazil last year, delegates heard a familiar argument: rising emissions are unavoidable for countries pursuing growth.Since the first Cop in the 1990s, developing nations have had looser reduction targets to reflect the economic gap between them and richer countries, which emitted millions of tonnes of CO2as they pulled ahead. The concession comes from the idea that an inevitable cost of prosperity is environmental harm.That pattern seems to be holding. In 2024, global GDP per capita reached a new high as did annual carbon emissions. But asclimate targets slipandwarnings mountthat tipping points may already have been crossed, faith in growth for growth’s sake is starting to fracture.This week, the UN secretary general, António Guterres,called for economies to “move beyond GDP”as a measure of progress, warning that the world’s “existing accounting systems” were driving the planet towards disaster.His remarks echo an increasingly influential school of economics, known broadly as “post-growth”, that asks what was once unthinkable: will solving the climate crisis mean learning to live without constant expansion?Post-growth economists often reject GDP in favour of new frameworks that account for environmental damage – such as the “doughnut economics” adopted recently by Amsterdam, or New Zealand’s attempt at a “wellbeing budget”.The field has its disagreements, particularly over the extent to which countries should actively pursue de-growth measures to scale down their economies. But proponents agree that with the planet pushed to the limit, a radical rethink is needed.“Economic growth has a near mythical status in the affections of economists and politicians. But wishful thinking won’t solve the climate crisis,” said Tim Jackson, professor of sustainable development at the University of Surrey and a leading post-growth economist. “Post-growth economics offers us more choice, more realism and more insight into the possibilities for human prosperity. It’s not about returning to the cave but about breaking free from our intellectual prisons.”The roots of post-growth can be traced back to one book, which caused a storm upon its publication in the 1970s.Some argue that Limits to Growth underestimated humanity’s ability to adapt in the face of environmental breakdown.This technological optimism underpins the idea of “green growth” – that the world economy can keep expanding while avoiding catastrophe. Advocates point to the uptake of renewables, which has taken place to such an extent in some nations that growth has seemingly been decoupled from emissions.Countries such as the UK, France, Germany and the US have all increased GDP per capita since the 2000s while cutting carbon emissions.But experts heavily contest the evidence of decoupling. “It’s inconclusive because it focuses on the wrong thing: annual flows of emissions rather than their accumulation,” said Peter Victor, an emeritus professor at York University in Toronto.“It is the accumulated stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that causes climate change, not the annual flows. We are very far from decoupling the stock of atmospheric carbon dioxide from economic growth.”Others point out that while some countries may have decoupled their growth from domestic emissions, the picture is more mixed when accounting for imported goods. Meanwhile, many countries – notably India and China – have yet to significantly decouple annual emissions from growth.More broadly, since Limits to Growth was published, our understanding of how economic activity is damaging the planet has widened beyond just carbon emissions. Post-growth economics has emerged alongside the study of so-called “planetary boundaries” – hard environmental limits that, once crossed, could have disastrous consequences.The research focuses on nine ecological processes, from climate change to ocean acidification and ozone depletion, and for each identifies the safe zone in which we should operate.The most recent planetary health check,published in September, found seven of these nine boundaries were being breached to a dangerous degree.Scientists warn seven out of nine planetary boundaries have now been breachedSummary findings of 2025 Planetary Health CheckAtmospheric CO2 levelsAt a 15 million year highEcological diversityIn major declineLand area covered by forestsFallen below safe levelsFreshwater flowsUnstable, raising drought & flood riskGlobal nutrient cyclesDisrupted, causing 'dead zones'Chemicals & plasticsToo much released without testingOcean acidificationMarine organisms at riskAerosols in atmosphereFalling within safe zoneOzone in stratopshereSafe but recovery incompleteWhen put against living standards, the study of planetary boundaries reveals a trade-off.In 2018, researchers at the University of Leeds applied these boundaries to more than 150 countries, looking at metrics such as CO2emissions, ecological footprints and land use. They examined how many of these boundaries a country had breached and compared this with progress on a variety of social indicators such as income, nutrition and life satisfaction.Their key finding: no nation had met the basic needs of its residents while also staying within its biophysical limits.The better off a country’s residents were, the more environmental ceilings were broken – the very opposite of where they should be if they were growing sustainably.How this relationship can be broken, if at all, is where the efforts of ecological economists are now focused.The Guardian spoke with a range of academics working in the field and, broadly speaking, they identified three contemporary positions.The families of ecological economicsHow post-growth compares with other schools of thoughtAre planetary limits at risk?Is green growth possible?Can we rely on markets?Key policiesGreen capitalistsCarbon pricing, deregulationGreen KeynesiansGreen new deal, public investmentPost-growthPrioritise wellbeing, reduce overconsumptionOne group are the green Keynesians, who believe green growth is possible through state-led transition. A signature policy idea from this family has been thegreen new dealand the need for public policy that delivers green investment, infrastructure and jobs.On the flip side are the green capitalists, who again hope for growth but believe market reforms and technology will deliver it sustainably. Aside from optimism that innovation offers a way out, this group has also pushed ideas such as carbon pricing and deregulation of green industries. Both sides have shared ground, such as support for renewables or the need for public-private partnerships.By contrast, those in the post-growth camp disagree on a more fundamental level: they say continued growth is not possible while keeping within the planet’s boundaries.Victor said: “Post-growth encompasses many approaches, which differ in their scope and emphasis. However, they share a common understanding that the physical scale of the economy must be reduced to avoid further degradation of life-supporting planetary systems.”The de-growth movement has been one of the most high-profile incarnations of this view, with its calls for the radical scaling down of production and consumption. Many in this family believe the scenario in Limits to Growth is already playing out, or will do shortly, pointing to long-term productivity slowdowns and low growth in many western economies.De-growth proposals have included working time reductions, such as afour-day week, and maximum income caps, particularly to reduce the purchasing power of the rich. But there are others working within post-growth economics who take a more agnostic view. To them, whether green growth is possible is beside the point – instead policymakers need to shift priorities away from growth altogether to other measures of prosperity that can still improve wellbeing.In any case, as of the most recent Cop negotiations our global destination has been agreed. Under the Paris agreement, global carbon emissions need to fall 45% by 2030, with net zero achieved by 2050, to stick to the target of 1.5C.What remains uncertain is the path there and how, and whether, we can grow at the same time. It is, to take current global GDP, the $111.1tn question.Data sourcesIn the introductory chart, data for CO2emissions is sourced from the Global Carbon Budget project, while data on GDP per capita is sourced from the World Bank.The Limits to Growth chart was generated usingPyWorld3, a Python implementation of the World3 model used in Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World (1974).This model differs slightly from the original Limits to Growth model (1972) because of different numerical parameters and a slightly different model structure.This article was amended on 9 February 2026. Peter Victor is an emeritus professor at York University in Toronto, not the similarly named institution in the UK, as an earlier version suggested."

Sarwar’s comments followed the resignations from Downing Street of Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, andTim Allan, his communications director.Now therevelationthat a website claiming to launch a leadership campaign for Angela Rayner was briefly published last month has added to speculation about when the prime minister could go and who may replace him.As the phoney war has gathered pace in recent weeks, allies of Rayner and the health secretary,Wes Streeting, have been taking aim at each other.View image in fullscreenAllies of Angela Rayner and Wes Streeting have been taking aim at each other as the speculation over Keir Starmer’s future has intensified.Composite: Getty and PA“Anyone that has any association with Peter Mandelson should be nowhere near government,” Steve Wright, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, told the BBC on Sunday, in an apparent swipe at Streeting, who has long been close to the formerLabourpolitician and diplomat.Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting, told the same programme: “Of course, there are people in cabinet who need to question their own positions, because they were very close to people like Peter Mandelson. They may have known what was going on, who knows. But there are a couple in cabinet … and they know who they are.”Allies of Streeting have hit back, accusing Rayner’s friends of trying to distract from her own political difficulties given tax officials are yet to decide whether the former deputy prime minister underpaid stamp duty when purchasing a flat in Hove last year.“The truth is Wes wasn’t very close to Mandelson, their relationship has been wildly overwritten. It’s not like Wes was invited to his wedding,” one of the health secretary’s allies said.Streeting insisted on Monday he was not pushing for the resignation of the prime minister, saying: “Keir Starmer doesn’t need to resign … Give Keir a chance.”View image in fullscreenFriends of Rayner have told reporters she is ‘ready’ to run should Starmer step down.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesBut the lack of a vacancy has not stopped allies of the leading candidates touting the credentials of their favoured contenders.Friends of Rayner have told reporters she is “ready” to run should Starmer step down. One senior Labour figure recently told the Guardian: “Angela says she took the scars for Jeremy Corbyn, she took the scars forKeir Starmer, and so the next time she takes the scars it will be for herself.”The Sunday Times quoted one friend of Rayner as saying MPs who were “frothing at the mouth” at the chance to install Streeting as leader were “mad because he has been damaged by association with Mandy [Mandelson]”.View image in fullscreenThose close to Wes Streeting accuse Angela Rayner’s allies of exacerbating divides within the party.Photograph: Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockThose close to Streeting accuse these Rayner allies of exacerbating divides within the party. One said over the weekend: “The Labour party is pretty sick of the toxic briefing culture in No 10 and will not want to bring in something even more nasty.”Streeting and Rayner are not the only two potential candidates being talked about in Westminster. Some on the soft left of the party, who would normally be Rayner allies, are concerned about polls that show she is one of the least popular Labour figures with the public at large.View image in fullscreenThe Labour deputy leader, Lucy Powell, has been suggested as an alternative.Photograph: James Manning/PA“A lot of her friends, people who know her well and love her, just think she is fundamentally unelectable,” one said.The person suggested the deputy Labour leader, Lucy Powell, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, or the defence secretary,John Healey, could all be alternative candidates.Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, has not given up hope of returning to the Commons, having beenblockedfrom standing in the Gorton and Denton byelection. However, a leadership contest in the next few weeks will be too early for him given the party leader must be drawn from the ranks of sitting MPs.View image in fullscreenAndy Burnham’s tilt at a return to parliament was blocked by the Labour’s national executive committee.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThose close to Miliband say he does not want to lead the party again, having lost the 2015 election, though theSun on Sunday quotedone Labour source as saying: “Ed is preparing to run again. He has told people, despite what he says when he is interviewed.”Some in the party believeShabana Mahmood, who has conservative social views but economic views on the left of the party, would be the best successor. Her standing among Labour members has been hit, however, by the tough stance she has taken on immigration as home secretary.View image in fullscreenShabana Mahmood is seen by some as a possible candidate but her stance on immigration has affected her standing among party members.Photograph: Lucy North/PAOthers despair at the options from the top of the party as it stands and so are looking to the more junior ranks of recently elected MPs. One unlikely candidatebeing talked upby some among the 2024 intake is Al Carns, a former Royal Marines officer.He has many admirers inside and outside the party. “Carns understands about building a team and could do certain things that most MPs couldn’t do,” one political expert recently said.Unfortunately for Carns that expert was Boris Johnson’s former chief of staff Dominic Cummings.Explore more on these topicsLabour party leadershipKeir StarmerAngela RaynerWes StreetingLabourShabana MahmoodLucy PowellanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s an impossible marvel of TV makingJack SealeMon 9 Feb 2026 17.30 ESTShareTry not to be told about the central premise of Small Prophets, the new comedy byDetectorists writer/directorMackenzie Crook, before you dive in. In a show full of gorgeous surprises, the main thing that happens is the most precious gift waiting to be unwrapped. What you should know, though, is that this is everything a Detectorists fan would wish for in its creator’s new project: the same sensibilities take on phantasmagorical new shapes. Small Prophets is a pure, pure pleasure.Our gentle hero is the lank-haired, long-bearded Michael (Pearce Quigley), the only occupant of an overgrown semi-detached at the dead end of a south Manchester cul-de-sac. His daily routine: waking from a strange dream about birds, coaxing his battered Ford Capri into life, driving to his boring job on the shop floor of a DIY superstore, popping to his dad’s nursing home for repetitive conversation, then returning to his silent house ready to do it all again tomorrow. It has been this way since Christmas Eve seven years ago, when his girlfriend, Clea, vanished. They found her car by the Severn Bridge, but they never found her.‘Watching The Office recently, my heart just sank’ – Mackenzie Crook on comedy, cruelty and being TV royaltyRead moreThat could be the recipe for a bleak sadcom, with raindrops on windows and sugar stirred into chipped mugs of weak tea. But this is aMackenzie Crookshow, so there will be wonder below the surface. The detectorists found treasure buried in the soil and nestled in the trees; here, Crook sets himself the harder task of uncovering something truly fantastic in the urban ordinary.We soon realise that Michael has talents to confound anyone who might dismiss him as a raggedy eccentric. At first it’s in the way he stays sane at work by indulging his talent for wind-ups when he spots a gullible customer. As he improvises an elaborate variation on the old joke about tartan paint, or tells a man standing in front of a vast wall of bright blue buckets that the shop unfortunately does not sell buckets, there is evidence of a mischievous mind to match that of his father Brian (Michael Palin), who may be persistently unable to retain the information that Clea has gone, but is a whiz at constructing Rube Goldberg-style marble runs.When Brian suggests a scheme for confirming the truth about Clea that cannot possibly work, Michael and his much younger colleague Kacey (their relationship, a sort of platonic, gender-flipped take onHarold and Maude, is the most beautiful friendship you will see on TV for many a year) open their hearts and minds to it. Crook then unspools a tale that would, in anyone else’s hands, dissolve into facile whimsy. But he makes exactly the right decision in every moment, big and small.Most important is the casting. For Michael, the outsider whose charms are apparent to those with the sense to look, Crook takes Quigley, who was a supporting player in Detectorists, and gives him the lead role he deserves. Lauren Patel, who as far as I can see has previously appeared in Waterloo Road and not a whole lot else, is sensational as the thwarted, hopeful Kacey. And, as Brian, the old eccentric who understands just as much as he needs to? Michael Palin. Enough said.View image in fullscreenWhiz … Michael Palin as Brian.The creations further down the cast are singular delights too.Jon Pointingplays Clive, a millennial version of a classic curtain-twitching neighbour who keeps trying to tell Michael to trim his rambling hedge, but who ends their every encounter with fingertips on temples, bewildered and outfoxed. Then there’s Crook himself as Michael’s officious but ineffectual boss, Gordon, who has a ponytail long enough for him to reach behind his back and pull it straight with greasy fingers.What Kacey’s own improbable dream is, what the last thing that made Michael cry was, what Michael is doing in his house to keep Clea’s memory alive, what the deal is with the sullen teenager who endlessly cycles in circles around the close – all of these are resolved with sunbursts of imagination that are fantastically unlikely and yet, when they’ve been said aloud, perfectly rational. If there were a chest of gold on offer to the viewer who could predict how the scene where Michael is mugged turns out – how it is utterly absurd, then deeply moving, then both at once – nobody would be able to claim the prize.If there is a message or a moral, it is that there are still wonderful things at hand in a world that might seem like it is running out of them. The existence of Small Prophets proves the point: that British telly can still create impossible marvels like this is a reason to keep believing in magic.Small Prophets aired on BBC Two and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsMackenzie CrookTV reviewTelevisionMichael PalinTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the theater and violence of capitalism was still thereAaron TimmsMon 9 Feb 2026 09.23 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 09.48 ESTShareRoger Federer smiling wolfishly to the crowd: a return to woke? Adam Sandler hangdog in the Levi’s Stadium stands, Jon Bon Jovi mooching on the sideline like a retired dentist on a cruise, Billie Joe Armstrong belting out American Idiot during the pre-game show under his motionless meringue of fogey-blond hair: were they a sign? A New England Patriots team who were neither favored to win nor widely reviled, then promptly repaid a grateful publicby losing: was this the Super Bowl which proved that history really can move on, that America is not fated to remain hostage to the tremors and hatreds of the past? Well, yes and no.A year after Donald Trump made American football’s showpieceall about him, Sunday’s game in Santa Clara always promised a sort of correction – a cooling of the mood, perhaps even an end to the manipulation of sport for political ends. As always the best way to gauge the success of this mission was as the gods intended: through a TV screen. Trump –saddledwith historically low approval ratings, facing a massacre in this year’s midterms, and no doubt wary of risking a public appearance in the deep blue sea of the Bay Area – was absent on this occasion, and he kept the F-22 fighter jets that were scheduled to be part of the pre-game flyover away from Levi’s Stadium too. (Unspecified “operational assignments” were the reason offered for the jets’ withdrawal, which means there’s probably a low-ranking member of the Trump administration puttingbig moneyon a US military strike somewhere in Latin America as we speak.) And yet, the absent autocrat still weighed on proceedings, his curdling influence turning every moment and gesture on Sunday into a referendum on the prospects for a post-Trumpian sporting future. Could football be normal again?The Seahawks and the Patriots did their part by offering up a game of punishing defense and attritional offense that had all the carefree charm of a medieval torture procedure. Can football be normal again? That remains unclear, but on this evidence it can certainly be boring, which is maybe a form of progress. Despite the best efforts of professionaljaw surgerypatientJake Paul, the pre-game chatter was mostly about de-escalation: even the ESPN host Pat McAfee felt moved topoint out, on his first visit to San Francisco, that the city was nothing like the urban hell described by the catastrophizers of Fox News and other rightwing media outlets. Perhaps, for once, the Super Bowl would not be dragged into America’s tedious and interminable culture wars. BetweenPaul’s racist critiqueof the half-time show and the alternative spectacle offered by Turning Point USA, maybe all the right can do now is squawk impotently into the void.1:19'A surreal moment': Sam Darnold and Kenneth Walker III on Seahawks' Super Bowl victory – videoOn the field, Joe Montana, Peyton Manning and a bunch of other footballing legends got things moving by throwing out peace signs through a pre-game honor guard of young women with violins, and from there the tone of thisSuper Bowlas a grownup affair, all strings and restraint, was set. Even the pre-game ceremony to mark this year’s 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence had a shrugging, almost apologetic quality to it, the sermonizing brief and symbolism feathery: this was jingoism, but on Ozempic. YouTuber Charlie Puth was a surprise choice to sing the national anthem, and no one seemed more shocked than the man himself: dressed in the style of a fun dad on his way to parent-teacher night – button-down shirt, tie, brown leather jacket and straight-leg jeans – Puth dispensed with the standard bombast and delivered The Star-Spangled Banner in a feline whisper. Perhaps more than any other recent installment of American sport’s biggest day, this Super Bowl seemed determined not to draw attention to itself. “I know we won the Super Bowl, but we could have been a little bit better on offense,” victorious quarterback Sam Darnold told sideline reporter Melissa Stark after the game. Even in triumph there were learnings to glean, takeaways to digest, improvements to plan. This was the Super Bowl as corporate retreat, a moment to pause, reflect and reset for the year ahead.Relentless Seahawks pummel Patriots to claim their second Super Bowl titleRead moreIn Mike Tirico and Chris Collinsworth, NBC boasted two play-by-play announcers with the character to meet the soporific moment. Collinsworth, calling his sixth Super Bowl, offered a clinic in stating the obvious, noting midway through the second quarter that “this is shaping up as a defensive game”. He’s certainly not Tom Brady bad, but thenno one apart from Brady is. Meanwhile Tirico, realizing the dream that fired his defection from ESPN in 2016 to call his first ever Super Bowl, had to juggle duties at Levi’s Stadium with his role anchoring NBC’s coverage of the Winter Olympics, a fact viewers were reminded of approximately once every 30 seconds on Sunday night. “Champion will be crowned in 30 minutes,” Tirico announced at half-time with a theatrical pause, before adding with an elongating flourish: “Mmmmaybe more.” It’s a good thing NBC has the big man locked down to a long contract, because it’s unclear whether anyone else working in media today has the talent to produce material this strong. Tirico is the most white-collar commentator in American sports; he has an unparalleled skill for making every in-game call and on-set interjection sound like something your accountant might say to you as he’s walking you through your tax return. In that sense he was the perfect on-air complement to this turgid encounter, an anti-hype guy to suit the times.Yes, but was itwoke? Was the stagecraft behind this Super Bowl, both in the stadium and on TV, some kind of “statement” about America Today? Is progressive culture now “back” in any meaningful sense? The choice of Bad Bunny to headline the half-time show may have been ragebait for Red America, but however convincingly the field at Levis’s Stadium was terraformed to resemble the hinterland of San Juan (it was not very convincing), the Super Bowl did not ultimately herald some permanent “turn” on the part of the NFL toward cultural progressivism. No one, not even Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio himself, “libbed out”; however welcome or unexpected it might have been, the half-time spectacular saw no big protest about ICE or lament of the country’s rapid descent into authoritarianism. After last year’s Super Bowl turned into a Trumpified debacle, Sunday was all about evening up the ledger, about welcoming the sport’s non-Maga contingent back into the tent – a project in which the inclusion of Bad Bunny, the day’s lack of on- or off-field drama, and the bipartisan shock over$180 burgersall played a galvanizing role.View image in fullscreenThe view inside the stadium as the national anthem is performed at Super Bowl LX.Photograph: Jeenah Moon/ReutersAs always it was the ads, rather than events in the stadium, that said the most about the state of the world today. Apart from a few outliers – Guy Fieri as “some guy” in an ad for Bosch power tools, Adrien Brody going method for TurboTax, William Shatner as a near-incontinent ambassador for Raisin Bran named “Will Shat” – this year’s commercials advertised products that fit a dependable number of recurring categories: AI, gambling, food delivery and insurance. Here, in taxonomical miniature, was a brilliant summary of what culture has in store for us: slop, speculation, a retreat from the commons, and indemnification – if we’re lucky – against the disasters that await. Amid the tedium of action on the field, this Super Bowl offered a powerful advertisement for the theater and violence of capitalism as usual.Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LXSuper BowlNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are crumbling buildings, food shortages and corpses. But the invaders on the newspaper’s mind might not be from Mars: images of anEnoch Powellrally suggest fears about a different kind of alien. There is talk of rivers of blood.With this heavy-handed metaphor, the Lancaster-based Imitating the Dog shovesHG Wellsinto a time when the threat of annihilation comes from within: from lack of trust, suspicion of foreigners and selfish lust for survival. Yes, there is the occasional glimpse of an extraterrestrial tripod and some squid-like tentacles, but this War of the Worlds is so unconcerned about that, you wonder what attracted the creators to the book in the first place.The political message is not merely shoehorned in, it is also confusing: is London dealing with Martian invaders or not?The production describes what could be the fever dream of William Travers (Gareth Cassidy), not the worldly narrator of the original but a rightwing acolyte of Powell who has suffered a heart attack after being knocked over by a horse at his rally. Still in his hospital pyjamas, he wakes up to an apocalypse and wanders through a charred landscape of empty corridors, deserted underground stations and crazed survivors. He has a perpetual look of panic.View image in fullscreenPerpetual panic … War of the Worlds at Cast, Doncaster.Photograph: Ed WaringAnd a look is all he can give: there is so little dialogue in the visually based adaptation by directors Pete Brooks, Andrew Quick and Simon Wainwright that the four actors can only imply what they are thinking. What motivates their curt interactions we can only guess. When Travers stops being frightened and bewildered, he becomes unaccountably angry, his psychology always a mystery.For all the dramaturgical flaws, however, it is impressively told. With handheld cameras, back projections and miniature props, the precisely choreographed actors provide the live feed for a filmic odyssey projected above their heads. Abby Clarke’s sets stick to a claustrophobic palette of dirty greens and fiery ochres, while James Hamilton’s ever-present score swells in symphonic waves and electronic pulses. Technically, it is a triumph; emotionally, it is on another planet.Touring until 2 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreHG WellsDoncasterreviewsShareReuse this content"

Instinctively tapping on the usual suspects on your phone’s home screen becomes a reflex, and vast quantities of money and user data have been specifically employed to keep you reaching for the phone, ingraining it into our work, leisure and social lives. You’ll get no shame from me if you love your phone and have a healthy relationship with your apps, but I’ve found myself struggling lately.This year, I’m attempting to cut back on screen time – sort of. I’m replacing the sleek oblong of my smartphone with something a little more fuzzy and nostalgic. In an attempt to dismantle my bad habit, I’m closing the feeds of instant updates and instead carrying around a Game Boy Advance. I’ve been playingPokémonFireRed, a remake of the very first Pokémon games, which turn 30 this month. Even this refreshed version is more than two decades old.Improving your digital wellbeing doesn’t necessarily mean cutting out screen time completely. Not all screens are created equal. I’m hoping that swapping one screen for another isn’t like Indiana Jones switching out the golden idol with a big bag of sand, only for the booby trap boulder to crush me all the same.View image in fullscreenA remake of the very first Pokémon games … Pokémon FireRed.Photograph: Nintendo/MobyGamesI’d not played Pokémon regularly since 2006’s Pokémon Diamond on theNintendoDS, which was my introduction to the franchise. I dabbled in Pokémon Black on the DS and Pokémon Legends: Arceus on the Nintendo Switch, but neither stuck. I’d convinced myself that once you’ve played through one Pokémon game, you’ve pretty much played them all. But as Hollywood has profitably realised, 20 years is a long enough gap for something to feel fresh again.My first steps in Pokémon were taken in the Sinnoh region, so the prospect of visiting the Kanto region from the first games and catching the original 151 Pokémon felt exciting to me. But I couldn’t bring myself to start playing the original Red or Blue on a chunky old Game Boy. I might be trying to embrace a more analogue existence, but gaming without colour is my line in the sand.FireRed’s positive effects on my life arrived unexpectedly quickly. It only took a couple of hours of exploration and encounters with wild Pokémon to make me forget about my phone. It was sat right next to me, but it was no longer calling to me like Gollum’s ring. Usually my device would find its way into my hand during loading breaks and elaborate cutscenes on narrative-heavy and beautiful modern PlayStation games.Perhaps there’s some magic in FireRed’s more freeform approach to story and less overstimulating retro graphics. Maybe those gaps left by implied details in the design and dialogue leave space for my imagination – which my doomscrolling habit had nearly atrophied. The world of Pokémon is serene and charming, despite constant trainer battles and gruelling gym leader face-offs, and even those are quite low stakes. A gaming experience hasn’t offered me such tranquility since I first picked upAnimal Crossing. Try as he might, even Tom Nook can’t patent escapism.Curiously, this adventure, though fresh for me, feels nostalgic. I’ve never played with a team solely made up of monsters from the original Pokédex, yet somehow I’m transported back to the late 90s when it seemed like the world was going Poké-mad. I even named my rival after one of my childhood best friends. All these years later, it’s so satisfying to finally, thoroughly embrace this canon.Pokémon is hardly counterculture: it’s the most profitable video game franchise in history. Pokémon is gearing up for a 30th anniversary year with a McDonald’s Happy Meal promotion, a new theme park, a partnership with theNatural History Museumand a Uniqlo line among much else – so, if anything, it feels more zeitgeisty and omnipresent than it has in years. And yet it does feel rebellious to pick up an old Game Boy instead of my phone. It’s somehow unruly to take myself offline, just for a bit, to just have fun with a retro game. I’m able to enjoy technology on my own terms: I’m not coerced into microtransactions, I’m not relying on the latest oh-so essential firmware update, I’m not endlessly instructed tolike, comment, subscribe for more.View image in fullscreenVideo game developer Shigeru Miyamoto holds up the Nintendo Game Boy Advance during its launch in May 2001.Photograph: John Barr/APFilling the natural breaks in my day with an old video game has done me the world of good, even if it’s evolving my Psyduck while dinner is in the oven or taking down a gym leader while waiting for a package. My phone’s screen time is already down by three hours a week since beginning this adventure. In a small way, it’s helping me to stop comparing myself with others and begin to tackle some existential dread that doomscrolling seems to encourage. Playing Pokémon FireRed in 2026 is utterly nourishing, and wonderfully low stakes compared to a social media ecosystem where everything is trying to appear equally urgent and meaningful.If you’re trying to combat overthinking, insecurity or exhaustion by committing to the herculean task of using your phone less, take a quick trip to the Kanto region – or another resolutely offline game world.Explore more on these topicsGamesPokémonNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

I say, get a grip or get thrown outMon 9 Feb 2026 13.52 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 13.55 ESTShare“It’s nice, isn’t it. The quiet.” Thenow-infamous social media postproduced by a Starmer supporters at the start of his time in office is now written only in sarcasm beside yet another terrible news headline. Rayner resigns: “Nice, isn’t it. The quiet”; Mandelson sacked: “Nice, isn’t it. The quiet”; the prime minister loses his chief of staff – you get the picture.Around the time of that post, we had our glorious first conference in Bournemouth after winning our best election result in a century, and a prominent BBC journalist said to me: “We won’t have to cover the soap opera like before – it’s going to be about policy.” Imagine being the leader of theLiberal Democrats, known for our torrents of policy, and being told this by a BBC journalist; the phrase pig in excrement comes to mind.However, that wasn’t meant to be. I have never agreed withKeir Starmeron much. He is weak on political reform, and we have never needed it more. He was never going to end the cost of living crisis by doing a proper deal with Europe, as he could and should have done. And of course, he is Labour – so I knew the party’s instincts would be to centralise and bureaucratise everything possible. But I did think he would end the soap opera. He is a decent man; I did not see in him the same zest to attain power just for the sake of it. And like many people across the country I genuinely did want this Labour government to succeed.Regretfully, No 10: the Box Set continues from the last government, just with a new cast. Bad decisions on pensioners’ warm home discounts, the farm tax and compulsory ID cards all showed a severe lack of judgment – and that is before you get to the Mandelson debacle, a deep shame onLabourand on our country.So why haven’t I joined the chorus calling for the prime minister to resign? Isn’t that what Lib Dems do, I hear you say. Largely because I don’t think it is just Keir Starmer. The Conservatives tried endlessly changing the face behind the Downing Street door – and the rot at the heart of their government only deepened.I fear we could be in for the same with Labour: a neverending tussle over the keys to No 10, consuming all the energy of government that should be focused on the things that matter. Making sure people don’t die on trolleys in hospital corridors, for example.So here’s my ultimatum to Labour: sort yourselves out. Stop all your infighting and navel-gazing, settle your internal spats one way or the other, and get on with actually governing the country. Do the job you begged voters to give you.And if you can’t? We’ll need a general election. Because the country just can’t afford another three and half years of this.Some people will say, “Not another one!” Others will say this will putNigel Faragein No 10. On the first point, I have some sympathy. I’ll need new trainers for door-knocking; the wetsuit will come out of storage; I’ll have to check my bungee guy isn’t already booked up for the summer. But in all seriousness, we’ve had six prime ministers in the past 10 years – the “not another one” ship has already sailed. Either Labour MPs change the prime minister, or we all do.Let’s talk about Nigel Farage. Could a general election lead to that most horrible of outcomes – a Farage victory? I’d argue that limping on with a failed Labour government for three more years makes that more, not less, likely. And we know this threat isn’t inevitable: the Liberal Democrats have shown in local elections that in whole swathes of the country, Reform can be beaten.Reform UKand their patron saint, Donald Trump, feed on government failure. When the economy is failing, when hospitals are full of people needing care, when petty crime feels rampant on our streets, the populist right convinces voters that we don’t need a better, fairer system – we need to destroy everything.I’m really frightened that this is exactly the future Labour are sleepwalking the country into. We need to change course now – and that means more than just changing who sits in No 10. Labour need to get a grip on themselves and a grip on the problems ordinary people are facing. And if they can’t – better to go now and let those of us who can make our case in a general election.Ed Davey is leader of the Liberal DemocratsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I fear the question would lead to dissatisfactions too profound (would I be eating oysters right now? Would my socks be cashmere? Would I know what existentialism meant – no, I meanreallyknow?). This morning, however, I did stop and give it some serious thought: specifically, how would I feel if my government wrote to me, reminding me to have children? To get that letter from childless Macron would be like getting told off about your BMI by a nurse whose BMI is definitely the same as yours, if not greater: on the one hand, it’s none of your business who has kids or what anyone’s BMI is. But on the other, how about we just all keep out of each other’s business? Luckily the letter is going to be sent out by the health ministry, and say what you like about ministries, you can’t criticise their lifestyle choices.Before you get your panties in a twist, feminists, this letter will be sent to both men and women of the 29-year-old variety, and the government underscored that “fertility is a shared responsibility between women and men” – a statement that is both true and woke (yup, I’m reclaiming “woke” to mean “things I approve”).All that being said, the pressure on women is unlike that on men, for reasons that stretch into the thousands before you even get to “which one of them has to give birth?”. The age of 29 was presumably chosen symbolically, to flag that 30 is just around the corner, and that’s when you’re supposed to worry about your fertility. It’s an exceedingly cautious cut-off point, and a heavily gendered one, by which I mean, when did you last hear anyone say, “tick tock, tick tock” to a man on the occasion of his 30th birthday?Naturally, there’s a broader political dimension, some of which applies equally to mothers and fathers. For instance, while you’re unveiling a 16-point plan to tackle low birth rates, why not make the 17th point that if anyone could afford to house themselves, they might be quicker to settle down? Maternity leave, though, or the lack of it, remains quite a her-problem not a him-problem. I made a radio documentary once, years ago, about two adjacent towns, a couple of miles apart, one inFrance, one in Germany, and their different policies around motherhood. In Germany, mothers would probably not see the inside of their offices again for years. In France, childbirth was expected to take no more time out of your diary than a minibreak with one plane cancellation – which is to say: OK, more than a weekend but certainly not as much as a week. This was a long time ago, but my take-home was “both of these systems are bad”, and hey presto, 15 or maybe 20 years later, both countries have a birthrate “crisis”. Then again, so does the UK, and I’m not wild about the word “crisis”.The Epstein files expose just how cheap corruption is in the UKRead moreBecause this debate, as one sustainability professor, François Gemenne,told Sky News, is not just about babies and whether or not there are enough of them (at 1.56 children per woman, they are miles off the 2.1 required for a sustainable population). It’s also about the pensions system, which itself stands in for a wider conversation about the welfare state. And it’s about modern politics and its “obsession with immigration and the fear of being ‘replaced’”, Gemenne concluded.The obsession with fertility started with Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and his staggering motherhood tax breaks (mothers of three are nowexempt from tax altogether). This pro-natalist viewpoint was taken up by Elon Musk some years before he went full Trumper, and features worrying arguments about some humans being more valuable than others. If demographics were the problem, if policymakers were really just trying to balance the retired against the working aged, then their orientation towards migrants would be completely different. Countries with low birthrates would be welcoming, and have language lessons, and smiling, and induction days.In other words, don’t buy it, French 29-year-olds: you’re being used as pawns in the creation of a Great Replacement narrative. That’s the worst reason ever to start a family.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was not just failed vetting: there was a failure of moral seriousnessStreeting wrote off his re-election chances in WhatsApp exchanges with MandelsonMon 9 Feb 2026 13.15 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 13.21 ESTSharePolitics has a problem with sexism and misogyny. We need to be clear what it is and why. With every scandal there is a call to clean up the system, to reform vetting procedures and the laws governing the release of sensitive information. Those are serious issues, but we will not fix the problem by starting there because the problem is not procedural. It is about culture and behaviour.In the scandal of Peter Mandelson’s appointment to be the British ambassador to the United States, of course we need to establish the timeline of who said what, to whom and when.Gordon Brown is right to insiston a more rigorous process and a renewed commitment to the redistribution of power. But if we focus solely on what happened we will miss the important question of why it happened.This is more than a story about the flaws of individuals and the flaws of a system. This is about culture and moral character. About how, for too long, proximity to power insulated powerful, wealthy and well-connected men from the consequences of their appalling behaviour towards women and girls. The really worrying aspect is not what took place in secret. It is what happened in plain sight. A candidate’s knownassociation with a convicted sexual predatordid not weigh heavily enough on decision-makers. And we need to think too about the silence of those who stood by, who knew enough to feel uneasy and yet did not speak loudly enough to influence the decision.This is a group I include myself in. Contrary to what has been widely reported, I was not a close friend ofPeter Mandelson, but I am not going to wash my hands of my actual association with him either. After a weekend of smear and innuendo that I have something to hide, I have decided to publish my messages with Mandelson. From these messages, people will see that the main issue I have had with their publication is that I will put some of my colleagues in a difficult position because of what I said about the Israeli government ahead of the recognition of the state of Palestine. Mandelson and I saw each other for dinner on average once a year, in a group setting. He offered advice. My partner worked for him 25 years ago and I therefore got to know him better than others of that generation in politics, a generation I have always admired since I joined the Labour party as a 15-year-old in 1998. I wasn’t involved in his appointment, but like many other people I thought it was a good move at the time. The painful truth I have spent the past few days wrestling with is that, like many others in Westminster, I just didn’t think enough about the appointment or the past that was known. Also, like many others in Westminster, I filtered the news of it entirely through the lens of whether it seemed a sensible way to help our relationship with a critical ally at a crucial moment.And so, the real question is not simply how vetting failed, but how moral seriousness failed. A quick rush to fix the system – which will probably not stop the next scandal in any case – will close down the space in which we can arrive at serious changes; not just in process, but in culture and behaviour.People join theLabourparty because of a belief in equality and social justice. Yet that very motivation conceals a danger. As George Orwell warned, belief in a righteous cause can easily become a licence for cruelty, deception and moral indifference. If you believe you are on the right side it is easy to turn a blind eye.We need to be honest about the fact that if women such as Jess Phillips had been in that room when the decision was taken, Mandelson would never have been sent to Washington. I was struck listening to the debate in the Commons last week that powerful speeches made by women such as the Labour MP Polly Billington were also accompanied with exhaustion at having to make the same points that they, and many others, have raised before about the culture of sexism and misogyny in public life, as well as in every school, workplace and community in our country.“The standard you walk by is the standard you accept,” as the saying goes. That is why diversity in leadership is so important and why we need to push back hard at those who think that equality, diversity and inclusion are tick-boxes or fringe issues. Diversity brings different perspectives to every place where power resides. Who is in the room shapes what is said out loud, what is noticed, what is deemed to count, and what is silently laid aside. The absence of women’s voices in moments like this is not incidental; it is part of the explanation. This is a scandal, first and foremost, about the way men treat women and girls – and not just monsters such as Epstein, but through everyday sexism. We cannot allow that terrible truth to disappear.I have seen it in the NHS I lead. From victims of some its worst scandals to women such as a close female relative, whose severe pain was ignored by her male doctor not once but twice until her male partner vouched for her pain. Even the NHS, founded on principles of equality, ignores women’s voices and experiences.We can’t let this scandal be another that passes by without real change. The rules we live by cannot substitute for behaviour. There is no vetting good enough, no rules tight enough, no system of accountability strong enough if we do not understand this. We have to have the courage to speak up when silence is easier. We have to confront these moral questions. Politics is hard. Most of the choices are hard and some of them are tragic. But we need to accept that some forms of power are not worth the moral price they extract.Wes Streeting is health secretaryDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now all of Britain faces the falloutOwen JonesPeter Mandelson helped Morgan McSweeney privilege Labour’s reactionary forces in a Faustian pact to sustain the PM. What they sowed, we’ll reapMon 9 Feb 2026 09.27 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 14.08 ESTShareAchicken that loses its head can still, for a short period, run around and flap its wings: the illusion of life sustained by residual nerve impulses. After thedownfall of Morgan McSweeney– our de-facto prime minister – this is the phase Britain’s government has now entered. Those who have worked closely with Keir Starmer emphasise his lack of politics, while his own aidesprivately boastthat he is merely their frontman. McSweeney was the head, and the head has gone. There will be some flapping about in every direction. Starmer’s director of communications,Tim Allan has stepped down, the Scottish Labour leader,Anas Sarwar, is calling for Starmer’s resignation and the question of whether and when he will go is still open. But this political project is all over.This was not supposed to happen, at least according to conventional political wisdom. Before his collision with real power, Starmer was sold as competence incarnate: a figure committed to public service, presiding over a team of adults in the room who would spare us from the psychodramas of the Tory era. They had, we were told, discovered an electoral elixir. Ruling out significant tax rises on wealthy elites, attacking the welfare state and bashing migrants placed them in the fabled centre ground and would appeal to mainstream public opinion.In short, Starmerism was destined to thrive in office. “Starmer instantly looks comfortable as prime minister,”cooed Philip Collins, his former speechwriter and now editor of Prospect magazine, after Labour’s election victory. “I always thought he would and this hard-to-define sense is part of the reason he is PM in the first place.” Instead, the Starmer premiership turned out to be theFyre festivalof British politics: lavishly hyped in advance, buoyed up by elite enthusiasm, and collapsing into fiasco almost as soon as it began.Those ofus on the leftwarned this project would disintegrate once it encountered reality. The obvious retort is that opponents always predict failure. But the point is not that we predicted Starmerism would implode: we predictedwhy.When Jeremy Corbyn won the Labour leadership in 2015, the party’s right faced a choice. They could admit that their ideas were exhausted, that the financial crash had shattered old certainties and demanded new answers. When Labour secured40% of the votein the 2017 general election, overturning the Tory majority on an unashamedly leftwing manifesto, it was fair for critics to say this still fell short. But it was also reasonable to conclude the platform that delivered the party’s biggest surge in vote share since 1945 was something to build on, even as the Brexit culture war overwhelmed it in the lead-up to 2019.The party’s right chose a different path. McSweeney had run the leadership campaign of the Blairite torchbearer Liz Kendall in 2015, when she offered a political agenda similar to the eventual Starmerite offering. When Kendall secured 4.5% of the vote, McSweeney and his ilk concluded they could only retake the party through deceit. Starmer was the perfect candidate: a politician who wanted to be prime minister for its own sake, who served in Corbyn’s shadow cabinet and opportunistically sounded off against Brexit, and thus could rub the belly of theLabourmembership.It should have been obvious that this project was doomed when the leftwing policy pledges of Starmer’s successful leadership campaign – run by McSweeney – were so swiftly abandoned. As Paul Holden’s recent devastating book, The Fraud, meticulously documented, this strategy exposed that Starmerism was defined by deceit, cynicism and a desire for power for its own sake. And that it lacked any coherent policy vision of its own. McSweeney’s dominance symbolised the Faustian bargain that Starmer struck with Labour’s most reactionary forces in exchange for the leadership.“Morgan wouldn’t breathe without consulting Mandelson first,” aformer McSweeney associatereportedly confessed, and just days before his downfall as the US ambassador, the man dubbed the Prince of Darkness was in No 10 to help design Starmer’s reshuffle. Mandelson’s influence was not incidental. It was the inevitable consequence of a political vacuum being filled with Blairite retreads whose answers belong to another era.That Starmerreceived more freebiesthan every Labour leader on record including Tony Blair, and that Mandelson established a deep friendship with the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, are symptoms of the same problem. This faction of Labour is mesmerised by wealth, proximity to power and elite approval. This is what doomed Starmerism – exactly as the left warned.So what now? A third of Britain’s postwar prime ministers have occupied No 10 in the past decade, despite only one change of governing party. This instability has much to do with an unprecedented squeeze in living standards and a hollowed-out public realm, all of which has driven mass political disillusionment and anger. The basic truth is this. Our economic system fell apart in 2008. In the absence of a credible alternative, politics is defined by instability and an emboldened far right that thrives on the fiction that the key issue of our time is a zero-sum struggle between citizens and migrants.At the last election, little attention was paid to Labour winning barely a third of the vote amid the lowest turnout in modern democratic history. Given the extraordinary unpopularity of the outgoing Tory government, the lack of popular enthusiasm should have been a warning. Instead, commentary fixated on vibes. Starmer looked prime ministerial. His politics were deemed respectable.What links Jeffrey Epstein and Keir Starmer’s government? A thick seam of contempt | Nesrine MalikRead moreHad the left critique been taken seriously, none of this would be surprising. As the same pundits who once cheered Starmer on now tour the studios explaining his collapse, that truth is quietly buried. This was always a project rooted in cynicism and a desire to neutralise Labour as a threat to wealthy interests. It achieved its goal, and the very survival of the party may be the price.Alas, McSweeney has not just left Labour facing disaster but the rest of us, too. Even if Reform UK falls short of victory in the next election, a pact with the increasingly extreme Tories could deliver us to rightwing authoritarianism. If Labour had sense, it would understand that a broken economic model is the root of Britain’s malaise. It would adopt a programme of progressive taxation to fund investment in broken services and struggling communities. It would end the failed privatisation experiment and deliver a mass public housebuilding programme.To his credit, Andy Burnham is one Labour politician who gets this, but the hierarchy hasblocked himleaving Greater Manchester. Even if he somehow found a path to the leadership, the large number of Starmerite Labour MPs would probably bar such an agenda. Angela Rayner, too, would likely have to strike an accommodation with the party’s right, and deliver Starmerism with a Stockport accent. So the party may as well install Mandelson’s favourite candidate, Wes Streeting, and double down on its failure, stripping away all remaining illusions anyone may have about what this Labour party is about.The Greens are now the best bet to replace Labour in urban heartlands. One Labour MP – no past supporter of Corbyn – tells me that his wife plans to vote for them. A hung parliament with a large Green contingent could force a change in the voting system and offer a real chance of ending our failed economic model. In the wreckage that McSweeney has left us, it is our best hope.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourMorgan McSweeneyPeter MandelsoncommentShareReuse this content"

Others treat it as an exercise in Zen humility. I suppose relinquishing main-character energy could make travel less painful? “Be grateful that you’re flying and that’s it,” as James Cashen, a middle seater,explained his philosophy on TikTok.Cashen said his secret coping power was to strike up conversations. “Embrace the leadership role … You’re the glue,” he said. Responding to appalled commenters,Cashen clarifiedthat he went with the flow rather than initiating. This made me wonder: when I fly with my husband (Europe’s most restless traveller), I’m a default middle-seater. Perhaps, buried in a book, with earplugs in, I’m missing out? Could I be forging friendships or at least having an interesting chat?Friction-maxxing: could less convenience lead to much more happiness?Read moreThat may appal you, but I’m reading psychologist Dr Gillian Sandstrom’s forthcomingbook on talking to strangers, and she is evangelical about the many benefits: we learn, make connections, stimulate our creativity and get more comfortable with uncertainty and rejection.I asked Sandstrom if she had tips for in-flight strangermaxxing. She’s not a voluntary middle-seater, she says, but embraces the opportunity when it arises: she recently learned about US cross-country bike racing from a Polish seatmate (“Apparently, Kentucky has the most courteous drivers, but also the scariest dogs”). Her advice? Engage either on take-off or near landing by asking a question, maybe what they’ve bought in duty free, or tips on your destination. “What do you think of middle-seat people?” might also be an interesting one.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionAir transportcommentShareReuse this content"

So is everyone elseNils PratleyBank snares biggest acquisition since it was bailed out by taxpayers in 2008 but it isn’t cheap – and may be slow to pay offNatWest to buy wealth manager Evelyn Partners for £2.7bnMon 9 Feb 2026 13.38 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 14.40 ESTShareAnnounce a £2.7bn acquisition and watch your stock market value fall by £3.1bn.NatWest picked a bad day to announce its big move in the fashionable field of “wealth management” – the noise from Westminster created a poor backdrop for UK assets such as gilts and domestic banks. But the main problem with itsEvelyn Partners dealis that it is very much of the “one for the long term” variety. The terms are not obviously cheap.The NatWest chief executive Paul Thwaite’s strategic thinking wasn’t the controversial element because it is conventional. Lloyds, HSBC and Barclays are all talking about the appeal of managing money for “the mass affluent”, a cohort that tends to mean those with at least £50,000 to invest, but in practice usually implies much more.The attractions are, first, there is more mass affluence than you might assume. The lucky boomer and X generations are getting older, and the transfer of wealth to their children creates an opportunity for a bank to sell advice and financial products. That brings the stability of regular fee income, a counterweight to the core business of lending that comes with the ups and downs of the interest rate cycle.Second, regulatory and political breezes are blowing in the right direction. TheFinancial Conduct Authorityis loosening its rules to allow more useful financial advice to be given. Rachel Reeves wants more of the nation’s unproductive cash savings to be useful work via investing in companies and real assets, and her successors as chancellor are likely to agree.Third, younger generations probably grasp the dire long-term dynamics of the UK’s national finances. They understand that relying on the state pension for retirement is unwise and that exposure to the stock market is generally rewarding over a lifetime.View image in fullscreenPaul Thwaite, NatWest’s chief executive, in the House of Commons.Photograph: House of Commons/UK Parliament/PAThus the strategic logic of NatWest’s purchase of Evelyn, with £69bn of assets under management, adds up. NatWest isn’t a stranger to this market – like the other banks, it’s already in the wealth management game and, further up the affluence tree, it has its private bank, Coutts. Thus, with the addition of Evelyn, it can boast £127bn of assets in the broadly defined private banking and wealth market and say that fee-based income for the group will rise by a fifth. Not bad.The stock market’s grumble, though, was also logical. In the short-term, NatWest could probably get more bang for the same £2.7bn buck simply by buying more of its shares. Jefferies’ analyst did the maths: dilution of about 2% to medium-term earnings. That is partly because Evelyn is not cheap on whatever metric you use – five times annual sales, or 4% of assets under management. Or, most strikingly, the valuation per Evelyn’s 155,000 customers – about £17,000 a pop.Think of the long term, argued NatWest. It reckons there’s potential for £100m of cost savings, to add to Evelyn’s reported top-line earnings of £179m. It is also getting a direct-to-consumer platform called Bestinvest and a regional network of financial planners and investment managers.In effect, this deal is really about trying to encourage more of NatWest’s existing 20 million base of retail customers into an expanded wealth management set-up. At that point, an initial ho-hum projected return on investment should improve to eventually outstrip the easy fillip from buying back shares.The risk to the thesis is that growth in income doesn’t match the high hopes – perhaps because of the intensifying competition in wealth management – or takes longer to arrive. Come back in five years, say, to discover if the bet is working. This is NatWest’s biggest deal since the nadir of its 2008 bailout by the state and, sooner or later, Thwaite probably had to be more aggressive in the chase for the mass affluent wallet below the bracket of Coutts. But it’s a long chase and NatWest is not the only runner.Explore more on these topicsNatWest GroupNils Pratley on financeStock marketsInvestingFinancial Conduct AuthorityBankingcommentShareReuse this content"

Can we really depend on this technology?Mon 9 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 05.59 ESTShareRecently, the Rowsons accidentally invented a new game that anyone can play at home. I have yet to come up with a world-beating name for it, so for now let’s just call it “How bloody stupid is AI?” The playing of the game will change from player to player, depending on their circumstances – but essentially the rules remain the same. Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.In my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonistSteven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.It’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny. As a satirist, I have always been a fool for anything that points up the even greater folly of our leaders, the tools of their techbro masters or the true capabilities of our new robot overlords. Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”View image in fullscreenA friend, but not my wife: fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overviewwas “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically isnotmy wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:Textile designerFiona Scott-Wilson.PoetBridget Rose.ActorFiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.EconomistAnn Pettifor.Julia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this isthe fantasy author,the illustrator,the late powerlifteror another Julia Mills altogether).Writer and journalistEmily Rees.Lawyer and academicSiva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmasterJonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.Writer and journalistCarrie McLaren.Channel 4 News presenterCathy Newman.CNN correspondentClarissa Ward.Journalist and broadcasterRachel Johnson.My own daughter.View image in fullscreenEconomist Ann Pettifor.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.Then it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does heexist?There was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. PlaywrightLee Hallgot a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.As for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).Another search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalistAnn Widdecombe(hisex-wife),Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author,Polly Toynbeeis a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”View image in fullscreenCNN’s Clarissa Ward.Photograph: John Lamparski/Getty Images for Concordia SummitFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”I suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.While my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imaginethatfamily Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.We should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?I wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”Martin Rowson is a cartoonist and authorExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)OpinionComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

All bets are off now.Mon 9 Feb 2026 13.55 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 15.00 ESTShareThe Labour party spent 14 years in the wilderness, following the general election of 2010. It has taken only 18 months for the political project with which it returned to power to implode. Theresignationof Morgan McSweeney, Sir Keir Starmer’s chief of staff and the man credited with orchestrating his path to Downing Street, has left the prime minister isolated, rudderless and at the mercy of events he is in no position to control.Mr McSweeney fell on his sword after taking responsibility for backing the appointment of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador, despite what was known about the peer’s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. The hope, clearly, was that his departure will give the prime minister the breathing space to reset yet again. Monday’scallfor Sir Keir’s own resignation by Anas Sarwar, Labour’s leader in Scotland, soon dispelled that illusion, although it also provoked a show of loyalty from cabinet colleagues.What now? The prime minister has indicated that he will move to strengthen vetting processes and toughen up rules on lobbying, following revelations that Epstein used Lord Mandelson as a conduit for influence and inside information. Such reforms are overdue, as Gordon Brown has longargued. But the significance of Mr McSweeney’s exit – followed on Monday by the resignation of Sir Keir’s fourth Downing Street communications director, Tim Allan – goes deeper than the Mandelsonscandal, appalling as that has been.Many within Labour will share Mr Sarwar’s view that over the past year and a half there have been “too many incidences where the wrong judgment calls have been made”. The 2024 electiontriumphrevealed, above all, the depth of the nation’s determination to eject the Conservative party from office. But Sir Keir’s admiration for Mr McSweeney’s undoubted campaigning abilities led him to grant his consigliere excessive power and influence. The outsourcing of the government’s strategic direction served neither the prime minister nor the country well.On core Labour territory such as welfare spending, a hubristic No 10 clique took a confrontational and at times contemptuous approach to the priorities of the party’s own MPs. Subsequent backbenchrebellionshave eroded the government’s credibility and entrenched a public perception of the prime minister as weak and lacking a plan. With astonishing rapidity the opportunities presented by a huge parliamentary majority, and the goodwill of a country desperate for change, have been squandered.Sir Keir – and his disenchanted party – must now decide whether the loss of authority and trust can be reversed with him at the helm. At a minimum that will require an end tofactionalism, outreach to Labour’s broad left and the offer of a more inspiring progressive narrative. But the coming weeks and months will be a political calvary for the government, however they play out. The Gorton and Denton byelection this month will set the tone for May’s local elections, at which a punishment beating by voters seems inevitable. The mandatedpublicationof more than 100,000 communications between the government and Lord Mandelson will expose an unedifying world of political machinations to an already exasperated public.The prime minister may yet benefit from a period of respite, as would-be challengers contemplate their options. It seems unlikely that any of them would relish the prospect of leadingLabourinto a political bloodbath in May. Nor would the country be likely to look more favourably on a party that foisted a fifth prime minister in four years upon it. But this government has now lost control over the trajectory of events. For the foreseeable future, it is difficult to imagine how it could win it back.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Reports that Aberdonians have not seen so much as a sliver of sun since 21 January prompted an outburst of stoicism on BBC radio, with one resident commenting: “You have to get on with it, brighter days are coming”.Before then, however, north-east Scotland is braced for more heavy rain. For farmers and businesses in the affected areas, the impact goes far beyond inconvenience. Marketing consultant Sam Kirby told the Guardian that she had towork from a car parkin Cornwall following Storm Goretti, because her broadband wasn’t working. And Goretti was the first of three January storms.In Somerset, where more than 600 homes were flooded in 2014, emergency pumps have been added to the permanent ones stationed at Northmoor, in an attempt to keep water at bay. But some spoke of“a losing battle”in the face of escalating risk due to climate change. Cereal and vegetable growers are waiting for waters to recede before assessing crop damage.Following other recent extreme weather, the Environment Agency is embarking on a review of its flood management strategy for England (responsibility for similar schemes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is devolved). In aletterto the environmental audit committee of MPs, the environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, said that efforts at “strengthening workforce competence across the flood sector” would help English councils to cope, while a revised planning framework would take flood risks into account. But years of cuts to Environment Agency budgets, combined withconfusion over its purpose, mean that confidence in its capacity to lead on climate resilience efforts, including flood prevention, is far from assured. While relief workers have been praised by local people who are grateful for their efforts, the overall approach is criticised for beingreactiverather than proactive.There has been no recent flooding event in the UK to match the disaster that unfolded in eastern Spain in 2024, when229 people were killed, and where the region’s president wasforced to resignover the botched response. But with experts warning that torrential winter rains are arriving 20 years earlier than climate models predicted, due to a combination of warmer air – which holds more moisture – and an unstable jet stream causing weather systems to become stuck, the need for investment and clear communication around the growing threat is clear.The danger is that as extreme rain becomes more frequent, and people get used to drivers being rescued from stranded vehicles or pensioners from flooded homes, these events are seen as less rather than more alarming. Climate researchers have warned that the“boiling frog” effectcan make gradual change difficult to address. But with6.3m properties in Englandat risk, rising to 8m by 2050, ministers need to focus on climate adaptation, including drainage – and keep doing so long after the latest floods have receded.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromJohn WhitneyandPamela EllisMon 9 Feb 2026 11.59 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 14.40 ESTShareSimon Jenkins leaves one or two unanswered questions in his plea for state help with saving pubs (Here is a political lesson progressives need to learn, and fast: British pubs are crucial, 5 February).Why pubs and not wool shops? Or stationery shops or greasy spoon cafes? Should teetotallers be expected to donate towards keeping open the doors of places they’re unlikely to visit? And what about the jackpot question? Why are so many people eschewing pubs? And are they really the haven of heavenly camaraderie he depicts? Probably in the well‑heeled villages of posh Oxfordshire, but in the grim anonymous edifices of downtown Grimsville it’s a different story.Yes, governments have been bleeding small retailers on the high street dry for decades. But to single out the pub and weave a web of bonhomie and comfort around it is a fairytale. They are businesses and need to accept that if they want to keep trading, they need to work out how best they can do it. Not expect special treatment. Public money for the boozer? Who’d drink to that?Michael NewmanShefford, BedfordshirePerhaps Simon Jenkins should get out more. His nostalgic view of the pub as the social centre of a community that deserves government support plays to the Reform UK playbook. Has he not heard of community centres, for example?Very few pubs today are truly independent. Subsidising pubs means subsidising the major breweries. They are the root cause why pubs are an endangered species. Whether through direct ownership or managed leases, breweries have been squeezing landlords dry for years.John WhitleyMilford on Sea, HampshireSimon Jenkins suggests that “The church pub should become the architecture of a united community”. In the middle ages the custom of church ales served just this purpose, bringing the community together to celebrate and fundraise, with food, dancing and home-brewed ales. This was brought to an end by the Reformation, but perhaps an enterprising cleric in a community bereft of its pub could revive the custom.Pamela EllisYorkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

During the spring 2021 lockdown, my class was reduced to about 18 children, who were either the children of key workers or had special educational needs and disabilities (Send).For the first time ever, I could sit with an individual child for five whole minutes to resolve a maths difficulty, or have an in-depth reading discussion. As a class we did science investigations we could normally only dream of, due to having enough space and resources. Send children grew the confidence to give opinions or ask for help. Every child lucky enough to be in school truly fulfilled their potential in a way that could never normally happen. It was a vision of what education could be. However, March quickly arrived and the children were back to having no elbow room to write properly, and sharing vital resources between six.Anyone who says class size makes no difference hasn’t spent their working day squashed up against their colleagues and still be expected to work and behave at their best, as our children have to every day.Caroline ManleyLiverpoolOf course class size matters. I spent 42 years in primary education in various roles, from class teaching, being a music specialist, a visiting advisory teacher, a vocal animateur and a visiting tutor for PGCE/apprenticeship courses.I observed and taught classes ranging from one pupil to the normal 30-plus in state schools. In private schools, below 20 is the norm and it most definitely makes a difference to teaching and learning. The outcomes are not the same. It has always been the case that small classes cost money, and that’s the bottom line. Politicians and those in charge of education will never admit that smaller groups are better. The benefits massively outweigh the few disadvantages.Carole KendallLetchworth Garden City, HertfordshireLooking back on my teaching career, one of my most vivid memories of the late 1960s was trying single-handedly to “teach” a class of 48 nine‑ and 10-year-olds in a very overcrowded classroom. Note the inverted commas around “teach”. How far was I really teaching those children? I couldn’t know all of them very well; some regularly slipped my attention. That class included children with a range of special needs that I didn’t recognise at the time and couldn’t have met single-handedly anyway.Sixty years on, class size still matters. Falling rolls could help meet that range of special and other needs, and to give all individuals more attention. My pupils’ grand- or even great-grandchildren deserve no less.Prof Colin RichardsFormer primary school teacher and schools inspector, CumbriaRe the editorial advocating for smaller class sizes and stating an average class size of 26.6 pupils in 2024, I’ve recently come across the class photo from my final year of primary school (class 4A, Grange junior school, Bradford, teacher Mr Byrne) in which there are 43 pupils. So some progress has been made since 1961. (I still made it to Liverpool University.)Martin GoodwinStandish, Greater ManchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In the amateur era, Wales, with a much smaller population than that of England, had more wins than losses against most of the home nations. Welsh clubs were among the very best in the world and Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Llanelli all beat the All Blacks.The game and its culture had great resonance in southern Wales, where relatively slightly built men, fleet of foot and with flair (many from south-west Wales and Welsh speakers) ran with the ball won by forwards often hardened by work in heavy industry. Schoolmasters were dedicated to encouraging talent and participation in team games. Money and player size (except in the front five) were relatively unimportant and success bred success. For much of that era, spectator community spirit was characterised by the fervent singing of Welsh hymns such asSosban Fach.All that has changed. Rugby is now a game where money and size are all important. It has a totally different and commercial culture.Wales, a relatively poor country, has changed greatly too, culturally and industrially, and with its small population cannot hope to find enough huge men with sufficient talent, especially when at any given time so many are off injured. Unsurprisingly, empty seats at internationals show that interest in rugby in Wales has declined substantially. It was lovely while it lasted.Gareth ReesBristolI am pleased to see that your editorial on the decline of Welsh rugby emphasised the need to bring the sport back into schools. A noble sentiment. The same could be said of rugby and cricket in English state schools as well.In 1962, when I played for the English schools’ under-19 group XV against the Welsh and French schools, our team was composed almost entirely of state school students. The independent schools back then even had their own representative side that played matches against Scotland and Ireland. Today, most members of our representative age group sides come from the latter sector, where time and facilities are available for coaching. Otherwise, as has nearly always been the case in France, for example, it has been up to their clubs to nurture talent.Given concerns about the long-term effect of head collisions and our very litigious world, good luck to those who would like to see more rugby in Welsh state schools’ already overcrowded curriculums. Perhaps those “hymns and arias” might be firmly part of history.John MarriottNorth Hykeham, LincolnshireIt may be a while since Wales’ men won a rugby match of note (Analysis, 7 February), but it’s even longer since we had the misfortune of being a principality – the 16th century, in fact.Diolch yn fawr!Steffan ParryBorth y Gest, GwyneddHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Japan’s defending Olympic champion Miho Takagi took bronze in 1:13.95.Inside a packed 7,000-seat arena in Milan’s western suburbs, the atmosphere felt closer to Heerenveen than Lombardy. Most of the crowd wore Dutch orange, turning the venue into a rolling wall of noise as the final three heats unfolded. Among them was Leerdam’s fiance, theboxer-influencer Jake Paul, who wept uncontrollably from the second row after she won as her own tears left streaks of eyeliner down her face.‘She’s a grown woman’: skiers defend Lindsey Vonn’s decision to race despite crashRead moreKok ignited the building first, skating against American world record-holder Brittany Bowe and posting 1:12.59 – a time that, at that moment, stood as an Olympic record and set off the first wave of celebrations in the stands. But the decisive moment came one race later.Drawn in the final pair against Takagi, Leerdam delivered a masterclass in pacing and control. She opened in 17.68 seconds and produced the fastest 600m split in the field at 43.78 before closing with authority to stop the clock at 1:12.31 and lower the minutes-old Olympic record.Her final lap of 28.53 seconds completed a performance built on middle-phase efficiency rather than explosive opening speed, moving her to within seven-tenths of Bowe’s world mark of 1:11.61.“I knew that if during the race I would feel tired, I wasn’t allowed to feel tired,” Leerdam said after clinching gold. “I told myself: ‘You have 80 years to recover from this. You can feel tired after. You don’t want to live with that regret. You fought so hard for this.’”For Leerdam, the result represented both redemption and culmination. In Beijing in 2022 she finished second in this event behind Takagi. On Monday night, skating directly against the same rival, she reversed that storyline in a single, technically precise kilometer.“After the finish line I was surprised, very tired and very emotional,” she said.For anyone encountering Leerdam for the first time this week, the gold medal is only part of her story.The skater from the Westland region of South Holland, has become one of the most recognizable athletes in winter sport. A two-time world champion and three-time European champion in the 1000m in addition to the Beijing silver, she has also built an audience that extends far beyond the oval, withmore than five million followers on Instagramand millions more across other platforms.That visibility has made her one of the most talked-about figures at these Games. In Milan, she has largely bypassed traditional media, choosing instead to communicate directly with supporters through her own channels. The approach has frustrated some Dutch reporters beholden to a skating-mad readership but reflects a career-long pattern: Leerdam has consistently chosen to operate on her own terms. Former teammates and coaches say external criticism has often sharpened her focus.That fierce independent streak traces back to childhood. Family members have described her as intensely driven from an early age – someone who, once she chose skating, pursued it with unwavering focus. She initially excelled at hockey before switching over as a preteen, drawn to the individual nature of the sport and its clarity of outcome. In later interviews, she has described speed skating as brutally honest: the clock decides, not opinion.View image in fullscreenJake Paul was in tears as his partner sealed gold.Photograph: ANP/ShutterstockBy her mid-teens, that focus was already being paired with a broader vision. Former speed skater Ben van der Burg, who also grew up in Westland, has said Leerdam’s family recognized early that elite performance could coexist with commercial opportunity – an approach that would later make her one of the most marketable athletes in Dutch sport.On the ice, the results followed quickly. By 18 she was already a world junior champion, and within a few seasons of moving into the senior ranks she had established herself among the world’s best at the distance. Leerdam developed into one of the leading skaters of her generation, winning multiple world titles.Off the ice, she has been unusually open on her own channels, speaking about menstrual health and the pressures of weight management during her teenage years – conversations that former skaters and coaches say helped normalize subjects long treated as taboo in elite sport.Her profile expanded further in 2023 when she began a relationship with Paul. The couple, who announced their engagement last year, maintain a long-distance relationship between Puerto Rico and the Netherlands and have essentially become theTaylor and Travisof speed skating: #couplegoals writ large through one of the most visible crossovers between Olympic sport and digital-era celebrity.Paul watched Monday’s race surrounded by the camera crew that frequently documents his life. His presence – and the couple’s combined social media reach – has brought an unusual level of external attention to a sport that traditionally exists outside the global celebrity ecosystem.It has also brought its share of notoriety. Paul has generated headlines at these Olympics for outspoken social media commentary on US politics and culture, including inflammatory postsduring Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time showthat triggered intense online backlash and apublic disagreement with his brother Logan. Earlier in the Games he was seen sitting with US vice-president JD Vance at a women’s hockey game, adding to the unusual level of attention surrounding Leerdam beyond the rink.Yet within speed skating, Leerdam’s reputation remains grounded in performance. Aside from a fall in the 1000m at the Dutch Olympic trials, she arrived in Milan in flying form, including a track-record performance earlier this season in Inzell where she defeated Kok in the 1000m, a result that reinforced her status as the skater to beat in her signature distance.Former competitors say that combination – commercial visibility alongside consistent elite results – is what ultimately defines her place in the sport. Without the results, she would be an influencer who skates. With them, she has helped reshape how a speed skating star can exist in the modern sporting landscape.Monday’s race may ultimately come to represent the pinnacle of that career. Leerdam indicated last year that these Games could mark her final Olympic appearance. She is also scheduled to skate in the 500m on Sunday.If this was her signature moment, it arrived in the cleanest possible form: an Olympic record in the final group, revenge against the defending champion who once denied her gold, and a performance delivered under maximum expectation in front of what effectively became a Dutch home crowd desperate for its first breakthrough of these Games. For a skater who has spent much of her career balancing elite sport, public scrutiny and global visibility, it was the clearest possible statement.Explore more on these topicsSpeed skatingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lengths ski jumpers go to for Olympic gloryAfter a national scandal involving two athletes, Norwegian fans at these Winter Games don’t enjoy becoming a punchlineAndy Bullin PredazzoMon 9 Feb 2026 16.08 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 18.19 ESTShareYes, it’s time to talk about the ski jumpers’ penises. Although to be honest the ski jumpers themselves would prefer it if everyone could keep the conversation to their testicles. Figuratively. “This sport,” the former Olympic champion Sven Hannawald once said, “has a lot to do with balls.”This turns out to be more true than you might imagine, even for a sport that involves flying 100m down a mountain. As the world now knows, being well endowed is a distinct advantage for the simple key reason that when a jumper spreads their legs the crotch of their trousers stretches out into a wing, and the bigger that wing is, the further they’re likely to fly.Computer analysis suggests they get an extra 2.8 metres of distance for every extra centimetre of fabric.Winter Olympics 2026: Jutta Leerdam takes speed skating gold but GB medal wait goes on – liveRead moreWhich is why the ski jumping rules state that a suit is only allowed to be 4cm larger than the surface area of the body wearing it. But of course anyone who can find a way of temporarily enhancing that surface area when the official measurements are being taken would have the advantage of a few precious extra square centimetres of material with which to work. Which is why last Thursday the president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, Witold Banka, found himselffielding questions about whether or not the organisation was investigating reportsthat some jumpers had started injecting hyaluronic acid into their penises to make them bigger.No one in the ski-jumping community wants to discuss this. The federation that runs the sport says it is just a “wild rumour”. But the unfortunate truth is that the sport, and the Norwegian team in particular, has invited all this speculation after two of their athletes, Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang, were banned for three months after their coaches were caught sewing extra material into the athletes’ jumpsuits at the World Cup last year. Someone, and no one ever seems to have found out who, posted an online video of them doing furtive things with a sewing machine.View image in fullscreenA Norway coach uses a flag to signal when it’s good to jump.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIn the beginning the coach denied it. But when he came clean, he and two of the support staff – including the team tailor – were banned for a year and a half. The athletes got off with three months because they claimed to be oblivious to what was going on. Which is how they came to be back competing in the Olympic normal hill competition on Monday evening (normal, it has to be said is a very relative concept in this sport).It was a national scandal in Norway, which is the proudest, and most successful, of all the Winter Olympic countries. The Norwegians have won more medals in ski jumping than anyone else, and Lindvik is the current Olympic champion in the long hill. As funny as you and I might think this is, ski jumping is a beloved sport in the handful of countries that practise it, and the Norwegian fans I talk to about it during the Olympic competition don’t enjoy becoming a punchline. “I don’t want to talk about it,” one tells me. “It’s all behind us now,” is the only thing another will say. “It’s sad, very, very sad,” says a third.By the end of the night I’m beginning to understand more about why they’re so upset. Ski jumping is a great evening out. In Predazzo, where the Olympic competition is taking place, a big, happy band of fans from across Europe, North America and Japan are knocking back beers and hotdogs and shouting out at the athletes as they fly through the night. People are blowing horns, and banging cowbells. It’s an easy sport to love, and an astonishing one to watch.But the truth is no one really knows if this scandal is “behind us” or not. The federation insists it is, but a lot of the sport’s former stars have spoken out about stretching the rules themselves, partly out of a desire to take the heat off the men who have been banned, and partly as a call to reform the sport. The former Olympic medallists Johan Remen Evensen, Anders Jacobsen and Daniel-André Tande all told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK that cheating was common during their careers. They spoke about how jumpers used to wear suits with low-slung crotches, or tug their underpants down by their knees to stretch out their trousers then tuck them up again during inspections.View image in fullscreenGerman fans enjoy the ski jumping at Predazzzo.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThen Switzerland’s former world champion Andreas Küttel said he had been doing it, too. He admitted he used to spray his suit with hairspray before competitions, to stop the air from passing through it.The margins in ski jumping are so small, the stakes so high, and the sport is so sensitive to the tiniest variations of physics, that the athletes are always looking to game the rules. In the early 2000s, there were a series of scandals involving the suits and bindings, and in the late 2000s another involving extreme weight loss, which lead to widespread problems with eating disorders among the competitors. This problem still exists, despite the federation bringing in rules around the body mass index of the jumpers. Federations are perpetually caught in trying to find better ways to regulate the sport as the athletes look for new loopholes.This one will pass. Then another will come. And in the end these few months will be remembered as a brief moment – the briefs moment – in the history of the sport.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSkiingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was lovely to see them and know they are so proud of me, no matter what.”Winter Olympian Gus Kenworthy says he has received death threats over anti-ICE protestRead moreEveryone knows that fourth is the worst place to finish at an Olympics. But, for Muir, this result stung like pouring a gallon of antiseptic on an open sore.Coming into this final, Muir knew she was a strong favourite for a medal. She had won this event at the X Games two weeks ago with a score of 93.66, before qualifying third here. On this day, it just wasn’t to be.Instead the Swiss star Mathilde Gremaud defended her Olympic title with a score of 86.96 points, while China’s Eileen Gu repeated her second place in Beijing with 86.48. While Muir knew she was not at her best, she felt that bronze was there for the taking.Slopestyle involves three runs, involving skiing on rails before attempting three big tricks, with the highest-scoring run counting. And having fallen on her first run, and made a minor mistake on her second, Muir approached her final attempt knowing she needed to beat the 76.46 by Canada’s Megan Oldham to make the podium.The rails went well. The first trick was nailed. Then came a wobble on the second. It meant Muir needed to be perfect on a final jump, a huge double cork 1440, to give herself a chance. She was – and the reaction of the British team afterwards suggested it might be enough. But after a long wait, the judges had other ideas. Muir had scored 76.05 – and missed out on bronze by 0.41 points.View image in fullscreenMathilde Gremaud celebrates winning gold in the women’s freeski slopestyle at the Winter Olympics.Photograph: Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“I’m obviously a bit sad,” she said. “It’s just a tough place to be, fourth. I had a bit of difficulty in the first two runs. I got a bit annoyed at myself after my second run, and I’m really happy that I managed to pull myself back before my third run.“On the second jump, I was trying for a mute grab in my double just because it just makes it a little bit harder,” she said. “And I was really pushing for that extra boost that that might give me. And today it slipped away from me.“So I went back to safety to just get a run down and get my 14 in the last jump, because that’s one of my biggest tricks.”Muir will have another chance to win a medal when she competes in the big air next week, an event in which she finished fifth in Beijing. But, for now, this defeat has hit much harder than four years ago.“It feels completely different from 2022 because the last time I was 17, I put the tricks down to come fifth, the best I’d ever done them,” she said. “I was so proud of myself. It’s hard to say how I’m feeling right now. I’ve got a lot to process.As she spoke, Oldham was revelling in her surprise bronze medal. “I can’t even believe it, it’s crazy,” she said. “I’ve been dreaming about this for so long. I had a concussion two months ago and wasn’t really sure if I’d be able to ski.”The Canadian’s smile was a picture. The contrast with Muir could hardly have been greater.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We are ­looking into what exactly the ­problem is.“We will pay maximum attention to the medals. So that everything will be perfect because this is one of the most important things for the athletes.”Organisers have since suggested that the problem may stem from the medal’s cord, which is fitted with a breakaway mechanism required by law. The system is designed to release automatically if pulled with force, preventing the wearer from being choked.There were similar issues with the Paris 2024 Olympic medals, with more than 200 requests for replacements – roughly 4% of those awarded.Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026newsShareReuse this content"

Next year, we’ll be healthier. Next year, we’ll fix our offensive line. Next year, we’ll add that superstar receiver and retain all our guys. Next year.Dan Marino has been here. He lost a Super Bowl in his second season with the Miami Dolphins and spent the rest of his Hall of Fame career chasing a return. Joe Burrow was herejust a few years ago, a drive away from a ring. The Cincinnati Bengals were confident – certain, even – a Super Bowl berth was the start of something, not the end. But they quickly evaporated, and Burrow has trudged through disappointing seasons ever since.“Look, I told those guys. This may have been our only shot,” Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell said after his team’s playoff exit last season, sounding like a man who had peeked behind the curtain.Bad Bunny and jingoism lite: was this the Super Bowl where woke roared back?Read moreOnly the very best teams get sequels in the NFL – the likes of Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs or Tom Brady’s version of the New England Patriots.Thisversion of the Patriots showed on Sunday that they’re good, but not special.They were beaten by the Seahawks 29-13, with the final score doing a disservice to Seattle’s dominance.The Patriots didn’t just come up short; they were flattened. For much of the game, they could barely move the ball on offense, relying on their all-world defense to keep them within striking distance of a comeback. Drake Maye put together ahistorically poorSuper Bowl performance, flailing under constant pressure from Seattle’s defensive front. There were flashes late on, a hint of hope, but the Seahawks showed there are levels in championship games.“As great as it is, I wish the season just kept going,” Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said after his team’s win. Even covered in champagne, Macdonald understood the fragility of the moment. He may never crest this high again. There is a reason Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers own the same number of titles as Nick Foles and Trent Dilfer. Making the Super Bowl is physically and mentally gruelling. It requires an uncommon alignment of talent and luck. When those breaks fall right for a team, they need to cash in.And all season long, things fell right for the Patriots. The soft schedule. Maye competed at an MVP level despite being one of the youngest players in the league. Everything head coach Mike Vrabel touched turned to wins. It was a remarkable turnaround, from four wins last season to a place in the final dance this time around. But Sunday exposed every wart New England had managed to cover up.It was a matchup ofstrength against strength– and the Patriots leaned into it. They stubbornly stuck to the run game, ramming headfirst into the Seahawks’ defensive wall, fearful of Seattle’s pass rush. They chased explosive plays against a lockdown defense, and couldn’t spring anything down the field. They opened the game with eight straight punts. In the first half, they had 51 yards of total offense, the second-fewest by any Super Bowl team this century. Getting to half-time only 9-0 down felt like a win.View image in fullscreenIt was a tough day for Patriots fans on Sunday.Photograph: Kevin C Cox/Getty ImagesBreaking down Seattle’s defense was always going to be a challenge: Macdonald is a defensive savant. They roll eight deep along the defensive line, filled with game-wreckers and hustlers. Everywhere else, there is speed and talent.Maye and his receivers could do nothing against Seattle’s swarming, piranha defense. There were bodies in the backfield, arms in passing lanes, limbs everywhere. Maye had no space or time to operate. By the time he was able to string anything together, he looked frazzled, forcing throws and missing open receivers.And yet, somehow, the Patriots lingered because their own defense was magnificent. Cornerback Christian Gonzalez played the half of his life, shadowing Jaxon Smith-Njigba across the field and breaking up two would-be touchdowns.Patriots defensive coordinator Zak Kuhr blitzed Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold relentlessly, hopinghe would see ghostsand chuck the game away. But Darnold remained composed, navigating a cluttered pocket and escaping trouble. In a defensive contest, throwaways, incompletions and late scampers are decisive. Avoiding sacks and turnovers is the key.The Patriots and Maye could do neither. There is an old coaching axiom: an offense can work around having one sinkhole along the offensive line. Working around two is tough. But working around two who stand next to each other is almost impossible. Seattle picked on the weak left side of New England’s offensive line. Rookies Will Campbell and Jared Wilson were overwhelmed. Macdonald dialed up pressure after pressure, targeting the duo repeatedly. Next Gen Stats credited Campbell with 14 pressures allowed, the most by any player in a game this season. When the Patriots tried to address the problem in the second half, Macdonald flipped his approach. Knowing the Patriots would offer help to their left side left the door open to free pass-rushers from their right. For a coach as good as Macdonald, it was easy work.Every blitz came screaming home. Maye was hit, hurried and harassed, pressured on more than half his dropbacks. Heperceivedpressure on almost all of them, throwing off-target even when he had time.Without a receiver who could win downfield, without protection that could hold for two beats, the offense shrank. New England’s play-calling remained conservative, almost frightened, until it was too late.By the time the Patriots opened things up and finally let Maye cook, the kitchen had already burned down. He started seeing ghosts. He was staring down at pass-rushers who weren’t there. He threw late and hopefully. He finished with two interceptions, including a back-breaking pick-six, a fumble and six sacks. By the end of the game, with the Patriots having the smallest opening for a comeback, Maye was washed. Afterfinallyestablishing some rhythm, Maye tried to chase the game back with one knockout throw.It didn’t go well.For the Patriots to have a chance, they needed their quarterback to be special. He was anything but. He finished 11-of-20 for 135 yards with a touchdown, two interceptions and a fumble when put under pressure. Darnold, meanwhile, struggled when facing heat, but crucially didn’t turn the ball over.“Nobody [on the Patriots] played good enough for us to win,” Vrabel said post-game. “We are 307 days into what is hopefully a long and successful program.”And there it is – the promise of tomorrow. It’s an easy sales pitch to buy: the Patriots were two years ahead of schedule. Maye is only 23 and, despite Sunday, one of the best quarterbacks in the league. The defense is championship caliber. The roster flaws are fixable. They have oodles of cap space. Another draft, another offseason, a healthy line, a proper No 1 receiver. The Eagles have shown a recent blueprint, returning from a Super Bowl loss to win it all within two seasons.Drake Maye Super Bowl statsBut it won’t be that easy. No team nails every draft pick or free-agent pickup, certainly not two years in a row. Besides, teams crumble. Critical players are picked off in free agency. Players and coaches leave. Injuries bite. TheDisease of Mecreeps in. The schedule will harden. Just a year ago, the Washington Commanders made it to the NFC title game on the back of an outstanding rookie quarterback. A year later, they won five games and decided toblow things up.Some will point to the fact that the Patriots’ path to the Super Bowl goes through the AFC, weaker right now than the Seahawks’ NFC. But the AFC will grow teeth, too. Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Mahomes and Burrow aren’t disappearing. Neither will the Chargers, Texans, Broncos or Jaguars. There are plenty of teams waiting for their own crack at a title.The Patriots earned their shot this year. But nothing says they’ll get another anytime soon. Only four quarterbacks have come back to win a Super Bowl after losing their first Super Bowl start. Even for theNew England Patriots,that’s thin ice.The promise of next year is comforting. The league, though, only offers now. And with a chance to spring an upset, the Patriots were unmasked as pretenders.Explore more on these topicsNew England PatriotsSuper Bowl LXNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has been dubbed “LinkedIn Liam” because of some of his quotes, compared to David Brent because of his mannerisms and mocked after miscontrolling a ball last week during his side’s defeat by Arsenal. The reaction towards the former Strasbourg manager has been intense.“The reason I know this is because I’ve got teenage children,” Rosenior said before Tuesday night’s home game against Leeds. “They’re on social media. It affects them. It affects my parents, it affects my family. But I knew walking into this job it was going to happen. It’s normal.“When you’re prepared for it, it makes you smile. I’m a confident person. And if you’re affected by things like that you shouldn’t be in this job. There’s no way you can do this job if you’re affected negatively by it. I quite enjoy it, to be honest. I didn’t help myself with my first touch at Arsenal. But that comes with the territory. I’m enjoying the job. And I know in time people will start judging me on what they see on the pitch, which is the most important thing.”Asked why he had expected it, he said: “Maybe my background and my coaching and being at a club the size of this is different. It’s different. I’m not a massive name. I’m from a different type of club and have a different type of character.”Rosenior had roles at Derby and Hull before moving to France to manage Strasbourg. He considered suggestions that the mockery feels different. “I don’t know if you’re trying to lead me to say anything,” he said. “It doesn’t affect me. I’ve been prepared to do this job for years, for decades, and I knew what would come with it. And it actually doesn’t affect me at all, because I know the focus is doing the job and enjoying it.“I love this job. I’m enjoying it. I’m not afraid to be myself. If I wear glasses, if I sound a little bit over the top when I speak, or articulate myself in a certain way, or I don’t look like a manager, it doesn’t bother me at all.”It was put to Rosenior that it seems weird for there to be such a negative response to a young English manager showing promise in a big job. “Yeah, I agree with what you’re saying. Erm, I’ll leave it at that.” Asked whether he put it down to British culture, ­Rosenior said: “I’m not going to go into that. People make their own judgments on people before they meet them. That’s part of life.”Rosenior hopes Reece James will be fit to face Leeds after missing games against Arsenal and Wolves. The captain has been out with a minor knock and felt unwell on Monday.

Hackney went close to putting Boro further ahead, firing inches wide of Cooper’s right-hand post before Bamford had a great chance to equalise, bringing the ball down from a superb Hamer pass and firing a fraction wide of the target.Brynn came to Middlesbrough’s rescue with a superb save to keep out Hamer’s well-struck effort and Cooper did likewise for Sheffield United, getting down well to turn Whittaker’s shot wide.The visitors went 2-0 up in the final minute of the half when Hackney’s drive struck Cooper’s right-hand post, the ball bounced up and McGree was quickest to react, heading the loose ball into the unguarded net.As the home side looked for an early second-half goal to inspire a revival, an inviting ball across the face of goal from Callum O’Hare was just too far in front of the lurking Bamford. Bamford did pull a goal back in the 73rd minute, controlling a great ball into the area from Hamer before beating Brynn from 12 yards.Rothwell, who came on as a substitute at the start of the second half, was shown a red card in the 80th minute following a reckless challenge on Alan Browne and that all but ended any hopes of getting anything from the game.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedMiddlesbroughmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the intervening years they formed a formidable ­partnership, sharing an office throughout, with Green an architect, alongside Hayes, of an ambitious blueprint that would take the women’s team to the top of English and European football. He was particularly involved in the club’s recruitment strategy alongside Hayes, masterminding a process that would have Chelsea operating three or four transfer windows ahead.WSL talking points: Arsenal punish City and Chelsea get into the grooveRead moreGiving an insight into their relationship in 2023 Hayes said that she would “tell him I want to get to the moon, he’ll tell me the rocket isn’t built yet”.Green also stepped in, alongside assistant manager Denise Reddy, to lead the team when Hayes missed six games due to an emergency hysterectomy.During his time at the club they won 19 trophies, including eight league titles and six FA Cups.Sam Kerr praised his influence on social media: “Thank you PG for everything you have done for us!” the forward wrote. “We wouldn’t have all the success we have had without you! Big big loss for the club.” Erin Cuthbert also posted on Green’s impact on her career.The loss of Green’s experience and wider influence within the game marks a sea change at Chelsea, with the head of women’s football having been widely considered a key ­continuity piece following Hayes’s decision to leave the club to become head coach of the US women’s national team.The Guardian understands that Green’s influence and role in decision-making has been increasingly impeded at Chelsea, with co-sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, taking more of an active role around the women’s team.Green’s departure comes days after the club announced anew long-term contractfor the manager, Sonia Bompastor, who he helped recruit following the departure of Hayes, and who achieved an unbeaten domestic treble in her first season in charge. However, Bompastor has come under fire from a section of Chelsea fans in recent weeks after back-to-back defeats to Manchester City and Arsenal compounded feelings around a string of poor performances. It was the first time the Blues had suffered successive losses since 2015.Chelsea’s statement said: “His commitment, experience and professionalism have been valued across the club, and his work has helped support a sustained period of success and progress forChelsea Womenduring which we won 19 trophies. The club would like to thank Paul for his dedication and service over more than a decade and wishes him well for the future.”Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Much of the opposition centres around antisocial behaviour experienced during England matches and, as revealed by the Guardian, theRFU hosted a drop-in event for residentsin an effort to convince them that their concerns were being taken seriously.Six Nations on road to perdition unless chastening Celtic wake-up call is heeded | Robert KitsonRead moreLast Saturday, it is understood that 24 FPNs were handed out to those committing urinating offences which took place in a number of places including front gardens, alleyways, main roads, and bushes. That is despite attempts to tackle the problem by installing barriers in hotspots and deploying plain-clothed officers and stewards to ward off potential offenders. The FPN amount is £150 but if paid within 10 days it goes down to £100.Councillor Gareth Roberts, leader of Richmond council, said: “We love the fact that Twickenham is the home of English Rugby and that people come from round the world to visit our borough and watch a match, but rugby fans should take this as a warning. If we catch you using our borough as a toilet, we will fine you. No ifs, no buts.”As revealed by the Guardian in October, theunion raised the possibility of using “anti-pee paint”, which is designed to leave offenders “covered in their own urine”, when applying for a new licence, which would have paved the way for more concerts.View image in fullscreenThe RFU tried to crack down on antisocial behaviour from rugby fans going to and from Twickenham for the England-Wales game.Photograph: Simon King/ProSports/ShutterstockLast month, the RFU laid out its plans to tackle antisocial behaviour. The union said it was “strengthening coordination with the relevant authorities and ensuring that antisocial behaviour has clear consequences, including working with the Metropolitan police, TfL, and Richmond council so matchday issues can be dealt with quickly and appropriately, and that fixed-penalty notices are being issued for offences such as public urination”.When applying for a new licence in September, the RFU had a setback when Richmond council determined that the limit of three concerts – and only one not on a Saturday – must remain. The licensing subcommittee meeting was told that there were 192 representations against extending the RFU’s licence and only 13 in favour. One representation read: “The pavements and roads are unhygienic, and children are having to walk and scoot through dried urine and excrement,” while another provided evidence showing “urination and indecent exposure” on the individual’s property.The RFU’s push for more concerts is running in two parts: licensing and planning. The union also had a setback with its planning application last summer but intends to reapply after the local elections in May as well as request a new licence. Before then, the union is on a charm offensive with local residents, vowing to “be the best neighbour we can be”.There is only one more men’s international – against Ireland later this month – before the RFU resubmits its application to the council. Only five days before the local elections, however, Twickenham will host the annual Army v Navy match which has been notorious for antisocial behaviour in the past.Meanwhile, Steve Borthwick is set to keep changes to a minimum for England’s trip to Scotland on Saturday after his side put Wales to the sword in a 48-7 win last weekend. Ollie Lawrence is expected to miss out on a return to the side with Tommy Freeman remaining in the centres with Fraser Dingwall. Borthwick is also poised to keep faith with hat-trick hero Henry Arundell and Tom Roebuck, who was a late call-up to replace the injured Immanuel Feyi-Waboso against Wales. In the pack, it would be a major surprise if Borthwick does not restore Maro Itoje to the second row and the captaincy.England head to Murrayfield on the back of 12 straight wins to face a Scotland side who were stunned by Italy in Rome last week but the fullback Freddie Steward said: “Regardless of what has been before, when Scotland play England, you get the best of them. I don’t think it will affect their mentality too much but we know that when they come and play us, they’ll be full of emotion and ready to go.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamWales rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Now Manchester United must try to replace himThe Brazilian was often exposed by the tactics of Ten Hag and Amorim, but was always adaptable and a replacement will be expensiveDominic BoothMon 9 Feb 2026 15.00 ESTShare“Leave the football before the football leaves you.” The meme-baiting quote from Jamie Carragher hung heavy over Casemiro for a long while, but it is testament to the Brazilian’s character and durability that he will leaveManchester Unitedthis year on his own terms, two years after those infamous words from the former Liverpool player.In fairness to Carragher, context at the time was key. After Unitedwere hammered 4-0 by Crystal Palacein May 2024, Casemiro looked spent at the elite level, bypassed too easily in increasingly fast‑tempo matches and left for dead by Erik ten Hag’s high-risk tactics.Casemiro could have taken the easy route out to the Saudi Pro League – it was hardly like he had anything to prove given his impressive medal collection. Back then it seemed United would do almost anything to offload him; now it is clear that replacing him will be the club’s trickiest summer task, another challenge for Jason Wilcox and company.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreLate-era Casemiro – he turns 34 this month – added discipline to his game and became wary of his weaknesses when exposed against runners through the middle. He was happy to sit deep and use his remarkable ability to read the play, ready to time those trademark tackles and release more energetic midfield partners. Aerially, he remained a colossus in both penalty boxes. United managers did not always get the midfield structure right around him – not least Ten Hag – but the former Real Madrid linchpin got on with his job without making a fuss.Filling the Casemiro void will be expensive for United, even if removing his significant wages offers financial relief. The club have made clear that overhauling their midfield is a top transfer priority, after 2025 was spent restructuring the attack with about £200m splashed on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Of the current crop of midfielders, only Kobbie Mainoo appears locked in for next season. Bruno Fernandes is still coveted by clubs in Saudi Arabia, and Manuel Ugarte’s difficult adaptation to English football leaves the exit door open should United receive a sufficient bid. United may need to sign two or three midfielders, but a specialist defensive pivot will be top of the list.View image in fullscreenCasemiro celebrates scoring against Fulham earlier this month. He remains an aerial powerhouse in both boxes.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPACarlos Baleba fits that profile. Unitedexplored a deal last summerbut were deterred by Brighton’s valuation, north of £100m. After a slow start to the season, the Cameroonian is reaffirming his reputation as one of the league’s best talents outside the traditional big six and he could be pursued once again. At 22 and with the defensive and physical attributes to slot into the Casemiro role, he remains an attractive proposition.Elliot Anderson will have no shortage of suitors this summer thanks to his performances for Nottingham Forest and his rise into Thomas Tuchel’s first-choice England lineup. The 23‑year‑old could feasibly act as a more energetic and progressive version of Casemiro; he possesses the engine and passing game to play in an elite midfield, but a stumbling block could be Forest’s valuation of one of their prize assets. Evangelos Marinakis will rightly demand top dollar for Anderson, if he chooses to sell at all.Something similar can be said for Crystal Palace and Adam Wharton, though the recent Selhurst Park fire sale perhaps weakens the Eagles’ negotiating position. Wharton may feel he is due a transfer in the same way Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze and Marc Guéhi were granted dream moves. As a Blackburn lad, he has links to the north-west so many expect a bunfight between United and City for his signature.Stylistically, however, Wharton poses a dilemma. He would perhaps need a destroyer alongside him because he is primarily a distributor, a natural risk-taker in possession. He has thrived playing next to the workhorse Will Hughes at Palace. Would Wharton and Mainoo complement each other as a pairing?Alternatives include bringing Rúben Neves back to the Premier League after a three‑year sojourn with Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia, or taking a punt on Stuttgart’s highly rated Angelo Stiller. Neither player is an ideal fit given United’s preference for players in their early to mid-20s who have cut the mustard in the English top flight. Neves has done so at Wolves, albeit not recently, but will turn 29 in March. Stiller, 24, may be regarded as an unknown quantity owing to his lack of Premier League experience. The Bournemouth pair Tyler Adams and Alex Scott, 26 and 22 respectively, fit United’s criteria but are not names to truly excite the fanbase.View image in fullscreenBrighton’s Carlos Baleba is a player coveted by United, and plenty of other clubs.Photograph: Jeff Mood/ProSports/ShutterstockThe caveat is what a new permanent manager, if appointed in the summer, would demand. Ruben Amorim’s departure came on the back of an altercation with United’s hierarchy over transfer control; presumably a new man will have his own thoughts on his side’s midfield structure, which United would be wise to heed.Michael Carrick has favoured 4‑2‑3‑1 with Mainoo alongside Casemiro. Will his successor, assuming Carrick does not land the role permanently, require a similar balance in midfield? As with so many questions around United right now, they must find the answer this summer.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the world No 80 Osorio – who won a WTA Challenger event in Manila last month – regrouped for the second set, as Raducanu struggled to find her range from the baseline.The pressure from Osorio soon told as she broke Raducanu then held to move ahead 4-2 before maintaining her momentum to take it 6-4 and level the match.Raducanu was broken again at the start of the deciding set, ­choosing not to chase a drop shot to the net before calling for the physio. After a lengthy conversation – and having her blood pressure checked – the Briton went back on court, but then lost the ­second game to love and walked back to the net to shake Osorio’s hand and retire.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Sarwar and his advisers have calculated it will be impossible for Starmer to recover after the scandal over Peter Mandelson’s links to Jeffrey Epstein.1:11Scottish Labour leader calls for Keir Starmer to resign as PM – videoHis call for Starmer to go comes as a serious blow to the prime minister, who is fighting to reassert control over his party after accepting theresignation of his closest adviser, Morgan McSweeney, amid anger over the appointment of Peter Mandelson as US ambassador.But senior Labour sources said McSweeney’s departure had left the prime minister dangerously exposed as he headed towards aseries of electoral challenges– including the Scottish elections – that could determine his political fate.Sources close to Eluned Morgan, Labour’s first minister in Wales, denied on Monday she was planning to add her voice to the call for Starmer to go even though the party also faces a hammering in the Welsh elections in May.Sarwar told the press conference that his first priority was toScotlandand that he did not want to “sacrifice” the country to a third decade of an SNP government.“That’s why the distraction needs to end, and the leadership in Downing Street has to change. It is so obvious that we desperately need change in Scotland and in three months’ time the opportunity to get rid of a failing SNP government is one that is too important to be missed,” he said.“We cannot allow the failures at the heart of Downing Street to mean the failures continue here in Scotland, because the election in May is not without consequence for the lives of Scots.”He added: “The people of this great country, Scotland, are crying out for competent government, for transparency, for honesty and for delivery. They want to see politics that is open and accountable. They want to see leaders who put the national interest before themselves.“That is the standard I will always apply. In three months, we have an election that must be about one thing and one thing only: Scotland. That is my duty, that is my priority, that is my loyalty, and that is Scotland’s choice.”Sarwar revealed that he told the prime minister earlier in the day that he planned to call for his resignation and that “it’s fair to say, we didn’t agree”.After a tumultuous few days, David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, was the first cabinet minister to publicly back the prime minister, after hours of silence from his senior ministerial team.“Keir Starmer won a massive mandate 18 months ago, for five years to deliver on Labour’s manifesto that we all stood on. We should let nothing distract us from our mission to change Britain and we support the prime minister in doing that,” he posted.Douglas Alexander, the Scotland secretary, who works closely with Sarwar, said: “Anas has reached his own decision and I respect that. My job – as Anas acknowledged today – is to make sure Scotland’s voice is heard in cabinet. My focus remains on doing that.”There was an immediate backlash among some Scottish Labour MPs, who have privately been among the most critical of the prime minister, with one telling the Guardian: “Anas does not speak for us all.”Cabinet ministers including Rachel Reeves, the chancellor; Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary; and John Healey, the defence secretary, rallied round the prime minister, although the support of some was more muted.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, who is known to have leadership ambitions of his own, told Sky News that although the atmosphere was febrile, “Keir Starmer doesn’t need to resign.” He added: “It has not been the best week for the government … Give Keir a chance.”Some cabinet ministers in London were shocked by Sarwar’s intervention. One told the Guardian: “I can’t for the life of me understand what he’s doing. It would be madness to have a leadership contest and delegate the future of the country to the Labour membership.”Downing Street said Starmer was not resigning and would be “concentrating on the job in hand”. His official spokesperson described his mood as “upbeat” and “confident” as he addressed No 10 staff.Sources close to the prime minister have suggested that he spent the weekend reflecting on his future. But the spokesperson said: “That is not the prime minister who appeared in front of staff this morning. It is very clear that he remains determined to tackle the job in hand.”Sarwar’s team was deeply irritated to learn last week that the prime minister had been arguing internally that he needed to remain in office to help Scottish Labour win the May election. They believe the polls show that Starmer’s continued leadership will destroy their electoral chances.Polling by More in Common found on Friday that Labour had fallen four points in the Holyrood constituency vote, slipping behind Reform into third place, and was also a point behind Reform on the list vote.Until the latest developments in the Epstein scandal, Sarwar had repeatedly defended Starmer’s record and as recently as last week had offered the prime minister his tentative support.In the months after Scottish Labour’s success in the 2024 general election, when it won 37 out of Scotland’s 57 Westminster seats, Sarwar had been extremely confident of winning the Holyrood election.He brought in more than a £1m in donations, winning backing from wealthy Scottish business leaders, and believed Scottish voters had grown weary and disappointed with the SNP after 18 years in government.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerAnas SarwarScottish politicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The Hong Kong authorities must end Jimmy Lai’s appalling ordeal and release him to be with his family.”His son Sebastien said Lai feared dying alone while his legal team called him the world’s current highest profile political prisoner.The UN rights chief, Volker Türk, said the verdict was incompatible with international law and must be quashed. “This outcome highlights how the vague and overly broad provisions of Hong Kong’s national security legislation can lead to being interpreted and enforced in violation of Hong Kong’s international human rights obligations,” he said.Anitta Hipper, an EU spokesperson, said the bloc “deplores” the outcome of Lai’s years-long prosecution and called for his immediate and unconditional release.View image in fullscreenSebastien Lai, who said his father ‘fears not seeing his family again, he fears dying alone’.Photograph: Corey Rudy/ReutersLai is the founder of Apple Daily, a popular pro-democracy newspaper that was forced to close in 2021, the year after his arrest. Once one of Hong Kong’s richest men, Lai was unusual among Hong Kong’s elites for also being an outspoken critic of the Chinese Communist party.He was arrested in 2020, weeks after the imposition of adraconian national security law in Hong Kong. The law was introduced by Beijing in response to months of pro-democracy protests in the territory, which Lai and his newspaper had supported. Critics say that the law criminalises dissent. The Chinese and Hong Kong authorities say it was necessary to restore stability to the city, which has plummeted downmedia freedomlists since the law was introduced.The 78-year-old British citizen was sentenced on Monday to 20 years in prison after beingconvictedon one count of conspiracy to produce seditious material and two counts of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces. The collusion with foreign forces charges were brought under Hong Kong’s punitive national security law.Lai’s jail term is the harshest that has been handed down for a national security case in Hong Kong. The Chinese Nobel peace prize winnerLiu Xiaobowas sentenced to 11 years in prison for subversion of state power in mainland China. He died in hospital in 2017, surrounded by security guards.Hong Kong journalists harassed in ‘systemic and organised attack’Read moreLai’s son Sebastien said on Monday that while expected, news of his father’s long sentence had felt worse than he had anticipated, but it still brought him “relief” that the “farce” of his father’s trial had ended.“Dad knew that this was coming even when he was first arrested, and even when he started campaigning 30 years ago,” said Sebastien, who hopes he will be able to see his father again. “My father feels fear the same way anyone feels fear. He fears not seeing his family again, he fears dying alone.”While he said he did not doubt the will of No 10 to secure his father’s release, he said thevisa-free travel agreementbetween the two nations announced after Keir Starmer’s visit to Beijing had felt “a bit tone deaf” with his father still in prison. On Monday, the UK alsoannouncedan expansion to its dedicated visa scheme for Hongkongers to come to the UK.Starmer said heraised Lai’s casewhen he met China’s president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing in January. But it is not clear what, if any, progress the UK has made towards securing Lai’s release.Sebastien Lai said: “What’s the upside for us? If we can’t even get my father out, what does this relationship signify?. I’m in a situation where I just have to put my faith in my country and in this government.”The prime minister’s official spokesperson said on Monday: “We condemn this politically motivated prosecution. We’re clear that Beijing’s national security law was imposed on Hong Kong to silence China’s critics, and we’ll continue to raise this case at the highest levels of the Chinese government, as indeed the prime minister did directly with President Xi.”Sebastien Lai said Beijing was creating a “martyr hero” in his father. Jonathan Price KC, a member of Lai’s international legal team in London, said the sentence was a “monumental injustice” and described the former media tycoon as “the most high profile political prisoner currently in the world”.Thibaut Bruttin, the director general of Reporters Without Borders, said Lai was a symbol of media freedom in Hong Kong and it was a “dark day for those who care about free press”. “Today, democracy is in jail in Hong Kong,” Bruttin said.Lai’s conviction and heavy sentence were widely anticipated. Hong Kong has a near 100% conviction rate for national security offences and Lai is considered to be the most high profile political enemy of the Chinese Communist party in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous territory that is controlled by Beijing.Lai’s sentence was welcomed by the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities.John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said Lai “has committed numerous heinous crimes, and his evil deeds were beyond measure. The severe sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment imposed on him manifests that the rule of law is upheld and justice is done, and also brings great relief to all.”Lin Jian, the spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said Hong Kong upheld the rule of law and Lai was the “mastermind” behind the unrest that shook the territory in 2019 and 2020. He called the prosecution “legitimate, justified, lawful and beyond reproach” and urged other countries not to interfere in China’s internal affairs.Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiHong KongChinaUnited NationsEuropean UnionPress freedomKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Rainfall in the south-west was 56% above the long‑term average, rising to 88% above average across the south-east and central southern England.North Wyke in Devon, Cardinham in Cornwall and Astwood Bank in Worcestershire have recorded rain every day so far this year, the Met Office said on Monday.Jess Neumann, a hydrologist at the University of Reading, said: “It’s been a miserable and relentlessly wet start to the year for many across the UK.” The commuter town near London has had its longest unbroken spell of rainfall since records began more than a century ago.“It seems hard to remember that only a few months ago, large parts of the UK were experiencingdrought and hosepipe bans.”View image in fullscreenFlooding in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire. The deluge across the UK since January has not been a single storm but a rapid-fire sequence of weather systems.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAWhy is the UK so rainy?The seemingly continuous rain has been driven by a rapid-fire succession of weather systems. Storms Goretti, Ingrid and Chandra battered the UK in January, with back-to-back deluges that have pushed soil in parts of the country to saturation point.Neil Armstrong, a chief forecaster for the Met Office, said: “The past few weeks have felt relentlessly wet, with repeated bands of rain sweeping in from the Atlantic and creating increasingly saturated ground across large parts of the UK.”The conditions have been fuelled by a southward shift in the jet stream – a conveyor belt of fast-flowing air – steering successive areas of low pressure towards the UK.“Cold plunges of air across North America have strengthened the temperature gradient across the north-west Atlantic, energising the jet,” Armstrong said. “A blocking high over northern Europe has prevented weather fronts from clearing, causing them to stall over the UK.”View image in fullscreenFlood waters spread across a street in Alcácer do Sal in southern Portugal as Storm Leonardo swept through the country last week.Photograph: Patrícia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty ImagesWhere have storms struck?The same shift in the jet stream has also battered Spain and Portugal withdevastating floods, killing several people and forcing thousands from their homes.Storm Leonardo, which merged with a rainfall-laden “atmospheric river” carrying tropical moisture from the Caribbean, was followed by Storm Marta at the weekend, which killed two people.While the low pressure systems in the UK have not intensified as rapidly, they have still been powerful enough to break daily rainfall records in several locations. Scientists warn that even modest rainfall can trigger flooding when soils are already saturated and unable to absorb more water.View image in fullscreenFlood water swamps a children’s play area in Chertsey, Surrey, after the river overflowed its banks.Photograph: Maureen McLean/ShutterstockIs the climate crisis making rainfall worse?Scientists think fossil fuel pollution is making the jet stream more erratic, allowing extreme weather systems – from heavy rain to heat domes – to become stuck over the same areas for prolonged periods, amplifying their impacts. These so-called blocking systems are expected to become more frequent under medium- and worst-case emissions scenarios.At the same time, global heating is intensifying rainfall. Warmer air can hold about 7% more moisture for every 1C rise in temperature, a shift that has contributed to increasingly wet UK winters arriving roughlytwo decades earlier than regional climate models had predicted. In January, however, Arctic air led to slightly cooler temperatures than usual, with high monthly rainfall totals more a result of persistence and duration than intensity.Scientists project climate breakdown will bring wetter winters and drier summers to the UK. Neumann said: “One positive to come from the recent rainfall is the move to recovery status for UK water resources.” She added that England is now free from drought for the first time since May, with reservoirs and aquifers slowly restocking and recharging to healthy levels.Explore more on these topicsFloodingUK weatherClimate crisisSpainPortugalEuropeEurope weatherShareReuse this content"

TheNational Atomic Energy Commission(CNEA) mined uranium here in the 1970s and it is now in focus as President Javier Milei aims to shift Argentina’s nuclear strategy.The remote region sees few visitors, but in November, a delegation from theInternational Atomic Energy Agencyvisited as part of anIntegrated Uranium Production Cycle Review. Cerro Solo, adjacent to the shuttered mines, is one of CNEA’s largest proven uranium deposits, and restarting mining of the ore is the first step inMilei’s new nuclear plan.View image in fullscreenSergio Pichiñán points across the river toward the old uranium mines: ‘If they want to open this back up, we’re all pretty worried around here.’Photograph: Denali DeGrafThe others are to develop small modular reactors, use them to power AI datacentres, export reactors and uranium, andpartially privatiseNucleoeléctrica, the state-owned nuclear energy utility.Yet the plan is facing fierce criticism from both pro- and anti-nuclear voices. Argentina’s non-militarynuclear programme is 75 years old. It exports research reactors that produce isotopes for medical radiology and science, and its three nuclear plants – Atucha I and II and Embalse – provide about5% of the country’s electricity.Exporting uranium isn’t an Argentine nuclear plan; it’s banana republic-style miningDiego Hurtado, former CNEA vice-presidentUranium production in Chubutdeclined in the 1980s, and the mines were closed in the 1990s; since another closed in Mendoza in 1997, Argentina has imported uranium, so many see restarting uranium extraction as a strategic move.Adriana Serquis, a nuclear physicist, is not so sure. She was president of CNEA until 2024 and was recently elected to congress. She says: “The plan doesn’t seem oriented toward supplying our own plants, but rather exporting uranium directly to the US. It would appear the objective is to satisfy others’ needs while destroying our own capabilities.”View image in fullscreenCarnotite, a radioactive mineral and a source of uranium found in Chubut province.Photograph: PB/YB/AlamyDioxitek, a state-run subsidiary of CNEA, processes imported uranium into uranium dioxide for use in Argentina’s power stations, butsigned a commitment in Augustlast year with the US-basedNano Nuclear Energyto supply it with uranium hexafluoride. As Argentina’s reactors run on natural or low-enriched uranium oxide rather than uranium hexafluoride, it is likely that any uranium extracted in Argentina would be exported to the US rather than be used for local energy production.In parallel, Nano Nuclear Energysigned a memorandumof understanding with the British-Argentinian companyUrAmerica, which has large holdings in Chubut and plans to mine uranium. One of the stated goals of the agreement is “strengthening US energy security by sourcing materials for nuclear fuel from a reliable partner”.Diego Hurtado, ex-president of the nationalnuclear regulatory authorityand former CNEA vice-president, says Argentina’s proven uranium reserves would fulfil domestic demand for about 70 years, though less if nuclear energy were expanded.“Argentina doesn’t have extra uranium,” he says. “Exporting uranium isn’t an Argentine nuclear plan; it’s banana republic-style mining: ‘I’ll sell you raw materials so you can use them to generate employment and industrial capacity in your country instead of here.’”The nuclear plan signifies a realignment towards Washington by Milei, who has declared his country to be an “unconditional ally of the US”. In September, the far-right president signed Argentina up as thefirst Latin American memberof the US Foundational Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology(First) programme.View image in fullscreenJavier Milei meets Donald Trump at the White House in October 2025. Milei says his country is an ‘unconditional ally of the US’.Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty ImagesHurtado says Argentina has little to gain from the arrangement. “Since the late 60s, the US has systematically tried to undermine Argentina’s nuclear development,” he says. “They treat Latin America as their back yard and don’t want competitors for their technology here.”During his tenure at CNEA, Hurtado met US nuclear specialists who put pressure on Argentina to reject the ChineseHualong One reactor, which was lined up to be the country’s fourth nuclear power station. Milei has suspended this project.View image in fullscreenAdriana Serquis speaking at a recent forum on national sovereignty in Patagonia.Photograph: Denali DeGrafSerquis, at a recent forum on national sovereignty in Patagonia, said of the situation: “The hegemonic model of countries like the US or European countries, that have achieved certain technologies, says ‘Once I’ve gone up the ladder, I knock it down so no one else comes up.’”Other parts of the plan have also drawn criticism. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are at the forefront of nuclear energy development. To date,there are only two in operation– one in China and one in Russia.Argentina has been developing an SMR, known as Carem, for decades, with construction under way since 2014. In 2024, the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency surveyed52 SMR projects worldwideand listed Carem as among the four most advanced.Argentina has invested more than £560m, and estimates show the project is about two-thirds complete.Yet the Milei administration has declared it a failure and in effect mothballed it. The new plan focuses instead on anew SMR project, the ACR300, at only 1% of development, just patented by an Argentinian state-run company but through its subsidiary in the US.“Not only have they stopped investing in the project, but all the engineering and research teams are being dismantled,” Serquis says. “They say they’re going to have four SMRs built in five years, and that’s just fiction.”View image in fullscreenThe Chubut River in Cerro Cóndor, where uranium mines operated in the 1970s.Photograph: Denali DeGrafAll this comes in the context ofMilei’s chainsaw-styledismemberment of public research and environmental protection agencies. “Milei took office with a potent discourse of stigmatising science and technology, and rapidly defamed them across the board, from CNEA to the National Water Institute to the National Weather Service to public universities,” Hurtado says. “It’s catastrophic.”‘From horrible to merely bad’: will Javier Milei take his chainsaw to the environment in Argentina?Read moreTrade unions claim that between 80% and 90% of CNEA workers receivesalaries below the poverty line– increasing emigration and brain drain. In 2024, the country’s secretariat for innovation, science and technology onlyspent 7% of its allocated budget. Public universities have seen budgets slashed.Partially privatising the public nuclear utility, Nucleoeléctrica, sets off other alarm bells. The plan,formally launchedby the economy ministry in November, aims to sell 44% of the state company to a private investor. Although not holding an absolute majority, the buyer would have the largest stake, giving them decision-making control.Demian Reidel, Milei’s lead on nuclear matters, was the chair of the council of presidential advisers until being appointed as head of Nucleoeléctrica, wherehe is now facing a scandalabout the company’s procurement and alleged overpricing of service and software contracts.View image in fullscreenThe village of Cerro Cóndor. Uranium production in the area declined in the 1980s and the mines were closed, but that could change with the government’s new nuclear strategy.Photograph: Gioia ClaroHe did not respond to requests for comment, but has described the privatisation as “what any normal company doesto attract investment”.Nucleoeléctrica, however, is one of the few state companies in Argentina that runs a budget surplus, postinga record 17.2bn pesos(£8.6m) in the first quarter of 2025. Opposition parties in congress proposed a bill to declare Nucleoeléctrica a strategic priority and prevent privatisation, but they are likely to lack the two-thirds majority to override Milei’s presidential veto.Isidro Baschar, a former member of the company’s directorate, says Argentina risks losing strategic capacities and reaping no benefit from privatisation, noting that nuclear power worldwide is overwhelmingly state-run (thoughmost commercial plants are privately owned in the US).“Nuclear energy combines critical infrastructure, extremely long-term investments, highly specialised licensing and international commitments regarding security and non-proliferation. None of that can be sustained through market logic alone,” he says.View image in fullscreenNear the old mine sites in central Chubut, thousands of tonnes of uranium tailings from the 1970s are protected by a fence and a sign that says ‘Restricted Area’.Photograph: Denali DeGrafSerquis, Hurtado, and Baschar all highlight nuclear power, alongside the solar potential in the high, dry provinces of the north-west and Patagonia’s strong winds, as key elements for meetingemissions-reduction goalsand fighting the climate crisis.Draining cities dry: the giant tech companies queueing up to build datacentres in drought-hit Latin AmericaRead moreMilei is a knownclimate denier, calling global heating “a socialist lie”, and wants new nuclear plants not to replace fossil fuels but to attract more demand.

[Patagonia] is the region of the country with the strongest popular rejection of these endeavours.”Chubut has a broad-based and deeply entrenched grassroots anti-mining movement. A 2003 referendum on open-pit gold-mining received an81% “no” vote, leading to a law prohibiting the practice throughout the province. In 2021, lawmakers tried to open the central steppe to mining but withdrew after protesters blocked highways, swarmed the capital and set fire to government buildings.View image in fullscreenA sign in Esquel, Chubut, stating it is a non-nuclear municipality.Photograph: Denali DeGrafThe anti-nuclear movement goes back to the 1980s, when a radioactive waste dump was proposed near Gastre, a remote village in central Chubut. After years of popular opposition scuttled the project, cities and towns across Patagonia passed anti-nuclear ordinances banning the presence or transit of nuclear materials.Now, near the old mine sites in central Chubut, tens of thousands of tonnes of old uranium tailings sit behind only a chain-link fence and a sign that says “Restricted Area”.Orlando Carriqueo, spokesperson for the Mapuche-Tehuelche parliament of Río Negro, an Indigenous organisation in another Patagonian province, says public opinion in the region is concerned about the consequences of uranium mining for fuel production and about waste management. “We’re being turned into an energy colony,” he says.View image in fullscreenProtesters blockading a highway in El Hoyo, Chubut, to protest against legislation to legalise open-pit mining in the province, December 2021.Photograph: Denali DeGrafReports by CNEA over the past three administrations showno radiation monitoring at the site.

He managed to swim back into his home before the storm surge changed direction, almost carrying him out of the smashed-in front door.“I was holding on to downpipes to stop myself being dragged out again. It was unbelievably strong, the water,” he said.“You’re sitting on the stairs watching it come up each step and wondering when it’s going to stop … All you can do is wait and hope it does stop.”Life on Clydach Terrace, next to the river of the same name, has been difficult ever since, Thomas said. Heavy rain or amber weather warnings mean no one on the street can sleep. “There’s so many triggers that take us back to that night … Even now, [my grandson] has a problem when it rains. He doesn’t like it.”View image in fullscreenPaul Thomas, standing between Nant Clydach and Clydach Terrace.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianClydach Terrace is one of the most dangerous places in the country, classified as “high risk to life” by the flooding management authority. The residents’ six-year-long nightmareended last weekwhen Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) council voted to buy 16 of the street’s 18 houses at a cost of £2.6m, and the doomed homes will now be demolished.It is believed to be the first time anywhere in the country that such drastic measures have been taken as a result of the climate emergency, earning the road’s residents an unenviable moniker: they are the UK’s first climate evacuees.This group of approximately 40 people could be a cross-section of any street, in any town. The terrace is home to a teacher, a contractor, retirees, NHS employees, a children’s carer and office workers who commute to Pontypridd and Cardiff.South Wales council to buy and demolish homes prone to floodingRead moreOver the years, two families have bought properties next door, so several generations live side by side, and at least four households are home to young children. Some people have lived in Clydach Terrace for decades; one young couple bought their first home there in 2020, and yet more people are renting.Of the 18 houses on the street, only 6a and 6b – newer builds set back from the road, and up a slope – will remain. One woman living there said she would not be moving, but her son, a little further down the road, will be.For now, the street is united in relief. “It was the right decision. It’s for everyone’s safety,” said Paige Didcote, 27.“I won’t have the anxiety if I am at work, and my partner’s at work, of having to rush back. We both work over an hour away and anything can happen within that hour,” she said.Thomas said: “Not feeling physically sick when you see a weather warning coming your way … Not going to bed and wondering: ‘Are we going to wake up in the morning?’ To live a normal life again, it’s a dream come true.”View image in fullscreenSome of the homes on Clydach Terrace.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThe climate crisis is shifting weather patterns,intensifying wind-rain extremesin some parts of the UK, which are also becoming more susceptible to flooding – and Storm Dennis was one of the most intense extratropical cyclones ever recorded.A cubic metre of water weighs about 1 tonne, or roughly as much as a small car. It is estimated that at Dennis’s peak, the Taff, which Nant Clydach flows into, carried 805 cubic metres a second – enough to fill an Olympic size swimming pool in just over three seconds.Thomas, a carpenter, believes that the weight of the water in another storm like Dennis could be enough to collapse the fronts of the terrace houses.“If you’re upstairs, all the floor joists you and your family are standing on collapse as well, and you go into the river,” he said.Storms and heavy rainfall have overwhelmed Clydach Terrace’s residents several times in the six years after Dennis. It has been either impossible or very expensive to obtain insurance since, putting the houses in an even more vulnerable position.During the Guardian’s visit last week, the homes on the street were in various states of repair; many were damp and mossy, with sandbags piled up outside the doors. In the front rooms of several homes, children’s toys, photo frames and other bric-a-brac of family life were piled up in plastic boxes, ready to move upstairs when the next storm arrives.On the other side of the road, the river hummed along. Thin winter sun filtered through the woodland on the sloping far bank and a water depth gauge board said its level was approximately 0.5 metres higher than normal.View image in fullscreenHomes on Clydach Terrace, with sandbags ready for the next flood warning.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThomas, a 66-year-old who has lived on the terrace for 40 years, said he loved living by the Clydach. “It’s a beautiful place. In the summer, I sit over the river, and the only danger is to be hit by a flying kingfisher … But in the winter, that river changes.”Nant Clydach rises from the ground at the top of the mountain; it joins the River Taff just outside Pontypridd, the market town where three steep valleys meet, and from there, as the topography softens, meanders down to Cardiff and the sea.The river was artificially diverted by mining activity in the 1930s and a tunnel built at the southern end of the street to channel the water. The terrace, which follows the curve of the watercourse, marks the eastern boundary of Ynysybwl.A retaining wall separates the Clydach from the road, but neither the wall nor the tunnel are big enough now to stop homes being badly inundated.View image in fullscreenLooking south along Clydach Terrace.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianIn some ways, the street is uniquely unlucky. The classic mining community row of early 20th-century stone houses was built on a natural floodplain, and its narrowness means there is no room for flood waters to dissipate. Crucially, the terrace is in a basin, meaning that a rise of just a centimetre over the retaining wall can almost instantly turn into 2 metres of water, engulfing nearby houses within minutes.Everyone on Clydach Terrace the Guardian spoke to said the speed with which the water can arrive was their biggest worry. “The water will come up the street faster than you can walk,” Thomas said.Caitlin Gibbs, 24, described living throughStorm Bert in 2024, before her three-year-old daughter Layla died of cancer. Gibbs was pregnant at the time with Nyla, now one.“It was a horrific time for us anyway. It was like: ‘What the hell do we do?’ What if something happens with her feeding tube?’ We have got no way of getting out of here,” she said.Flooding management authority Natural Resources Wales (NRW) explored dozens of ways to help Clydach Terrace after Storm Dennis, including building a taller defence wall and removing or enlarging the river culvert.After five years of surveys, modelling, assessments and back-and-forth with RCT council, the authority concluded in June 2025 that Welsh and UK government funding rules meant none of the options met a viable cost-benefit ratio. The news was met with frustration by Clydach Terrace’s residents, many of whom said they had voiced the same conclusion years earlier.View image in fullscreenNant Clydach alongside Clydach Terrace.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian“Even if we build a wall, it’s not a guarantee. Monmouth, for example, has flood defences, but it was flooded anyway,” said Jeremy Parr, NRW’s head of flood risk management, referring toNovember’s Storm Claudia.“Our staff live in these communities too, no one wants to see this happening … long-term viability is very difficult and we are going to see more of this extreme weather.”NRW’s decision led RCT council to consider buying the 16 homes on Clydach Terrace judged to be at risk and knocking them down. Council leader Andrew Morgan described the local authority’s vote last Monday as “the right thing to do”.“We’ve spent close to £130m on repairing infrastructure damaged by Dennis and £30m on flooding infrastructure in the last five or six years, so in the scheme of things, it’s a small amount.“Ultimately, if we don’t do this, the risk to these residents is going to continue to grow, and it’s already clear that their mental health is affected. Some of them have PTSD,” Morgan added.A purchase price of £2.3m has been agreed in principle. Additional relocation assistance, incidental and legal costs and land transaction tax takes the total to about £2.57m.Thomas and his family have already started viewing houses for sale elsewhere in the village. A young couple at the far end of the street said they are going to move to Cardiff, where one of them is from; Gibbs, a renter, isn’t sure what her options are.“I don’t want to go further up the valley, but if I end up in council housing and that’s what they’ve got, that’s what I’ll have to do,” she said.View image in fullscreenResidents of Clydach Terrace, including Paul Thomas (second right), with Ynysybwl councillor Amanda Ellis (fourth right) outside the Rhondda Cynon Taf council offices.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianClydach Terrace may be the first UK community to disband in the face of the climate emergency, but it won’t be the last.Fairbourne, in Gwynedd, and Seasalter in Kent have been listed for “managed retreat” over the next 20 years due to rising sea levels, while the UK’s east coast is one of the fastest-eroding in Europe: last month, the residents of a dozen clifftop homes inHemsby, Norfolk were told to evacuate and offered temporary accommodation.Another 713,000 homes, mostly in Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Kent and Doncaster, will face significant flood exposure by the middle of the century, according to theByline Times.Clydach Terrace will hold a street party before the houses are emptied and demolished; by September, Thomas said, everyone should have moved.“I would have loved them to fix [the river] but there’s nothing else they can do. You’d be a fool to think there isn’t climate change … The weather has changed, it’s as simple as that,” he said.“My world turned upside down in 2020. Hopefully, now we can move on from this.”Explore more on these topicsWalesFloodingClimate crisisCommunitiesExtreme weatherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last week the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, saidthe eurozone economy “remains resilient in a challenging environment”but the outlook was “uncertain” as it left interest rates on hold.EU leaders will meet in a chateau in eastern Belgium on Thursday to discuss the “urgent strategic imperative” of strengthening the single market, according to the invitation letter from the European Council president, António Costa. A day before that meeting the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, will meet industry leaders in Antwerp.She will follow up a 2024 summit in the Flemish city when business leaderscalled for a European industrial dealto complement theEU’s green dealas well as “corrective measures” on existing regulations.Since then von der Leyen’s commission has proposed 10 “omnibus” proposals toloosen regulation across economic sectors, from the automotive industry to digital, defence, chemicals and farming.However, the green campaigners argue that the deregulation agenda risks weakening the EU’s carbon price and other policies supporting the energy transition. “Without a strong and predictable carbon price, the business case for clean steel, green chemicals, circular materials and electrified industrial production collapses – and with it, the effectiveness of future industrial policy tools,” their letter says.A thinktank has reported thatEuropeis making slow progress towards reviving its weak economy.View image in fullscreenActivists from Extinction Rebellion, supported by Greenpeace Belgium, block the offices of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) in a protest in Brussels on Monday.Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPAThe European Policy Innovation Council found that only 15% of the recommendations made by Mario Draghi in a landmark 2024 report had been implemented. Almost two-thirds remain either in progress or have not been implemented at all,according to the Financial Times, which has seen a copy of the thinktank’s latest analysis.The agenda-settingreportby Draghi, a former Italian prime minister and European Central Bank president, set out 383 recommendations for EU institutions and member states. Without such measures, including an annual €800bn investment drive, Draghi said the EU riskeda “slow and agonising decline”.Responding to the EPIC report, the centrist Renew group in the European parliament lamented the slow implementation of Draghi’s agenda.It said there were too many internal hurdles in the EU single market, citing International Monetary Fundresearchshowing EU regulatory barriers were equivalent to a 44% tariff on goods and 110% on services.“While we are rightly horrified by the prospects of new US tariffs, we seem to be strangely complacent about the ‘internal tariffs’ we self-inflict,” the letter said. “We are in effect sanctioning our own economy.”In an attempt to aid Europe’s stagnant economy, the commission will publish in the coming weeks an Industrial Accelerator Act, including proposals to boost clean tech that are expected to introduce a “buy European” preference in strategic sectors.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsEuropean UnionClimate crisisGreen economyUrsula von der LeyenGlobal economyEuropeShareReuse this content"

He said parts of the capital had “sharia law”.He also made other claims about law and order and immigration that critics said were either left unchallenged or endorsed by interviewer Bev Turner, the host of GB News’s US-based nightly show.However,Ofcomsaid it had decided not to investigate 32 complaints that claimed the interview was either misleading or partial in its presentation.A spokesperson conceded that Trump’s views “were not challenged during the interview itself”, but said “alternative perspectives” were set out in a surrounding panel discussion, which challenged his opinions.Chris Banatvala, Ofcom’s founding director of standards , who drafted its code and investigation procedures, said he was “astounded” by Ofcom’s decision.“If there were ever a case that merited investigation for the broadcast of potentially misleading material and a failure to meet due impartiality requirements, this was it,” he said.“Donald Trump was allowed to make a number of unfounded allegations without any challenge whatsoever, with the potential to mislead viewers, undermining the most basic standards expected of broadcast journalism and regulatory requirements.“This was a test case for how Ofcom regulates broadcasters on due impartiality. It has failed that test. The decision raises serious questions about whether Ofcom is willing to enforce its own standards as set out in legislation. It now appears that Ofcom has abandoned any pretence that meaningful regulation of broadcast content is still being maintained.”It comes amid concerns within the media world that Ofcom has shied away from tackling potentially politically divisive accusations of bias and misleading in recent years.Another complainant, Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, accused Ofcom of a “shockingly bad decision” that had allowed “pernicious climate misinformation”.“The interview with President Trump was filled with falsehoods, such as claiming that climate change is a hoax and that China does not have any windfarms,” he said. “This feeble decision, with no explanation offered, rather suggests that Ofcom is afraid of standing up to Trump for fear of antagonising him further.”An Ofcom spokesperson said: “We carefully considered complaints about this current affairs programme which featured an interview with US President Donald Trump interspersed with a studio panel discussion and other guest interviews.“Preserving due impartiality is a cornerstone of Ofcom’s broadcasting rules and we carried out a detailed assessment of the entire programme as broadcast. While we acknowledge that President Trump’s views were not challenged during the interview itself, the surrounding panel discussion and other guest interviews offered a range of alternative perspectives which strongly challenged his position.“Given this, we will not be pursuing complaints about this programme further.”GB News was contacted for comment, but did not wish to do so.Explore more on these topicsOfcomGB NewsDonald TrumpTelevision industryUS televisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Georgie’s writing is full of heart and vivid energy, matching its extraordinary craft in every scene,” said Ellie Keel, the prize’s founder director.Sapling has at its root the murder of Conor Flynn by another child during the final years of the Troubles – an act that shocks a communityalready scarred by decades of violence. According to a synopsis released by the prize’s organisers, the story then follows his brother Gerry Flynn when aged 16 – 10 years after the murder.“Despite a deteriorating home life, the pains of adolescence, and the lingering shadow of a brother who never grew up, he’s just about keeping it together – until the events of one day shatter everything.“His brother’s memorial garden is destroyed, his killer released from prison, and the arrival of a charismatic stranger, Ryan, forces Gerry to confront the haunting dilemma: is Ryan the solution to his problems or the reason they exist in the first place?“Sapling is a tender and darkly funny story about what grows when deep-rooted pain is left untended.”Organisers said the latest edition of the award, which was launched in 2019 as the only national prize to champion and support playwrights who identify as female or non-binary, received 1,275 entries – the most it has had so far. Open to English-language plays running over 60 minutes, the prize offers its first prize-winner £20,000 alongside an option for Ellie Keel Productions, Paines Plough and Sheffield Theatres to co-produce the work.The judges – whose number included the artistic director of the National Theatre Indhu Rubasingham, the actor Romola Garai and the Guardian’s editor-in-chief Katharine Viner, among others – were put through a “particularly rigorous” meeting, Keel said, “reflecting the impressive standard of all our final five plays”. She added: “These plays and writers have incredible futures on big stages and I can’t wait to follow their journeys.It was also announced that Kristin Scott Thomas is to be the first winner of a newly created lifetime achievement prize named the Leading Light award. It is designed to “recognise a leading female in the arts industry for their enduring influence, distinguished body of work, and outstanding contribution to culture”, organisers said.The winners were announced at an awards ceremony held on Monday at the West End venue @sohoplace.Explore more on these topicsTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

With the judicial hurdles cleared, Gilston is being positioned not just as a housing development but as a rebuke to cookie-cutter estates that have dominated Britain’s suburban fringes.The vision for Gilston is rooted in thegarden town philosophy– a modern extension of Harlow in Essex, one of Britain’s original postwar new towns. Unlike traditional developments where infrastructure often follows housing as an afterthought, Gilston’s £1bn infrastructure budget is front-loaded.View image in fullscreenThe Gilston design rejects the car-centric model of the late-20th century.Photograph: Places for PeoplePlans include two secondary schools, seven primary schools, health centres and leisure facilities. Crucially, the design rejects the car-centric model of the late 20th century. “We put the schools in the villages so that people can walk their kids or ride their bikes,” Reed says. “I love that space aspect. I live in Edinburgh, and whenever anything’s built, every square inch is built on. There’s no space.”The scale of the project is immense. Each village will consist of between 800 and 1,800 homes, linked by 5 sq km (1.9 sq miles) of parks. PfP will deliver 8,500 of these homes, whileTaylor Wimpeywill construct the final 1,500 in the seventh village.View image in fullscreenPlans include two secondary schools, seven primary schools, health centres and leisure facilities.Photograph: Places for PeopleThe project arrives at a critical moment for the UK government, which has promised to build 1.5m homes by 2029. While Gilston is not officially one of the government’s recently announced “12 new towns”, PfP says it serves as a live proof of concept for the model.Reed is vocal about the need for national pressure to overcome local inertia. “In the past, when those sort of targets didn’t have any teeth, or were watered down, then everything kind of came to a halt because it’s very hard and very contentious,” he says.He dismisses cynicism surrounding the government’s targets, comparing the housing crisis to a public health emergency: “If we said: ‘Hey, let’s try to cure cancer in five years’, would everyone be like: ‘Whoa. No way. Tell us you’re wrong’? Let’s go, let’s fund it, and let’s go.”Gilston will be a “mixed tenure” format: of the initial 10,000 homes, at least 2,300 are designated as affordable. However, Reed emphasises that as a social enterprise, PfP intends to push that number higher as the project evolves over its projected 30-year build time.“We want to create rural communities where there’s social housing, affordable housing, shared ownership and outright sales,” Reed says. He would like to see “tenure blind” design, where social housing is indistinguishable from private property. “In some communities, you can tell by the front doors what kind of housing it is. We’re painting them all the same colour. The idea is for no one to have any idea, and for everyone just to get on with their lives.”View image in fullscreenEven with planning and land secured, there is a shortage of skilled labour so PfP is launching a training academy to fast-track tradespeople and planners.Illustration: Nicola Whiting/Places for People‘We can learn from the old’: how architects are returning to the earth to build homes for the futureRead moreWhile people will start to move into the site within the next few years, the whole project is likely to be completed in about 2050. “I will not be here when it’s finished,” Reed says. “But we’re sort of caretakers for these things. We’re going to be in that community … as a steward for decades to come.”Even with planning and land secured, the industry faces a shortage of skilled labour. In response, PfP has launched a national training academy to fast-track tradespeople and planners. “People say: ‘Even if we had the money and the planning, we don’t have the skills.’ Well, so what? Get the skills,” Reed says.As work at Gilston begins, it represents a £6bn boost to the UK economy and the creation of more than 2,000 permanent jobs. For a country mired in a housing shortage that has left 170,000 children in temporary accommodation, Gilston is more than just a construction site – it is a test of whether Britain can still build communities that last.Explore more on these topicsHousingCommunitiesSocial housingConstruction industryHertfordshireEnglandLabourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The UK would go on to impose sanctions on Umatex in May of the same year.Umatex was singled out because it was by far Russia’s largest producer of carbon fibre, material described by the US Office for Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as “critical” for the Kremlin war machine.Carbon fibre, OFAC said, was “used in almost all defence-related platforms including aircraft, ground combat vehicles, ballistic missiles, and military personal protection gear, as well as other weapons systems”.Olena Yurchenko, the director for analysis, investigations and research at the Economic Security Council of Ukraine (ESCU), confirmed the importance of Umatex’s output to the Russian war effort.The material, she said, was “indispensable” in reducing the weight and increasing the heat resistance of weaponry,including the drones that have become a pivotal technological battleground in the war.“Umatex serves as the material base for a significant portion of Russian military programmes,” she said.Being a big player in the Kremlin war machine can be hazardous. The chief executive of Umatex, Alexander Tyunin, was found dead last year, continuing a spate of unexpected deaths affecting the Russian business community since the outbreak of war. Russian authorities said the death appeared to be a suicide.For most of Tyunin’s tenure at Umatex, which began in 2016, he had enjoyed the support of a second-in-command, Dmitry Kogan.Kogan remained by Tyunin’s side for the first year of Russia’s incursion into Ukrainian territory, according to his LinkedIn profile, leaving in January 2023. A year later, he set up a new business in Yerevan, Armenia’s capital city. That company was Rydena.Sandwiched between Turkey, Iran and Russia, Armenia is among several nationsnamed in a government reportas a hub used by Moscow to procure “critical” military equipment indirectly, in defiance of western sanctions.Kogan isn’t the only senior ex-Umatex executive involved in the Armenian company.The company’s former director of business development, Alexander Shleynikov, took the role of chief finance officer.They were joined, in May of the following year, by Aleksandr Ilichev, an award-winning aerospace composites scientist who had been head of the testing laboratory at Umatex.Rydena’s website focuses on sectors including aerospace, unmanned aerial vehicles and the automotive sector, even hinting at ventures beyond Earth.“If you want to go to Mars, we know how to make your spaceship lighter,” the company says on its website.Rydena said the machinery was intended for “civilian industrial production”, adding that it did not make equipment for military purposes and did not do business with companies in Russia or any other jurisdiction under sanctions.Corporate filings indicate that its leaders maintain ongoing ties with Russia.Kogan and Shleynikov are also directors of a company based in Cyprus, Rydena Holding Ltd. Both men gave Moscow addresses when filing documents with the Cypriot corporate register in August this year.Yurchenko said the duo’s past work for Umatex raised serious concerns. “Anyone who worked there, particularly in a senior role, was a player in the Russian war machine,” she said.“Sanctions restrictions and isolation from western technologies only reinforce Umatex’s need for complex equipment import schemes – both to maintain existing capacities and to expand production to meet the growing needs of the military-industrial complex,” she said.“Anyone exporting machinery to their new company, or approving that export licence, should be 100% sure that there is no connection any more.”‘Clear diversion risk’Information about Rydena’s leadership team and their past work for Umatex was in the public domain at the time Cygnet accepted the contract, understood to be worth more than £4m, in February 2025. It received a licence to export its machinery later that year.But Cygnet and the UK government refused to answer questions from the Guardian about whether they knew of the Umatex link.Cygnet said it was notified by the government that officials had “no specific concerns” about the contract, adding that it “undertook detailed end-user checks required by export controls and received full export approval”.Its lawyers said: “Rydena signed a certificate of undertaking that the goods … would not be used for any purpose connected with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, or missiles capable of delivering such weapons.”Sanctions expert Anna Bradshaw warned that an end-user undertaking such as this may be of little practical value in ensuring that the machines, or technical information about them, are not diverted to Russia.“There is a clear diversion risk and if the response is that this is mitigated by an end-user statement then that’s very worrying.“Everyone knows that an end-user undertaking is a limited remedy. If it’s breached, the ship has sailed.”Cygnet is understood to have sent technical drawings to Rydena already, as part of the design and assembly process. It has also agreed to provide manuals translated into Russian, although this is understood to be a commonly used language in Armenian industry.Export is expected by April or early May.‘A bunch of red flags’While out cycling in 2016, Cygnet’s owner, Matthew Kimpton-Smith, suffered a cardiac arrest.According to a section of the company’s website, the devout Christian was “100% convinced that the Lord saved him for a reason”.The following year, he gave £2,500 to the Conservative party via the office of his local MP, Esther McVey, Electoral Commission records show.And, while not personally involved in the running of the business, Kimpton-Smith has presided over a period of success for Cygnet, founded by his parents in 1974.The group racked up sales of £18.7m last year, according to filings at Companies House, working with high-profile clients including the sports car company McLaren. Unusually for a company of its size, Cygnet was mentioned in the advanced manufacturing component of the government’s industrial strategy, published last year.Cygnet Texkimp, which accounts for the vast majority of group revenue, describes itself as an “export-led” business, supplying sectors including aerospace, industrial and defence.There is no suggestion that Cygnet has not followed the UK’s export licensing rules. But the Umatex link raises questions about the challenges around policing the flow of goods and components into Russia and countries, such as Armenia, that might act as a staging post.The application process for an export licence involves input from multiple government departments, including the security services.However, a government spokesperson declined to comment on whether officials had investigated Rydena’s connection to Umatex.Cygnet also declined to comment on whether it was aware of this.“There are a bunch of red flags here and the government has to explain what it did to assure itself that this was all fine,” said Liam Byrne MP, who chairs the select committee that scrutinises the business department.“We’re deeply concerned that the government’s enforcement posture is not in the right place.”Byrne is expected to write to the Department for Business and Trade(DBT) to ask what it knew about Rydena’s connections to Umatex.In a statement, Cygnet said it “engages proactively with the UK government on all matters of export control. In recent years we have met several times to discuss this subject with senior cabinet and shadow ministers, including those representing the DBT.”The company said it “take[s] great care to adhere at all times with the UK government’s export rules.“In the case of our contract with Rydena, as in all other cases, we undertook detailed end-user checks required by export controls and received full export approval. Rydena has provided an end user undertaking and certified its end use of our technology, which the UK government has approved.“This confirms Rydena’s intended use of our technology in the automotive, marine, sports, civil aerospace and tooling sectors within the European market.“Our considerable heritage is built on integrity in everything we do, and this includes our work with customers, partners, colleagues and governments.”Rydena said the machines were “intended for use in civilian industrial production” and that it did not participate, directly or indirectly, in defence-related projects.It said the company had no business links with Russian companies or government entities and that its executives have no ties to companies under sanctions and have not worked for organisations that were under sanctions at the time.It added that the export of controlled products from Armenia, such as dual-use goods such as carbon fibre prepregs, requires a permit and end-use verification.A spokesperson for the DBT said: “The UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes anywhere in the world, and all export licensing decisions are made in line with our strict criteria.“We have also banned the export of thousands of products to Russia and together with our international partners have implemented the most severe package of sanctions ever imposed on a major economy.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessManufacturing sectorRussiaUkraineArmenianewsShareReuse this content"

Cuba’s beaches are a major holiday draw for Canadian tourists in winter, and one of the government’s most important sources of hard currency.Other airlines from as far away as Russia, China, Turkey, France and Spain have also been affected. The crisis has erupted at speed because of Washington’s policy of forcing Cuba’s government to the negotiation table, with prominent figures in Donald Trump’s administration calling for regime change.Cuba on the brink as Trump turns up the pressure: ‘There is going to be a real blockade’Read moreThe US hasthreatened any country that sends oil to Cuba with increased tariffs, claiming the island’s government is a threat to US national security. On Monday, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, lashed out at what she described as a “very unjust” US policy.“You can’t strangle a nation in this way,” she said. Mexico dispatched 800 tons of humanitarian aid to the beleaguered island nation on Sunday, and Sheinbaum said Mexico was taking “all necessary diplomatic actions” to be able to send oil to the island – although she did not offer details on how that might happen.The scope of Cuba’s fuel crisis emerged late on Sunday when airlines were informed by a Notice to Aviation (NOTAM) warning that supplies would remain restricted until at least 11 March. The announcement came only two days after Cuba’s authorities had told the population international flights would be maintained.Immediately after the NOTAM landed, Cuba-bound holidaymakers in Moscow complained of being disembarked and offered the alternative destinations of China, Egypt or Turkey. Cuba had been one of the few warm destinations Russian state employees could holiday in, due to Moscow’s wartime security restrictions.Aeroflot said its subsidiary airline Rossiya would continue operating flights to Cuba, though routes may be adjusted to allow for refuelling. Where that would be, given the already 12 hour plus flight, remains unclear. Russia’s tourism board said about 4,500 of their tourists are now in Cuba, many of them state employees.Yekaterina Gulbina, a tour guide in Cuba, told the Guardian the overall situation was “generally manageable” and that tourists remained in good spirits. “For tourists in hotels, everything is still available, electricity, generators and taxis with fuel,” she said.European airlines have previous experience of this situation, and have been adapting. A similar crisis last year, of Cuba’s own making, saw airlines stopping to refuel in the Bahamas, Mexico and other nearby countries. Air Europa, which flies from Madrid, has already said it would stop for fuel in the Dominican Republic.Other major airlines serving the island plan to continue flying. “Despite this situation, which is beyond our control, we expect to operate our flights as scheduled by implementing contingency measures, such as a technical stop when necessary,” said a spokesperson for the Canadian company Air Transat.The aviation fuel crisis is the first obvious effect of the US oil blockade, and will affect one of Cuba’s largest sources of foreign exchange. At its height, Cuba was earning over $3bn annually from tourism, but that figure is now believed to have crashed below $1bn.Cuba had already been consolidating tourists into fewer hotels. Vicky Volonik and Mark Harrington, two Canadians who arrived in Cuba last week, told a Canadian news channel that they were being transferred to another hotel. “They’re trying to conserve energy by grouping everybody in the same hotel,” Volonik said. “People are very upset because all the workers here just pretty much lost their job and their livelihood … We’re more concerned about the people here. We’ll be looked after.”Johnny Considine, of the travel agency Cuba Private Travel, said that clients already on the island were unaffected. “They think it’s a little bit quiet,” he said. “But they’re having a very good time. Regarding clients who are coming in the near future, we are obviously contacting all of them. They can read the news for themselves and obviously make up their own minds whether they want to come or postpone.”Until now, the US’s increasingly aggressive stance had felt relatively distant on the island, with Cubans more preoccupied with trying to survive in a perpetual state of economic crisis. But on Monday, gas stations across the country were closed, and there were far fewer cars on the road.Cubans with cars have been told that finding fuel will require downloading an app and joining an online queue. On WhatsApp groups dedicated to the crisis, people were complaining the system was almost impossible to work. Cubans without transport try to flag down what drivers there are from the side of the roads.One British holidaying couple, in the southern tourist town of Trinidad, were furious about the situation. “Cuba is the most beautiful place,” the wife said. “I absolutely love it here and will come back with my kids one day when I hope the resilience of the Cuban people has once again triumphed over the economic terrorism of the USA.” They preferred not to give their names.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAir transportAmericasCubaTrump administrationOilnewsShareReuse this content"

Such scenes of political defiance would have been unimaginable until just a few weeks ago, before Maduro’s capture turned Venezuelan politics on their head.“We are going to build a Venezuela of democracy, of freedom, of justice, of pluralism and coexistence,”the 61-year-old former governor told reportersoutside the detention centre, adding that he believed Venezuela had “completely changed”.But Guanipa’s freedom was short-lived: just hours later he appeared to have been taken back into custody after being stopped by unidentified armed men.“I want to let the whole world know that my father has once again been kidnapped,” his son, Ramón, announced in a social media video, claiming that he had been captured about 11.45pm on Sunday. “I will hold the regime responsible for anything that happens to my dad,” the 29-year-old added, demanding proof of life.“Heavily armed men, dressed in civilian clothes, arrived in four vehicles and violently took him away,” Machado claimed on X. “We demand his immediate release.”On Monday, Venezuela’s top prosecutor announced that his office had requested Guanipa’s re-arrest “due to his non-compliance with … the terms [of his release]”.It did not say what those conditions were but some released political prisoners have been barred from travelling outside the country or speaking to the press.Human rights activists say about 425 political prisoners have been released in Venezuela since Donald Trump ordered the controversialabduction of Maduroin the early hours of 3 January.Maduro’s successor Delcy Rodríguez, the former vice-president, usedher first major speechto declare a “new chapter” in the oil-rich country, although made no mention of holding fresh presidential elections in Maduro’s absence.Rodríguez’s regime has moved to pass a new amnesty law, seemingly designed to benefit both the victims of Maduro’s dictatorship and some of those responsible for the repression.Observers warn that despite the regime’s recent concessions, they have yet to see any real indication that it is prepared to dismantle the security forces and paramilitary groups responsible for propping up years of authoritarian rule.Orlando Pérez, a Latin America expert from the University of North Texas at Dallas, said Guanipa’s re-arrest suggested “a push and pull” was playing out between different factions of Venezuela’s new leadership.Pérez believed Rodríguez and her brother, the powerful national assembly president, Jorge Rodríguez, appeared to favour making some concessions in order to speed up engagement with the United States and the transition to a new form of government, even if it was only a “competitive authoritarian” one.“But there are clearly forces that want to slow it down,” added Pérez, pointing to the feared interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, and the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López.“It’s an indication that we really are in a very slow process that can easily be reversed,” Pérez said.Guanipa was seized in May last year by “anti-subversion” agents and held in a Caracas prison on charges of terrorism, treason and conspiring with a foreign government. During more than eight months behind bars he saw his son only once. At the time, the opposition politician’s capture was celebrated by Cabello, who many suspect was behind his re-arrest on Sunday.On Monday afternoon Cabello told reporters Guanipa’s detention was a sign that Venezuelan justice was working.“They thought they could do whatever they felt like and cause a commotion,” he said, in apparent reference to Guanipa’s comments outside El Helicoide.Speaking in Washington, Machado called Guanipa’s arrest a “reaction” from part of the “tyranny” that continued to rule Venezuela, despite Maduro’s exit.“What’s happening in Venezuela is a demonstration that we aren’t just facing a criminal regime but also a regime that is terrified of the truth and terrified of its citizens,” she told reporters.At a press conference on Monday, Ramón Guanipa called for the immediate release of his father and the hundreds of other political prisoners still thought to be behind bars. “This must end – and it must end now,” he said.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaMaría Corina MachadoAmericasNicolás MaduroDelcy RodrígueznewsShareReuse this content"

But it has also become a target for the right, who have branded whistles “hearing-loss-causing machines” and said the act of blowing a whistle may constitute “assault”.“Those women absolutely went out of their way to cross the street and arguably commit assault against the officers with whistles in the ears,” the rightwing streamer Steven Crowderweighed in last week, referring to women at the scene of Alex Pretti’s killing in Minneapolis.Crowder wasn’t alone. Mike Cernovich, who like Crowder is part of a conservative movement that has branded liberals “snowflakes”, claimed last week that whistles “should be considered a violent weapon”, as the right coalesced in opposition to the device.The whistle has gained such attacked status due to people using it to support undocumented immigrants across the country. Protesters have developed a straight-forward code for when they encounter immigration agents. “If you seeICEin the neighborhood, blow your whistle in short bursts. If you witness ICE detaining someone, blow the whistle in a long, repeated pattern,” is howHands Off NYC, an advocacy group active in New York, characterizes it.Its use has spread across the country. In Chicago people have held “whistle parties” where they hand out the devices, and one group has distributed more than 150,000 whistles across the country, the Chicago Sun-Timesreported. Activists in cities ranging fromMilwaukeetoNew York,PortlandandLos Angeleshave done the same.The ubiquity of whistles in immigration standoffs has led them to be castigated, however.Megyn Kelly, a rightwing podcaster,suggestedlast week that whistleblowing contributed to Pretti being shot dead by immigration agents and said the use of whistles “needs to stop”.“Now, some are saying that’s fine. That actually is interference. You – if you came out on your front lawn and just blew a coach’s whistle at the top of your lungs all day, you would be cited by the police under the local noise ordinances. It would be a disturbance of the peace. That’s what these people are doing. And no doubt they contributed to the chaotic atmosphere that ultimately led Alex Pretti to die,” Media Matters recorded Kelly as saying.

From smoke alarms to those hearing loss causing machines that terrorists use against ICE. Tbh those things should be considered a violent weapon. They damage hearing for life.”It hasn’t just been activists using whistles.

It cannot be reformed. ICE must be abolished. And Kristi Noem [the secretary of homeland security] must be impeached.”Interviewed at the Grammys, Vernonsaid: “The whistle is there to represent all the observers in Minneapolis. They are out there on the street corner, 30 below, and they are warning their neighbors of danger. And I think music is a beautiful thing. We make it with soft hands, though. I think the real work of humanity and empathy are those people that see that and they don’t stay at home. They get out on the street and they are taking care of each other and nothing could inspire me more.”Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)ProtestTrump administrationMinneapolisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his2008 convictionin Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.Despitemurmuringsamong crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.Coinbase’s questionable cashThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong,has heavily influencedcrypto regulation in the United States.Epstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder ofTether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.Documentspublished by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additionalfilingssuggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.A spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.Backing bitcoinEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MITacceptedmore than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.In communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.In 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment inBlockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, wereinvitedby Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.On Twitter, Backclaimedthat Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.In communications with an Italian investor, Epsteinnotedthat he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017,checking inwith his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.Epstein emails elicit muted backlash from crypto industryLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, hascalled forAdam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.Charlotte Fang, the founder ofRemilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann ofKomodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchangesmightsee new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.As to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.Cryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor atYork Universitywhostudiescrypto.“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

It said it “considers that WhatsApp is an important entry point” for AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, to “reach consumers”.The warning comes amid heightened tension between European authorities and Donald Trump’s administration over the regulation of US tech companies. Brussels isreportedlypreparing to intensify enforcement of its key anti-competition rules and the Trump administration hassaidthis is “discriminatory” against US companies.“It is very obvious that we need to defend, to implement and to enforce our rules, to defend our market, a well-functioning market,” the EU competition commissioner, Teresa Ribera, told Bloomberg.In December the US imposedsanctionson the former European Commissioner Thierry Breton as well as four other European “activists”, accusing them of censorship and “suppress[ing] American viewpoints”. The move was widely seen as an escalation in response to European regulation of US tech platforms.Breton ischallengingthe sanctions, and the commission has announced it will back him.Asked about a potential US response to the EU’s measures against WhatsApp, Ribera said: “I don’t know how it may be read by any government, but my sense is that this is not connected to politics, but connected to well-functioning markets.”A Meta spokesperson said: “The facts are that there is no reason for the EU to intervene in the WhatsApp Business API. There are many AI options and people can use them from app stores, operating systems, devices, websites, and industry partnerships.“The commission’s logic incorrectly assumes the WhatsApp Business API is a key distribution channel for these chatbots.”Last month, Brazilian authorities brought a similar case against WhatsApp Business, saying that there were “potential anti-competitive practices” in the new terms, Reutersreported.That case wassuspended, with Meta saying its claims were “fundamentally wrong,” and that the “emergence of AI chatbots on the WhatsApp Business Platform overloads our systems, which were not designed for this type of support”.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)MetaEuropean UnionChatbotsTechnology sectorEuropeEuropean CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

While playing as an eight-year-old girl, the reporter was given a sexualised avatar, cyberbullied, aggressively killed, sexually assaulted and shat on – all with parental control settings in place.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWhile platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Kick were included in Australia’s under-16s social media ban, gaming sites such as Roblox were not.Wells and her department were investigating other levers to regulate services such as Roblox.The minister has written to Roblox requesting an urgent meeting, saying she was “alarmed by reports of children being exposed to graphic and gratuitous user-generated content on the platform, including sexually explicit and suicidal material”.“Even more disturbing are ongoing reports and concerns about children being approached and groomed by predators, who actively seek to exploit their curiosity and innocence,” she said in the letter.Guardian Australia understands Roblox has not yet responded to the letter. In a statement on Tuesday, a Roblox spokesperson said it was committed to keeping users safe, saying it had recently rolled out features like age checking systems, and was working with Australian law enforcement to keep users safe.“We look forward to the opportunity to inform the minister of the steps we take to help keep our community safe. Roblox has robust safety policies and processes to help protect users that go beyond many other platforms, and advanced safeguards that monitor for harmful content and communications,” they said.“While no system is perfect, our commitment to safety never ends, and we continue to strengthen protections to help keep users safe.”In her letter, Wells pointed to media reports alleging children can access spaces on the game meant for adults which include explicit sexual content, and charges laid against a Queensland man accused of grooming hundreds of children on platforms such as Roblox, Fortnite and Snapchat.Wells has also asked the eSafety commissioner about any short-term measures that could be taken, and separately has written to the classification board to ask if Roblox’s PG rating remains appropriate.In the letter to Roblox, Wells noted the company had worked with the eSafety commissioner on additional safety measures for children but that issues appeared to continue.“This is untenable, and these issues are of deep concern to many Australians parents and carers,” she wrote, saying she was keen to hear what Roblox was doing to prevent adults contacting children, and to protect children from inappropriate experiences.The eSafety office said it had also written to Roblox last week, saying it planned to test how the platform was complying with commitments such as making under-16s private by default, new tools to prevent adult users from contacting children and restricting chat features. After that testing, eSafety foreshadowed it “may take further action under the Online Safety Act”.“I welcome the minister for communications’ correspondence and the Australian government’s support on this important issue as we use all of the tools available to us to keep Australian kids safe online,” Inman Grant said.Explore more on these topicsRobloxAustralian politicsSocial media banGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

So is everyone elseAlex Daniel andKalyeena MakortoffMon 9 Feb 2026 08.21 ESTFirst published on Mon 9 Feb 2026 03.33 ESTShareNatWest has agreed a £2.7bn deal to buy Evelyn Partners, one of the UK’s biggest wealth managers, in the bank’s largest acquisition since it was bailed out by taxpayers in 2008.The move signals an attempt to bolster the wealth management business for the banking group, whichreturned to full private ownershiplast year, and already owns the private bank Coutts.It makes NatWest the latest among the big four banks to push more forcefully into wealth management. Rivals including HSBC, LloydsBankingGroup and Barclays have been working to lure more fee-paying affluent customers, ensuring lenders are less reliant on income from everyday loans that are linked to the rise and fall of interest rates.Bank chairs backtracking on climate commitments could face shareholder revoltsRead moreNatWest beat the rival bidder Barclays to the takeover, according to Sky News, which first reported the deal, bringing about 2,400 Evelyn Partners employees under its wing.Evelyn Partners, formerly known as Tilney Smith & Williamson, controls about £69bn of client assets and offers financial planning and wealth management across the UK and Ireland.TheNatWest Groupchief executive, Paul Thwaite, told reporters on Monday that the deal was “transformative” for the bank, which will result in the private bank and wealth management division becoming a key “growth engine” and driving a 20% rise in the group’s overall revenues from fees. “So we see the quality and mix of our earnings, change quite considerably,” he added.Evelyn will help NatWest capture a market that falls between the millionaire clients served by its Coutts private banking division, and thepremier banking segment of their retail bank, where clientsneed a minimum of £100,000 in income, savings or investments.The London-based company had been seeking buyers after its private equity owners, Permira and Warburg Pincus, put it up for sale last summer. The group had already completed the sale of its professional services business to the buyout company Apax Partners last year.The company traces its roots back to 1836 when Thomas Tilney created his eponymous stock brokerage in the City of London. Tilney was bought by Permira in 2014, before acquiring the 145-year-old Glasgow-based investment company Smith & Williamson in 2019, and rebranding to its current name three years later.Thwaite said he had been impressed with Evelyn’s “loyal” and “UK-centric” customer base, which was served through 21 regional offices across the country.However, Thwaite did not rule out job cuts, saying there “will be areas of duplication” that will require talks with staff. The deal is expected to be completed this summer.Thwaite has led NatWest since 2024, taking over from Alison Rose after adispute over Nigel Farage’s Coutts bank account. He has prioritised growth in more lucrative businesses such as wealth management and private banking.Thwaite has previously said the bar for buying other companies is “very high”. However, NatWest has already boughtmuch of Sainsbury’s banking businessand a £2.5bn residential mortgage book from Metro Bank since he took charge.He said on Monday that the deal was a “unique opportunity to provide financial planning, savings and investment services to more families and people across the UK”.NatWestreturned to full private ownershiplast May, 17 years after its £45bn taxpayer rescue during the financial crisis, when it was known as Royal Bank of Scotland.NatWest Group’s privatisation came at a £10bn loss to taxpayers, as the state recouped only about £35bn of its costs because NatWest’s shares languished below the average 502p level paid in the bailout.The Evelyn Partners chief executive, Paul Geddes, has been at the group since 2023. Before that he worked for RBS for 15 years, running its insurance arm, which included the Direct Line and Churchill brands.NatWest, which is poised to report its full-year results on Friday, also announced that it would give £750m to its shareholders via a share buyback.However, the bank’s share price fell nearly 6% on Monday, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100.“While expanding in wealth management is strategically logical, we remain cautious on the deal economics, which rely heavily on synergy delivery to justify the price,” said Gary Greenwood, an equity analyst at Shore Capital.Explore more on these topicsNatWest GroupBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

The artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio transformed the pitch of the Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, into his own love letter to the island, with cinematic set pieces including sugarcane fields, a house party, and a livelywedding ceremonyfeaturing a surprise performance byLady Gaga.By contrast, the rightwing Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show drew just 5.2 million viewers. The event promised to offer an alternative by celebrating “American culture, freedom and faith” and featured the country singer Kid Rock performing in a fedora and jean shorts against a stars and stripes backdrop, in a performance that appeared to be partly lip-synced.Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time show review – a thrilling ode to Boricua joyRead moreMeanwhile, Bad Bunny tapped into just how broad a definition of “America” could be, shouting “God bless America” before reeling off a list of countries and territories including the US and “mi madre”,Puerto Rico.On Truth Social,Donald TrumpcalledBad Bunny’s show “absolutely terrible, one of the worst”, and a “slap in the face to our country”. Piers Morgan later hit back at Trump,writing: “Couldn’t disagree more, Mr President. I absolutely loved Bad Bunny’s halftime show … Oh, and Spanish is 1st language for 50m+ Americans!”Meghan McCain also showed her support,writing: “I’m sorry but I just genuinely question your taste level if you didn’t enjoy the Bad Bunny halftime show.”Celebrities supporting Bad Bunny’s performance included the Grammy-award winning artist Kacey Musgraves, whowrote on X: “That made me feel more proudly American than anything Kid Rock has ever done.” Rapper Doechii alsowrote: “Bad Bunny WOW ! Fucking, WOW . History.”Country star Zach Bryan also mocked the alternative show, sharing a video of someone blocking Bad Bunny’s set with a hand and watching the Turning Point performance. “What kid rock actually thinks is happening across America,” he wrote in an Instagram story.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny and Lady Gaga during half-time show.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/ShutterstockThe Brazilian directorKleber Mendonça Filho, whose film The Secret Agent is up for Oscars next month, alsowrote: “What a beautiful and extraordinary thing, Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl reminding the US who they are and where they are.”California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,wrote: “America, the beautiful. THANK YOU, BAD BUNNY.” Previously, Newsom had declared Sunday “national Bad Bunny day” in California. Tom Brady summed up the overall response, writing “Amazing!!!!!!!!!” on an Instagram story.In afive-star review, the Guardian’s Stefanie Fernández called it a celebration of “the love, the community and the absolute joy that we create together every day in spite of everything else”.‘A statement about power shifting’: why Bad Bunny wore Zara for his Super Bowl showRead moreEarlier this month, Bad Bunnytook homethe album of the year Grammy for his 2025 release Debí Tirar Más Fotos, which blends traditional Puerto Rican genres with hip-hop and reggaeton. During one his speeches that night, he said: “We are not savages, we are not animals, we are not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans … The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.”Last year he was Spotify’s most-streamed global artist with more than 19.8bn streams, dethroning Taylor Swift, who had held that title for the previous two years.The half-time show’s references to politics were subtle but frequent. On stage Bad Bunny carried the Puerto Rican flag of independence, the original flag of the territory that was outlawed until 1952 and is distinguished by its sky blue triangle. While performing a salsa version of her 2024 Bruno Mars duet Die With a Smile, Lady Gaga wore a dress in the same shade.Ricky Martinguested and performed Lo Que le Pasó a Hawaii, a plea against gentrification and white tourism in Puerto Rico with a Spanish-language hook translating to “I don’t want them to do to you what they did to Hawaii.” He laterwroteon social media: “I need several hours to process the tsunami of emotions I’m feeling.”While performing El Apagón, Bad Bunny referenced the territory’s frequent power outages alongside dancers who climbed fizzling electricity pylons.As well as showing the artist’s humble side, it also proved his pulling power with a house party segment, which featured starsincludingthe rapper Cardi B, actor Pedro Pascal and the Colombian singer Karol G.Ahead of the performance, Bad Bunnysaid: “I really want people to have fun.

Just as some musicians long for a 20-second clip that can launch a million TikToks, films are looking for the certain je ne sais quoi that will turn it from simply a story into an all-encompassing aesthetic event and lifestyle experience. To properly experience Wuthering Heights, as trailers suggest, you need to tap into your saucier side – for which you will almost certainly require a thong and maybe a stay in anofficial Airbnb replicaof Cathy’s bedroom.View image in fullscreenQuasi-romantic codependency … Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie at the Wuthering Heights UK premiere.Photograph: Stuart Hardy/ABACAPRESS.COM/ShutterstockThis seepage of the obsession narrative can also be seen in the decision to hinge the press tour on pushing the apparentlyquasi-romantic codependencybetween its stars Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, following the template of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo onWicked’s press tour. Just as audience members are encouraged to ape the film’s theme of obsessional desire by glugging a“Creme undone”cuppa while dunking a “Better with Sex” choc-chip cookie, so too the actors must cosplay wanting to jump each others bones at every opportunity.So far, so late consumerist desperation. Yet the problem with attempting to curate and peddle an aesthetic of obsession through merchandise is that, unlike the source novel, such efforts have nothing to actually say about obsession; they just show us what it looks like and instruct us how to join in. Unlike the novel, which unpicks the destructive effects of obsessive love, Wuthering Heights’s sale push appears, a bit alarmingly, to ask us to aspire to and purchase obsession.The bleakness of Brontë’s original vision means this all feels in poorer taste than Wicked hairbrushes. Many of these brand collaborations suggest a reduction of the narrative to its sexuality and an erasure of its wider themes – something Fennell is already under scrutiny for since thewhitewashed castingof Elordi as Heathcliff. It’s difficult to reconcile a novel that explores the nuances of class, race and generational trauma with branded hand creams.The overtly erotic nature of many of these collaborations feels calculated to spin the story into a dark romance ripe for the BookTok audience. Posts from the official Wuthering Heights TikTok account use buzzwords like “yearning” and mention romance tropes popular on the platform such asjealous lovers. The overt sexuality of the trailer, the “Come Undone” body oil and candle made for dripping on to partners, the silk eye mask and lingerie edit with Lounge all lean into a vaguely BDSM aesthetic. It’s a particular take on the story and a way for fans to once again feel as if they are participating in something transgressive but in the most capitalist, and therefore normative, way possible.To further drive home the BookTokification of Brontë’s novel this all feels reminiscent of an infamous chapter of “romantasy” history when BookTok darling A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J Maas was beginning to get popular. A popular book-themed subscription box created a “book boyfriends” box, complete with apenis-shaped bar of soap. While this was a deliberately absurd and tongue-in-cheek joke gently ribbing the, then, small demographic of readers who rate every book on a “spice” scale, these readers have become a group with potent buying power andclearly willingto spend money on books and bookish merchandise. This is not to say these aren’t valid readers or that it’s not exciting to bring a classic to a new readership. But to say that maybe we’ve lost sight of what a piece of art should be: something affecting which does not demand you turn out the contents of your wallet.Explore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsEmily BrontëFilm adaptationsEmerald FennellfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No. Possibly not even the greatest of half-term. This loud, chaotic and unlovable animated kids’ comedy feels as though it is bordering on AI slop, algorithmically generated and instantly familiar fromZootropolis,Singand other movies with talking animals. It is a shame, because it has a real-life inspiration: basketball star Stephen Curry, who was repeatedly told at the start of his career that he was too skinny and too small to make it as a pro. Curry is a producer here, and has a performing role. But in spite of this connection, Goat lacks heart and soul, and a sense of genuine emotions.What it does have is some pretty decent voice acing, bringing a degree of charm to the movie. Will Harris (voiced by Caleb McLaughlin) is a goat who has grown up dreaming of playing professional “roarball”, a fiercer and faster version of basketball. But Will is a “small” and roar players are all “bigs” – powerful beasts such as rhinos and horses. Will’s hero and the star of his favourite team, the Thorns, is a panther called Jet (Gabrielle Union), a champ close to retirement but determined to win the league. When Will gets a shot at joining the Thorns, he is laughed at, underrated but undeterred.There are some decent jokes, but they are lost in all the noise. Watching Goat is like standing next to a helicopter as it’s taking off. The roarball games are deafening, and pitched at lightning speed, in courts that switch from jungle settings to an arctic ice experience. The underdog plot is as old as time, and for a film targeted at under-eights there are a lot of scenes with mobile phones, and characters constantly checking their socials. The only thing that lingers after leaving the cinema is a headache.Goat is out on 13 February in the UK and US, and on 26 March in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsComedy filmsBasketballStephen CurryComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It follows Bickle, a lonely, mentally unstable Vietnam war veteran working as a New York cab driver who, disturbed by the crime, corruption and moral decay he sees around him, develops a dangerous saviour complex.‘We have to stop what’s going on, it’s insane’: Robert De Niro on battling age, apathy and TrumpRead moreBickle narrates: “All the animals come out at night: whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies – sick, venal. Someday, a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets.”Raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, by a Calvinist family, Schrader did not see a movie until he was 17. Then he became a film critic and a protege ofPauline Kaelof the New Yorker magazine. But at 26 he hit a rough patch and wrote Taxi Driver as a form of self-therapy.Speaking by phone from New York, the 79-year-old recalls: “I lost my job, left my wife, left the girl I left my wife for, didn’t have a place to live, was drinking considerably, was living in my car and had a gun in the car. This went on for a couple of weeks.”He would haunt New York’s adult cinemas because they were open day and night. “You could sleep four or five hours in the balcony of the old porn palaces. You would occasionally be awoken by people around you but you could get a few hours of sleep that way.”One day Schrader felt a pain in his stomach, went to an emergency room and was found to have a bleeding ulcer. He was 26. “In the hospital this image came to me of a taxi cab and I said, ‘That’s me: I’m this kid locked up in this yellow box floating in the sewer, who looks like he’s surrounded by people when he’s absolutely alone.’“Whereas other people at that time associated taxi drivers with your garrulous, friendly brother-in-law, I saw inTaxi Driverthe heart and soul of Dostoevsky’s Underground Man.”Before he started writing, Schrader reread works byJean-Paul SartreandAlbert Camus. “I wanted to take this character, who had existed in European literature and American literature – which is the underground man, the existential hero – and bring him to film.”He got the first draft written in just 10 days.“I wrote one draft and immediately started rewriting. I needed to exorcise this character. If I didn’t write about him, I’m afraid I might become him.”Among Taxi Driver’s many memorable scenes is Bickle, his head shaved into a mohawk, attending a political rally with the intention of assassinating a presidential candidate. But Secret Service agents spot Bickle putting his hand inside his jacket and approach him, which escalates to a chase.An inspiration for this wasSara Jane Moore’s attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford in San Francisco in September 1975. “She took a shot at Gerald Ford. She missed and was on the cover of Newsweek magazine the next week.“That’s where I said, ‘That’s what our culture has come down to? You shoot at the president, you miss, and now you’re on the cover of the largest publication in the country.’ That’s where the early ending of Taxi Driver comes: the irony of becoming famous.”Schrader offered the screenplay to the film directorBrian De Palma, who passed it on to Scorsese, who immediately believed in it and even saw something of himself in the underground man. Who, then, would play Bickle? Harvey Keitel was the early favourite. Schrader says: “Bob had been in Mean Streets but Marty went further back with Harvey.“I had gotten [co-producers] Julia and Michael Phillips involved. He showed us an early cut of Mean Streets. Julia and I walked out and we both looked at each other and said, ‘It’s not Harvey, it’s Bob.’ Marty recognised that was the truth but then he had a little problem with what to do about Harvey.”View image in fullscreenRobert De Niro in Taxi Driver.Photograph: Columbia/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockSchrader, Scorsese and De Niro did not talk much about Bickle ahead of production. They did not need to.“We all knew this kid,” Schrader says.Schrader originally wrote the character of Sport, a pimp, as Black to reflect what he had observed on the streets. But executives at Columbia Pictures demanded the role be changed to white, fearing that a white protagonist killing only Black people in the final shootout would incite riots and cause liability.“I had written the pimp Black because he [Bickle] is a racist character and he kills Black people. The studio said, ‘If he only kills Black people, you’re gonna have violence in the theatre.’ Then all of a sudden there was a role for Harvey.”Keitel asked Schrader to find a real life white pimp to model the character on. “I never did find the Great White Pimp,” Schrader admits, but Keitel took the role anyway. Foster, just 12 years old, wascast as the young sex workerIris and held her own when she and De Niro ad-libbed dialogue.There was more improvisation required when Bickle stares at himself in a mirror and imagines a confrontation. Schrader explains: “It was in the script that he takes the gun, plays with it in the mirror, points it at the mirror, pretends to shoot it, talks to himself.“‘What does he say to himself?’ Bobby asked me. ‘What line would it be?’ I said, ‘Hey, it’s like when you’re eight years old and you’re playing cowboy, you’re shooting in the mirror and say, “Hey, gotcha! I’m faster than you!” Stuff like that.’”When the moment arrived, De Niro came up with a line for the ages: “You talkin’ to me?” In 2016, at a screening of Taxi Driver at the Tribeca film festival in New York,he told fans: “Every day for 40 fucking years, at least one of you has come up to me and said – what do you think –‘You talkin’ to me?’”To achieve an R rating without cutting footage, Scorsese desaturated the colour of the final shootout, turning the bright red blood into a “tabloid” brown. Also vital was the musical score by composer Bernard Herrmann, who completed the recording sessions hours before his death.Taxi Driverwas released on 8 February 1976. Schrader remembers talking to someone at Columbia Pictures who thought the film would flop but feeling more optimistic himself. “We made a $20 bet and, on the day it opened at the Coronet, I went over. I wanted to be there, first day, first screening.“It was just about ready to start and I noticed around the theatre there’s a line and I thought, ‘Oh fuck, they had a problem and they’re not letting people in.’ In fact, that was the line for the show two hours later. Right about the time I walked in, the words Taxi Driver came up with that music and the audience applauded. This is the first screening in New York, so all that word of mouth had been buzzing around.”The movie’s debut at the 1976 Cannes film festival drew boos and some walkouts. The playwrightTennessee Williams, the then jury president, said: “Films should not take a voluptuous pleasure in spilling blood and lingering on terrible cruelties as though one were at a Roman circus.”Foster has recalled that, apart from a press conference, Scorsese and De Niro hunkered down in their hotel rooms, worrying that everyone would hate the film. That left the young Foster, who could speak French, to do media interviews. Yet Taxi Driver stillwon Cannes’s top honour, the Palme d’Or.It also struck a chord with theHolden Caulfieldsof the world – young men full of resentment, anger, self-loathing and an inability to connect. Schrader says: “It hit the bullseye of the zeitgeist but you cannot plan to do that. Either it happens or it doesn’t.“I remember one day in my office, I came in and my secretary said, ‘Don’t go in there.’ I said, ‘Why not?’ She said, ‘It’s one of those kids.’ So I went in and there was a kid there and he had jumped over the fence and come to my office. I asked him what he wanted. He said, ‘How did you find out about us?’ I quickly checked to see if he had a gun on him and said, ‘What do you mean?’ He said, ‘That movie, Taxi Driver – who told you about me?’View image in fullscreenMartin Scorsese and Robert De Niro during production.Photograph: WWD/Penske Media/Getty Images“I said, ‘Honestly, no one told me about you; there are a lot more of you than you think.’ Then I said to him, ‘Have you ever been on a movie lot?’ I said, ‘Well, let’s get a golf cart, I’ll show you around the movie sets.’ He said, ‘Oh, that would be cool.’ We went around in a golf cart and I had a security guard come over to me and say, ‘Mr Schrader, you’re needed back.’”Schrader’s interloper was not alone in taking Taxi Driver personally. In March 1981, John Hinckley, who had become obsessed with the movie and had been stalking Foster,tried to assassinatePresident Ronald Reagan in an effort to impress her. Foster was subjected to intense, unwanted media scrutiny at the time and has consistently refused to comment publicly on the incident.Years later, Schrader recounts, De Niro asked if they could bring Bickle back in a sequel. “I said, ‘Bob, first of all he’s dead, but if he wasn’t dead, he’s not riding a taxi any more. He’s sitting up in his cabin in Montana setting off bombs and his name isTed Kaczynski.’”A generation later, the natural heir is the disaffected young man hunched over his laptop, wanderingthe manosphereand potentially exploding into violence. “There is now a whole recognised culture of incels. It’s sort of curious. These lonely kids who would sit and fester in their rooms now fester in their rooms and talk to other lonely kids who are also festering in their rooms. Does this alleviate some of their psychosis or does it heighten it? I don’t know which.”Such cultural relevance helps explain why Taxi Driver has endured for 50 years and will doubtless endure for 50 more. Schrader muses: “Every generation finds it. When someone comes up to me and says, ‘Taxi Driver changed my life,’ I always say to them, ‘Let me guess, you saw it when you were 15, and they say, ‘How did you know?’“I say, ‘Fifteen is the age where you’ve been watching action films and you’ve heard about this film and it’s the first time you realise you can have an action film that isn’t just about action.’ Every generation of young men in particular seem to find that through that film. There are few other films like it that epitomise a certain point in your life and so it is a film that won’t die.”Scorsese went on to make films including Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Casino, The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street.De Nirostarred in The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull, Once Upon a Time in America, Goodfellas, Meet the Parents and many others.Schrader, who continued to write screenplays and also directed films such as Blue Collar, American Gigolo and First Reformed, comments: “Bobby should have taken more chances. He got heavily involved in real estate and that became an excuse to take the money gigs.“Marty said to somebody once, ‘I paint frescoes: I paint the ceiling, I paint the floor; Paul paints Dutch miniatures.’ If you want to paint frescoes, you need a lot of money – a lot more than I need to do Dutch miniatures.”For all its modern resonance, Taxi Driver also stands as a precious time capsule that washed down to 2026 from an America disillusioned bythe Watergate scandalandVietnam war. It is a portrait of a city – the New York of high crime and hustlers that nearly went bankrupt in 1975 – but also a portrait of a moment.Richard Brody, a film critic at the New Yorker, comments: “For me, the most powerful experience of Taxi Driver is not rewatching it; it’s having watched it just about in its time as a teenager and feeling it had concentrated all the craziness of the time into that movie – a kind of requiem for the political and social frenzies of the late 60s and early 70s that by the time of the making of Taxi Driver had spun out of politics and spun into an inchoate but grave crisis.“Taxi Driver gave me the sense, when I saw it, that Scorsese felt a breaking point. He felt the old latches ripped off and volatile, unpredictable energies that had formerly been directly channeled now unleashed.”Explore more on these topicsTaxi DriverPaul SchraderRobert De NiroMartin ScorseseJodie FosterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Oscar-tipped director Oliver Laxe explains why he had to organise his own music festival in the Moroccan desert to find deeper meaning in dance-floor ecstasyWhitney WeiMon 9 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 02.03 ESTShareIn the opening scene of Oliver Laxe’s existential mystery thriller Sirāt, a crowd of partygoers stack up a sound system for a rave in the southern Moroccan desert, where the paths of the film’s protagonists cross for the first time. Crucially, Laxe explains, the revellers were no ordinary extras. Most of them were committed, lifelong ravers who had travelled to the makeshift festival from across Europe. One of the DJs who played, Sebastian Vaughan AKA 69db, was a core member of Spiral Tribe, the pioneering British “free party” collective of the 1990s.“In film, reality is usually made to adapt to the rules of cinema,” the French-born Spanish director tells me when we meet in Berlin. “But we do the opposite: we adapt cinema to reality.” When negotiating with the ravers how to best represent them in the film, he recalls, “they told us that the music cannot stop for three days. And we were really pleased with this idea”.Sirāt promises to be one of the arthouse crossover hits of the year. After winning the Jury prize at Cannes last May, it will be released in UK cinemas in February and has a good chance of grabbing an Oscar or two in March, where it is shortlisted in five categories, including best international feature film. On the surface, Laxe’s film is a road movie about a modest family unit – patriarch Luis, his son Esteban and their dog Pipa – searching for a missing daughter, Mar. Their search is complicated when radio reports announce the outbreak of an armed conflict with the unnamed neighbouring country and the army arrives to break up the desert festival.View image in fullscreenDirector Oliver Laxe (third from left) on the set of his film Sirāt.Photograph: Altitude Film SalesBut over the almost two hours of the film, the search-mission plot gradually fades into the background. Far from being just an accidental backdrop, rave culture and its deeper metaphysical meaning emerges as Sirāt’s main subject.Many previous films have tried to explore dance music culture, with varying degrees of success: British coming-of-age drama Beats, Mia Hansen-Løve’s French touch tale Eden, or Warsaw-set docu-fiction All These Sleepless Nights. What sets Sirāt apart is that Laxe sees raving, and the ego dissolution associated with it, as a confrontation with mortality. “If you die on a dancefloor, it’s considered a mythological death,” says the director, who observes Sufism and personally studies gestalt psychotherapy.The unusual way Laxe’s film portrays the death of certain characters has been key to its growing cult status. But he insists that his intention is far from cruel. Rather, his depiction alludes to the spiritual practice of shedding worldly attachments or the false self to achieve true liberation. “This is the same in all the core of all the cultures, where the hero transcends the idea of his own death,” the director says, referencing the work of scholar Joseph Campbell. “He knows that his death is not the end of anything, it’s the door to eternity. It’s like a triumphant death.” His film is his own take on the hero’s journey, a universal narrative archetype.The poetry of Rumi was another one of Laxe’s many inspirations. The 13th-century Sufi mystic roused others to dance “when you’re broken open” and “in your blood”, which informed the film’s portrayal of raving and psychedelics use as an ecstatic rite amid life’s suffering. “As a film-maker, I would like to evoke transcendence,” he explains, “even the worst disasters, tragedies, obstacles, the worst thing that can happen to you – it’s a gift, in a way. It has to be like this. It’s painful at some point, but I think there is serenity.”Laxe intentionally cast non-professional actors with disabilities – Tonin Janvier (“Tonin”) has a prosthetic leg, Richard Bellamy (“Bigui”) has a missing hand, others have visible scars – to externalise the emotional imperfections of those searching for solace on the dancefloor.Raves, he says, are unique in that they allow for uninhibited, even extreme forms of expression. “You can scream, you can cry, you can fall on the floor,” he said. “At some point, you see yourself and you see the construction of your ego, you see how fake you are, your personality, that’s not your essence. In this moment, the beat, the kick, the music comes. It’s like it’s pushing you up. It’s like you are celebrating your wounds when you land.”View image in fullscreen‘You can scream, you can cry, you can fall on the floor’ … Sirāt.Photograph: Altitude Film SalesIn the film, none of Laxe’s spiritual musings would have come together without Sirāt’s score. For this, the director tapped one of electronic music’s most respected underground producers, Berlin-based David Letellier, AKA Kangding Ray.A veteran musician with legendary experimentalist label Raster-Noton and regular DJ at techno temples Berghain and Tresor, Letellier says he’s seen contemporary electronic music leave behind its roots in DIY and queer subcultures to be “co-opted by big corporations” and transformed into a lifestyle product through social media. What is now often taken for granted, he says, is “the solidarity, the resistance, the anti-authoritarian, anti-system ethos that was once its base”.Laxe contacted Letellier after coming across his 2014 track Amber Decay, and spent five days with the producer in Berlin listening to everything from Steve Reich to Detroit techno. During the making of Sirāt’s score, Letellier withdrew behind a vast wall of modular synths in his studio and spent days matching sounds to the pain, despair, and anger depicted on-screen.He told me his work for Sirāt was less like a composer assembling notes and more like that of a sculptor. “I take sounds and I carve them and I polish them or cut them or destroy them or explode them,” he said. The end result is a soundtrack that appears to disintegrate over the course of the film, from visceral electronics into dark, skeletal ambient noise.Sirāt review – rave in the desert leads to exasperating quest in the sands of MoroccoRead moreIn the second half of the movie, the father character Luis grapples with a sudden devastation in his life. As a low techno heartbeat drones on in the background, he stares around in a state of surrender and lifts his hands in the air. In a moment of crisis, he finds solace in the act of dancing. “The body has memory of the pain, of your pain, the child’s pain, the trauma of a child,” Laxe says, “but also the pain of your lineage, your family, and the pain of the world.”Sirāt is released in UK cinemas on 27 February, and in Australian cinemas on 26 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmThrillersDrama filmsDance musicMusic festivalsElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I immersed myself in music-making with a synth, drum machine and a four-track Tascam Portastudio. I was very inspired by Brian Eno. I’d seen the words “found sounds” on his album credits. The notion that any sound could be included in a recording struck me as magical. I just held a mic out of my bedroom window. Black Man Ray started out as an ambient number with an intro featuring the sound of a boy I recorded singing in the street below. In the end, he actually featured in the opening bars of our songThe Highest High.Black Man Ray has that classic China Crisis synth sound, but our producer Walter Becker did a huge amount of work on it, as he did on all the tracks on Flaunt the Imperfection, our third album. Virgin Records were keen to follow up the success of our single Wishful Thinking and would have been bending Walter’s ear, telling him to focus on songs that sounded like potential hits. We recorded Black Man Ray at the Parkgate Studio in Sussex – in the kitchen! I have a vivid memory of it, mainly because Walter had sesame seeds in the pan, toasting them. Coming from a very working-class family, I’d never seen such a thing.There’s something very 1980s about the song’s intro, but there’s always been an awful lot of melody in our compositions. Even before Ed or I start singing, there’s a keyboard trilling away on Wishful Thinking, Red Sails and Papua. A lot of bands at that time didn’t do that.People find the title and lyrics of Black Man Ray mysterious. Being interested in photography, I had a copy of Creative Camera magazine which had an article on the surrealist Man Ray. His name intrigued me. But the song was quite autobiographical about being in a band, so the title was like Ray Charles singing about his life. Again, it’s that Eno-esque idea of singing oblique, enigmatic lines that appear to mean something on their own, buried among the rest of the lyrics. There’s an element of truth there, but it’s not The Long and Winding Road.Eddie Lundon, backing vocals, songwriter, guitarAfter our US tour, Gary and I decided to take a break from each other, working separately on songs for Flaunt the Imperfection. The first time I heard Black Man Ray was a rough version Gary played me on a lovely summer’s day in the garden of his mother’s house. I could hear its pop potential right away, it was so melodic and catchy. But it’s always been the way our songs start out with one of us writing the fundamentals, having the inspiration, building around a certain melody, and only evolving into the sound that’s ultimately recognisable as China Crisis when Gary and I come together.One of the best parts of Black Man Ray was where I joined Gary, who sings the lead vocal, harmonising on the chorus: “Ye-e-s ye-e-s, I could be wrong.” That section is anthemic really and irresistible to sing along to. It’s the part of every live performance that unites our audience and reminds us why we love what we do so much.While we’d been in the US, our label Warner Brothers asked us who we’d like to work with to produce the album. We mentioned the likes of Richard Carpenter and Steve Winwood, and said we’d love to work with some of the classic Steely Dan adjacent team like Gary Katz. Word of this got back to Walter Becker who, it turned out, was already a fan of China Crisis. He flew over from the States to meet us and we hit it off immediately. He was an absolute perfectionist and hard taskmaster, very precise in his instructions, insisting on multiple takes.At one point he mentioned how Black Man Ray reminded him of the Beatles. I think he was mostly referring to the arrangement, the intro, verse, chorus and repeat, followed by a middle eight, then a double chorus and outro. But for two young lads from Liverpool to hear him say that, well, you can imagine how that would have felt.The 10th Anniversary edition of China Crisis’s Autumn in the Neighbourhood album is now available on vinyl and CD from Last Night from GlasgowExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeShareReuse this content"

He was the Scot who would be king, consumed by vaulting ambition for the throne, or else the powerful man of action, devoured by envy of his onetime friend. But in an illuminating new biography by the political journalist James Macintyre, Brown emerges as something closer to the hero of a Victorian novel: a man who leads an epic life shaped by early misfortune and later tragedy, driven onward by a moral purpose that burns to the very end.His is a compelling story. Bill Clinton was once described as the most psychologically complex occupant of the Oval Office since Richard Nixon; the same is surely true if you substitute Brown, Downing Street and Winston Churchill. Macintyre hails him as a “titan”, brimming with both intellectual firepower and the urge, rooted in Christian faith, to do good. (When the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was asked to identify who in the current era most closely incarnates the values of the pastor and legendary anti-Nazi dissident Dietrich Bonhoeffer, he answered: “Gordon Brown.”) But Macintyre also describes his subject as “famously flawed”, with a volcanic temper, a talent for grudges – he stops speaking to Robin Cook and can barely remember why – a tendency towards “needless suspicion towards his perceived opponents” and a willingness to rely on a phalanx of “sometimes thuggish spin doctors”, expert in the blackest arts.Compare this image to that of Peter Mandelson ‑ the man Brown brought back from the political dead, only for him to allegedly betray government secrets to a billionaireIn other words, Brown defies the easy categorisation that both the politics and media of the age demands. He is simultaneously possessed of an intellect of “astonishingly high quality”, according to Tony Blair, and yet capable, when making dinner at home for the woman who would become his wife, of inadvertently placing a duvet cover on the table instead of a tablecloth. He is a distinguished scholar of history, yet so fixated on the latest headlines that staff took to hiding the newspapers and switching off the TV sets. He was the “big clunking fist” – Blair again, though oddly the phrase doesn’t appear in this book – who repeatedly showed a gentle empathy to friends and colleagues at times of loss and who, with no publicity, volunteered at a hospice during what was meant to be a rare prime ministerial holiday.He was indeed filled with personal ambition, yet had no interest in the trappings of office or the cash he could have made on leaving it. On the contrary, he insisted on paying his own way, even picking up the bill for decoration work done at Downing Street, which landed him with “considerable debt as a result”. He has refused to take his prime ministerial pension. Compare this image to that of Peter Mandelson ‑ the man Brown brought back from the political dead, only for him to allegedly betray government secrets to a billionaire who had apparently given him money in the past.He is shy, alternating on camera between only two modes: dour and awkward. (Public performance was not made easier by the teenage rugby injury which led him to spend much of 1968 in a hospital bed, lying in the darkness, and which resulted in permanent blindness in one eye and impaired vision in the other.) Yet in private he can be warm and funny: Brown would do a bit that involved him impersonating himself, mocking the gulf between his own “mechanical style” and the oratory of Barack Obama. Macintyre reports two episodes of depression – the second following the election defeat of 2010, the first prompted by the death of his baby daughter, Jennifer, at just 10 days old – and yet at age 75 Brown keeps going, still rising at dawn every day to work, work, work.He was famously indecisive, his premiership blighted by weeks of dithering over whether to call an early election soon after succeeding Blair, and famously decisive, acting to address the financial crash of 2008 when his fellow world leaders were flailing. In one memorable scene, the leaders of the G20 nations gather for crisis talks. A panicked Nicolas Sarkozy says, “Look around the table … compared to our predecessors, we are nothing. Let’s just be honest: in this room no one has a plan.” Obama taps the microphone, leans forward and says, “Gordon’s got a plan.” And so he did, ordering the recapitalisation of the banks, a move that prevented the collapse of the global financial system and saved the world economy from plunging into depression.Macintyre is upfront that he is sympathetic to, indeed admiring of, his subject and that he has had Brown’s co-operation on the book. But he does give Brown’s former antagonists, inside and outside Labour, their say. He speaks to the Blairites, including Blair himself, and to David Cameron, Michael Gove and Nick Clegg, quoting his sources on the record and at length. With Macintyre, Blair is far more forgiving towards his former chancellor than he was in his own memoir – where he wrote of Brown: “Analytical intelligence, absolutely. Emotional intelligence, zero.” Perhaps time has mellowed him, for he is at pains to be only generous towards the man who went from office spouse to daily headache, even insisting that he had no problem with Brown’s ambition for the top job: “Why shouldn’t he have it?”There are, inevitably, many pages dedicated to dissecting the supposed pact agreed between Blair and Brown in 1994, when Brown did not contest the Labour leadership, thereby allowing Blair a clear run. Even after exhaustive examination, there is no definitive verdict on what exactly happened between the two. Did Blair promise to step down after 10 years as Labour leader or only after 10 years as PM – or were these pledges that, given the uncertainty of politics, could never realistically be made? For all his admiration of Brown, Macintyre concludes that things worked out for the best: “Blair as front man and Brown as chancellor was almost certainly the right result in the end.” Brown would remain angry, though, gnawing his fingers down to the quick whenever Blair spoke in cabinet meetings. (There is, surely, aJohn and Paulstyle account yet to be written of the Brown-Blair relationship, with its Lennon-McCartneyesque arc of intense male friendship, rivalry, eventual estrangement – and ground-shifting productivity.)To read now of his achievements, as  Labour struggles for direction and coherence, is bittersweetThe effect of airing these details, like quoting Brown’s onetime opponents, is to encourage the reader to acknowledge Brown’s flaws while seeing how vastly outweighed they are by the rest of his record. To read now of his achievements, as a Labour government struggles for direction and coherence, is a bittersweet experience. Brown halved the number of children living in poverty. The chances of young people finding a job rose by 20%. His creation and funding of Sure Start centres transformed lives: a 2024 study found that children from low-income families who lived near a centre performedup to three grades betterin their GCSEs than those who lived further away. The New Labour government was the most redistributive of the entire postwar era, Macintyre writes, thanks to a combination of the minimum wage, tax credits, pension changes and vastly increased spending on the NHS. As one former adviser notes, “It’s very important that Labour people don’t assume that action on poverty happens automatically because their lot is in power: last time it happened because Labour had a chancellor who was hell-bent that it should.”Granting independence to the Bank of England gave the British economy a new stability; Brown’s determination to cancel the debts of the poorest nations led to $100bn being written off, releasing cash for schools, clinics and clean water for some of the neediest people on the planet. True, his regulation of the high-rollers in the City was too light. True, he did not resign over the invasion of Iraq. True, British entry into the euro, which Brown opposed, might have made Brexit impossible, though failure could have had the opposite effect. What is hard fact is that Brown’s record of accomplishment is immense – and rare. It makes him one of the towering figures of recent British history.And, as Macintyre notes in the closing chapters, Brown is not done. Whether acting as a UN education envoy, ensuring schooling in Lebanon for millions of child refugees from Syria, or persuading Amazon to hand over unused goods to fill his innovative “multibank” – “a food bank, clothes bank, toiletries bank, bedding bank, baby bank, hygiene bank and furniture bank all rolled into one” – Brown is doing more good as an ex-PM than plenty of his successors managed in the job.Thanks to a rightwing press that often seemed to loathe him it was Brown’s demons that were, during his years in government, most often presented to the British public. Only intermittently was a glimpse offered of the stronger, better angels of his nature. This diligent book seeks to redress that balance, to tell the story of a life packed with drama, tragedy and, above all, service.Gordon Brown: Power with Purpose by James Macintyre is published by Bloomsbury (£25).

One loss is mineWhich thou too feel’st, yet I alone deplore.Thou wert as a lone star whose light did shineOn some frail bark in winter’s midnight roar:Thou hast like to a rock-built refuge stoodAbove the blind and battling multitude:In honoured poverty thy voice did weaveSongs consecrate to truth and liberty, —Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve,Thus having been, that thou should cease to be.Shelley’s genre in To Wordsworth has been described as the “corrective tribute”. The euphemism seems to let Shelley off lightly. There’s little doubt that the younger poet intended a combination more abrasive than gently “improving”. The sonnet was published in his 1816 collection,Alastor; or, The Spirit of Solitude, in which one of the themes is an idealistic young Romantic poet’s narrative of political disillusion.Shelley’s technique is artful. The opening address to Wordsworth has a tone of gentle lament, in which the younger poet sees himself and his addressee as sharers of life’s ordinary sorrows and losses, the “common woes”. His quiet affirmation of solidarity is, however, a preparation for stronger censure to follow, and soon we see the place where the weapon is unsheathed: “These common woes I feel. One loss is mine, / Which thou too feel’st, yet I alone deplore.” The stop after “I feel” marks the severance. Shelley sees the lost intensity of their once-shared political idealism. All his disillusionment with Wordsworth centres in the verb “deplore”. It describes Shelley’s strength of young feeling, unique and merciless.The particularly cruel insight (if true) is that Wordsworth’s resigns his power with less suffering than Shelley experiences, observing his resignation. The loss is far more sharply registered by Wordsworth’s once-admiring younger friend – according to his friend’s account. It may be his true response, and a cruel judgment: it isn’t exactly a usable “corrective”.The “frail bark” and “rock-like refuge” Wordsworth has presented in young Shelley’s view are somewhat conventional metaphors, and seem rather shallowly connected to the work and the life. However, Shelley raises his game. He finds a special decorum in a last longing image of Wordsworth in all his moral presence: “In honoured poverty thy voice did weave / Songs consecrate to truth and liberty.” Shelley would have been thinking of the more politically radical sonnets by Wordsworth such asTo Toussaint Louvertureand possibly the despairingThe World Is Too Much With Us. Wordsworth’s nature poems were also important to Shelley, and furthered the democratic vision.What the younger visionary proclaims ultimately is the imaginative and moral death of the older poet. It’s a chilling verdict, and the truth of it is not proven: we learn much more of what Shelley felt about Wordsworth than any details concerning the finer points of the failure and complacency he believed Wordsworth to have exemplified. Wordsworth was still some years from the pinnacle of success, respectability and poet laureateship, and the various charges of loss of inspiration other poets would later press. To Wordsworth remains effective in the slowly mustered forces of its sincerity and regret, and the emotional charge of the disappointment. “Deserting” his own songs (like a leader abandoning his troops) Wordsworth has left Shelley to grieve, “Thus having been, that thou should cease to be.” Shelley has in fact come to bury a poet he believes is already creatively, politically, dead on the battlefield of ideas.Explore more on these topicsPercy Bysshe ShelleyCarol Rumens's poem of the weekPoetryWilliam WordsworthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Helena doesn’t want it called her “hen… Like we’re dumpy little featherbrains going cluck, cluck, cluck”, but all the same, the men – including Sophie’s curator boyfriend of six years, Greg – will not arrive for another five days.She may be on holiday but Sophie is not at ease in the villa’s atmosphere of “almost offensive” good taste, with luxurious meals, cocktails on tap and endless sunshine. In the 10 years that have passed since they first met as students, the differences between the women have become more pronounced: money has “made itself known”. Elegant, chilly Iris, whose parents have bought her a place in Peckham, works in publishing; the family of spoilt, patrician art dealer Alessia seem practically to own the island on which the women are holidaying; and Helena’s aspiration is to be a trophy wife with a house full of “nice things”.By contrast, Sophie – whose father is an electrician and mother the full-time carer for her disabled sister – is working in a museum shop while she tries to make her way as an artist. She is also under pressure from her reliable, thoughtful partner, Greg, to have a baby, when what she urgently wants is freedom to paint. Apparently understanding this, Alessia commissions a nude portrait from Sophie, to be painted during their time on the island in her private studio. But when the beautiful Ky, waiter, archaeologist and extraordinary lover, appears at the villa and begins to look at Sophie in a certain way, the rivalries that have been simmering turn toxic, and unease becomes something more dangerous.Cosslett is excellent at the sensual detail of light and food and physical pleasureAs Sophie wrestles to reconcile what she wants, what she needs as an artist and what is acceptable in polite society, it becomes clear that this account is written with long hindsight from far into a shadowy future. The island narrative is punctuated at regular intervals by brief passages in which Sophie engages with female artists from history, from Artemisia Gentileschi to Francesca Woodman, deconstructing their experience as she stands in front of their work in museums and galleries down the succeeding years and setting it against her own struggle to find fulfilment as a painter. We skip to and fro between these meditations and the dance of the characters in their Greek idyll, moving towards the arrival of the men, and the certainty of disaster.Female, Nude is an energetic and ambitious novel. Cosslett – a Guardian columnist – is excellent at the sensual detail of light and food and physical pleasure; she immediately engages us with a seductive drama of friendship between women in an exotic and glamorous White Lotus-like location, while at the same time offering a serious-minded interrogation of art. Add in an unpicking of the complex burden that is motherhood and the trade-offs a woman must make with her body and society if she is also to find creative fulfilment, and it’s not entirely surprising that the triple threads sometimes become unmanageable.The artistic analyses are interesting but inevitably feel clunky, as though parachuted in to provide a gravitas that the millennials-on-a-hen-week narrative rejects. It is less easy to believe, too, in the wise and weary future Sophie these passages offer us than in the messy, resentful 31-year-old, lashing out at her frenemies on their Greek idyll, ravenously solipsistic, ruthless and selfish – entirely convincing as an artist in the making, in other words, and as watchable as she is unlikable.The characterisation more generally is a little uneven: while her husband-to-be is splendidly unpleasant, bridezilla Helena is no more than serviceable, Iris the ice queen not far from a cipher and her partner Edwin almost entirely theoretical. But if Ky is pure romantic fantasy, the novel gives Sophie a delightfully free rein with him that makes for a thoroughly enjoyable read – just as Cosslett’s seriousness of intent must also inspire respect.Female, Nude by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is published by Tinder (£18.99).

The mood is more like a stray dog has sidled up to that lamp-post and cocked its leg. The lamps multiply on these squalid, mean streets: uprooted, they become giant props for performers to illuminate and edit the action on a vast stage with its wings exposed and no artificial backdrop. A suspicious figure roams the outskirts with a torch; another drives a vehicle back and forth in the distance. One long-necked light snakes down from above like a tendril, its glow deepening the chiaroscuro. Bodies melt and morph. It is as if a film noir has caught fire in the projector, distorting each scene.Nederlands Dans Theater’s production, at the 20th edition ofHolland Dance festival, confounds from its ragged beginnings to the final seconds, when even the curtain is not allowed to fall in peace. Horses starts with the house lights up and a solo with instinctive flinches and hoof-like hands suggesting hunter and hunted before a second dancer arrives nose-first, as if led by scent. The animality briefly evokes NDT’sFigures in Extinctionbut this is an acutely urban nightmare, with humans’ survival skills put to the test. Suddenly, the auditorium’s doors slam shut and we are plunged into darkness.On Max Glaenzel’s set, lit by Tom Visser, there are vaudeville vignettes of peril, the intrigue heightened by Andrzej Panufnik’s unsettling strings and the clowning overlaid with heavy breathing, canned laughter, comical splish-sploshes and other sound effects. The interactions are at times documented by a pair of figures who resemble wildlife photographers, yet the setting evokes a huge soundstage and revels in artifice.View image in fullscreenUncanny … Horses by Nederlands Dans Theater.Photograph: Rahi RezvaniMorau tests this supple squad of dancers with choreography suggesting limbs that won’t behave, startling their owners with angular thrusts. Bodies are cradled but also dragged and disposed of in a desolate landscape where the lamp-posts are arranged to frame a jolting ensemble or, in a spellbinding sequence, spin like a pendulum held by one dancer for another’s solo beneath. The 11th hour surprise, in this pungently atmospheric work, is that the lost souls whose cries sound like tortured creatures manage to construct a shelter from all those beams. It’s done to the balm of And the Swallow, composerCaroline Shaw’s paean to laying your head safely. A performance that has majored in the uncanny becomes a tribute to human ingenuity: the herd comes together by sensing shared threat.Horses, from 2024, is part of NDT’s double bill,Wildsong, paired with Belgian choreographerJan Martens’s premiere, Kid in a Candy Shop, which is set at first toJulia Wolfe’s Pretty. It is hard to imagine more instantly propulsive music but as the Dutch Ballet Orchestra delivers the surging opening, the dancers are caught in a spectral slow motion, each body still tuning up. They gather speed but when the waves of Wolfe’s music subside, their balance is challenged by forming frozen tableaux, some on one leg. Uniformity is rare among the movements of this huge ensemble, often locked in individual patterns under the abrupt switches in Jan Fedinger’s colourful lighting design, which complements huge projections from British naturalist F Percy Smith’s 1910 filmThe Birth of a Flower, with snowdrops and roses coming into bloom. As these become kaleidoscopic on screen there is no tessellation on stage to match nature’s symmetry, rather industrious individuality, with an occasional floral motif as a dancer curls into a tight bud or extends a limb like an unfurling petal.View image in fullscreenKid in a Candy Shop features excerpts from F Percy Smith’s film The Birth of a Flower.Photograph: © Rahi RezvaniSeveral sections feel like rehearsal games that have not been transformed into a compelling whole in performance. But the dancers’ precision is showcased in a second half set to Hanna Kulenty’s GG Concerto, harpsichordist Gośka Isphording sending the dancers into pinballing, glitching sequences as they bounce, hop, bend and spin in turn. Performed in muted candy-colour costumes, these are pick’n’mix routines befitting the title, but while some sequences fizz the overall result is never as fun as perhaps intended, nor as beautiful as the flower videos that continually threaten to upstage it.Elsewhere at the festival, petals fill the stage inPlease Hold My HandbyCompagnie Tiuri, the Dutch group which creates work for performers with and without disabilities. Its artistic director, Jordy Dik, has crafted a resonant dance-theatre response to shocking statistics about femicide in his homeland and around the world. It is delivered by a cast of four women within the fringe curtains of Loura Sita van Krimpen’s boudoir-style set, established as a safe space yet invaded by violent episodes as the piece unfolds.View image in fullscreenHealing quality … Please Hold My Hand by Compagnie Tiuri.Photograph: Noortje van GestelIt opens with a tender ritual: one woman washes herself, joined by others who brush her hair and dress her. Only slowly does the impact of what may have happened before the scene sink in. A sense of trauma hangs over this tribute to togetherness, as the dancers shield each other, lend their bodies for support in a duet of alternating back bends or simply clean up after each other. But there is abundant joy here, too, as they twirl with silken movements. Red petals are scattered from an upturned umbrella, piling up like autumn leaves. As bodies are dragged through them, the patterns can resemble smeared blood.The piece cleverly plays with romantic gesture and cliche, as partners share caresses and sweep each other off their feet, before the movement evokes coercive control instead. Gaiety is often a step away from brutality, an embrace turning into a grip; the lights are dimmed for a scene in which a woman is punched and kicked in the stomach. Dik reminds us that women’s attackers have frequently been their partners.In a scene akin to Ontroerend Goed’sSirens, the women take turns at a microphone to ape everyday sexism and abusive threats, their tone veering from sly to sinister (“This stays between us, right?”). There is a steely grace to the performances by Andrea Beugger, Margriet Jacobs, Sabine van Riel and Annemieke Mooij and an overall healing quality in Dik’s appeal to give people their flowers.View image in fullscreenParable … Fernando Melo’s The Longest Distance Between Two Points.Photograph: Hans GerritsenThe unnerving blend of material – now horrifying, now humorous, elegant then messy, always sensorial, a rich musical collage – is pure Pina Bausch. One dancer’s lipstick kisses on paper are given to the audience and another scene, featuring balloons and hot pants, is more straightforwardly derivative. It provides an oddly abrupt ending to the piece, which has an activist coda outlining global statistics of violence against women and asking us to illuminate tealight candles for the women we love.Dik’s short piece Live, Live, All We Can Do Is Live – a boyband mini-concert, featuring one dancer’s memories of his dreams to become a Spice Girl – is included in the festival’sHubClubprogramme, presented byIntrodans. An inclusive platform for disabled and non-disabled talent, HubClub is styled as an irreverent cabaret, with five short works (mostly fragments from existing pieces) sandwiched between an overture and a finale. These dancers are introduced in spangly evening wear, gathered around – and even under – a dining table, cigarettes dangling from lips.The scene changes between each segment are handled with wit and invention. For Fernando Melo’s nifty piece The Longest Distance Between Two Points, that table is stripped bare, its long planks becoming partners for the cast and even used as impromptu stages for them, held at various angles. Steve Reich’s Music for Pieces of Wood adds pace as plank-carrying dancers circle each other to create human-made borders that appear almost out of thin air in a piece that is free-flowing and claustrophobic as it becomes a parable about division and confined identities. In the wrong hands, these structures oppress; in others, they provide support. It’s deceptively simple, surprisingly moving when two yearning men are separated by a wall and is – beware splinters! – performed without gloves or socks by a deft company. The potentially lumbering concept proves instead extremely malleable.View image in fullscreenCircus spirit … Boulevard of Broken Dreams by Inbal Pinto.Photograph: Hans GerritsenTwo pieces in HubClub reveal Inbal Pinto’s gift for quirky choreography with a troubling undercurrent. Salty Pink is a seaside folly, with pelvis-thrusting bathers stretching out against a bucolic backdrop and seeking picture-postcard fun, their ruddy demeanour cracking to reveal despair. Boulevard of Broken Dreams, featuring a Foley sound artist, has a circus spirit and trompe l’oeil effects, as a floaty dress is pulled on and off each dancer, taking on a different meaning each time. The costume becomes almost as charged a symbol as the red dress in Bausch’s Rite of Spring, sparking joy, jealousy and fury at different turns, depending on the combination of wearer and observers. This disrobing and dressing is done with smooth grace, Pinto’s call for communal respect and liberty as understated as Melo’s.Conny Janssen’s Manoeuvres is short and sweet: an escapist tea break in a drab canteen for a group of workers. To a medley of golden oldies, they are first seen daydreaming – reading a novel or building a castle from sugarcubes. Then they are dancing in their seats, up on tabletops, sharing loose-hipped rock’n’roll duets or scampering across the floor. Percussion is provided by spoons and cups. Pointedly, they turn to look at the clock on the wall: how will you choose to spend your time off? It’s an irresistible 10 minutes that you don’t want to end – much like the last dancer, still lost in movement as the cleaners pack up around him.View image in fullscreenIrresistible … Conny Janssen’s Manoeuvres.Photograph: Hans GerritsenHubClub’s party spirit is matched by Gauthier Dance’s exuberant if inconsistentFireWorks, conceived to celebrate 40 years of Theaterhaus Stuttgart, where the company is based, and now relaunched for Holland Dance festival’s 20th jubilee. Artistic directorEric Gauthieris the antithesis of lofty pretension: he has an eye for crowd-pleasing concepts and a knack for opening up the artform. Bouncing on to stage in a leather jacket, he gives a showman’s introduction to an evening whose logistics are dizzying: the 16 dancers and a charismatic, eight-strong young company deliver more than a dozen short works including Gauthier’s own jokey ABC of dance, a whistlestop solo encapsulating key positions, choreographers and other essentials.It all adds up to 150 minutes yet flies by and the evening culminates in an eye-popping Bolero performed on trampolines that suggests Gauthier is also an aficionado of DanceTok. Tonight’s audience can’t keep their cameraphones in their pockets as it builds steam. The concept may seem ridiculous but it is infectious fun, each dancer’s bounce accentuating the insistent repetition of the sultry rhythms. Andonis Foniadakis’s choreography is transformed into a tongue-in-cheek exercise class as dancer after dancer arrives on stage with their own trampoline to join in, the increasing spectacle of endurance adding to Ravel’s epic crescendo.View image in fullscreenSpectacle of endurance … Andonis Foniadakis’s Bolero+ from FireWorks by Gauthier Dance.Photograph: Jeanette BakIn this daisy-chain of performances on a bright red stage, the music choices are as eclectic as the dance styles: Dominique Dumais’s corps pulsating to Laurie Anderson’s O Superman, Marco Goecke (of thedog faeces attackon a critic) fusing a solo and duet to Mercedes Sosa, or the summery fun of Benjamin Millepied performed by a bright athleisure-clad crew to Oscar Peterson.Johan Inger’s A Thousand Thoughts melds the Kronos Quartet’s ominous Bells and its version of the traditional Swedish folk music Tusen Tankar for a haunting duet with a fairytale quality, the dancers joining souls (and, in some bewitching floorwork, soles) for movement that is rich in mystery and bracingly pure in its vision of companionship. These snatched minutes together seemingly amount to a lifetime. No less gripping is Virginie Brunelle’s Carousel, to Philip Glass’s music for Les Enfants Terribles, where the central couple’s revolving encounters are scrutinised by the other dancers.The bright young performers of Gauthier’s Juniors company (at 19-23, older than they sound) are a great match for the playful humour of aDevendra Banhartmedley that accompanies Alejandro Cerrudo’s Lickety-Split. These insouciant duets and carefree encounters are a delight, down to one dancer playfully head-butting another’s rear into just the right position. After all, in Gauthier’s alphabet of dance, A is not just for arabesque but also for ass.Holland Dance festivalruns until 21 February, with many performances then touring.

This is the question hovering over Catherine Dyson’s The Last Picture – first shared in a rehearsed reading at YorkTheatreRoyal as part of the RSC’s 37 Plays initiative in 2023 and now receiving a full production. It’s a piece that moves constantly between past and present, testing the empathic capacities and limits of theatre as an art form.There’sa touch of Tim Crouchto Dyson’s writing, which invites the audience into the imaginative act of bringing her words to life. This is a play about pictures in which not a single image is shown. Addressed in the second person, we are cast as audience members in a theatre as well as a class of year 9 students on a school trip to an exhibition about the Holocaust. As the unseen photographic evidence of genocide is described, the play flings us backwards into the scenes captured, placing us in the position of those being led to their murders – as well as that of the neighbours who looked the other way.Guidelines review – teens try to escape the aftermath of a murder filmed on a phoneRead moreOur guide throughout is the excellent Robin Simpson as Sam, the students’ emotional support dog. Radiating a comforting canine energy, Simpson talks us gently through the exhibition, periodically pausing to do a headcount and check how we’re feeling. John R Wilkinson’s absorbing production thrives on simplicity and space, allowing the storytelling and subtle shifts in lighting and sound to transport our imaginations – as well as leaving the gaps that expose where imagination and empathy fall short.Though the play can’t resist closing on a note of hope, there’s nothing neat about The Last Picture’s take on history or humanity. If these images and the responses to them show us anything, it’s that we remain capable of it all: selflessness, brutality, compassion, indifference, kindness and atrocity alike.At York Theatre Royal until 14 February, then touring.Explore more on these topicsTheatreYorkHolocaustAntisemitismreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tonight, the star of Mean Girls, Les Misérables and Mamma Mia is seated among a rather different set of luminaries: key figures from London’s avant garde jazz scene.The link here is composerDaniel Blumberg. When heaccepted an Oscarlast year for his extraordinary score to The Brutalist, Blumberg namecheckedCafe Oto, the leftfield Dalston venue whose improvising musicians have long formed the bedrock of his work. While scoringThe Testament of Ann Lee– a biopic starring Seyfried as the founder of the Shaker religious movement – Blumberg was struck by parallels between Shaker worship and free improvisation: a shared ascetic intensity, a cult-like devotion, and moments of wild, euphoric release. The speaking-in-tongues qualities of Shaker devotional singing, he realised, had uncanny echoes in the work of vocal improvisers such asPhil MintonandMaggie Nicols, both of whom feature in the film – and in this performance.View image in fullscreen‘The players clang discordant handbells, as if summoning the dead’: The Testament of Ann Lee’s music at Milton Court with Maggie Nicols  and Phil Minton(fourth and third from right)Photograph: Yasmin HuseyinSeyfried, a fine musician (as anyone who caught herplaying dulcimeron Jimmy Fallon’s show will know), sings the Shaker-style hymns that Blumberg wrote for the film. Her voice – pure, hymnal, lightly inflected with Appalachian bends – acts as a melodic anchor while the rest of Blumberg’s eight-piece ensemble mutilate these songs. Violinist Billy Steiger and bassist Tom Wheatley (on what appears to be a six-string bass viol) smear the tunes with woozy drones; drummer Steve Noble teases out abrasive textures from a kettledrum; all the players clang discordant handbells, as if summoning the dead.If the hymns in the film function as joyous, communal, Wicker Man chants, binding a congregation together, here they acquire a feral, unsettling edge. Much of that is down to Minton and Nicols. Minton – a youthful-looking 85 – unleashes his formidable arsenal of vocal effects: gasps, retches, howls, panting, animalistic whinnies. Nicols punctures the hymns with yelps, shrieks and sudden eruptions of joy. They mirror, and then grotesquely exaggerate, the Shakers’ ecstatic glossolalia.What emerges is not accompaniment but confrontation: faith rubbed raw by improvisation, beauty deliberately bruised. Seyfried holds her ground throughout, unflinching amid the sonic sabotage, less Hollywood interloper than fully embedded participant. The result – although only 45 minutes long in total – is exhilarating and wonderfully disorientating.Explore more on these topicsExperimental musicJazzClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

The approach of his 80th birthday seems to have spurred rather than slowed a composer who warmed up by premieringhis first opera in 2025, and now marks the milestone itself with a new oboe concerto for longtime colleagues the London Symphony Orchestra and their principal oboe Olivier Stankiewicz.Nearly 20 years on from 2009’sViolin Concerto, Matthews’s uncompromising structural vision has only intensified. His solo oboe might stand apart from the orchestra, but is locked into its musical argument, helping to tussle themes and ideas into their ultimate form in a dynamic – often combative – back and forth.View image in fullscreenAgile … Olivier Stankiewicz performs with the London Symphony Orchestra.Photograph: Mark AllanIf the choice of oboe suggests English pastoral, Matthews is quick to dispel the association. A summoning upward flourish from the soloist launches a single continuous movement, Stankiewicz’s agile, peremptory oboe an almost constant presence. Texturally dense, forcing the soloist to ride the storm (precisely marshalled by conductor Elim Chan), the music throws out challengers in the form of a raucous, jazz-tinged clarinet and a seductive cor anglais. And there’s no resolution in an ending that’s more an emergency stop, flung at the audience like a challenge. This isn’t music going gently, it’s a piece still wrestling heroically with definitions.It’s a natural partner for Rachmaninov’s final work, 1940’s Symphonic Dances, whose web of allusions and quotations – a waltz, the Dies Irae chant, a theme from his First Symphony – grapples with musical history and identity. Chan is a compelling figure on the podium, feet moving like a boxer, fists raised with no baton. There’s nothing fantastical about her account; instead we get a deep internal logic, dances with the emphasis on the “Symphonic”, an overarching continuity through the composer’s phantasmagoria of episodes.The same structural clarity is at work in Bartók’s Dance Suite, where Chan never lets the glittering surface (and glitter it absolutely does, especially in the woodwind solos of the Allegro Vivace and the grotesque little flickers of the opening movement) warp the underpinning architecture.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Symphony OrchestraBarbicanreviewsShareReuse this content"

At the end of the day it is all coming from actors.”Equity – which has 49,000 members and whose membership card is seen by many budding actors as a gateway to the industry – and Spotlight both charge about £200 a year.View image in fullscreenOwen Cooper, who won an Emmy for Adolescence, was submitted for the role through Spotlight.Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPAWith about 100,000 actors and performers signed up, Spotlight is the biggest database for agents, producers and casting directors to find talent in the UK and Ireland, as well as operating in regions including Europe.It was founded in 1927, three years before the establishment of Equity, and the two organisations have enjoyed almost a century of close-knit and amicable relations. However, this dramatically changed after theacquisition of Spotlight by the US company Talent Systems, backed by Caltius Equity Partners, in 2021, which brought to an end three generations of private ownership by the Seale family.Two years later Gerry Cardinale’s RedBird Capital Partners, which last yearpulled out of buying the Telegraph titlesand is part of Paramount’shostile bidfor Warner Bros Discovery,took a majority stake in Talent Systems.Paul W Fleming, the general secretary of Equity since 2020, said the union “took a decision to start looking at Spotlight” in 2023 with the backing of members after allegations that fees charged to performers were “rocketing” after the change in ownership.“For a long time our members have been concerned about the price of Spotlight membership,” he said. “Our longstanding understanding was Spotlight was allowed to charge as long as they don’t make a profit out of it. It was always owned by a family, there weren’t shareholders. Spotlight had a clear defined domain.”Monthly meetings were held between the two sides and then, in January last year, Equity filed a high court action.View image in fullscreenThe Equity union argued that Spotlight’s fees were a ‘tax on hope’ for jobbing actors.Photograph: Ian West/PAThe nub of Equity’s legal argument was that Spotlight operates services above and beyond being a directory of actors and that it is in effect an employment agency.The union waged a very public and high-profile campaign arguing that the fees charged by Spotlight, which actors must appear in if they want a realistic chance of making a career, were a“tax on hope”for jobbing actors.“We are not an agency, it is an advertising service for actors,” said Hood, who joined Spotlight after the acquisition in 2021 after 17 years at Equity. “It is a centralised directory service. If you want to be seen among your peers this is the place. We don’t procure work for you, and that service hasn’t ever changed in going on 100 years.”What Equity ultimately wants is for Spotlight’s status to be reclassified so that it is not allowed to make a significant profit from its services, so its subscription levels will only cover the costs of showcasing talent. But to date it has not gone well.In September, the high court judge Catherine Howells delivered what industry trade press termed an“embarrassing blow”for Equity rejecting its case. She described Spotlight as “an industry-valued marketing and promotional tool for performers … that does not provide services for the purposes of finding persons employment with employers, or of supplying employers with persons for employment by them”.View image in fullscreenA copy of Spotlight from 1939. The directory celebrates its centenary next year.Photograph: SpotlightDespite the defeat, and the overall cost of the legal action to date thought to be about £500,000, Equity appealed and has been givenleave to continue to pursue the caseat the court of appeal with a date set for the last week of November.“We are not trying to destroy Spotlight or do anything like that,” said Fleming. “There has not been a complete deterioration of the relationship. Anything other than the [high court] judgment we have [would be] a win of sorts. We do believe we have a strong position. Members do feel exploited by Spotlight in their charging. Members are very supportive of this.”Despite the omnipresence of the upcoming renewal of a legal battle in court, Hood is attempting to focus on Spotlight’s centenary next year.The company’s Covent Garden offices showcase rows of annual editions of Spotlight – early editions comprise two volumes for male actors and one for “actresses and children” with the final print version issued in 2016 – but the only known copies of the first two editions are in the British Library.View image in fullscreenLaurence Olivier’s Spotlight listing from 1931.Photograph: SpotlightOne entry, in thespring 1931 edition, features a 24-year-old, moustachioed Laurence Olivier who is listed as a “juvenile man”. The listing for the actor, who 16 years later would be knighted as one of the UK’s acting greats, comes complete with his address – in Roland Gardens, south-west London – and a personal phone number, “Kensington 6505”.The 2000 edition of Spotlight features a beaming 26-year-old Olivia Colman, listed as “5 feet 7 inches … brown eyes”, three years before breakout roles on the Channel 4 shows Peep Show and Green Wing set her on the path to stardom.Olivia Colman’s Spotlight listing from 2000.Photograph: Spotlight“We are not a huge business, this isn’t Meta or Apple,” said Hood. “We make a modest profit and are growing the business to reinvest.”Talent Systems Europe, the parent company of Spotlight, reported turnover of £14m in 2024, a 6.6% year-on-year increase, according to the most recent publicly available accounts at Companies House. The company reported a pre-tax profit of £2.7m, an increase of a third over 2023.“We have tried to reach out to resolve the issues in a way that doesn’t incur any further cost to either party as we believe it is not in the best interest of actors to continue this,” said Hood. “We would much rather be in a place of dialogue than litigation.”Explore more on these topicsActingFilm industryTelevision industryTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The novelist, Fiona, gets twitchy when he starts recording and balks when he wonders if her fiction is autobiographical. She squirms and stalls until he ends up asking questions with his back turned, to make it less of an ordeal.Things are not quite as overwrought on our video call when Arikha dials in from Paris. She is accompanied, on screen, by the actor Maryam d’Abo, who is starring in the play in London. So is D’Abo, like Fiona, deeply suspicious of journalists? “Of course,” she says in a friendly tone. Maybe I should turn my back as we talk. Or at least “some” journalists, she adds diplomatically, referring to her formative experience as a “Bond girl”. At the age of 26, she played Kara Milovy, a Czech cellist and would-be sniper who – typically – falls for the charms of Timothy Dalton’s 007 inThe Living Daylights.I was quite shy. I hadn’t been a child actor“I’ve never done so much press,” she recalls. “And in those days, there were the Fleet Street journalists who were harsher and more judgmental. You open your heart because you’re inexperienced – and then it’s edited so you think, ‘That’s not how I meant it.’”View image in fullscreenFalling for 007’s charms … with Timothy Dalton in The Living Daylights.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/RexShe mostly loved the Bond experience, though. “It was like a big family,” she says, with producers Cubby and Barbara Broccoli very present. But she lived with a terror of being somehow exposed, in the aftermath. “I take responsibility for not having had enough confidence,” she explains. “I was quite shy. I hadn’t been a child actor. But I’m not blaming Bond for screwing up my career. I’ll never regret it.”Both a producer and actor, D’Abo made a 2002 documentary, Bond Girls Are Forever, in which she spoke to women about their experiences on 007 films. “My pitch was Judi Dench. I said there is no story without her, because she becomes James Bond’s boss. I wanted to show how these roles had evolved and how they mirrored society – how they went from the 60s and villains like Honor Blackman’s Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, in which there was a huge amount of tongue-in-cheek humour, to the 70s where Maud Adams is badly treated. It would be unthinkable now but there is that scene in The Man With the Golden Gun when Roger Moore smacks her in the face.” As the decades passed, women in the films became more empowered.The only thing D’Abo might change, in hindsight, would be her decision to stay in Los Angeles when she might have built a theatre career in France. She is English but spent some of her childhood in Paris, speaking French as her first language. It is one of the affinities she found with Arikha, a friend of many decades who was born and brought up in Paris.Without our imagination, what are we supposed to write about? How would Tolstoy have written War and Peace?Arikha is better known as a novelist. Her first foray into professional playwriting was inspired by Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf and Ingmar Bergman’s Scenes from a Marriage. “I love writing about dysfunctional families because of the complexities and all that’s unsaid. I love the idea of dissecting a couple but also the imbalance between one, the writer, who is on the brink of fame, and her husband, who is about to sink. So the seesaw of emotions, truth, fame and success – the hodge-podge of it all.”In the play, Fiona has written a book using someone else’s story. Is this theft or a legitimate gathering of material? Her actor-husband, Ivo, has recently been cancelled after charges of violence against a woman. Are these fabricated or real? The play also asks what it takes from family life to be an artist, specifically for mothers.Arikha grew up within a thoroughly artistic milieu, and you get the impression that she has thought deeply about these questions on artistic endeavour. She is the daughter ofRomanian artist Avigdor Arikhaand American poet Anne Atik. Samuel Beckett was her godfather and she would send him poems and plays she had written. She likes the mix of reality and fiction in art, and has interwoven them in her books. “I think life does inevitably come through in fiction, unconsciously sometimes.” When she wrote her memoir,Major/Minor, her sister said: “That never happened.” “I said: ‘It’s my truth’ and she said: ‘No it’s not. It didn’t happen.’ So what is truth?” There are some real-life parallels in the production of Spanish Oranges. Arikha’s 23-year-old daughter, Arianna Branca, is playing the daughter of the fictional couple.View image in fullscreenDysfunctionals are forever … D’Abo and Jay Villiers star in Spanish OrangesPhotograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianBoth D’Abo and Arikha know what it is to be married to fellow artists: the former to the late film-makerHugh Hudson, the latter to the composerTom Smail. Neither speak of experiencing the highly freighted artistic rivalry of the play. Does Arikha draw a line around what to take or leave out from real life based on ethics or privacy? Yes, for her novelTwo Hours, which was a pared down version of a “pretty difficult moment in my life”.As well as dissecting Fiona and Ivo’s marriage, Arikha pulls on several writerly conundrums around appropriation and identity politics. Both women are vehemently against the idea of only writing, or acting, from personal experience. “I remember Hugh had this wonderful project and Ed Harris was going to play this character who is gay,” says D’Abo. “The possible financiers said, ‘You have to get a gay actor.’ It was killing the whole artistic process for an actor and for a writer.”Some people might say that this is a valid criticism based on representation and authenticity. “Of course, there has to be a healthy balance but it’s also about letting the creatives be free in bringing what is right for that particular storytelling and character,” says D’Abo.Arikha agrees. “Without our imagination, what are we supposed to write about? As long as it’s done accurately and with empathy. Think of Tolstoy. How would he have written War and Peace? You have to use your imagination. You have to try and feel what it would be like to be someone else – or somewhere else.”Spanish Oranges is at thePlayground theatre, London, from 11 February until 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreJames BondThe Living DaylightsDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As he publishes a polemic about surveillance and state control, the artist relives a momentous trip to see his motherMon 9 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 10.29 ESTShareAi Weiwei is talking me through the decision-making process before his first visit to China in over a decade. The artist, known around the world as the most famous critic of the Chinese communist regime, had to do some fraught arithmetic before deciding to head back home.Before boarding a flight with his son, who had never met the artist’s elderly mother, Ai thought back to his time in detention when his captors told him he would spend the next13 years in custody on bogus charges: “They said, ‘When you come out, your son won’t recognise you.’ That was very heavy and really the only moment that touched me.”I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. That’s my only relationship to China. I’m not patrioticHe ended up spending several months in captivity. Lao, his son, is now 17. Ai says Lao doesn’t really need his guidance any more so he decided to book their flights and roll the dice. “People said, ‘Are you scared?’ I said, ‘No, why should I be scared?’ I’m Chinese. I have a Chinese passport. I’m entitled to go back and see my mum. So I went back.”View image in fullscreen100m hand-painted seeds … Ai’s famous Turbine Hall exhibition.Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty ImagesWelcome to the life of Ai Weiwei. For most people, returning home doesn’t involve weighing up the risk of whether you’ll see close family ever again, but that’s the reality for a 68-year-old whose whole existence has been shaped by authoritarianism and the struggle against it.His trip to China went well. He ended up being interviewed at the airport and released after a couple of hours into a country whose smells, sights and sounds were soothing to him. Ai described the journey as being like “a phone call suddenly reconnecting”. Today, he’s more poetic, describing it as “a piece of jade broken that you can put back together because it matches very well. Everything’s so familiar: the light, the temperature, the people.”Ai is meeting me in the London offices of his publisher to talk about his new book,On Censorship, a 90-page polemic on the nature of state control, AI and surveillance. The man certainly knows about these things. Born in Beijing in 1957, he grew up in labour camps in north-west China following the exile of his father, the poet Ai Qing. In 2011, he was detained for 81 days in a 170 sq ft windowless prison because of his own activism. Upon his release, he was tracked, interrogated and threatened by the Chinese state; then his passport was returned in 2015 and he began a life in exile. He currently divides his time between Lisbon, Berlin and Cambridge.I feel the same kind of surveillance and censorship in the westHis artworks are as dramatic as his backstory. An army of 1,600 Chinese artisans created100m hand-painted porcelain“seeds” that were scattered over the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in London 16 years ago. He cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus in 14,000 fluorescent orange lifejackets worn by refugees; and made a film dedicated to the children who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. That direct challenge to the official state narrative made him “the most dangerous person in China”.His upcoming work, at Aviva Studios in Manchester, involves 30 tonnes of buttons, which weresaved from a London factorythat was closing down and smuggled into China to be turned into huge hanging artworks by craftspeople.The book is a startling read, arguing that those in the west misunderstand the nature of censorship. He defines it as “the exercise of power over intellectual space”, both “an indispensable tool of mental enslavement and a fundamental source of political corruption”. It is not just authoritarian regimes, he warns. Liberal societies think that censorship is rare, “but people forget that even on sunny days, shadows are inevitable”.View image in fullscreenWorn by refugees … some of the 14,000 lifejackets that cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus.Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/EPASome of the arguments are perplexing. In a section about the limitations of AI, the artist refers to the selfie he took with AfD leaderAlice Weidel in 2018. He says AI decided that the image, which is real, must have been fake because the pair seemed to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At the time of the selfie, Weidel,whose grandfather was a Nazi, was considered to be in the more moderate wing of the far-right party, but since becoming leader has called for“large-scale repatriations” of foreigners, saying the country’s focus on the Holocaust is akin to a “guilt cult”.Does Ai regret the selfie? He tells me that on many issues, her political demands “could be wrong”, but she’s still “more rational than other political opponents in Germany”. What about her anti-immigrant rhetoric – isn’t that anathema to him? “Some states don’t even accept one [immigrant] and Germany accepts 1.2 million, which is a pretty generous decision,” he replies. “So if they change the policy and they want to limit it, then there is nothing wrong.”He’s also impressed by the fact that Weidel “openly wants Germany to be more independent from American influence”. He adds: “I think those are some of the things that we need to do.” Those who know German politics would find that argument surprising because the AfD are seen as the party who are closest to Trump and nearly all parties in the country want more independence from the US. A ringing endorsement of someone at the outermost reaches of far-right European politics might cause a few double takes, and there are more surprises.My position with China started before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in a black hole with my fatherAi’s attitude to China has shifted dramatically. The nation, he said recently, is “in an upward phase,” pointing to the technological advancements made and increased personal freedoms. The west, however, struggles to “sustain its own logic”, has lost its “ethical authority” and has “descended into something barely recognisable”.Although a quick glance across the Atlantic at America in the age of ICE raids does somewhat make his point, he means Europe, too. So is the Chinese regime’s most famous critic now toeing the party line? “My position withChinastarted before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in this black hole with my father,” he says, pointing to a picture on his iPhone of a desolate location in north-west China.He’s not angry exactly, but the suggestion that he’s softened on the Chinese government has touched a nerve. “I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. So that’s my only relationship to China,” he says. “I’m not nostalgic. I’m not patriotic.” What about the claim that the west embraces censorship? Is that his experience in the UK?“I cannot get into details,” he says cryptically. “But I feel the same kind of surveillance, same kind of censorship in the west.”View image in fullscreenDetail … the artist at work in his Berlin studio.Photograph: Steffen Roth/The ObserverPressed for an example, he tells me a story about the Royal Academy in London, an institution that gave him alandmark exhibition in 2015and made himan honorary member in 2011following his detainment in China. In November 2023, an exhibition of new works to be shown at the Lisson Gallery was pulled after he posted a tweet that began: “The sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world.” The tweet was deleted, with the artist telling journalists his show had “effectively [been] cancelled”.In the aftermath, a vote was then held at the RA to determine whether his membership should be revoked because of accusations that the post was antisemitic. “I don’t have the intention of an antisemite. My best friends, they’re all Jewish people,” says Ai. “I tweeted millions of tweets on Twitter, but [how is it that] this tweet can cause such trouble? Then they said the procedure is to let the Academicians vote.”His peers supported him and he won the vote. Ai was then asked to write an article about freedom of speech for the RA’s magazine, which he did, arguing: “Speaking the truth and insisting on one’s own perspective is dangerous and may come at a heavy price. Books may go unpublished, exhibitions may be closed, concerts cancelled.”On Censorship by Ai Weiwei review – are we losing the battle for free speech?Read moreAfter he sent it, there was silence. Then he says the RA claimed they didn’t have room to run the piece. For him, this is the censorship in the west, which he argues in OnCensorshipcan be “more covert, more deceptive and more corrosive” than in authoritarian regimes. “I have several cases like this,” Ai adds. “Happens in Britain and in Germany.”The RA disputes this account, claiming the decision to drop the piece was made before Ai submitted it. A spokesperson added: “Plurality of voices, tolerance and free thinking are at the core of what we stand for and seek to protect.”I wonder how Ai feels about the world in 2026. His new book paints it as a place without refuge for those who value self-expression and freedom of speech. “I think today we are living in a complicated world, where life is more like a shattered mirror,” he says. “It reflects the reality, but the reality can be a broken reality.”Did his trip to China restore his faith in humanity? There’s a pause. “If we were in the time of the Tang dynasty, someone like me would go back and write beautiful poetry,” he says, smiling. “But not today. I just take a few selfies.”On Censorship by Ai Weiwei is published by Thames & Hudson (£12.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

She tells the extraordinary story of how she survivedMon 9 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 05.45 ESTSharePicture Reshona Landfair in 1996 at 12 years old, when she met the R&B superstar R Kelly (real name Robert Kelly). Her world, she says, seemed like “a buffet” spread out before her. She was a popular girl, a seriously talented basketball player and the youngest member – in her words, “the pint-sized girl rapper” – of4 The Cause, the singing group she had formed with three cousins. They’d been signed to a record label, made the Top 10 in eight countries and toured much of Europe. Her large extended family from the West Side of Chicago was tight-knit. Life was filled with music, sport, church, Sunday lunch at Grandma’s, family road trips and everybody knowing everybody’s business. “That was a beautiful time,” she says. “I had love and good people all around me. I was living in my true light of who I wanted to become. I felt like I was on my way.”Fast forward to Landfair at 26 years old, when she finally left Kelly’s orbit. By then, half her family weren’t speaking to the other half, and the relationships that survived were charged with guilt, unasked questions and terrible past mistakes. She had no friends left, as Kelly hadn’t allowed it. Her hopes of a musical career were also long gone – Kelly had made her leave 4 The Cause when she was just 15. She had no qualifications beyond high school and no idea what she wanted to do because, for more than a decade, she’d relied on Kelly to tell her. She couldn’t imagine a healthy relationship; she’d learned sex, she says, “through the lens of a paedophile”. Every element of her 12-year-old life, everything on that “buffet table”, had been destroyed by Kelly. Yet she is still told regularly by total strangers that she must be a “gold digger”, that she “rode the gravy train” and took Kelly for all she could get.View image in fullscreen4 The Cause in 1998, with Reshona Landfair, front, in stripesPhotograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyThere shouldn’t be much left to learn about Kelly’s 30-year history of abusing women and children. In 2021, he wasconvicted of racketeering and sex trafficking, and the following year he was convicted ofchild enticement and producing child abuse images. Millions have watched the three seasons of the documentary series Surviving R Kelly, and his six-week trial in 2021 was covered across the world. But those who have followed the horror story will know that one key voice has not been heard, and that is Landfair’s.Her absence was especially notable in season one of SurvivingR Kelly, which first aired in January 2019. Many of his victims – fans, aspiring singers and dancers, and girls that he and his entourage just found in the mall – described their experiences in chilling detail. They were groomed, isolated, beaten, broken. Sex involved harm, pain and extreme degradation, which he liked to film.Surviving R Kelly: what we can learn from the shocking new seriesRead moreWoven through the series is a powerful testimony from a former protege of Kelly’s called Sparkle, who had introduced him to her 12-year-old niece, a talented rapper, but become alarmed by their unsupervised time together. Sparkle’s appeals to the family went unheard – by now, Kelly had employed the niece’s father as a session guitarist. In 2002, one of Kelly’s “sex tapes” was leaked and widely distributed, and showed him urinating on a young girl who Sparkle instantly recognised as her niece – and knew from her hairstyle that it had been when she was just 14. Months later, Kelly was charged with possession of child pornography. The trial took place in 2008. Sparkle gave evidence for the prosecution but her niece refused to testify. In court, her parents denied that the girl in the video was their daughter.Kelly was acquittedand the chance to hold him accountable was missed. That girl, of course, was Landfair.The programme triggered a reckoning – within weeks of it being broadcast, Kelly had been arrested again. For Landfair, watching it was life-changing. She didn’t appreciate Sparkle speaking for or about her, but the rest was a revelation. “It was mortifying,” she says. “For so long, I’d thought these were sexual cravings and fetishes that he had on me – but then I saw it had been so many women, so many girls. It was like watching a serial killer, but sexually. I had no idea that it was this massive, and I felt responsible. I’d protected him, I’d lied for him.” Her voice breaks and there’s a long silence while she gathers herself. “He was able to hurt so many people after me.”These revelations led to her testifying against Kelly in court at his 2022 trial in Chicago, and she has now written a book, Who’s Watching Shorty?, about her time with Kelly.It started when her aunt, Sparkle, took him to see 4 The Cause perform. “It was just so mesmerising to be around him,” she says. “He was this big statue in my eyes.” Kelly singled out Landfair for special praise and took the whole family to dinner. He quickly became a “family friend”. He visited their church, made Landfair his “goddaughter”, cheered her on in basketball games and invited her father, a guitarist, to work at his studio. It felt like the whole family had been blessed, says Landfair. They were on the “come up”. “Being connected to Robert would create so many levels of security, whether that’s musically, financially, or just your reputation and popularity, having this cool celebrity in the family. We all appreciated that.”View image in fullscreenLandfair’s aunt, Sparkle, and R Kelly during a break in filming a video in 1997.Photograph: Raymond Boyd/Getty ImagesHer book describes the devastating steady drip of the grooming process, and Kelly’s voice in her ear. It started with a hug that was just “a little too long and a little too tight”. They would have rambling phone calls, Landfair in her teenage bedroom, surrounded by sports trophies. At first, it was innocent chatter – music, school, basketball – then, down the line, he began to ask what she was wearing. Then he’d tell her to touch herself.Over many months, Kelly convinced her that they had a special bond, an incredible, once-in-a-lifetime connection, and that he was risking everything for the two of them. “You understand me on a level that is beyond anybody and everything I’ve ever experienced,” he told her. Then it would be: “If you love me like I love you, then you need to do what I say,” or: “People do shit they don’t want to do for folks they love every damn day of the week.” He made rules around what she wore, who she could speak to, what she could say. In time, he was the one person she was close to. If Landfair refused a certain sexual act – which Kelly called “the next level” or “going higher in our love” – he would punish her or call in a girl from another room of his studio (a maze of dark, windowless rooms) and have her perform it in front of Landfair. She knew there were many “girlfriends”, but in her muddled teenage mind, they were her rivals, not victims.Who else knew? Landfair says much of Kelly’s entourage who saw to her daily needs and brought her food must have known. “Those people were around every day,” she says. “They had to care for you and they were like family. As a child, I saw it as helpful. Now I see they were part of it too, even if they didn’t perform the acts.”What about her parents? Kelly always instructed her on how to shut down their questions. (When he made Landfair leave 4 The Cause, she was told to tell her parents it was because she wanted a “normal childhood”.) She feels strongly that it’s much too complicated to just “blame the parents”. Yes, Kelly paid her father, who died in 2021, a steady income, and he would not have wanted to make an enemy of someone so powerful – but she says she would have seemed “happy”.“I definitely think there were moments my parents had spiritual discernment and it probably was weighing on them so heavily that it was just not something they wanted to believe,” she says. “I’m not here to sugarcoat or cover up their shortcomings, but I know they were operating out of love and fear of losing me.”If they were trying not to look too hard, the leaked video, made when Landfair was 14, gave them no choice but to see. By then, Landfair was 17. “It was degrading, embarrassing, traumatising, my body being tossed around and seen by the world,” she says. “It was bootlegged and sold on street corners, in flea markets. People I grew up with were having ‘watch parties’.”View image in fullscreenLandfair on stage with 4 The Cause in 1998, when she was 14.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyHer parents were devastated for their daughter, furious with Kelly, fearful of the consequences. Under Kelly’s careful instructions, Landfair threatened to kill herself if they tried to separate her from Kelly. At a crisis meeting in a Chicago hotel, Kelly begged on his knees for forgiveness from Landfair’s father. He said he was sorry for lying, but not for loving their daughter, and promised to protect her. At this point, the parents chose not to trust family services, police, courts and judges.“We were just a family who didn’t want to cause the end of Robert’s career,” she says. “We felt more secure, more protected with Robert’s resources.”From that point on, Landfair went “underground”. She left school to be “home-schooled” and left home, too. She could no longer be seen with Kelly, and instead stayed in one of those dark studio rooms, or in a cubicle in his tour bus, parked outside his home. His staff saw to her needs, but Kelly himself wasn’t around much. “I was miserable, I was alone,” she says. “There were moments he remembered that he needed me on side, so there’d be a shower of appreciation, like a dinner, or a trip – but nothing was a gift by then, nothing was enjoyable. It was a mission carried out for his benefit.”Kelly was still in demand despite the video, even appearing at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics, and he was occupied by parties, performances and many more women and girls. Landfair was strictly forbidden from watching any coverage of the impending case, Googling Kelly’s name, or anything related to him – a rule she had always lived by.It took six years for the sex tape to reach trial in 2008 – there seemed no urgency about it from the authorities. Landfair knows now that the entire 26min 30sec video was played for everyone in the courtroom, not just the jury. She knows people snickered.“I do feel like race played a big part in the trial and the way I was handled in public,” she says, then stops, and quietly fights back tears. “I get chills when I think about it.” Another pause. “If it had been a caucasian girl this happened to, especially by a black man, I’d have been treated more like a victim, I’d have felt more supported. Instead, the only support I felt was from Robert’s side. I’m not here to play the race card, but it’s a reality. Black girls growing up, we’re considered to be ‘fast’. If we’re victimised, it’s more our fault. If things happen, we’re blamed.”View image in fullscreenReshona Landfair … ‘I didn’t see myself as a victim because the world didn’t.’Photograph: Lucy Hewett/The GuardianAfter Kelly’s acquittal, Landfair remained in his world for a few more years, but he was rarely present. In truth, she’d been replaced by other victims. She left at 26. “I was very lost, confused, very scared,” she says. “I really didn’t know life and normality. I had to rebuild my entire self.” She still didn’t see her time with Kelly for what it was. “I didn’t see myself as a victim because the world didn’t,” she says. “I was just a big conversation. I knew that people called me a ‘ho’ and a ‘gold-digger’ while praising him and his music.“Also, you compartmentalise. When you’re in those moments that you’re reminded of the things you’ve been through, you push it right away.”She avoided reading anything about Kelly, and certainly didn’t talk about him – that had been drilled into her for years. Even watching Surviving R Kelly on her own when it aired felt risky. “I was scared. I felt I was doing something wrong by even watching it – but by the end, I felt the spirit of conviction all over me.” Shortly afterwards, when Landfair was served a subpoena by Homeland Security, she told them she would be cooperating fully.Landfair wasn’t involved in Kelly’s 2021 trial – the one heard in New York with 45 witnesses, and which resulted in a 30-year sentence forracketeering and sex trafficking. She didn’t even follow it. “I was still so fearful,” she says. “I didn’t want to tap into too much information in case I felt intimidated. I just focused on what was in front of me.”View image in fullscreenA sketch of R Kelly’s Chicago trial. Screens were used to block off part of the courtroom while the sexually graphic video clip was played.Illustration: Cheryl Cook/APHer case was heard a year later in Chicago, with two days of testimony from Landfair. “I purged in that courtroom,” she says. “I didn’t want to hold anything back.” When she finished, she walked into the holding room, lay on the floor and cried. “It felt spiritual,” she says, “like oil running off my body, toxins leaving. That was my moment of liberation. For the first time, I was not under his spell.” Kelly was sentenced to 20 years, 19 of them concurrent with his previous 30-year sentence.Recovery is slow but steady. Landfair has a five-year-old son now. She works for a nonprofit supporting single mothers, and for a school-based health programme. “I’m still in the process of repairing my life,” she says, “but I’m so much further along.”She still thinks about Kelly, though she tries not to. What made him this monster? Landfair doesn’t believe it had much to do with sex. “It was power,” she says. “Just as much as he had sexual fetishes and desires, it was more gratifying for him to see that he was able to get whatever he wanted, to make you do vile things and submit to him in every way.”Kelly has talked publiclyabout experiencing childhood sexual abuse himself, from the age of seven. “I wish he had used his adult mind, his money, his power to get professional help, or raise awareness and help others,” says Landfair. “Instead, when I walked into the courtroom, he gave me a look that let me know he still didn’t get it,” she adds. “It was not a look of remorse. It was a look that said, ‘Hmph, how dare you?’“When I think about Robert now,” says Landfair, “there are moments I feel anger, moments I feel sadness – but ultimately, I just hope he gets it. Maybe now he does.”His recent statement, since delivered to Rolling Stone magazine in response to her book, through his lawyer, suggests otherwise: “At a young age, Ms Landfair was unfairly forced into the public eye against her will by people that were intent on destroying the reputation of R Kelly. She did not deserve that. Mr Kelly has no negative comments to make about her. He hopes she finds success and peace.”Who’s Watching Shorty?: Reclaiming Myself from the Shame of R Kelly’s Abuse by Reshona Landfair is published by Legacy Lit (£25)Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was 2004, we were living in Dibden, New Forest, and I was looking to buy some guinea pigs. I saw an ad for a raccoon on the secondhand site Preloved. My husband, Graham, and I lived in Florida in the 90s and had a raccoon that would come into the yard. It had a bad leg, and we nurtured it, so I was very interested in raccoons.I met someone who bred them after researching on Google, and we ended up with three, one after the other – we bought two, Nigel and Casey, and later, Mishka was given to us.If you’re bringing up raccoons, they have kitten milk, which I got from the pet shop, to start with. They can’t have cow’s milk; they get really bad diarrhoea. I bottle-fed Mishka, then weaned her on porridge. She liked dog kibble, chicken sticks, berries, pumpkin and cheese. She wouldn’t eat any meat. She was eventually diagnosed with diabetes. My husband had to inject her every day with insulin. Eventually, she didn’t mind, but in the beginning she did bite him.If you crossed Mishka, she would let you know. She lived in an enclosure in the utility room, and then used to come out into the lounge and have the run of the house. We used to put our dogs, chorkies Kennedy and Elf, in the bedroom when she left the utility room. If she was in a bad mood, she’d bite you and growl, but mainly she was loving. I could hug her, kiss her, brush her. She hated water. She wouldn’t get in the bath unless it was dry. We had to use wipes to clean her. But she didn’t smell.The pet I’ll never forget: Cocolo, the donkey who arrived unexpectedly at our doorRead moreView image in fullscreen‘She stripped the wallpaper off my walls with my dog’ … Mishka.Photograph: Gill WatersMishka didn’t like the other two raccoons, so she used to terrorise them a bit by hitting them on the head. When we first got her, she had a large cage in the lounge, where she could relax on a hammock. One day, she climbed on top of the cage and jumped into a Christmas tree. That was hysterical. Together with my dog, she stripped the wallpaper off my walls. She was a naughty, mischievous, gorgeous raccoon.It used to be legal in the UK to keep raccoons as pets, but then an invasive species law came in that meant you weren’t allowed to buy, sell or give them away. We were allowed to keep ours until they died. Mishka wasn’t well the last couple of weeks of her life, which was horrible. The vet didn’t know what was wrong with her but I think she had a brain tumour. She died last May, aged seven.She was my pride and joy. We just had so much fun. Everyone thought we were crazy – our family, our friends – but anyone who met Mishka fell in love with her.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe pet I'll never forgetPetsWildlifeAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I use whatever veg is in season: purple sprouting broccoli is at its best right now, but you could add stalks of rainbow chard, shredded cavolo nero, even halved baby carrots. Play around with whatever veg you have and love.Creamy chicken, purple sprouting broccoli and mustard fricasséeIf you can’t find mustard powder, feel free to use your mustard of choice – wholegrain would work well here.Prep5 minCook30 minServes44 skin-on chicken breasts(about 160g each)Sea salt andblack pepper2 tsp English mustard powder1 tbsp olive oil200g purple sprouting broccoli30g unsalted butter4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced1 tsp dried oregano1 tsp aleppo pepper2½tbspplain flour125ml dry white wine500ml chicken stock200ml single creamPut the chicken breasts on a deep plate and season generously. Add the mustard powder and olive oil, then massage them all over the chicken.Put a wide casserole dish or large, deep frying pan on a medium-high heat and sear the chicken skin side down until it is deeply coloured. Fry on the underside for a few minutes, too. This should take five to eight minutes in total.Meanwhile, trim off and discard the woody ends from the purple sprouting broccoli and halve or quarter any large, bushy stalks. When the chicken is browned all over, return it to the plate skin side up; it doesn’t need to be cooked through at this stage, just coloured.Add the butter to the pan and turn down the heat to medium-low. Add the sliced garlic, dried oregano and most of the aleppo pepper, fry for a minute, then stir in the plain flour. Keep stirring until you have a biscuity-smelling paste, then stir in the white wine until the sauce is smooth and bubbling.Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, then return the seared chicken skin side up to the pan. Cover and cook for eight minutes, then stir in the cream, nestle in the broccoli, cover and cook for a further six to eight minutes, or until the broccoli is tender and the chicken is cooked through. Scatter over the remaining aleppo pepper and a good grinding of black pepper, and serve with mashed potato or rice.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyChickenMeatMain courseVegetablesStewrecipesShareReuse this content"

It’s quiet, intentional and deeply comforting. The stillness just before sunset gives way to movement – the table being laid, the clinking of glasses, the pause as everyone waits for the call to prayer. Then, with a date in hand and water on the tongue, the fast is broken. That moment never loses its meaning, no matter how many times you experience it. Iftar doesn’t begin with a feast, but with small, simple things, such as these two soups.Shurbad(lamb, oat and barley soup – pictured top)Shurbadexists across many cultures, especially in east Africa, the Middle East and north Africa. The word comes from the Arabicshariba, meaning “to drink”, and it refers to something light and warming. This is often served at the start of a meal and, while the ingredients and methods vary across the different regions, the feeling is the same. This is a dish that many, myself included, make only during Ramadan, because it feels tied to the rhythm of the month. This version is gently spiced and comforting; if you prefer, use chicken instead of the lamb. The soup freezes well, too, so you can make it weeks in advance.Prep10 minCook2 hr 45 minServes8-10500glamb shoulder on the bone, diced2 vegetable stock pots400gtin finely chopped tomatoes180gpearl barley4 tbsp rolled oats½ tsp ground cumin½ tsp ground coriander½ tsp curry powder5 tbsp olive oil, or sunflower oil½ large brown onion, peeled and chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled1 small bunch fresh corianderLemon juice or apple cider vinegar, to serve (optional)In a large deep pot, combine the lamb and stock pots with 2½ litres of cold water. Put the pot on a medium-high heat, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for about an hour and a half, until the meat is tender.Lift out the meat with a slotted spoon, then shred it into small pieces; discard the bones. Return the shredded meat to the pot and stir in the chopped tomatoes and barley. Cook uncovered for another 45 minutes on a medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, then stir in the oats, cumin, ground coriander and curry powder. Cook for 20 minutes, then take off the heat.In a separate saucepan, heat the oil on a medium heat. Add the onion and fry, stirring, until browned. Put the garlic cloves and fresh coriander in a mortar, then grind to a paste. Stir this into the fried onion and cook for another minute. Carefully pour the hot onion and oil mixture into the soup, then stir to combine and simmer for a further 10 minutes.This is best served hot with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice or a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar on each portion. The soup can be kept in the freezer for up to three months. To serve, just defrost, warm through and finish with a quick herb oil. Don’t forget the vinegar or a squeeze of lemon to bring it all together.Addas(red lentil soup)View image in fullscreenIlhan Mohamed Abdi’saddas, aka red lentil soup.This lentil soup, known simply asaddas, is made from the most basic pantry ingredients, but somehow always tastes like more than the sum of its parts. I’ve been eating it since I was little, and it was one of the first meals I weaned my daughter with once we introduced spices. It was only recently that a good friend from Algeria introduced me to the addition of ras el hanout, the north African spice blend. The soup thickens beautifully by the next day, almost like a soft dal, so I’ll often serve that over rice; otherwise, I’ll gently loosen it on the stovetop with a splash of water and enjoy it as soup again.Prep10 minCook55 minServes4-62-3 tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped4-5 garlic cloves,peeled and crushed1 large carrot,peeled and finely chopped300gred split lentils, rinsed1 heaped tbsp vegetable bouillon powder1⅓ tbsp ground cumin⅓ tbsp ras el hanout1 tsp salt400mlcoconut milk1 large handfulchopped coriander, plus extra to garnishLemon slices, to serveHeat the olive oil in a large saucepan, then add the onion and saute for three to four minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic, leave it to soften slightly, then add the carrot. Stir everything together and saute for a minute or two.Add the rinsed lentils and stir well – the mixture might clump, but keep stirring. Add the bouillon powder, cumin, ras el hanout and salt, and cook over a low heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 seconds. Add the coconut milk, 1.3 litres of cold water and the fresh coriander, and adjust the salt to taste. Cover the pan, bring to a simmer and cook on a medium-low heat for 20 minutes.Half-blend the mixture with a stick blender to give it a creamy texture while keeping some chunks intact. If need be, add more water, and remember to check the salt. Simmer for another 15 minutes, then serve hot garnished with extra coriander and the lemon slices.These recipes are edited extracts from The Ramadan Kitchen: Nourishing Recipes from East toFeast, by Ilhan Mohamed Abdi, published by Pavilion Books at £26.

I was already paying £62 a month in direct debits but was apparently falling short.I discovered the company had registered the wrong meter to my grandmother’s account and was charging her, and now me, for a neighbour’s supply.It has thus been overcharging my grandmother – registered as a vulnerable customer – since she movedto the newly built estate 18 years ago.Southern visited the property, admittedthe account was linked to the wrong meter and installed a new digital one.Itsaid in December thatit had cancelled the £614 bill, and that the account was£500 in credit. But nowit has changedits story.It has wiped the credit andis, instead, demanding I payit £500, even though my new meter readings prove my actual usage amounts to about £100.Every time I call, I get a different story, or a new “process” to follow that leads to a dead end.It feelsas ifit is trying to cover up a massive 18-year mistake.JMHorsham, West SussexThames Water charged me for enough water to make 1m cups of teaRead moreIt seems your grandmother, who lived alone and was on the priority services register because of her age and illness, has been paying for the water at a neighbouring house ever since she moved in. The mix-up wasn’t obvious when the neighbouring household was small, but her bills increased significantly more recently since four people now live there.You immediately spotted that the meter serial number on your bills did not match the meter assigned to the house.Instead of making urgent amends, Southern added the amount outstanding on the neighbour’s meter to the sum due on your new one. The result was a £500 bill sent days after written confirmation that the account was £500 in credit.Southern admits that its complaints team contacted you and that the account was fully reviewed after I raised questions. By its calculations, your grandmother had been overcharged £893. You accept this figure.The supplier has issued a cheque for this, plus £200 in goodwill, to your grandmother, and refunded £594 of overpayments made by you since you took over the account last summer.Southern Water says: “We are very sorry for the mix-up in meter readings and the distress the customer experienced trying to resolve the issue.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The MX Master 4 is the latest evolution in a line of pioneering mice that dates back more than 20 years and has long been the mouse to beat for everything but hardcore PC gaming. Having given it a magnetic free-spinning scroll wheel, plenty of buttons and precise tracking, now Logitech is trying something different for its seven-generation: the ability to tap back at you.This level of innovation doesn’t come cheap. The MX Master 4 costs £119.99 (€129.99/$119.99/A$199.95), placing it firmly in the premium market alongside high-end gaming mice and expensive peripherals aimed at creative professionals.The overall ergonomic shape of the mouse remains very similar to the previous outstanding versions from2019and 2022. It is finely balanced providing great grip, support to your palm and eight buttons all within easy reach – no stretching required – but it is only available for the right-hand.View image in fullscreenThe MX Master 4 is a mouse designed for comfortable use during long office hours.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianEverything about the mouse feels high quality and satisfying to use. After user feedback, the materials have since been updated to be harder wearing and easier to clean (no one likes a grubby mouse).The button clicks feel strong but are virtually silent, which will please those around you. The best-in-class MagSpeed scroll wheel uses magnets to create a silent ratchet for line-byline movement, but flick it hard enough and the magnets disengage to allow it to spin freely like a flywheel so you can effortlessly shoot through documents or pages.The thumb scroll wheel, back and forward buttons and the gesture button are better placed than previous iterations and are particularly useful for scrolling around in photography or design packages. Press the gesture button to switch between windows by default without having to reach for the keyboard.View image in fullscreenThe haptic button has the actions ring icon on it and forms part of the rubber grip for your thumb.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBelow this is the new haptic button. Press it to invokeLogitech’s “actions ring”, which is a circle of app-aware actions around your cursor you can quickly click without reaching for a menu or keyboard shortcut.The haptic feedback is a click or tap similar to a modern laptop trackpad or the little vibrations from virtual buttons on your phone, first when depressed and again when you mouse over an on-screen button. The ring is customisable and provides rapid access to useful tools, such as volume and playback control, screenshots or AI tools on the desktop or the crop tool, layers or colour picker in apps such as Adobe’s Photoshop, Lightroom or Premiere Pro.View image in fullscreenMouse clicks are virtually silent and the free-spinning scroll wheel is extremely simple and satisfying to use.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe haptics can also be used for certain actions outside of button presses. It can tap when your mouse moves from one display to another or gives feedback when you adjust sliders, snap to a grid or have finished exporting a clip in various Adobe apps.The feedback shows a lot of promise but it relies on plugins for individual apps to be installed from the Logi Marketplace, of which there are justseven availableat the moment, including for the Adobe creative suite or Zoom. If you use alternatives, such asthe Affinity suite by Canva, you are out of luck.SpecificationsDimension:128.2 x 88.4 x 50.8mmWeight:150gConnection:Bluetooth 5.1 or Logi Bolt USBBattery life:up to 70 daysNumber of buttons:eightSensor sensitivity:200-8,000 DPILogi Options+View image in fullscreenLogi Options+ allows you to customise almost everything about the operation of the mouse, and enables the advanced productivity features.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe mouse connects to any Bluetooth device, so can work with computers, tablets, phones and other devices, but it can also use the Logi Bolt USB-C dongle for computers, which provides a more secure connection. The mouse can remember three devices at once, switching between them via button on the underside – handy for use with different computers or tablets.It works on practically any surface, including glass, without the need for a mouse pad and the battery lasts about 70 days of typical use, charging via USB-C.In a first for the line, the mouse is designed to be disassembled with exposed screws and has a battery that can be replaced at home with instructions, meaning this could be the last mouse you ever need.The mouse’s basic functionality works without any additional software, but the actions ring, smart actions, AI, more advanced haptic feedback and many other productivity features require thefree Logi Options+ appfor macOS and Windows.The software offers a lot of customisation and optional tools, and can be safely left to run in the background most of the time, but was recently subjectto a complete failure. It has worked reliably with the MX Master 4, but occasionally has problems detecting other Logitech Bluetooth keyboards and is notorious for consuming computer resources unnecessarily.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenStandard exposed screws and disassembly manuals help make the MX Master 4 easy to repair.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe MX Master 4 is made from recycled plastic and cobalt. It can easily disassembled at home with standard exposed screws, includingreplacing the batterywhich costs£22.99.PriceThe Logitech MX Master 4 costs£119.99(€129.99/$119.99/A$199.95)For comparison, the MX Master 3S costs£89.99, Keychron M6 costs£54.99and the Razer Basilisk Mobile costs£89.99.VerdictThe MX Master 4 takes one of the best productivity mice, makes a bunch of refinements to make it even better, and adds the potentially gamechanging haptic feedback.Unfortunately, how much use you get out of the excellent haptic system relies entirely on plugins being available for the apps you use, which is great for the Adobe creative suite of apps, but not much more.The Master 4 is super comfortable to use for extended periods, is quiet and has all the right buttons in the right places, including its best-in-class scroll wheel. Having Bluetooth and the Logi Bolt dongle makes it easy to use with several devices. The collection of useful additional productivity tools via the Logi Options+ app can speed up your workflow no end with a bit of power-user configuration.It is an expensive, luxury mouse. But it is the best productivity mouse you can get and with a repairable design and a battery you can change at home, it may just be the last mouse you need.Pros:super comfortable, excellent design and button placement, best-in-class scroll wheel, quiet, innovative haptics have potential, plenty of customisation options, serious productivity tools including the actions ring and smart actionsCons:expensive, not many plugins available to support the haptics, Logi Options+ can be a resource hog, right-handed only.View image in fullscreenThe MX Master 4 is the best, most comfortable and luxury-feeling productivity mouse money can buy.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsGadgetsComputingreviewsShareReuse this content"

FromRihanna’s pregnancy revealtoKendrick Lamar’s show-stealing jeans, the 13-minute showcase has long doubled as a luxury fashion parade.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny and his dancers brought Puerto Rican imagery to the Super Bowl stage.Photograph: Kindell Buchanan/PAAnd few musicians are as plugged into that world as the Puerto Rican megastar.Bad Bunnyhas fronted underwear campaigns for Calvin Klein and Jacquemus, and on 1 February he attended the Grammys in a black velvet Schiaparelli suit sculpted into an hourglass with gold corsetry laced down the back.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny in Schiaparelli at the Grammys.Photograph: John Shearer/Getty Images for the Recording AcademyAsSpotify’s most-streamed artist of 2025, Bad Bunny is about as famous as a musician can be. But he is also one of the most visually astute performers. Just as this all-Spanish lyrics underlined the fact that English is no longer pop music’s lingua franca, his decision to wear high street at television’s most-watched event suggests couture is no longer pop’s default uniform either.With its affordable interpretations of catwalk trends,Zararemains the emblem of budget-friendly – albeit unsustainable–chic, sitting at the centre of the runway-to-high street pipeline. Almost anyone can wear Zara.Bad Bunny’s first look comprised a collared shirt and tie, cropped off-white trousers, Adidas Resilience trainers and a cropped padded American football jersey with the word Ocasio – part of his full name, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio – across the back.View image in fullscreenThe rapper and singer redefined Super Bowl style in a bespoke off-white Zara ensemble.Photograph: Kindell Buchanan/PAWorn at the start of his performance within a sugar cane field surrounded by dancers in the straw hats worn by jíbaros, Puerto Rico’s rural farmers (Benito also wore a jíbaro-style rope belt), the outfit initially sparked speculation about the number 64 emblazoned across the front. Online sleuths variously suggested it referred to the year of his mother’s birth and the US Congress that granted Puerto Ricans citizenship in 1917. According to Complex magazine, it was in fact his uncle’s football jersey number.It was not until he re-emerged midway through his 13-minute set for a duet with Lady Gaga, wearing a broad-shouldered off-white suit and tie, that Zara confirmed it was behind both looks. Styled by Storm Pablo and Marvin Douglas Linares, the outfits were bespoke; off the rack, a Zara suit would cost about £250.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny and Lady Gaga perform.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPAAndrew Groves, a professor of fashion design at the University of Westminster in London, UK, said: “The suit still reads as authority, but the authority comes from Bad Bunny’s cultural position, not from a luxury house’s stamp of approval.“Though Bad Bunny isn’t wearing a zoot suit [the wide style worn byyoung Black and Latino people in the 30s and 40s that became a symbol of rebellion against marginalisation] it uses the same proportional logic: exaggerated volume as a way for Black and Latino communities to claim public space when visibility was policed.“On a stadium stage it reads as controlled presence, not decoration. Zara on a Super Bowl stage is a statement about power-shifting.”The suit’s fluid cut even drew comparisons to Francisco Goya’s anti-war masterpiecethe Third of May 1808, which depicts a Spanish civilian wearing a billowing white shirt facing a French firing squad.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny blended high-street fashion with personal symbolism on the Super Bowl LX stage.Photograph: Dave Shopland/ShutterstockOther cultural references were more overt. Lady Gaga wore a custom blue pleated ruffle dress with aflor de maga(Puerto Rico’s national flower) brooch by Luar, the New York label led by the Dominican designer Raul Lopez, echoing the colours of the Puerto Rican flag. Within the set design’s pinkcasita, inspired by the island’s candy-coloured homes, dancers wore knitted outfits by the Puerto Rican designer Jomary Segarra’s brand Yo+.Super Bowl half-time shows have long been style spectacles, but they occasionally veer into politics. Beyoncé’s 2016 Formation performance,with its Black Panther references, made global headlines.After saying “ICE out” at the Grammys last week, there had been speculation that Bad Bunny could make another political statement. He did not wear an Ice Out pin. Instead, he wore something his fans could afford – paying homage to a pop culture that is increasingly multilingual, international and, at its heart, accessible.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnySuper BowlSuper Bowl LXNFLZaraPuerto RicofeaturesShareReuse this content"

While most of us know what to expect from a city break in, say, Paris, Lyon or Bordeaux, Metz throws up surprises at every turn.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The giant feline sculpture is the work of Italian visual artist Maurizio Cattelan (ofbanana-duct-taped-to-a-wall fame), whose works form part ofDimanche Sans Fin(Endless Sunday), an exhibition he has curated that brings together more than 400 works from Paris’s Centre Pompidou, which closed for a five-year renovation last October. Each piece depicts a different way the “day of rest” could be interpreted, whether it’s the innocent play of Picasso’s sculpture Little Girl Jumping Rope(1950-1954) or Max Ernst’s figure playing chess in the King Playing with the Queen (1944).View image in fullscreenIn a room dedicated to artists’ portraits of their mothers, Cattelan’s Shadow (2023) shows his mum hiding in a fridge (the thought of cooking a Sunday roast might drive many of us to take such action).I’m being shown around by Cattelan’s co-curator, Zoé Stillpass. “It was amazing to have all the pieces from the Paris Pompidou to play with,” she says. “The banana exhibit, which makes you question the idea of ‘the masterpiece’ and why we give value to something, has a room to itself here.”View image in fullscreenThe interior of Philippe Starck’s Maison Heler.Photograph: Julius HirtzbergerBut my jaw had dropped before I’d even set foot in the exhibition, when I set eyes on the Pompidou-Metz itself. It opened in 2010 and is an extraordinary feat of design.

The building fills a wide open space that was once occupied by a Roman amphitheatre.The station is more akin to a church than a transport hub, with a striking stained-glass window depicting King CharlemagneMetz was something of a playground for architecture long before the Pompidou arrived. Before I’d left the station, I’d had an introduction to the city’s Germanic Imperial Quarter. Built between 1905 and 1908 during Kaiser Wilhelm II’s occupation of Alsace-Lorraine, the station is more akin to a church than a transport hub, with a striking stained-glass window depicting Charlemagne, the eighth-century Frankish king, carved pillars, mosaics and a beautiful glass-roofed arcade. Outside is a stately water tower that once serviced the steam engines.Architects designed the Imperial Quarter to feel old, with winding streets, leafy squares and the stately Avenue Foch with its ornate mansions. Elsewhere, in Place Saint-Louis in the real old town, the stone arcades occupied by money-changers in the 14th century are now home to cafes and restaurants, with terraces sprawling into the square.View image in fullscreenMaison Heler, with Manfred’s house atop a nine-storey tower block.Photograph: Pierre Defontaine/Grand Est tourismRenaissance architecture also gets a look in with the Maison des Têtes on En Fournirue, which dates from 1529 and has five detailed busts above its leaded windows. All these attractions are easily reached on the free electricshuttle busthat loops round the city centre.Later, asolar-powered boat tripalong the River Moselle gives a view of the city’s monuments from the water, including a Japanese Torii gate and Protestant church the Temple Neuf, with its steel-grey roof tiles shimmering in the sun.The sight of Metz’s new design hotel soaring into the sky makes me feel like I’ve shrunkThe city’s most imposing monument is theCathédral Saint-Étienne. Built in yellow Jaumont limestone, it dates from the 13th century, but some of its most striking features are much more modern. Among its 6,500 sq metres of stained-glass windows – one of the world’s largest expanses – are works from the 1960s by Marc Chagall. Vivienne Rudd from the city’s tourist office is showing me around. She explains how Chagall tells the story of Adam and Eve in his intricate design, with its abstract lines and ethereal figures: “You can see how Eve is in front of the tree of knowledge, holding a snake, and you can see Adam’s face hiding in the blue panes.” In the windows in the north transept, she shows me where to spot Jesus’s head and his crown of thorns. It takes some concentrating, but then I spy it.“If you can’t see it, you have to go and drink a shot of mirabelle eau-de-vie [the local plum-based spirit] and then come back and look,” she laughs.Even without drinking Alice’s elixir, the sight of Metz’s new design hotel soaring into the sky makes me feel like I’ve shrunk. Celebrated Parisian designer Philippe Starck’sMaison Helertook 10 years to complete but finally opened last March, just a few minutes’ walk from the Pompidou-Metz. Its design is extraordinary: a turreted mansion house atop a rather nondescript nine-floor tower block.View image in fullscreenFelix, a six-metre sculpture by Maurizio Cattelan at the Centre Pompidou-Metz.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Verhaegen/AFP/Getty ImagesIts backstory is equally fantastical. Starck devised a novella, titled The Meticulous Life of Manfred Heler, in which the house, belonging to the eponymous main character, a lonely postwar inventor, is dramatically pushed upwards during an earthquake – hence the house on top of the tower block. The story also involves his love interest, a milkmaid named Rose, whose part in the story inspired the gentle pink decor of the bistro restaurant on the ground floor.Bedrooms and corridors have an industrial vibe, with neutral tones and concrete walls, and Manfred’s bizarre scientific experiments are depicted in black-and-white photos. Light and colour come from the stained-glass windows – the work of the designer’s daughter, Ara Starck – which cast a beautiful glow across the wood-panelled restaurant and cocktail bar, set in Manfred’s house at the top.As carefully designed as it is, it’s also affordable, and the food in both restaurants (mains from €23) is excellent. I tuck into white asparagus with hollandaise and cod with a light pea broth and saffron beurre blanc. When I try to read the novella, though, to get a better understanding, it proves utterly baffling – in keeping, perhaps, with this wonderfully curious city.The trip was provided by Tourism Metz and theMaison Heler(doubles from€106 room-only).Dimanche Sans Finruns until25 Jan 2027at Centre Pompidou-MetzExplore more on these topicsFrance holidaysCity breaksCultural tripsEurope holidaysShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thanks to a loan set up by his athletics club, he doesn’t have to pay 5,000 ariary a day to rent his vehicle, which most drivers doMembers of an athletics club in Madagascar formed by rickshaw drivers are now beating elite athletes in international endurance eventsByRomain PhilipponSupported byAbout this contentMon 9 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 14.59 ESTShareIt is a fiercely competitive market, and one of the toughest physical jobs in Madagascar’s Antsirabe, but over the past five years cycle rickshaw driver Haja Nirina has honed his athletic prowess alongside his business.In this city, about 100 miles (160km) south of the capital, Antananarivo, there are more than 4,000 rickshaws for a population of 265,000, the cheapest transport available for people and goods. Some are pulled by cycles, others by hand. Each day, Nirina makes between 10 and 15 trips, making 10,000 to 15,000 ariary (£1.70 to £2.60). Unlike 99% of drivers, Nirina doesn’t lose 5,000 ariary of his income paying a daily rental fee for the rickshaw. For the past three years, he has owned his, thanks to a programme run by his local athletic club.Crown Athletics Club has its roots in Antsirabe’s first rickshaw race in 1997, when Tsiry Rakotomalala organised prizes of rice, chickens and other food items.View image in fullscreenThe chaotic streets of Antsirabe, where the rickshaw drivers vie for tradeView image in fullscreenJean-Claude Rakotonirina, known as Diry, 33, who pulls his rickshaw by hand, is one of Crown Athletics’ rising stars. In the job for 10 years, he runs 20-25km every day around Antsirabe, mostly transporting goodsThe race was so popular that afterwards Rakotomalala recruited about 10 of the drivers to launch Crown, the city’s first athletics club, which gained new momentum with the arrival of Yann Mayette as president in 2017. Convinced that Madagascar’s athletes had the potential to compete internationally, Mayette encouraged the runners by offering a microcredit plan through the club, enabling them to buy their rickshaw cycles.These guys could probably achieve results that would quickly propel them to the professional levelYann Mayette, club presidentAs a result, Nirina has only 500 ariary in expenses to pay for the overnight and Sunday storage of his bicycle, meaning he can focus more on his training and races.Mayette, who moved to the city from France 10 years ago, has motivated the athletes to participate in competitions locally, some of which he organises himself around Antsirabe. Mayette remembers with a smile an “expedition” to the capital: “Any trip, even 150km, can feel like a real expedition here!” The Crown runners swept the board that day, returning with handfuls of medals and trophies. “On the way back, one of the athletes suggested selling the trophies, as they didn’t know what to do with them, and a few ariary would certainly be more worthwhile than all that metal,” he says.But like his fellow rickshaw runner Diry, Nirina has kept his trophies; at his modest brick and mud home, the table is covered with cups and medals. “I don’t run for the money; anyway, in Madagascar, nobody can make a living from sports. I run because I love it.”View image in fullscreenThe Crown club’s runners meet twice a week for trainingView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFrom left: Haja Nirina stretches after his run home from the city; Tsiry Rakotomalala, the club’s founder, was formerly a coach of Madagascar’s London and Tokyo Olympics teams. Despite his athletes’ impressive results, he is disillusioned by the lack of interest shown by the authoritiesNirina’s home, surrounded by paddy fields, is about 10km from the centre of Antsirabe. Every day, morning and evening, he runs the route, sometimes adding an uphill detour by way of Mount Ivohitra to his workout. “Every day, I ride about 60km on my cycle rickshaw,” he says during a coffee break in one of the city’s many dusty outlets.Beating the odds: three Olympic sportswomen on overcoming poverty, mockery – and small swimming poolsRead moreOn Sundays, his day off, he trains with the club. This week, Rakotomalala has them run eight 3km segments along the main road. “It’s simpler, because there are kilometre markers to calculate our distances,” the coach says.The athletes’ equipment remains woefully inadequate, there are no high-performance watches to measure distances, or even new trainers – the club president collects used running shoes from donors in France. “People sometimes send us things that are only fit for landfill, thinking they’ll be useful to us. But even though you still see many rickshaw drivers barefoot in Madagascar, how can you even consider participating in an international race with shoes full of holes?” says Mayette.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFrom left: Yann Mayette offers Nirina a pair of secondhand shoes. All of the club’s equipment comes from donations; despite the limited space in his house, Diry reserves a special place for his athletics trophiesAnd that is his goal: for his runners to compete outside Madagascar and test themselves against professional athletes. Last year, he managed to register Nirina and Mamie Andrianirina – a runner from Antananarivo – for the Mascareignes, one of the races in the celebratedGrand Raid, an ultra-trail event on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion. Speaking at the time, he was worried: “The problem is, we’re never sure we’ll be able to go. Getting visas is complicated.”But in October, thanks to the help of friends, Nirina was at the Mascareignes starting line with more than 1,400 participants from all over the world. In 8 hours, 46 minutes, and 7 seconds, he finished second, three minutes behind the winner and just ahead of his compatriot Andrianirina, who was third.“It was incredible,” says Mayette. “They were the ones everyone made fun of when we started racing, who were always reminded of their status as rickshaw drivers. Today, they’re proving they’re among the best athletes in Madagascar.”View image in fullscreenMany rickshaw pullers still work barefoot. The hand-rickshaw puller is at the bottom of the social ladder in Madagascar. Originally, it was a job for peasants who had moved to the cityNirina returned home with a €350 (£300) bonus – his offer to donate it to the club was refused. “These guys could probably achieve results that would quickly propel them to the professional level,” says Mayette.“But today, the world of trail running has become demanding. Results hinge on details: nutrition, equipment, training.” Will a sponsor be interested in the remarkable story of this small club from Antsirabe? “It’s not a big budget, but for the moment, my wife and I are financing all the club’s expenses. When we leave Antsirabe, I don’t know what will happen.”View image in fullscreenRickshaw driver Nirina on his daily run to workExplore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayUltrarunningRunningMadagascarAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The crowd roared. For a second, she was completely airborne, before landing on her opponents.“‘Wow, I’m doing this,’” she thought. “Exhilarating. I couldn’t think of anything I’d rather be doing on my birthday.” She had seized her moment in an Alpha Pro battle royal, a multi-competitor elimination match. As her opponents – all men – threw her out of the ring, they wished her a happy birthday.Goldner, who lives in Melbourne, Australia, has been a lifelong fan of wrestling. As a child, she watched it on TV and at the city’s Festival Hall. “I was always fascinated by it,” she says. She remembers exactly where she sat in the arena to watch Harley Race and Ron Miller do battle in 1977.Back home, she would shift the coffee table and roll around the lounge floor or bounce off the couches – the seat, arms and back were “three turnbuckles in each corner”.But something about wrestling felt off. “Most of the representation seemed to be burly cisgender men … A lot of the storylines reflected queerphobia,” she says. “While I was aware of something about myself, I didn’t know I was trans, or understand what that meant.”At her all-boys school, Goldner hated sport, and was bullied. Her grades deteriorated. She had to focus on her studies, and even give up music, which she loved, handing back her beloved violin in tears to the music teacher. Fifty years on, it remains a painful memory.After school, she followed her parents’ advice and majored in accountancy. She worked through her 20s: it was easy but soul-destroying. “You’re like an engine that’s using 5% of its capacity,” a careers adviser told her. It was the trigger, along with listening to kd lang’s 1992 album Ingenue, “to question lots of things I’d taken for granted”.Since the age of nine, Goldner had held a picture in her head “of looking like a woman”. A friend helped her to find a knowledgable psychologist – where, aged 29, she heard, for the first time, the word “transgender”.“I said to myself, ‘Well, I’ve gone a long way down, unknowingly going against myself. I wonder what would happen if I went with myself?”She joined trans groups, and initially didn’t think about permanently identifying as a woman. “It sort of crept up,” she says. In her mid-30s, she foundedTransgenderVictoria, a community organisation working to achieve better social, economic and health outcomes for trans people. Goldner put “heart and soul” into the job, but it wore her down. She stepped back from management and left her role at TV in 2019.The lack of a meaningful outlet left her feeling stifled. Over the years, she had “tried drag queen and drag king, standup comedy, acting”. A creative voice had tried to find its way out ever since she’d handed back her violin decades earlier. Now she dreamed of being a wrestling announcer or commentator. Sometimes, she spontaneously commentated from the crowd, and people loved it.In 2023, when she was 57, she signed up for training at Melbourne’s Relentless School of ProWrestling. First she had to learn how to get in and out of the ring “without looking like a doofus”, then how to do forward and backward rolls. “It was the best I had ever felt in my body.”View image in fullscreenSally Goldner performs her first missile dropkick off the top rope.Photograph: Courtesy of Sally GoldnerOver the following days, her inner critics harangued her. “‘You’re too old, not fit enough, not strong enough,’” she says. “But my heart kept saying, ‘You want to do this.’”Goldner’s 60th year has been transformative. She has been diagnosed with ADHD and autism; “just like when I found out about being trans, my mind became more settled”.She regularly contributes as a ring announcer and commentator, and, six months ago, she made her in-ring debut under the wrestling name Zali Gold; three syllables make better chants.Many pro wrestling organisations in Australia run mixed wrestling events. Goldner competes in battle royals, with and against men and women. The matches are scripted and agreed with participants in advance.Since performing the missile dropkick off the top rail, Goldner is building her move set, and plans to make her singles or tag debut.Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsWrestlingA new start after 60TransgenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hair grows from follicles – tiny structures in the scalp sitting 2-4mm beneath the skin. Inside each follicle, the hair fibre is formed long before it becomes visible at the surface of the scalp. By the time it emerges, the hair that you’re cutting is dead, hardened tissue.“Cutting what’s above the surface has no effect on what’s happening in the follicle below,” says Tobin.Hair growth happens at a rate of around 1cm a month during a growth phase that lasts several years, before the hair is shed and the cycle begins again. That rate is determined by genetics and can’t be sped up with scissors.What does change is how long hair appears to grow. Heat styling and aggressive chemical treatments can damage the outer shaft, making it brittle and prone to splitting. When hair breaks faster than it grows, it never seems to get any longer.Is it true that … you lose most body heat from your head?Read moreSo where does the myth come from? Think of trimming an unruly hedge, Tobin says. “When you give it a good clip into shape, it can give the impression of being denser. You haven’t changed what’s happening in its deeper branches – you’ve just tightened up the overall appearance.”Hair behaves in much the same way. Individual strands taper as they get further from the scalp, so cutting them shorter makes them feel thicker. Removing frayed, weathered ends can also make hair look fuller and healthier.If you’re trying to grow your hair, Tobin says, the priority isn’t frequent trims but minimising damage. “The advice would be to maintain the hair fibre in a virgin state with the least aggressive chemical or thermal exposure.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …Women's hairMen's hairfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Only two survivors were rescued.The International Organization forMigrationsaid the boat overturned north of Zuwara on Friday, in the latest disaster involving people attempting the perilous Mediterranean crossing in the hope of reaching Europe.In a statement, the IOM said: “Only two Nigerian women were rescued during a search and rescue operation by Libyan authorities.” It added that one of the survivors said she lost her husband and the other said she lost her two babies in the tragedy.The agency said its teams provided the survivors with emergency medical care upon disembarkation. “According to survivor accounts, the boat – carrying migrants and refugees of African nationalities departed from Al-Zawiya, Libya, at around 11pm on February 5. Approximately six hours later, it capsized after taking on water,. IOM mourns the loss of life in yet another deadly incident along the Central Mediterranean route.”The Geneva-based agency said trafficking and smuggling networks were exploiting migrants along the route from north Africa to southern Europe, profiting from dangerous crossings in unseaworthy boats while exposing people to “severe abuse”.It called for stronger international cooperation to tackle the networks alongside safe and regular migration pathways to reduce risks and save lives. The IOM fears that hundreds of people have died since the start of the year attempting to cross the Mediterranean amid harsh weather conditions on the dangerous crossing.A spokesperson for the European Commission said Brussels was trying to address the root causes of irregular migration and promote legal, safe and orderly pathways to the European Union. “These tragic events once again underline the need to intensify joint efforts with our partners, including Libya, to prevent such dangerous journeys and to combat the criminal networks of migrant smugglers that put lives at risk,” they told Agence France-Presse.Between the start of 2014 and the end of 2025, more than 33,000 migrants died or went missing in the Mediterranean, according to the IOM’s Missing Migrants Project.Last year, it recorded 1,873 missing or dead in the Mediterranean, including 1,342 on the central route.Explore more on these topicsMigrationLibyaAfricaRefugeesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A colossus of African music. Ebo Taylor passed away yesterday; a day after the launch of Ebo Taylor music festival and exactly a month after his 90th birthday, leaving behind an unmatched artistry legacy. Dad, your light will never fade.”A spokesperson for the Ghanaian president told the BBC’s Newsday programme that Taylor would “be remembered as one of our greatest musicians ever ... a man who strove to put Ghanaian music on the global map at a time when other genres of music were prominent”.A recent interview on the music website Passion of the Weisshailed Taylor as“the greatest rhythm guitarist in history … with complete originality, he incorporated the diverse rhythmic traditions of the Ga, Ewe, Dagomba and his own Akan people into his compositions.”Taylor was born Deroy Taylor on Ghana’s Cape Coast on 6 January 1936. He started playing piano at the age of six, his tastes shaped by American and English music, in part as a result of Ghana being a British colony at the time.Growing up during the blossoming of highlife, he switched to guitar while he was at college, and subsequently joined the Stargazers – whose members Teddy Osei and Sol Amarfio would later form the UK-based Afro-rock bandOsibisa– and a succession of other bands. He became known for his rare embrace of both highlife – largely played in a major mode – and Afrobeat, which hews to minor modes.View image in fullscreenTaylor at the 2011 Womad festival.Photograph: C Brandon/RedfernsAt the Eric Gilder School of Music in London in the early 1960s, Taylor studied Dvořák and cited the complexity of the Czech composer’s music as an influence on his own. But he also said that he learned more outside of the classroom, by sitting in with bands and attending jazz and highlife jams, and meeting acts including the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.At the time, Nigerian musicianFela Kutiwas studying at Trinity College in the capital. The pair became friends, bonding over a common interest in highlife and often jamming together. “We also had the desire to become a Miles Davis, a Charlie Christian, or a Kenny Burrell,”Taylor told Post Genre in 2025. “So we had the same mood … He was such a playful and lively person.”The two musicians became genre innovators. In 2014, Taylortold the BBCthat “with the advent of James Brown and funk music there was the opportunity to develop highlife music. Fela did a lot of work introducing the funk into the Yoruba music while comparatively I did almost the same thing in Ghana.”Taylor credited Kuti with encouraging him to write distinctly African music, and he combined the influence of Dvořák and Davis with a strong sense of his own musical traditions, both from Ghana and his Malian grandmother. “I do believe that it is important for music to progress, otherwise it just becomes something for museums, but you have to know your traditional culture before you start addings things to it,”he told the Vinyl Factory in 2018.After forming the Black Star Highlife Band in London in 1964, he returned to his home country a year later, and formed bands including the New Broadway Dance Band and the Blue Monks, which both featured, for a time, fellow Ghanaian musician Pat Thomas – now a member ofأحمد [Ahmed].View image in fullscreenTaylor performing in Spain in 2012.Photograph: Esteban Martinena Guerrero/EPA/ShutterstockIn the early 70s, Taylor worked as in-house guitarist, arranger and producer at the Essiebons label, run by Dick Essilfie-Bondzie, a former government worker turned music impresario who released what a 2021 reissue called “the best in modern highlife”. Taylor recorded several of his own albums for the label and worked on records by artists such as Thomas and Gyedu-Blay Ambolley.In the 80s, Taylor stepped back from fronting his own bands to work on other artists’ records. In the 2000s, he taught music at the University of Ghana.His first internationally released album, Love and Death, came out in 2010. Taylor’s music had become more widely disseminated thanks to increased international interest in highlife, which was the subject of many reissue records and compilations. His songs were also sampled by artists including Usher, the Black Eyed Peas, Kelly Rowland, Jidenna and Vic Mensa. Love and Death prompted a renewed run of activity for Taylor, which included the albums Appia Kwa Bridge (2012) and Yen Ara (2018), and international touring.In 2018, Taylor had a stroke that impaired his ability to speak English. For the 2025 album Ebo Taylor JID022, a collaboration with Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Adrian Younge’s Jazz Is Dead project, his son Henry facilitated communication between the three musicians – and played guitar on the project himself. Taylor also often played with his son Roy. It is unclear how many children Taylor had; his eldest son Ebo Taylor Jr died in 2022.At the age of 90, Taylor was no longer able to play guitar. He lived much of his life, including his later years, in the small coastal city of Saltpond, where he was known locally as Uncle Ebo. He received several lifetime achievement awards from organisations representing Ghanaian and highlife music.The contemporary singer and rapper Black Sherif paid tribute to Taylor: “We lost a legend whose contribution to music has created worldwide ripples. I take solace in the fact that I witnessed greatness in Uncle Ebo Taylor’s art form. Rest In Power!”Explore more on these topicsMusicGhanaFela KutiAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Storm Marta passed over the Iberian peninsula on Saturday, bringing fresh torrential rain and killing two people. Storm Kristin killed at least five people after it made landfall on 28 January withStorm Leonardo claiming another victim last Wednesday.The outlook for this week is for more rain across Spain,Portugaland France, especially across north-west Portugal, where more than 100mm is possible during the first half of the week. Some of the heaviest of the rain will transfer to southern Italy and western parts of Greece and Turkey later in the week.High rainfall totals are also expected across parts ofSouth Africaand Lesotho this week. By Saturday, provinces including the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape in South Africa could record fairly widespread rainfall totals of 80-100mm as a result of heavy showers or thunderstorms, with daily rainfall totals perhaps reaching 50mm where storms are particularly intense.Already, the South African Weather Service has issued warnings and advisories for severe thunderstorms through the first half of this week with a risk of excessive lightning, gusty winds, and hail. As a result, flooding, mudslides, and infrastructure damage is expected, potentially affecting more than 10 million people.Japan and Korea continued to be gripped by cold weather last week as temperatures remained below average, reaching a peak over the weekend. Temperatures in Tokyo fell to almost 10C below average on Sunday as temperatures struggled to rise above zero, with snow falling too.Tokyo sits on a similar latitude to the most northern parts of Africa and Athens, but despite this, snow is not unheard of, occurring on average about once or twice a year. This is due to Japan being positioned between a cold northerly flow from continental eastern Asia, as well as a supply of moisture from both the Sea of Japan to the north and the Philippine Sea to the south.Western areas of Japan tend to see the most significant snowfall, as was the case this time with the Hokuriku region seeing more than 50cm in 24 hours. Temperatures are expected to quickly rise through later this week, reaching the mid to high teens in Tokyo by the weekend.Explore more on these topicsFloodingWeather trackerExtreme weatherSpainPortugalSouth AfricaAfricaJapananalysisShareReuse this content"

Cuba’s beaches are a major holiday draw for Canadian tourists in winter, and one of the government’s most important sources of hard currency.Other airlines from as far away as Russia, China, Turkey, France and Spain have also been affected. The crisis has erupted at speed because of Washington’s policy of forcing Cuba’s government to the negotiation table, with prominent figures in Donald Trump’s administration calling for regime change.Cuba on the brink as Trump turns up the pressure: ‘There is going to be a real blockade’Read moreThe US hasthreatened any country that sends oil to Cuba with increased tariffs, claiming the island’s government is a threat to US national security. On Monday, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, lashed out at what she described as a “very unjust” US policy.“You can’t strangle a nation in this way,” she said. Mexico dispatched 800 tons of humanitarian aid to the beleaguered island nation on Sunday, and Sheinbaum said Mexico was taking “all necessary diplomatic actions” to be able to send oil to the island – although she did not offer details on how that might happen.The scope of Cuba’s fuel crisis emerged late on Sunday when airlines were informed by a Notice to Aviation (NOTAM) warning that supplies would remain restricted until at least 11 March. The announcement came only two days after Cuba’s authorities had told the population international flights would be maintained.Immediately after the NOTAM landed, Cuba-bound holidaymakers in Moscow complained of being disembarked and offered the alternative destinations of China, Egypt or Turkey. Cuba had been one of the few warm destinations Russian state employees could holiday in, due to Moscow’s wartime security restrictions.Aeroflot said its subsidiary airline Rossiya would continue operating flights to Cuba, though routes may be adjusted to allow for refuelling. Where that would be, given the already 12 hour plus flight, remains unclear. Russia’s tourism board said about 4,500 of their tourists are now in Cuba, many of them state employees.Yekaterina Gulbina, a tour guide in Cuba, told the Guardian the overall situation was “generally manageable” and that tourists remained in good spirits. “For tourists in hotels, everything is still available, electricity, generators and taxis with fuel,” she said.European airlines have previous experience of this situation, and have been adapting. A similar crisis last year, of Cuba’s own making, saw airlines stopping to refuel in the Bahamas, Mexico and other nearby countries. Air Europa, which flies from Madrid, has already said it would stop for fuel in the Dominican Republic.Other major airlines serving the island plan to continue flying. “Despite this situation, which is beyond our control, we expect to operate our flights as scheduled by implementing contingency measures, such as a technical stop when necessary,” said a spokesperson for the Canadian company Air Transat.The aviation fuel crisis is the first obvious effect of the US oil blockade, and will affect one of Cuba’s largest sources of foreign exchange. At its height, Cuba was earning over $3bn annually from tourism, but that figure is now believed to have crashed below $1bn.Cuba had already been consolidating tourists into fewer hotels. Vicky Volonik and Mark Harrington, two Canadians who arrived in Cuba last week, told a Canadian news channel that they were being transferred to another hotel. “They’re trying to conserve energy by grouping everybody in the same hotel,” Volonik said. “People are very upset because all the workers here just pretty much lost their job and their livelihood … We’re more concerned about the people here. We’ll be looked after.”Johnny Considine, of the travel agency Cuba Private Travel, said that clients already on the island were unaffected. “They think it’s a little bit quiet,” he said. “But they’re having a very good time. Regarding clients who are coming in the near future, we are obviously contacting all of them. They can read the news for themselves and obviously make up their own minds whether they want to come or postpone.”Until now, the US’s increasingly aggressive stance had felt relatively distant on the island, with Cubans more preoccupied with trying to survive in a perpetual state of economic crisis. But on Monday, gas stations across the country were closed, and there were far fewer cars on the road.Cubans with cars have been told that finding fuel will require downloading an app and joining an online queue. On WhatsApp groups dedicated to the crisis, people were complaining the system was almost impossible to work. Cubans without transport try to flag down what drivers there are from the side of the roads.One British holidaying couple, in the southern tourist town of Trinidad, were furious about the situation. “Cuba is the most beautiful place,” the wife said. “I absolutely love it here and will come back with my kids one day when I hope the resilience of the Cuban people has once again triumphed over the economic terrorism of the USA.” They preferred not to give their names.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAir transportAmericasCubaTrump administrationOilnewsShareReuse this content"

Such scenes of political defiance would have been unimaginable until just a few weeks ago, before Maduro’s capture turned Venezuelan politics on their head.“We are going to build a Venezuela of democracy, of freedom, of justice, of pluralism and coexistence,”the 61-year-old former governor told reportersoutside the detention centre, adding that he believed Venezuela had “completely changed”.But Guanipa’s freedom was short-lived: just hours later he appeared to have been taken back into custody after being stopped by unidentified armed men.“I want to let the whole world know that my father has once again been kidnapped,” his son, Ramón, announced in a social media video, claiming that he had been captured about 11.45pm on Sunday. “I will hold the regime responsible for anything that happens to my dad,” the 29-year-old added, demanding proof of life.“Heavily armed men, dressed in civilian clothes, arrived in four vehicles and violently took him away,” Machado claimed on X. “We demand his immediate release.”On Monday, Venezuela’s top prosecutor announced that his office had requested Guanipa’s re-arrest “due to his non-compliance with … the terms [of his release]”.It did not say what those conditions were but some released political prisoners have been barred from travelling outside the country or speaking to the press.Human rights activists say about 425 political prisoners have been released in Venezuela since Donald Trump ordered the controversialabduction of Maduroin the early hours of 3 January.Maduro’s successor Delcy Rodríguez, the former vice-president, usedher first major speechto declare a “new chapter” in the oil-rich country, although made no mention of holding fresh presidential elections in Maduro’s absence.Rodríguez’s regime has moved to pass a new amnesty law, seemingly designed to benefit both the victims of Maduro’s dictatorship and some of those responsible for the repression.Observers warn that despite the regime’s recent concessions, they have yet to see any real indication that it is prepared to dismantle the security forces and paramilitary groups responsible for propping up years of authoritarian rule.Orlando Pérez, a Latin America expert from the University of North Texas at Dallas, said Guanipa’s re-arrest suggested “a push and pull” was playing out between different factions of Venezuela’s new leadership.Pérez believed Rodríguez and her brother, the powerful national assembly president, Jorge Rodríguez, appeared to favour making some concessions in order to speed up engagement with the United States and the transition to a new form of government, even if it was only a “competitive authoritarian” one.“But there are clearly forces that want to slow it down,” added Pérez, pointing to the feared interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, and the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López.“It’s an indication that we really are in a very slow process that can easily be reversed,” Pérez said.Guanipa was seized in May last year by “anti-subversion” agents and held in a Caracas prison on charges of terrorism, treason and conspiring with a foreign government. During more than eight months behind bars he saw his son only once. At the time, the opposition politician’s capture was celebrated by Cabello, who many suspect was behind his re-arrest on Sunday.On Monday afternoon Cabello told reporters Guanipa’s detention was a sign that Venezuelan justice was working.“They thought they could do whatever they felt like and cause a commotion,” he said, in apparent reference to Guanipa’s comments outside El Helicoide.Speaking in Washington, Machado called Guanipa’s arrest a “reaction” from part of the “tyranny” that continued to rule Venezuela, despite Maduro’s exit.“What’s happening in Venezuela is a demonstration that we aren’t just facing a criminal regime but also a regime that is terrified of the truth and terrified of its citizens,” she told reporters.At a press conference on Monday, Ramón Guanipa called for the immediate release of his father and the hundreds of other political prisoners still thought to be behind bars. “This must end – and it must end now,” he said.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaMaría Corina MachadoAmericasNicolás MaduroDelcy RodrígueznewsShareReuse this content"

In a contract between the company and the ministry of public security, shared with the Guardian, Faber-Castell specified that the premises would be used as a shelter to offer refuge and humanitarian assistance for people migrating through the region.However, last year it appears conditions at the facility changed and people were locked up, with Faber-Castell unaware of this until contacted by the Guardian last month.The German pencil maker’s donation of the buildings in 2018 was in response to an increase in Nicaraguans fleeing across the border to Costa Rica amid a violent crackdown on protesters by Nicaragua’s government.The company said in the contract that the property was to be used to “house a shelter for the care of migrants … without the possibility of changing the purpose of the property”.There are no reports that Nicaraguans or others accommodated at the disused factory were kept in detention – until Costa Rica accepted 200 deportees from the US and locked them up at the former factory, since named Centro de Atención Temporal para Migrantes, or Catem.When the Guardian approached Faber-Castell for comment, the company said it had not realized anyone had been detained at Catem.“We agreed and stipulated in the contract that the building was to be transformed into a humanitarian refugee center, and under no circumstances was it agreed to be used as a prison,” representatives of Faber-Castell’s large subsidiary in Brazil said in a statement.Costa Rica had agreed to receive the 200 people deported from the US in late February 2025 after Donald Trump returned to the White House and began his promisedanti-immigration crackdown.The deportees were not Costa Rican, they had migrated to the US from as far afieldas Russiaand parts of Asia and Africa but found themselves deported and flown in chains to the Central American country, despite not being criminals. Upon arrival they were escorted to Catem, in Puntarenas, six hours south of the capital, San José.The people, including more than 70 children, were detained there for at least two months. Amid legal challenges, Costa Rica’s constitutional branch of the supreme courtlater ruledthey were “deprived of their right to liberty”. The Costa Rican ministry of public security told the Guardian it “categorically” denied this.Faber-Castell emailed a statement to the Guardian: “We are deeply concerned that people are reportedly being detained on our former factory site of ‘Maderin Eco’ in Costa Rica, an operation which we closed in 2013. We were not aware of this misuse until we were contacted by the Guardian.” Maderin Eco refers to the subsidiary of Faber-Castell thathad operatedin Costa Rica.View image in fullscreenAerial view of the Temporary Care Center for Migrants (Catem) in Puntarenas, Costa Rica, on 23 March 2025.Photograph: Armando Acevedo/AFP/Getty ImagesHuman Rights Watch (HRW), the New York-based watchdog group, visited the facility last spring and interviewed some of the deportees. HRWconcludedin a subsequent report that migrants were held at the center for months, despite the facility being “clearly intended for stays of just a few days” and that there was “no legal basis for their detention”.The report also acknowledged that “the Costa Rican government denies that they were in detention”.Asked for comment last week, the ministry of public security said in an emailed statement: “The migrants deported by the United States were of nationalities that require visas to enter Costa Rica. Due to human rights considerations, they were granted entry into the country without this requirement and were therefore transferred to CATEM, as their stay was temporary and humanitarian.”It added: “The immigration measures taken were based on the same humanitarian grounds, as it is well known that vulnerable individuals are susceptible to migrant smuggling and human trafficking networks. Costa Rica is an unfamiliar destination for them, with a new climate, cuisine, and other aspects. The General Directorate of Migration and Foreign Affairs has always sought to protect these individuals. Therefore, we categorically reject the claim of a violation of their right to freedom.”However, in December 2025,the Guardian spoke with Alexander, a 37-year-old Russian man who asked to use a pseudonym for his family’s safety because he said they had fled threats from the Putin regime. He, his wife and their young son ended up in Catem after Trump canceled their US asylum appointment at the last minute and then deported them to Costa Rica.“In the first weeks I lost 15 kilos and my family was sick, so I started asking questions like ‘why didn’t we have freedom?’,” Alexander said.“We were detained there without our passports. Some people wanted to leave and they didn’t allow us to leave. And after this, we understood that they put us into this prison without any reason.”Last June, the courtruledof thedeportees locked upin the Catem shelter that their “detention in a center not intended for these purposes, combined with an unlawful deprivation of liberty by immigration authorities, in addition to the lack of access to information and legal assistance, constitutes a violation of fundamental human rights”.The court’sdecision addedthat the “arbitrary deprivation of liberty of the individuals…without access to information, without judicial oversight…creates a risk of enforced disappearance”.It also ruled that Alexander and the other deportees from the USshould beentitled to compensation.The Catem facility has capacity for 300 people. In 2026 so far, 60 people have been accommodated there. The last data the Guardian received from the Costa Rican government, on 28 January, showed that there were no migrants at the site then.Faber-Castell did not answer questions about whether it intended to take any further action.Explore more on these topicsCosta RicaTrump administrationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He had pleaded not guilty to all charges. The collusion convictions carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.The judges in Lai’s case described him as the “mastermind” behind the conspiracies. They granted him minor deductions on his sentences on health grounds.View image in fullscreenA prison van believed to be carrying Jimmy Lai leaves the court building in West Kowloon, Hong Kong, on Monday.Photograph: Tyrone Siu/ReutersLai’s 20-year term is the harshest penalty handed down for national security offences in Hong Kong. The sentence was condemned immediately by Taiwan, as well as press freedom and human rights groups.The rise and fall of Jimmy Lai, whose trajectory mirrored that of Hong Kong itselfRead moreReporters Without Borders said: “Today, the curtain falls on press freedom in Hong Kong … This court decision underscores the complete collapse of press freedom in Hong Kong and the authorities’ profound contempt for independent journalism.”Human Rights Watch said the length of jail time given to Lai was “effectively a death sentence”. “A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust. Lai’s years of persecution show the Chinese government’s determination to crush independent journalism and silence anyone who dares to criticise the Communist party,” it said.Amnesty International called the case “another grim milestone in Hong Kong’s transformation from a city governed by the rule of law to one ruled by fear”.Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, said on Monday the sentencing of Lai was “deeply gratifying”. “Jimmy Lai’s crimes are heinous and evil in the extreme. His heavy sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment demonstrates the rule of law, upholds justice and is deeply gratifying,” he said.View image in fullscreenMembers of the media outside the court in Hong Kong on Monday.Photograph: May James/EPASteve Li, the chief superintendent of the police national security department, said the sentence was “appropriate” and alleged that claims about Lai’s frail health were exaggerated. Beijing’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Lin Jian, said the sentence was “legitimate” and “reasonable”.Lai’s prosecution has been described as politically motivated by human rights groups and the British government, which has called for his release. The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “For the 78-year-old, this is tantamount to a life sentence,” as she called for Lai to be released from his “appalling ordeal” on humanitarian grounds.“The prime minister raised Mr Lai’s case directly with President Xi during his visit. That has opened up discussion of our most acute concerns directly with the Chinese government, at the highest levels,” said Cooper. “Following today’s sentencing we will rapidly engage further on Mr Lai’s case.”Lai is the founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily, apopular Hong Kong newspaperthat supported the pro-democracy movement that swelled in the city in the 2010s. The movement was crushed in June 2020 by the imposition of a harsh national security law that criminalised most forms of dissent. The authorities said the law was necessary to restore stability to the city. Lai was arrested and charged under that law in August that year. Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021.Keir Starmer said that heraised Lai’s casewhen he met China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in Beijing in January. But it is not clear what, if any, progress the UK has made towards securing Lai’s release. Sebastien Laisaid recentlythat the British government had not done enough for his father and that “time is running out”.View image in fullscreenSebastien Lai at a media briefing in December.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianDonald Trump also said he wanted to secure Lai’s release. The chair of the US select committee onChina, John Moolenaar, said: “President Trump made it abundantly clear to General Secretary Xi in October that Lai should be freed and allowed to leave Hong Kong to be with his family … If General Secretary Xi wants to improve his relationship with the United States, freeing Jimmy Lai is where he needs to start.”Lai’s supporters hope negotiations can now start in earnest for him to be released on health grounds.There are increasing concerns about Lai’s health and wellbeing in prison. His family said he had suffereddramatic weight lossand that his teeth had rotted. He has been behind bars since December 2020, mostly in solitary confinement. Hong Kong authorities say Lai has received appropriate medical care and that he requested to be kept separate from other prisoners.Lai was sentenced along with eight other co-defendants – two activists and six former executives from Lai’s media company – in the landmark national security trial, all of whom pleaded guilty. They were handed sentences ranging from six years and three months to 10 years.Mark Clifford, the president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong and author of a biography of Lai titled The Troublemaker, said: “The heavy sentences meted out not only to Lai but to his six Apple Daily colleagues underscore China’s lack of concern about Hong Kong’s rule of law … The British government needs to redouble its efforts to free Lai on humanitarian grounds.”Clifford is a former executive in Lai’s media company and was referenced several times in the ruling against Lai.Lai’s trial was presided over by three judges handpicked by the government to hear national security cases. In their 855-page judgment convicting him, the judges said Lai was “a very savvy business man” and that it was “unfortunate that his deep resentment and hatred for the Chinese Communist party … led him down a thorny path”.Lai was accused of using Apple Daily and political connections, particularly in the US, to lobby for foreign governments to impose sanctions on China and Hong Kong after the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2019 and 2020.Lai said he never called for sanctions after the national security law had taken effect, as “it would be suicidal to do so”.Additional reporting by Geneva AbdulExplore more on these topicsJimmy LaiChinaHong KongAsia PacificPress freedomNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

It quickly pushed through the 57,000-point mark, before closing up 3.9% at 56,363 points.In other Asian markets, South Korea’s Kospi rose 4.4%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.8%, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was 1.9% higher.On the currency markets, the yen initially fell 0.3% against the dollar – its weakest level in two weeks – before strengthening as much as 0.7%. It was last trading 0.5% firmer at 156.43 yen against the dollar.Nikkei 225 chartTakaichi hopes to push through a 21tn yen (£99bn) stimulus package, and haspromised to suspend Japan’s 8% sales tax on food for two years.Investors have balked at the lack of clarity over how Japan, which has the highest debt burden in the developed world, would fund the proposal. The uncertainty has triggered a sell-off in government bonds and pushed the yen towards historic lows against other currencies.Some analysts had suggested that Takaichi’s strong mandate might give her leeway to retreat from the plan, with opposition parties advocating even bolder tax cuts suffering heavy defeats at the ballot box. But she pushed back against that view in a series of brief television interviews as results rolled in on Sunday, saying she wouldmove with speedto realise the LDP’s promise to suspend the levy.“While the initial yen weakness may not have played out, the outlook for the yen is still one which is likely to struggle to strengthen,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at OCBC in Singapore. “At least in the near term, there’s also concern about intervention risk, which may be capping the upside for dollar-yen.”Questions remained on Monday over whether the bond market would support Takaichi’s debt-fuelled stimulus spending plans.The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Japanese bonds rose by six basis points – or 0.06 percentage points – to 2.282% as bond traders digested the result. The yield on a 30-year Japanese bond rose by four basis points to 3.55%.The rises indicate some jitters among traders about Takaichi’s policies. Bond yields move inversely to prices.Mahjabeen Zaman, the head of foreign exchange strategy at Australia’s ANZ Bank, said Takaichi’s win “reinforces her push for bold spending”. She added: “In terms of [Japanese bond] yields, we expect them to also move higher, just reflecting higher inflation expectations and a little bit of that fiscal agenda that Takaichi will be pulling through.”Fred Neumann, the chief Asia economist at HSBC in Hong Kong, added that while the Japanese PM won a “big political mandate … she faces a very potent opposition, or at least a check, in the markets because she has much less room for manoeuvre. If her agenda is deemed fiscally too ambitious, you’ll see very quick reactions in the bond market and the exchange rate markets.”Japan was concerned about the rapid moves in foreign exchange markets and was closely monitoring them with a high sense of urgency, the government spokesperson Minoru Kihara told a press conference on Monday.The challenge for Takaichi is finding revenue to offset a consumption tax cut, which would cost about 5tn yen a year – roughly equivalent to Japan’s annual education budget. She has ruled out issuing fresh debt but has remained vague on alternative funding sources, saying details would be worked out through cross‑party debates on social welfare and taxation.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificStock marketsGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Laws passed in NSW on Christmas Eve capped the number of firearms recreational shooters can own atfour, and farmers at 10, among other changes, including a ban on some rapid-fire weapons.A senior advocacy adviser of the Alannah and Madeline Foundation, Stephen Bendle, said the gun control group, founded after the Port Arthur massacre, was “disappointedthat the Queensland premier has put the demands of the firearm industry over the public safety of the Queensland community”.“Queensland will have the weakest gun laws in Australia, despite the premier’s rhetoric,” he said.“None of the initiatives announced today does anything to prevent a Bondi orWieambillatragedy.“Firearm safety advocates have had 45 minutes’ discussion with the government since Bondi. We have been ignored in our calls for national consistency in gun reforms. The firearm industry have clearly carried the day in Queensland.”If passed, the laws would create a mandatory minimum sentence for drive-by shootings, increasepenalties for stealing firearms and ammunition and for trafficking guns, and create various new offences designed to prevent ownership of 3D-printed weapons.Parents of police killed in Wieambilla urge gun buyback as Queensland rejects federal schemeRead moreThey would also close a loophole the government says prevents the police investigating people who are planning a terror attack.The laws would allow police to take into account a person’s criminal record when issuing a licence, even if a conviction was not recorded.Crisafulli has repeatedly said that his priority in drafting the legislation was dealing with antisemitism, but that he also intended to make it easier to take firearms off “terrorists and criminals”.The government will also introduce hate speech legislation which would give the attorney general the power toban specific slogans,which the government has said would include the pro-Palestine protest chant “from the river to the sea”. A new offence will prevent the public distribution, publication, public display or public recitation of a proscribed phrase to cause menace, harassment or offence, with a maximum two-year jail sentence.Civil liberties groups and the Greens described the move as “Orwellian” and an attack on free speech.“The government is making itself the thought police. If they decide your words are offensive, you can go to jail for them,” Greens MP Michael Berkman said. “Is that the kind of democracy we want to live in?”The vice-president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, Terry O’Gorman, said “banning or criminalising a catch-cry, especially in public protest situations merely because it may ‘cause offence’, is an affront to free speech rights which have quite properly been protected in Queensland since the dark days of the Bjelke-Petersen street march ban in 1977”.Justice for Palestine is considering a legal challenge against Queensland’s new antisemitism legislation, according to spokesperson Remah Naji.The premier will announce “part three” of the government’s response to the Bondi shootings on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsQueensland politicsBondi beach terror attackDavid CrisafulliGun controlnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time to make our voices heard because we’re facing the worst performance ever from Rai Sport during one of the most anticipated events of all time, the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics.”The CDR said the flawed commentary was damaging to Rai, its licence fee payers and to journalists who work for the public service. The statement added: “This is not a political issue, as some would have us believe, but a question of respect and dignity for public service.”The journalists’ union, Usigrai, called the commentary “inadequate”.Opposition politicians claimed the incident was the latest example of alleged rightwing bias at Rai. Sandro Ruotolo from the Democratic party said it represented a further sign of “political occupation and amateurism” at what he called “TeleMeloni”.In anunprecedented action in 2024, news anchors on Rai’s three main TV channels read a statement from Usigrai condemning Meloni’s administration for “turning Rai into a government megaphone”.Before coming to power in October 2022, Meloni often accused Rai of leftwing bias.Rai Sports has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026Giorgia MeloniNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

His phone shows a social media page of a woman in bikini that has been redacted.Photograph: US Department of JusticePål Lønseth, head of Økokrim, said: “We have opened an investigation to clarify whether criminal acts have occurred. We are facing a comprehensive and, by all accounts, long-term investigation.”“Among other things, Okokrim will investigate whether [Juul] received benefits in connection to her position,” Lønseth added in a statement.Lawyers for both Juul and Rød-Larsen have said their clients are cooperating with investigators and are confident the allegations will be found to be without merit.The couple, who were part of a small group of diplomats facilitating the 1993-1995 Oslo accords, are the latest heavyweight Norwegians to make the headlines over the Epstein files.The revelations have sent shockwaves through the Nordic nation, chiefly because of the US financier’s relationshipwith Crown Princess Mette-Marit, but also because of his ties to other notable figures. Økorkrim, the national authority for investigation and prosecution of economic and environmental crime. has already opened an investigation into Thorbjørn Jagland, a former Labour prime minister of Norway, former chair of the Norwegian Nobel committee and former secretary general of the Council of Europe.‘Can Mette-Marit be queen after this?’: Rape trial and Epstein files bring double crisis for Norway’s royalsRead moreAppearance in the files does not in itself imply wrongdoing or illegal behaviour. Mette-Marit has expressed “deep regret” over her relationship with Epstein,who killed himselfin jail in 2019 as he awaited trial for sex crimes against minors, acknowledging “poor judgment”.Released by the US Department of Justice, the files appear to show that Juul and Rød-Larsen’s two children were bequeathed $10m by Epstein and that Rød Larsen was appointed executer of Epstein’s will in 2017 (this was later revoked).It appears from the files that they visited Epstein’s private island with their children in 2011, with Rød-Larsen later thanking the American for the trip and describing the island as “totally unique”. “We all loved it!” Rød-Larsen wrote in an email, before adding: “Mona sends a kiss.”Announcing Juul’s resignation, Norway’s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, said her contact with Epstein had “revealed a serious lapse in judgment,” adding: “The situation makes it difficult to restore the trust that the role requires.”Juul’s lawyer, Thomas Skjelbred, said a “serious charge” had been brought against his client. He added: “At the same time, she views it positively that the allegations will now be subject to a thorough investigation, allowing the actual circumstances to be clarified. My client does not recognise the accusations made against her.”Juul, he said, a former ambassador to Britain and Israel, will attend questioning with Økokrim this week and that she will cooperate with the ministry of foreign affairs’ inquiries.Rød-Larsen’s lawyer, John Christian Elden, said it had noted the charge against him for alleged complicity in corruption between 2011 and 2018 “centred on an apartment transfer in 2018 and a possible trip in 2011”.Elden added: “He remains fully available to the investigators and is cooperating to the fullest extent practically possible at this stage. Rød-Larsen is confident that once all the factual circumstances have been thoroughly reviewed, the investigation will clarify that there is no basis for criminal liability, and the case will be dismissed.”Rød-Larsen has apologised several times for the relationship he had with Epstein and in 2020 stepped down as chief executive of IPI, a thinktank.Explore more on these topicsNorwayJeffrey EpsteinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

While buying supplies at a hardware store on 9 September 2025 he was arrested in a random immigration sweep, according to Okoye, of BOS Legal Group inMassachusetts.Culleton entered the US in 2009 on a visa waiver programme and overstayed the 90 day-limit but, after marrying a US citizen and applying for lawful permanent residence, he obtained a statutory exemption that allowed him to work, Okoye told the Guardian. “He had a work-approved authorisation that is tied to a green card application,” she said.Culleton’s detention prevented him from attending the final interview in October, she said. “It’s inexplicable that this man has been in detention. It does not make sense. There’s no reason why the government shouldn’t just release him and allow him to attend the interview that will confirm his legal status.”After being held in ICE facilities near Boston and in Buffalo, New York, he was flown to a facility in El Paso, Texas, where he is sharing a cell with more than 70 men. Culleton said the detention centre was cold, damp and squalid, and there were fights over insufficient food – “like a concentration camp, absolute hell”, he told the Irish Times, whichfirst reported the storyon Monday.Culleton said that when he was arrested he was carrying a Massachusetts driving licence and a valid work permit issued as part of an application for a green card that he initiated in April 2025. He has a final interview remaining.When asked at the Buffalo facility to sign a form agreeing to deportation, Culleton said he refused and instead ticked a box expressing a wish to contest his arrest, which he intended to do on the grounds that he was married to a US citizen, Tiffany Smyth, and had a valid work permit.At a November hearing a judge approved his release on a $4,000 bond, which Smyth paid, but authorities continued to detain Culleton, initially without explanation.When his attorney appealed to a federal court, two ICE agents said that in Buffalo Culleton had signed documents agreeing to be deported. Culleton said he did not agree and that the signatures were not his. “My whole life is here. I worked so hard to build my business. My wife is here.”The judge noted irregularities in ICE’s court documents but sided with the agency. Under US law Culleton cannot appeal but he wants handwriting experts to examine the signatures and believes a video of his interview with ICE in Buffalo would prove he refused to sign deportation documents.Irish woman detained by US immigration released after 17 days in custodyRead morePrevious high-profile cases involving people from Ireland includeCliona Ward, who had a green card but was detained by ICE for 17 days over a criminal record from more than 20 years ago. A visiting Irish tech worker who overstayed his visa by three days and agreed to deportation wasjailed for about 100 days.Culleton told the Irish Times he did not know what would happen next and that the uncertainty was “psychological torture”. Facility officials tried to get him to sign a deportation order last week but he refused, he said.Okoye said the US government had discretionary power to release her client and was acting in an inept and capricious manner towards an immigrant who was following the green card process. “He’s never been arrested. He’s married to a US citizen. He owns his own business. He’s established a life here. He’s done everything right.”Smyth said she had endured five months of heartbreak, stress, anxiety and anger. “I would never wish this on anyone or their family. I am still praying for a miracle every day.”After a video call with her husband on Sunday night – their first in five months – Smyth told Culleton’s family inIrelandhe had lost weight and hair and had sores and infections. “There’s no hygiene there. He’s been asking for antibiotics for the last four weeks,” his sister, Caroline Culleton, told RTÉ. The detainees were seldom allowed out for exercise or air, she said.“It’s heartbreaking. We’ve talked about what he endures physically but what about his mental health? How will he deal with this when he gets out? What long-term effect it has on him?”Last week the Irish government said the number of Irish citizens seeking consular assistance about deportation from the US jumped from 15 in 2024 to 65 last year.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)IrelandBostonMassachusettsUS immigrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

If found guilty they face up to seven years in prison and a €100,000 (£87,000) fine.The accused are expected to argue that they were operating under extreme stress and “insurrectional” conditions, after hours of being targeted with projectiles by rioters.The nine officers from the CRS riot police division based in Chalon-sur-Saône are alleged to have entered a Burger King near Paris’s Arc de Triomphe on Saturday 1 December 2018, where non-violent protesters and some journalists had gone to shelter from teargas outside. The restaurant was closed but protesters had forced its doors as they struggled for breath.The court heard that riot police received an order to evacuate the Burger King as fast as possible. Video evidence shown in court indicated some people put their hands up immediately when police entered to show they were not hostile. But officers kicked or used batons to beat protesters on the body or head, some of whom were on the floor. One person received 27 blows from six different officers. Some protesters were heard screaming: “We’re going to die.”The court heard that the alleged beatings took place on the third Saturday of thegilets jaunesprotests, when more than 5,000 people had demonstrated on the streets of Paris. That day, masked men on the edge of the protests had scrawled anti-Macron graffiti over the Arc de Triomphe and some burst into the monument, smashing up its lower floors before climbing on to the roof.Cars had been torched and bank frontages set alight as some masked protesters fought running battles with police. There were 318 arrests that day and 263 people injured, including 23 police. It was considered by authorities as “potentially the hardest day in maintaining order and dealing with demonstrators”, the court heard.Manon, 35, who sheltered in the Burger King with her husband as they vomited after being teargassed, told Le Parisien before the trial opened that the riot police had “hit and hit, it didn’t stop”.Arié Alimi, a lawyer for two victims, said the case was a big moment in thegilets jaunesmovement and illustrated the “brutalisation” of policing.Laurent-Franck Liénard, defending the officers, said context was important and that day “my clients were faced with hundreds and hundreds of demonstrators with an extraordinary level of violence”.The officers arrived in court in uniform bearing badges and insignia, which the judge ordered them to remove. They returned in plain white shirts.Police tacticstowardsgilets jaunesdemonstrators came under scrutiny after official figures showed at least 2,500 protesters were wounded during the unrest, which continued each Saturday for a year. About 1,800 police officers suffered injuries. Activists said 24 protesters lost an eye and five lost a hand because of police weapons.In December 2019, a CRS officer received a two-month suspended sentence for wilful violence, after he was filmed throwing a paving stone at a protester duringgilets jaunesprotests earlier that year.Explore more on these topicsGilets jaunes protestsFranceParisProtestEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She had not in public called for the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, to resign.In what looked like a decisive roundup of the key reformist figures outside government, Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, the head of the front’s political committee, and Mohsen Aminzadeh, a deputy foreign minister under the former president Mohammad Khatami, were also arrested.Further arrests were made on Monday including of Hossein Karroubi, the son of Mehdi Karroubi, a past reformist presidential candidate who spent years under house arrest. Mehdi Karroubi had said Iran’s plight was the direct result of Khamenei’s destructive domestic and international politics, but the IRGC has alleged his son was the “inciter, compiler, and publisher of this destabilising statement”.At least two other prominent figures in the Reformists Front, an umbrella group of as many as 27 reformist factions, have been told to appear at the prosecutor’s office in Evin jail on Tuesday. The moves seem designed to prevent the spread of criticism of the way the security services handled the protests.The official government death toll is 3,000, but others put the figure substantially higher.In a call for Mansouri to be released, the National Unity party condemned what it described as “security confrontations with well-known peaceful and non-violent forces that had pursued their activities within the framework of the law, especially at a time when the country faces external threats and serious internal challenges”.The prosecutors’ office in Tehran claimed those arrested had made every effort to “justify the actions of the terrorists’ infantry”, and stated they were acting in league with the US and Israel. They were also accused of “targeting national unity, taking a stance against the constitution, promoting surrender, perverting political groups and creating secret subversive mechanisms”.Justifying the unprecedented crackdown, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, the head of the judiciary, said: “Those who issue statements against the Islamic Republic from within are in agreement with the Zionist regime and America.” He described the people who issued the statement as “wretched and miserable” and threatened they would “suffer losses”.In a statement last week, Mansouri said: “We will not allow the blood of these dear ones to be consigned to oblivion or the truth to be lost in the dust. Pursuing your rights and striving to clarify the truth is the human duty of us all. And with all our being, we declare our disgust and anger toward those who, ruthlessly and recklessly, dragged the youth of this land into earth and blood.“No power, no justification and no time can sanitise this great catastrophe,” she added. Mansouri has not supported foreign interventions.Her seizure follows the arrest of four other Iranian human-rights defenders who had signed a statement backed by 17 prominent activists demanding a “free, transparent referendum” to establish a new, democratic government in Iran. Three signatories were initially arrested – Vida Rabbani, Abdollah Momeni andMehdi Mahmoudian– but it appeared a fourth signatory, Dr Ghorban Behzadian-Nejad, a senior adviser to Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the reformist prime minister, was also arrested.The statement from the 17 read: “The mass killing of justice seekers who courageously protested this illegitimate system was an organised state crime against humanity.” The arrests come as Iranian leaders maintain a hard line ahead of expected talks on its nuclear programme.Separately, Narges Mohammadi, theNobel peaceprize winnerarrested 59 days ago, was given anew seven-year jail sentence.Iran sentences Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi to seven more years in prisonRead moreShe was briefly allowed to speak to her lawyer, Mostafa Nili, on Sunday for the first time. She revealed she had been transferred to hospital but had been then sent back to jail before her treatment was complete.Pezeshkian has set up an inquiry into the protests, but it is unlikely to be critical of the IRGC, and the arrests of his former supporters show how little influence he wields over the key decision-makers in the government, a point that will be underlined if he remains silent about the arrest of his backers.On a turnout of 49.7%, Pezeshkian won the presidency in June 2024 with 16.4m votes, decisively defeating his rival, Saeed Jalili, with 13.5m votes, yet Pezeshkian has struggled to use his mandate.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has brought forward a trip to Washington to lobby President Trump to include Iran’s missile programme in the talks under way between the US and Iran.Thetalks in Muscatmediated by Oman that started on Friday are due to recommence this week, and Trump has said he is willing for the talks to focus solely on curtailing Iran’s nuclear programme, a position that alarms the Israelis and some in the Republican party.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

However, until now, there was a lack of evidence about whether this link existed for infectious diseases in general.To fill that evidence gap, the study used data from 67,000 adults in two studies in Finland and 470,000 adults in the UK Biobank dataset to look at the relationship between obesity and severe infectious disease.Participants had their body mass index (BMI) assessed and were followed for an average of 13 to 14 years. The average age at the start of the study was 42 for the Finnish group and 57 in the UK cohort.Thestudy, published in the Lancet,found that people with obesity, defined as having a BMI of 30 or higher, had a 70% higher risk of hospital admission or death from any infectious disease compared with people with a healthy BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. The risk increased as body weight increased.The study’s lead author, Prof Mika Kivimäki, of UCL, said: “Our finding that obesity is a risk factor for a wide range of infectious diseases suggests that broad biological mechanisms may be involved.“It is plausible that obesity weakens the immune system’s ability to defend against the infectious bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi, therefore resulting in more serious diseases.“Evidence from trials of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs fits with this, as reducing obesity also appears to lower the risk of severe infections, alongside many other health benefits. That said, additional research is required to confirm the mechanisms underlying these associations.”The chances of dying differed between countries. About one in six infectious disease deaths were linked to obesity in the UK and one in four in the US, thestudy found. Vietnam had the lowest proportion, with obesity linked to 1.2% of infection deaths.There were limitations to the research – which was funded by Wellcome, the Medical Research Council and the Research Council of Finland – including that it relied on observational data and could not confirm causality.The study’s co-author, Dr Sara Ahmadi-Abhari, of Imperial College London, said: “Estimates of the global impact give a sense of how large the problem may be, but they should be interpreted with caution.”Explore more on these topicsObesityInfectious diseasesHealthMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Local and community energy is at the heart of our government’s vision,” Miliband said.No ban on gas boilers in UK warm homes plan but heat pumps get £2.7bn pushRead more“With the biggest-ever investment in community energy in Britain’s history, this government is saying to every local community: we want you to be able to own and control clean energy so the profits flow into your community not simply out to the big energy companies.”The funding for local community-owned solar, wind, hydro and biomass projects will be overseen by GB Energy, the state-owned company thatLabourhopes will help deliver much cheaper electricity bills and greater energy security for the UK.Claiming that up to £1bn will be available to spend before the next election, the UK government described the offer as the largest ever investment in community-owned energy in the UK. The funding would be shared with the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish governments.Community energy projects graphGBEnergysaid it initially hopes to support 1,000 clean energy projects, which will receive grants or loans. It could also allow communities and local councils to buy shares in large privately owned schemes.Ministers expect the money to pay for solar panels on public buildings, churches and schools, potentially producing much cheaper off-grid power, or fund small new windfarms where all the profits are spent on building new homes for social rent, subsidised buses or village halls.Officials in the sector have welcomed the new funding but said it is much less than the £1bn a year they recall being promised in Labour’s 2024 election manifesto. GB Energy said this funding was part of a multibillion green energy strategy, under which new solar and onshore wind projects will be announced this week.Ministers and supporters of the fund hope it will help combat growing criticisms of projects to build taller and larger electricity pylons to significantly upgrade the UK electricity grid, as well as install major new onshore wind farms, solar arrays and battery farms in rural areas.Critics see these as industrialising the landscape, angry that profits from those schemes flow to private investors and multinational companies. Some local campaigns challenging these projects are being embraced by the Conservatives and Reform UK, and weaponised by the US president, Donald Trump, in the battle to challenge Labour’s broader net zero agenda.‘Zombie’ electricity projects in Britain face axe to ease quicker grid connectionsRead moreNeither the UK government nor GB Energy has yet published any targets for new community-owned energy capacity, but GB Energy said it planned to publish a much more detailed prospectus for the funding later this year.The latest data compiled by the umbrella groups Community Energy England, Community Energy Wales and Community Energy Scotland shows the sector has grown consistently since 2017. The total installed capacity has grown by 81%, with solar and hydro capacity more than doubling.The number of people who are members of community energy companies has also surged, from 30,000 in 2017 to nearly 85,000 in 2024.Meanwhile, local councils have begun investing in publicly owned energy schemes. Edinburgh city council helped set up a solar co-op that puts crowd-funded solar panels on public buildings. Orkney Islands council recentlywon £62m funding from the UK government to install six turbines near Kirkwall.Zoe Holliday, the chief executive of Community Energy Scotland, said the UK government had to ensure that the electricity grid was capable of carrying all this new power; the current system was too patchy, leaving some community projects unable to proceed.Nonetheless, this funding could be “truly transformative” for local communities. “Many people in rural areas look out of their windows and look at these huge turbines on the horizon but they don’t materially show any positive benefits for the community,” she said.“For groups taking forward their own community projects, these become community assets, addressing energy resilience, providing an income stream which they can use to deliver local priorities.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyGreen economyEd MilibandGreen politicsEnergyLabourSolar powernewsShareReuse this content"

Political figures such as former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau called her a “beloved Canadian icon”, while the country’s current leader, Mark Carney, said Canada had “lost a legend”.Even the Westminster dog show felt the loss. O’Hara was especially beloved in dog-show circles for portraying Cookie Fleck, a Norwich terrier owner, in Christopher Guest’s 2000 mockumentary Best in Show. Organizers of the showpaid tributeto O’Hara with a video montage played on the jumbotron in New York City’s Madison Square Garden.O’Hara was born in Toronto in 1954, where she joined the legendary comedy theater Second City, alongside Eugene Levy, with whom she would collaborate throughout her career, including on the smash TV series Schitt’s Creek.Her break into movies came in 1980 with Double Negative – also alongside Eugene Levy, and John Candy.In 1988, she played Winona Ryder’s stepmother in Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice. She would later marry the film’s production designer Bo Welch. The couple had two sons, Matthew and Luke.But it was in 1990 that she became widely known to a global audience, as the mother of Culkin’s Kevin in Home Alone.She would reprise the role in the film’s sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, which featured a cameo from Donald Trump, decades before he would become US president.In 1993, she collaborated again with Burton on The Nightmare Before Christmas.The versatile comedian appeared in Guest’s other mockumentaries that revel in silly spectacles of Americana, such as the vain folk singers in A Mighty Wind, and award-hungry actors in For Your Consideration.Her role in Schitt’s Creek brought her an Emmy for best lead actress in 2020.

Is there any way out?Rising GDP continues to mean more carbon emissions and wider damage to the planet. Can the two be decoupled?Alex ClarkMon 9 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 11.19 ESTShareDuringCop30negotiations in Brazil last year, delegates heard a familiar argument: rising emissions are unavoidable for countries pursuing growth.Since the first Cop in the 1990s, developing nations have had looser reduction targets to reflect the economic gap between them and richer countries, which emitted millions of tonnes of CO2as they pulled ahead. The concession comes from the idea that an inevitable cost of prosperity is environmental harm.That pattern seems to be holding. In 2024, global GDP per capita reached a new high as did annual carbon emissions. But asclimate targets slipandwarnings mountthat tipping points may already have been crossed, faith in growth for growth’s sake is starting to fracture.This week, the UN secretary general, António Guterres,called for economies to “move beyond GDP”as a measure of progress, warning that the world’s “existing accounting systems” were driving the planet towards disaster.His remarks echo an increasingly influential school of economics, known broadly as “post-growth”, that asks what was once unthinkable: will solving the climate crisis mean learning to live without constant expansion?Post-growth economists often reject GDP in favour of new frameworks that account for environmental damage – such as the “doughnut economics” adopted recently by Amsterdam, or New Zealand’s attempt at a “wellbeing budget”.The field has its disagreements, particularly over the extent to which countries should actively pursue de-growth measures to scale down their economies. But proponents agree that with the planet pushed to the limit, a radical rethink is needed.“Economic growth has a near mythical status in the affections of economists and politicians. But wishful thinking won’t solve the climate crisis,” said Tim Jackson, professor of sustainable development at the University of Surrey and a leading post-growth economist. “Post-growth economics offers us more choice, more realism and more insight into the possibilities for human prosperity. It’s not about returning to the cave but about breaking free from our intellectual prisons.”The roots of post-growth can be traced back to one book, which caused a storm upon its publication in the 1970s.Some argue that Limits to Growth underestimated humanity’s ability to adapt in the face of environmental breakdown.This technological optimism underpins the idea of “green growth” – that the world economy can keep expanding while avoiding catastrophe. Advocates point to the uptake of renewables, which has taken place to such an extent in some nations that growth has seemingly been decoupled from emissions.Countries such as the UK, France, Germany and the US have all increased GDP per capita since the 2000s while cutting carbon emissions.But experts heavily contest the evidence of decoupling. “It’s inconclusive because it focuses on the wrong thing: annual flows of emissions rather than their accumulation,” said Peter Victor, an emeritus professor at York University in Toronto.“It is the accumulated stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that causes climate change, not the annual flows. We are very far from decoupling the stock of atmospheric carbon dioxide from economic growth.”Others point out that while some countries may have decoupled their growth from domestic emissions, the picture is more mixed when accounting for imported goods. Meanwhile, many countries – notably India and China – have yet to significantly decouple annual emissions from growth.More broadly, since Limits to Growth was published, our understanding of how economic activity is damaging the planet has widened beyond just carbon emissions. Post-growth economics has emerged alongside the study of so-called “planetary boundaries” – hard environmental limits that, once crossed, could have disastrous consequences.The research focuses on nine ecological processes, from climate change to ocean acidification and ozone depletion, and for each identifies the safe zone in which we should operate.The most recent planetary health check,published in September, found seven of these nine boundaries were being breached to a dangerous degree.Scientists warn seven out of nine planetary boundaries have now been breachedSummary findings of 2025 Planetary Health CheckAtmospheric CO2 levelsAt a 15 million year highEcological diversityIn major declineLand area covered by forestsFallen below safe levelsFreshwater flowsUnstable, raising drought & flood riskGlobal nutrient cyclesDisrupted, causing 'dead zones'Chemicals & plasticsToo much released without testingOcean acidificationMarine organisms at riskAerosols in atmosphereFalling within safe zoneOzone in stratopshereSafe but recovery incompleteWhen put against living standards, the study of planetary boundaries reveals a trade-off.In 2018, researchers at the University of Leeds applied these boundaries to more than 150 countries, looking at metrics such as CO2emissions, ecological footprints and land use. They examined how many of these boundaries a country had breached and compared this with progress on a variety of social indicators such as income, nutrition and life satisfaction.Their key finding: no nation had met the basic needs of its residents while also staying within its biophysical limits.The better off a country’s residents were, the more environmental ceilings were broken – the very opposite of where they should be if they were growing sustainably.How this relationship can be broken, if at all, is where the efforts of ecological economists are now focused.The Guardian spoke with a range of academics working in the field and, broadly speaking, they identified three contemporary positions.The families of ecological economicsHow post-growth compares with other schools of thoughtAre planetary limits at risk?Is green growth possible?Can we rely on markets?Key policiesGreen capitalistsCarbon pricing, deregulationGreen KeynesiansGreen new deal, public investmentPost-growthPrioritise wellbeing, reduce overconsumptionOne group are the green Keynesians, who believe green growth is possible through state-led transition. A signature policy idea from this family has been thegreen new dealand the need for public policy that delivers green investment, infrastructure and jobs.On the flip side are the green capitalists, who again hope for growth but believe market reforms and technology will deliver it sustainably. Aside from optimism that innovation offers a way out, this group has also pushed ideas such as carbon pricing and deregulation of green industries. Both sides have shared ground, such as support for renewables or the need for public-private partnerships.By contrast, those in the post-growth camp disagree on a more fundamental level: they say continued growth is not possible while keeping within the planet’s boundaries.Victor said: “Post-growth encompasses many approaches, which differ in their scope and emphasis. However, they share a common understanding that the physical scale of the economy must be reduced to avoid further degradation of life-supporting planetary systems.”The de-growth movement has been one of the most high-profile incarnations of this view, with its calls for the radical scaling down of production and consumption. Many in this family believe the scenario in Limits to Growth is already playing out, or will do shortly, pointing to long-term productivity slowdowns and low growth in many western economies.De-growth proposals have included working time reductions, such as afour-day week, and maximum income caps, particularly to reduce the purchasing power of the rich. But there are others working within post-growth economics who take a more agnostic view. To them, whether green growth is possible is beside the point – instead policymakers need to shift priorities away from growth altogether to other measures of prosperity that can still improve wellbeing.In any case, as of the most recent Cop negotiations our global destination has been agreed. Under the Paris agreement, global carbon emissions need to fall 45% by 2030, with net zero achieved by 2050, to stick to the target of 1.5C.What remains uncertain is the path there and how, and whether, we can grow at the same time. It is, to take current global GDP, the $111.1tn question.Data sourcesIn the introductory chart, data for CO2emissions is sourced from the Global Carbon Budget project, while data on GDP per capita is sourced from the World Bank.The Limits to Growth chart was generated usingPyWorld3, a Python implementation of the World3 model used in Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World (1974).This model differs slightly from the original Limits to Growth model (1972) because of different numerical parameters and a slightly different model structure.This article was amended on 9 February 2026. Peter Victor is an emeritus professor at York University in Toronto, not the similarly named institution in the UK, as an earlier version suggested."

It quickly pushed through the 57,000-point mark, before closing up 3.9% at 56,363 points.In other Asian markets, South Korea’s Kospi rose 4.4%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.8%, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was 1.9% higher.On the currency markets, the yen initially fell 0.3% against the dollar – its weakest level in two weeks – before strengthening as much as 0.7%. It was last trading 0.5% firmer at 156.43 yen against the dollar.Nikkei 225 chartTakaichi hopes to push through a 21tn yen (£99bn) stimulus package, and haspromised to suspend Japan’s 8% sales tax on food for two years.Investors have balked at the lack of clarity over how Japan, which has the highest debt burden in the developed world, would fund the proposal. The uncertainty has triggered a sell-off in government bonds and pushed the yen towards historic lows against other currencies.Some analysts had suggested that Takaichi’s strong mandate might give her leeway to retreat from the plan, with opposition parties advocating even bolder tax cuts suffering heavy defeats at the ballot box. But she pushed back against that view in a series of brief television interviews as results rolled in on Sunday, saying she wouldmove with speedto realise the LDP’s promise to suspend the levy.“While the initial yen weakness may not have played out, the outlook for the yen is still one which is likely to struggle to strengthen,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at OCBC in Singapore. “At least in the near term, there’s also concern about intervention risk, which may be capping the upside for dollar-yen.”Questions remained on Monday over whether the bond market would support Takaichi’s debt-fuelled stimulus spending plans.The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Japanese bonds rose by six basis points – or 0.06 percentage points – to 2.282% as bond traders digested the result. The yield on a 30-year Japanese bond rose by four basis points to 3.55%.The rises indicate some jitters among traders about Takaichi’s policies. Bond yields move inversely to prices.Mahjabeen Zaman, the head of foreign exchange strategy at Australia’s ANZ Bank, said Takaichi’s win “reinforces her push for bold spending”. She added: “In terms of [Japanese bond] yields, we expect them to also move higher, just reflecting higher inflation expectations and a little bit of that fiscal agenda that Takaichi will be pulling through.”Fred Neumann, the chief Asia economist at HSBC in Hong Kong, added that while the Japanese PM won a “big political mandate … she faces a very potent opposition, or at least a check, in the markets because she has much less room for manoeuvre. If her agenda is deemed fiscally too ambitious, you’ll see very quick reactions in the bond market and the exchange rate markets.”Japan was concerned about the rapid moves in foreign exchange markets and was closely monitoring them with a high sense of urgency, the government spokesperson Minoru Kihara told a press conference on Monday.The challenge for Takaichi is finding revenue to offset a consumption tax cut, which would cost about 5tn yen a year – roughly equivalent to Japan’s annual education budget. She has ruled out issuing fresh debt but has remained vague on alternative funding sources, saying details would be worked out through cross‑party debates on social welfare and taxation.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificStock marketsGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It said it “considers that WhatsApp is an important entry point” for AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, to “reach consumers”.The warning comes amid heightened tension between European authorities and Donald Trump’s administration over the regulation of US tech companies. Brussels isreportedlypreparing to intensify enforcement of its key anti-competition rules and the Trump administration hassaidthis is “discriminatory” against US companies.“It is very obvious that we need to defend, to implement and to enforce our rules, to defend our market, a well-functioning market,” the EU competition commissioner, Teresa Ribera, told Bloomberg.In December the US imposedsanctionson the former European Commissioner Thierry Breton as well as four other European “activists”, accusing them of censorship and “suppress[ing] American viewpoints”. The move was widely seen as an escalation in response to European regulation of US tech platforms.Breton ischallengingthe sanctions, and the commission has announced it will back him.Asked about a potential US response to the EU’s measures against WhatsApp, Ribera said: “I don’t know how it may be read by any government, but my sense is that this is not connected to politics, but connected to well-functioning markets.”A Meta spokesperson said: “The facts are that there is no reason for the EU to intervene in the WhatsApp Business API. There are many AI options and people can use them from app stores, operating systems, devices, websites, and industry partnerships.“The commission’s logic incorrectly assumes the WhatsApp Business API is a key distribution channel for these chatbots.”Last month, Brazilian authorities brought a similar case against WhatsApp Business, saying that there were “potential anti-competitive practices” in the new terms, Reutersreported.That case wassuspended, with Meta saying its claims were “fundamentally wrong,” and that the “emergence of AI chatbots on the WhatsApp Business Platform overloads our systems, which were not designed for this type of support”.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)MetaEuropean UnionChatbotsTechnology sectorEuropeEuropean CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

And New England showed enough holes on Sunday to suggest making it back to the big dance soon will be toughOliver ConnollyMon 9 Feb 2026 10.27 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 11.51 ESTShareThe greatest lie a fanbase tells itself is that there is always next year.It is the softest landing spot in sport, a comfort blanket after a crushing defeat. Next year, we’ll be healthier. Next year, we’ll fix our offensive line. Next year, we’ll add that superstar receiver and retain all our guys. Next year.Dan Marino has been here. He lost a Super Bowl in his second season with the Miami Dolphins and spent the rest of his Hall of Fame career chasing a return. Joe Burrow was herejust a few years ago, a drive away from a ring. The Cincinnati Bengals were confident – certain, even – a Super Bowl berth was the start of something, not the end. But they quickly evaporated, and Burrow has trudged through disappointing seasons ever since.“Look, I told those guys. This may have been our only shot,” Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell said after his team’s playoff exit last season, sounding like a man who had peeked behind the curtain.Bad Bunny and jingoism lite: was this the Super Bowl where woke roared back?Read moreOnly the very best teams get sequels in the NFL – the likes of Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs or Tom Brady’s version of the New England Patriots.Thisversion of the Patriots showed on Sunday that they’re good, but not special.They were beaten by the Seahawks 29-13, with the final score doing a disservice to Seattle’s dominance.The Patriots didn’t just come up short; they were flattened. For much of the game, they could barely move the ball on offense, relying on their all-world defense to keep them within striking distance of a comeback. Drake Maye put together ahistorically poorSuper Bowl performance, flailing under constant pressure from Seattle’s defensive front. There were flashes late on, a hint of hope, but the Seahawks showed there are levels in championship games.“As great as it is, I wish the season just kept going,” Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said after his team’s win. Even covered in champagne, Macdonald understood the fragility of the moment. He may never crest this high again. There is a reason Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers own the same number of titles as Nick Foles and Trent Dilfer. Making the Super Bowl is physically and mentally gruelling. It requires an uncommon alignment of talent and luck. When those breaks fall right for a team, they need to cash in.And all season long, things fell right for the Patriots. The soft schedule. Maye competed at an MVP level despite being one of the youngest players in the league. Everything head coach Mike Vrabel touched turned to wins. It was a remarkable turnaround, from four wins last season to a place in the final dance this time around. But Sunday exposed every wart New England had managed to cover up.It was a matchup ofstrength against strength– and the Patriots leaned into it. They stubbornly stuck to the run game, ramming headfirst into the Seahawks’ defensive wall, fearful of Seattle’s pass rush. They chased explosive plays against a lockdown defense, and couldn’t spring anything down the field. They opened the game with eight straight punts. In the first half, they had 51 yards of total offense, the second-fewest by any Super Bowl team this century. Getting to half-time only 9-0 down felt like a win.View image in fullscreenIt was a tough day for Patriots fans on Sunday.Photograph: Kevin C Cox/Getty ImagesBreaking down Seattle’s defense was always going to be a challenge: Macdonald is a defensive savant. They roll eight deep along the defensive line, filled with game-wreckers and hustlers. Everywhere else, there is speed and talent.Maye and his receivers could do nothing against Seattle’s swarming, piranha defense. There were bodies in the backfield, arms in passing lanes, limbs everywhere. Maye had no space or time to operate. By the time he was able to string anything together, he looked frazzled, forcing throws and missing open receivers.And yet, somehow, the Patriots lingered because their own defense was magnificent. Cornerback Christian Gonzalez played the half of his life, shadowing Jaxon Smith-Njigba across the field and breaking up two would-be touchdowns.Patriots defensive coordinator Zak Kuhr blitzed Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold relentlessly, hopinghe would see ghostsand chuck the game away. But Darnold remained composed, navigating a cluttered pocket and escaping trouble. In a defensive contest, throwaways, incompletions and late scampers are decisive. Avoiding sacks and turnovers is the key.The Patriots and Maye could do neither. There is an old coaching axiom: an offense can work around having one sinkhole along the offensive line. Working around two is tough. But working around two who stand next to each other is almost impossible. Seattle picked on the weak left side of New England’s offensive line. Rookies Will Campbell and Jared Wilson were overwhelmed. Macdonald dialed up pressure after pressure, targeting the duo repeatedly. Next Gen Stats credited Campbell with 14 pressures allowed, the most by any player in a game this season. When the Patriots tried to address the problem in the second half, Macdonald flipped his approach. Knowing the Patriots would offer help to their left side left the door open to free pass-rushers from their right. For a coach as good as Macdonald, it was easy work.Every blitz came screaming home. Maye was hit, hurried and harassed, pressured on more than half his dropbacks. Heperceivedpressure on almost all of them, throwing off-target even when he had time.Without a receiver who could win downfield, without protection that could hold for two beats, the offense shrank. New England’s play-calling remained conservative, almost frightened, until it was too late.By the time the Patriots opened things up and finally let Maye cook, the kitchen had already burned down. He started seeing ghosts. He was staring down at pass-rushers who weren’t there. He threw late and hopefully. He finished with two interceptions, including a back-breaking pick-six, a fumble and six sacks. By the end of the game, with the Patriots having the smallest opening for a comeback, Maye was washed. Afterfinallyestablishing some rhythm, Maye tried to chase the game back with one knockout throw.It didn’t go well.For the Patriots to have a chance, they needed their quarterback to be special. He was anything but. He finished 11-of-20 for 135 yards with a touchdown, two interceptions and a fumble when put under pressure. Darnold, meanwhile, struggled when facing heat, but crucially didn’t turn the ball over.“Nobody [on the Patriots] played good enough for us to win,” Vrabel said post-game. “We are 307 days into what is hopefully a long and successful program.”And there it is – the promise of tomorrow. It’s an easy sales pitch to buy: the Patriots were two years ahead of schedule. Maye is only 23 and, despite Sunday, one of the best quarterbacks in the league. The defense is championship caliber. The roster flaws are fixable. They have oodles of cap space. Another draft, another offseason, a healthy line, a proper No 1 receiver. The Eagles have shown a recent blueprint, returning from a Super Bowl loss to win it all within two seasons.Drake Maye Super Bowl statsBut it won’t be that easy. No team nails every draft pick or free-agent pickup, certainly not two years in a row. Besides, teams crumble. Critical players are picked off in free agency. Players and coaches leave. Injuries bite. TheDisease of Mecreeps in. The schedule will harden. Just a year ago, the Washington Commanders made it to the NFC title game on the back of an outstanding rookie quarterback. A year later, they won five games and decided toblow things up.Some will point to the fact that the Patriots’ path to the Super Bowl goes through the AFC, weaker right now than the Seahawks’ NFC. But the AFC will grow teeth, too. Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Mahomes and Burrow aren’t disappearing. Neither will the Chargers, Texans, Broncos or Jaguars. There are plenty of teams waiting for their own crack at a title.The Patriots earned their shot this year. But nothing says they’ll get another anytime soon. Only four quarterbacks have come back to win a Super Bowl after losing their first Super Bowl start. Even for theNew England Patriots,that’s thin ice.The promise of next year is comforting. The league, though, only offers now. And with a chance to spring an upset, the Patriots were unmasked as pretenders.Explore more on these topicsNew England PatriotsSuper Bowl LXNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now Manchester United must try to replace himThe Brazilian was often exposed by the tactics of Ten Hag and Amorim, but was always adaptable and a replacement will be expensiveDominic BoothMon 9 Feb 2026 15.00 ESTShare“Leave the football before the football leaves you.” The meme-baiting quote from Jamie Carragher hung heavy over Casemiro for a long while, but it is testament to the Brazilian’s character and durability that he will leaveManchester Unitedthis year on his own terms, two years after those infamous words from the former Liverpool player.In fairness to Carragher, context at the time was key. After Unitedwere hammered 4-0 by Crystal Palacein May 2024, Casemiro looked spent at the elite level, bypassed too easily in increasingly fast‑tempo matches and left for dead by Erik ten Hag’s high-risk tactics.Casemiro could have taken the easy route out to the Saudi Pro League – it was hardly like he had anything to prove given his impressive medal collection. Back then it seemed United would do almost anything to offload him; now it is clear that replacing him will be the club’s trickiest summer task, another challenge for Jason Wilcox and company.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreLate-era Casemiro – he turns 34 this month – added discipline to his game and became wary of his weaknesses when exposed against runners through the middle. He was happy to sit deep and use his remarkable ability to read the play, ready to time those trademark tackles and release more energetic midfield partners. Aerially, he remained a colossus in both penalty boxes. United managers did not always get the midfield structure right around him – not least Ten Hag – but the former Real Madrid linchpin got on with his job without making a fuss.Filling the Casemiro void will be expensive for United, even if removing his significant wages offers financial relief. The club have made clear that overhauling their midfield is a top transfer priority, after 2025 was spent restructuring the attack with about £200m splashed on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Of the current crop of midfielders, only Kobbie Mainoo appears locked in for next season. Bruno Fernandes is still coveted by clubs in Saudi Arabia, and Manuel Ugarte’s difficult adaptation to English football leaves the exit door open should United receive a sufficient bid. United may need to sign two or three midfielders, but a specialist defensive pivot will be top of the list.View image in fullscreenCasemiro celebrates scoring against Fulham earlier this month. He remains an aerial powerhouse in both boxes.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPACarlos Baleba fits that profile. Unitedexplored a deal last summerbut were deterred by Brighton’s valuation, north of £100m. After a slow start to the season, the Cameroonian is reaffirming his reputation as one of the league’s best talents outside the traditional big six and he could be pursued once again. At 22 and with the defensive and physical attributes to slot into the Casemiro role, he remains an attractive proposition.Elliot Anderson will have no shortage of suitors this summer thanks to his performances for Nottingham Forest and his rise into Thomas Tuchel’s first-choice England lineup. The 23‑year‑old could feasibly act as a more energetic and progressive version of Casemiro; he possesses the engine and passing game to play in an elite midfield, but a stumbling block could be Forest’s valuation of one of their prize assets. Evangelos Marinakis will rightly demand top dollar for Anderson, if he chooses to sell at all.Something similar can be said for Crystal Palace and Adam Wharton, though the recent Selhurst Park fire sale perhaps weakens the Eagles’ negotiating position. Wharton may feel he is due a transfer in the same way Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze and Marc Guéhi were granted dream moves. As a Blackburn lad, he has links to the north-west so many expect a bunfight between United and City for his signature.Stylistically, however, Wharton poses a dilemma. He would perhaps need a destroyer alongside him because he is primarily a distributor, a natural risk-taker in possession. He has thrived playing next to the workhorse Will Hughes at Palace. Would Wharton and Mainoo complement each other as a pairing?Alternatives include bringing Rúben Neves back to the Premier League after a three‑year sojourn with Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia, or taking a punt on Stuttgart’s highly rated Angelo Stiller. Neither player is an ideal fit given United’s preference for players in their early to mid-20s who have cut the mustard in the English top flight. Neves has done so at Wolves, albeit not recently, but will turn 29 in March. Stiller, 24, may be regarded as an unknown quantity owing to his lack of Premier League experience. The Bournemouth pair Tyler Adams and Alex Scott, 26 and 22 respectively, fit United’s criteria but are not names to truly excite the fanbase.View image in fullscreenBrighton’s Carlos Baleba is a player coveted by United, and plenty of other clubs.Photograph: Jeff Mood/ProSports/ShutterstockThe caveat is what a new permanent manager, if appointed in the summer, would demand. Ruben Amorim’s departure came on the back of an altercation with United’s hierarchy over transfer control; presumably a new man will have his own thoughts on his side’s midfield structure, which United would be wise to heed.Michael Carrick has favoured 4‑2‑3‑1 with Mainoo alongside Casemiro. Will his successor, assuming Carrick does not land the role permanently, require a similar balance in midfield? As with so many questions around United right now, they must find the answer this summer.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jackson drove away but Pearce continued to follow her as she drove toward a police station. Jackson told officers that Pearce drove into the rear of her car near the police station, then ran his vehicle into hers head-on.According to the affidavit, police officers arrived at the scene after Jackson called them and saw Pearce standing outside his SUV. One of the officers pulled out his gun and ordered Pearce to get on the ground, but Pearce instead got in his car and closed the door. After the officer opened the car door, Pearce shut it and attempted to leave the scene.Pearce’s SUV hit an officer’s knee, an incident the affidavit described as “intentionally in an attempt to evade arrest.”After a pursuit, Pearce’s car crashed at an intersection, and he left the vehicle and started running. When officers caught up to him, Pearce “began to resist arrest by tensing his arms and not allowing officers to apprehend him.” He was “triaged on scene” and taken for medical treatment.Jackson told police she had recently ended a three-year relationship with Pearce, and blocked his number, but he had continued to text her from another phone. She showed the messages to the police.“We are aware of an incident involving James Pearce Jr, in Miami,” the Falcons said in a statement on Saturday night. “We are in the process of gathering more information and will not have any further comment on an open legal matter at this time.”Atlanta selected Pearce with the 26th overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft out of Tennessee, which he attended alongside Jackson.

Adam Sandler hangdog in the Levi’s Stadium stands, Jon Bon Jovi mooching on the sideline like a retired dentist on a cruise, Billie Joe Armstrong belting out American Idiot during the pre-game show under his motionless meringue of fogey-blond hair: were they a sign? A New England Patriots team who were neither favored to win nor widely reviled, then promptly repaid a grateful publicby losing: was this the Super Bowl which proved that history really can move on, that America is not fated to remain hostage to the tremors and hatreds of the past? Well, yes and no.A year after Donald Trump made American football’s showpieceall about him, Sunday’s game in Santa Clara always promised a sort of correction – a cooling of the mood, perhaps even an end to the manipulation of sport for political ends. As always the best way to gauge the success of this mission was as the gods intended: through a TV screen. Trump –saddledwith historically low approval ratings, facing a massacre in this year’s midterms, and no doubt wary of risking a public appearance in the deep blue sea of the Bay Area – was absent on this occasion, and he kept the F-22 fighter jets that were scheduled to be part of the pre-game flyover away from Levi’s Stadium too. (Unspecified “operational assignments” were the reason offered for the jets’ withdrawal, which means there’s probably a low-ranking member of the Trump administration puttingbig moneyon a US military strike somewhere in Latin America as we speak.) And yet, the absent autocrat still weighed on proceedings, his curdling influence turning every moment and gesture on Sunday into a referendum on the prospects for a post-Trumpian sporting future. Could football be normal again?The Seahawks and the Patriots did their part by offering up a game of punishing defense and attritional offense that had all the carefree charm of a medieval torture procedure. Can football be normal again? That remains unclear, but on this evidence it can certainly be boring, which is maybe a form of progress. Despite the best efforts of professionaljaw surgerypatientJake Paul, the pre-game chatter was mostly about de-escalation: even the ESPN host Pat McAfee felt moved topoint out, on his first visit to San Francisco, that the city was nothing like the urban hell described by the catastrophizers of Fox News and other rightwing media outlets. Perhaps, for once, the Super Bowl would not be dragged into America’s tedious and interminable culture wars. BetweenPaul’s racist critiqueof the half-time show and the alternative spectacle offered by Turning Point USA, maybe all the right can do now is squawk impotently into the void.1:19'A surreal moment': Sam Darnold and Kenneth Walker III on Seahawks' Super Bowl victory – videoOn the field, Joe Montana, Peyton Manning and a bunch of other footballing legends got things moving by throwing out peace signs through a pre-game honor guard of young women with violins, and from there the tone of thisSuper Bowlas a grownup affair, all strings and restraint, was set. Even the pre-game ceremony to mark this year’s 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence had a shrugging, almost apologetic quality to it, the sermonizing brief and symbolism feathery: this was jingoism, but on Ozempic. YouTuber Charlie Puth was a surprise choice to sing the national anthem, and no one seemed more shocked than the man himself: dressed in the style of a fun dad on his way to parent-teacher night – button-down shirt, tie, brown leather jacket and straight-leg jeans – Puth dispensed with the standard bombast and delivered The Star-Spangled Banner in a feline whisper. Perhaps more than any other recent installment of American sport’s biggest day, this Super Bowl seemed determined not to draw attention to itself. “I know we won the Super Bowl, but we could have been a little bit better on offense,” victorious quarterback Sam Darnold told sideline reporter Melissa Stark after the game. Even in triumph there were learnings to glean, takeaways to digest, improvements to plan. This was the Super Bowl as corporate retreat, a moment to pause, reflect and reset for the year ahead.Relentless Seahawks pummel Patriots to claim their second Super Bowl titleRead moreIn Mike Tirico and Chris Collinsworth, NBC boasted two play-by-play announcers with the character to meet the soporific moment. Collinsworth, calling his sixth Super Bowl, offered a clinic in stating the obvious, noting midway through the second quarter that “this is shaping up as a defensive game”. He’s certainly not Tom Brady bad, but thenno one apart from Brady is. Meanwhile Tirico, realizing the dream that fired his defection from ESPN in 2016 to call his first ever Super Bowl, had to juggle duties at Levi’s Stadium with his role anchoring NBC’s coverage of the Winter Olympics, a fact viewers were reminded of approximately once every 30 seconds on Sunday night. “Champion will be crowned in 30 minutes,” Tirico announced at half-time with a theatrical pause, before adding with an elongating flourish: “Mmmmaybe more.” It’s a good thing NBC has the big man locked down to a long contract, because it’s unclear whether anyone else working in media today has the talent to produce material this strong. Tirico is the most white-collar commentator in American sports; he has an unparalleled skill for making every in-game call and on-set interjection sound like something your accountant might say to you as he’s walking you through your tax return. In that sense he was the perfect on-air complement to this turgid encounter, an anti-hype guy to suit the times.Yes, but was itwoke? Was the stagecraft behind this Super Bowl, both in the stadium and on TV, some kind of “statement” about America Today? Is progressive culture now “back” in any meaningful sense? The choice of Bad Bunny to headline the half-time show may have been ragebait for Red America, but however convincingly the field at Levis’s Stadium was terraformed to resemble the hinterland of San Juan (it was not very convincing), the Super Bowl did not ultimately herald some permanent “turn” on the part of the NFL toward cultural progressivism. No one, not even Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio himself, “libbed out”; however welcome or unexpected it might have been, the half-time spectacular saw no big protest about ICE or lament of the country’s rapid descent into authoritarianism. After last year’s Super Bowl turned into a Trumpified debacle, Sunday was all about evening up the ledger, about welcoming the sport’s non-Maga contingent back into the tent – a project in which the inclusion of Bad Bunny, the day’s lack of on- or off-field drama, and the bipartisan shock over$180 burgersall played a galvanizing role.View image in fullscreenThe view inside the stadium as the national anthem is performed at Super Bowl LX.Photograph: Jeenah Moon/ReutersAs always it was the ads, rather than events in the stadium, that said the most about the state of the world today. Apart from a few outliers – Guy Fieri as “some guy” in an ad for Bosch power tools, Adrien Brody going method for TurboTax, William Shatner as a near-incontinent ambassador for Raisin Bran named “Will Shat” – this year’s commercials advertised products that fit a dependable number of recurring categories: AI, gambling, food delivery and insurance. Here, in taxonomical miniature, was a brilliant summary of what culture has in store for us: slop, speculation, a retreat from the commons, and indemnification – if we’re lucky – against the disasters that await. Amid the tedium of action on the field, this Super Bowl offered a powerful advertisement for the theater and violence of capitalism as usual.Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LXSuper BowlNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the world No 80 Osorio – who won a WTA Challenger event in Manila last month – regrouped for the second set, as Raducanu struggled to find her range from the baseline.The pressure from Osorio soon told as she broke Raducanu then held to move ahead 4-2 before maintaining her momentum to take it 6-4 and level the match.Raducanu was broken again at the start of the deciding set, ­choosing not to chase a drop shot to the net before calling for the physio. After a lengthy conversation – and having her blood pressure checked – the Briton went back on court, but then lost the ­second game to love and walked back to the net to shake Osorio’s hand and retire.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Japan’s defending Olympic champion Miho Takagi took bronze in 1:13.95.Inside a packed 7,000-seat arena in Milan’s western suburbs, the atmosphere felt closer to Heerenveen than Lombardy. Most of the crowd wore Dutch orange, turning the venue into a rolling wall of noise as the final three heats unfolded. Among them was Leerdam’s fiance, theboxer-influencer Jake Paul, who wept uncontrollably from the second row after she won as her own tears left streaks of eyeliner down her face.‘She’s a grown woman’: skiers defend Lindsey Vonn’s decision to race despite crashRead moreKok ignited the building first, skating against American world record-holder Brittany Bowe and posting 1:12.59 – a time that, at that moment, stood as an Olympic record and set off the first wave of celebrations in the stands. But the decisive moment came one race later.Drawn in the final pair against Takagi, Leerdam delivered a masterclass in pacing and control. She opened in 17.68 seconds and produced the fastest 600m split in the field at 43.78 before closing with authority to stop the clock at 1:12.31 and lower the minutes-old Olympic record.Her final lap of 28.53 seconds completed a performance built on middle-phase efficiency rather than explosive opening speed, moving her to within seven-tenths of Bowe’s world mark of 1:11.61.“I knew that if during the race I would feel tired, I wasn’t allowed to feel tired,” Leerdam said after clinching gold. “I told myself: ‘You have 80 years to recover from this. You can feel tired after. You don’t want to live with that regret. You fought so hard for this.’”For Leerdam, the result represented both redemption and culmination. In Beijing in 2022 she finished second in this event behind Takagi. On Monday night, skating directly against the same rival, she reversed that storyline in a single, technically precise kilometer.“After the finish line I was surprised, very tired and very emotional,” she said.For anyone encountering Leerdam for the first time this week, the gold medal is only part of her story.The skater from the Westland region of South Holland, has become one of the most recognizable athletes in winter sport. A two-time world champion and three-time European champion in the 1000m in addition to the Beijing silver, she has also built an audience that extends far beyond the oval, withmore than five million followers on Instagramand millions more across other platforms.That visibility has made her one of the most talked-about figures at these Games. In Milan, she has largely bypassed traditional media, choosing instead to communicate directly with supporters through her own channels. The approach has frustrated some Dutch reporters beholden to a skating-mad readership but reflects a career-long pattern: Leerdam has consistently chosen to operate on her own terms. Former teammates and coaches say external criticism has often sharpened her focus.That fierce independent streak traces back to childhood. Family members have described her as intensely driven from an early age – someone who, once she chose skating, pursued it with unwavering focus. She initially excelled at hockey before switching over as a preteen, drawn to the individual nature of the sport and its clarity of outcome. In later interviews, she has described speed skating as brutally honest: the clock decides, not opinion.View image in fullscreenJake Paul was in tears as his partner sealed gold.Photograph: ANP/ShutterstockBy her mid-teens, that focus was already being paired with a broader vision. Former speed skater Ben van der Burg, who also grew up in Westland, has said Leerdam’s family recognized early that elite performance could coexist with commercial opportunity – an approach that would later make her one of the most marketable athletes in Dutch sport.On the ice, the results followed quickly. By 18 she was already a world junior champion, and within a few seasons of moving into the senior ranks she had established herself among the world’s best at the distance. Leerdam developed into one of the leading skaters of her generation, winning multiple world titles.Off the ice, she has been unusually open on her own channels, speaking about menstrual health and the pressures of weight management during her teenage years – conversations that former skaters and coaches say helped normalize subjects long treated as taboo in elite sport.Her profile expanded further in 2023 when she began a relationship with Paul. The couple, who announced their engagement last year, maintain a long-distance relationship between Puerto Rico and the Netherlands and have essentially become theTaylor and Travisof speed skating: #couplegoals writ large through one of the most visible crossovers between Olympic sport and digital-era celebrity.Paul watched Monday’s race surrounded by the camera crew that frequently documents his life. His presence – and the couple’s combined social media reach – has brought an unusual level of external attention to a sport that traditionally exists outside the global celebrity ecosystem.It has also brought its share of notoriety. Paul has generated headlines at these Olympics for outspoken social media commentary on US politics and culture, including inflammatory postsduring Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time showthat triggered intense online backlash and apublic disagreement with his brother Logan. Earlier in the Games he was seen sitting with US vice-president JD Vance at a women’s hockey game, adding to the unusual level of attention surrounding Leerdam beyond the rink.Yet within speed skating, Leerdam’s reputation remains grounded in performance. Aside from a fall in the 1000m at the Dutch Olympic trials, she arrived in Milan in flying form, including a track-record performance earlier this season in Inzell where she defeated Kok in the 1000m, a result that reinforced her status as the skater to beat in her signature distance.Former competitors say that combination – commercial visibility alongside consistent elite results – is what ultimately defines her place in the sport. Without the results, she would be an influencer who skates. With them, she has helped reshape how a speed skating star can exist in the modern sporting landscape.Monday’s race may ultimately come to represent the pinnacle of that career. Leerdam indicated last year that these Games could mark her final Olympic appearance. She is also scheduled to skate in the 500m on Sunday.If this was her signature moment, it arrived in the cleanest possible form: an Olympic record in the final group, revenge against the defending champion who once denied her gold, and a performance delivered under maximum expectation in front of what effectively became a Dutch home crowd desperate for its first breakthrough of these Games. For a skater who has spent much of her career balancing elite sport, public scrutiny and global visibility, it was the clearest possible statement.Explore more on these topicsSpeed skatingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hess answered: “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the US.”The next day,Trump lashed out at Hesson social media, calling him “a real Loser”. Another skier, British-American Gus Kenworthy,said he had received death threatsafter his anti-ICE protest last week. Other snowboarders and skiers were asked for their reaction on Monday.“My parents being immigrants from Korea, this one definitely hits pretty close to home,” said Kim, who begins defense of her title on Wednesday. “I’m really proud to represent the United States. The US has given my family and I so much opportunity, but I also think that we are allowed to voice our opinions of what’s going that we need to lead with love and compassion.”Other American snowboarders spoke out for diversity and the right of expression.“I think there are a lot of different opinions in the US right now. Obviously we’re very divided,” snowboarder Bea Kim said. “I personally am very proud to represent the United States. That being said, I think diversity is what makes us a very strong country and what makes that so special.”Teammate Maddie Mastro added: “I’m also saddened with what’s happening at home. It’s really tough and I feel like we can’t turn a blind eye to that. But at the same time, I represent a country that has the same values as mine of kindness and compassion. And we come together in times of injustice.”Gu called the situation “an unwinnable press war” for Hess and lamented the fact that the controversy could be a distraction for the athletes, and overshadow the beauty of the biggest event in winter sports.“I’m sorry that the headline that is eclipsing the Olympics has to be something so ... unrelated to the spirit of the Games,” she said. “It really runs contrary to everything that the Olympics should be.”She added: “The whole point of sport is to bring people together. One of the very few common languages, that of the human body, that of the human spirit, the competitive spirit, the capacity to break not only records, but especially in our sport, literally the human limit.

The lengths ski jumpers go to for Olympic gloryAfter a national scandal involving two athletes, Norwegian fans at these Winter Games don’t enjoy becoming a punchlineAndy Bullin PredazzoMon 9 Feb 2026 16.08 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 18.19 ESTShareYes, it’s time to talk about the ski jumpers’ penises. Although to be honest the ski jumpers themselves would prefer it if everyone could keep the conversation to their testicles. Figuratively. “This sport,” the former Olympic champion Sven Hannawald once said, “has a lot to do with balls.”This turns out to be more true than you might imagine, even for a sport that involves flying 100m down a mountain. As the world now knows, being well endowed is a distinct advantage for the simple key reason that when a jumper spreads their legs the crotch of their trousers stretches out into a wing, and the bigger that wing is, the further they’re likely to fly.Computer analysis suggests they get an extra 2.8 metres of distance for every extra centimetre of fabric.Winter Olympics 2026: Jutta Leerdam takes speed skating gold but GB medal wait goes on – liveRead moreWhich is why the ski jumping rules state that a suit is only allowed to be 4cm larger than the surface area of the body wearing it. But of course anyone who can find a way of temporarily enhancing that surface area when the official measurements are being taken would have the advantage of a few precious extra square centimetres of material with which to work. Which is why last Thursday the president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, Witold Banka, found himselffielding questions about whether or not the organisation was investigating reportsthat some jumpers had started injecting hyaluronic acid into their penises to make them bigger.No one in the ski-jumping community wants to discuss this. The federation that runs the sport says it is just a “wild rumour”. But the unfortunate truth is that the sport, and the Norwegian team in particular, has invited all this speculation after two of their athletes, Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang, were banned for three months after their coaches were caught sewing extra material into the athletes’ jumpsuits at the World Cup last year. Someone, and no one ever seems to have found out who, posted an online video of them doing furtive things with a sewing machine.View image in fullscreenA Norway coach uses a flag to signal when it’s good to jump.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIn the beginning the coach denied it. But when he came clean, he and two of the support staff – including the team tailor – were banned for a year and a half. The athletes got off with three months because they claimed to be oblivious to what was going on. Which is how they came to be back competing in the Olympic normal hill competition on Monday evening (normal, it has to be said is a very relative concept in this sport).It was a national scandal in Norway, which is the proudest, and most successful, of all the Winter Olympic countries. The Norwegians have won more medals in ski jumping than anyone else, and Lindvik is the current Olympic champion in the long hill. As funny as you and I might think this is, ski jumping is a beloved sport in the handful of countries that practise it, and the Norwegian fans I talk to about it during the Olympic competition don’t enjoy becoming a punchline. “I don’t want to talk about it,” one tells me. “It’s all behind us now,” is the only thing another will say. “It’s sad, very, very sad,” says a third.By the end of the night I’m beginning to understand more about why they’re so upset. Ski jumping is a great evening out. In Predazzo, where the Olympic competition is taking place, a big, happy band of fans from across Europe, North America and Japan are knocking back beers and hotdogs and shouting out at the athletes as they fly through the night. People are blowing horns, and banging cowbells. It’s an easy sport to love, and an astonishing one to watch.But the truth is no one really knows if this scandal is “behind us” or not. The federation insists it is, but a lot of the sport’s former stars have spoken out about stretching the rules themselves, partly out of a desire to take the heat off the men who have been banned, and partly as a call to reform the sport. The former Olympic medallists Johan Remen Evensen, Anders Jacobsen and Daniel-André Tande all told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK that cheating was common during their careers. They spoke about how jumpers used to wear suits with low-slung crotches, or tug their underpants down by their knees to stretch out their trousers then tuck them up again during inspections.View image in fullscreenGerman fans enjoy the ski jumping at Predazzzo.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThen Switzerland’s former world champion Andreas Küttel said he had been doing it, too. He admitted he used to spray his suit with hairspray before competitions, to stop the air from passing through it.The margins in ski jumping are so small, the stakes so high, and the sport is so sensitive to the tiniest variations of physics, that the athletes are always looking to game the rules. In the early 2000s, there were a series of scandals involving the suits and bindings, and in the late 2000s another involving extreme weight loss, which lead to widespread problems with eating disorders among the competitors. This problem still exists, despite the federation bringing in rules around the body mass index of the jumpers. Federations are perpetually caught in trying to find better ways to regulate the sport as the athletes look for new loopholes.This one will pass. Then another will come. And in the end these few months will be remembered as a brief moment – the briefs moment – in the history of the sport.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSkiingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her cries of pain could be heard clearly on the television broadcast and spectators and her fellow athletes were visibly shaken as she was airlifted to hospital.She was competing on Sunday while dealing with a ruptured ACL she had suffered a week earlier.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever,” she wrote in an Instagram post on Monday.Vonn added that she had “no regrets” about her decision to race. “Knowing I stood there having a chance to win was a victory in and of itself. I also knew that racing was a risk. It always was and always will be an incredibly dangerous sport,” she wrote.Some users on social media said she should not have been racing only a week after injuring her knee. However, those who know the risks of skiing best supported Vonn’s decision.“People that don’t know ski racing don’t really understand what happened yesterday,” Vonn’s US teammate Keely Cashman said on Monday. “She hooked her arm on the gate, which twisted her around. She was going probably 70mph, and so that twists your body around.”Cashman, who suffered a heavy crash of her own five years ago, said Vonn’s crash had “nothing to do with her ACL, nothing to do with her knee”, and people who think otherwise are “totally incorrect”.Lindsey Vonn’s crash is violent but honest ending to an unprecedented Olympic bidRead more“I think a lot of people are ridiculing that, and a lot of people don’t [know] what’s going on,” Cashman added.Vonn had been in the middle ofa remarkable comeback, coming out of a six-year retirement in 2025 after knee replacement surgery. There were doubts the 41-year-old could compete at the highest level again but she reached the podiumin all five World Cup downhill racesshe entered in the run-up to the Olympics, including two victories. However,the crash at the end of Januarythat ruptured her ACL made some question whether she was risking her life as she sought to win her second Olympic gold medal.Italy’s Federica Brignone, a two-time world champion, dismissed that criticism. “It’s her choice,” Brignone said. “If it’s your body, then you decide what to do, whether to race or not. It’s not up to others. Only you.”Another of Vonn’s US teammates, downhill specialist Kyle Negomir, also had no problem with her decision to try to replicate her gold medal performance from the 2010 Olympics.“Lindsey’s a grown woman and the best speed skier to ever do this sport. If she made her decision, I think she should absolutely be allowed to take that risk,” Negomir said. “She’s obviously good enough that she’s capable of pulling it off.”However her father, who has skied competitively himself, said he believes she should retire from racing.“She’s 41 years old, and this is the end of her career,” Alan Kildow told the Associated Press on Monday. “There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.”Kildow and Vonn’s three siblings have been at her bedside as she recovers from her injuries in hospital in Treviso.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He has been dubbed “LinkedIn Liam” because of some of his quotes, compared to David Brent because of his mannerisms and mocked after miscontrolling a ball last week during his side’s defeat by Arsenal. The reaction towards the former Strasbourg manager has been intense.“The reason I know this is because I’ve got teenage children,” Rosenior said before Tuesday night’s home game against Leeds. “They’re on social media. It affects them. It affects my parents, it affects my family. But I knew walking into this job it was going to happen. It’s normal.“When you’re prepared for it, it makes you smile. I’m a confident person. And if you’re affected by things like that you shouldn’t be in this job. There’s no way you can do this job if you’re affected negatively by it. I quite enjoy it, to be honest. I didn’t help myself with my first touch at Arsenal. But that comes with the territory. I’m enjoying the job. And I know in time people will start judging me on what they see on the pitch, which is the most important thing.”Asked why he had expected it, he said: “Maybe my background and my coaching and being at a club the size of this is different. It’s different. I’m not a massive name. I’m from a different type of club and have a different type of character.”Rosenior had roles at Derby and Hull before moving to France to manage Strasbourg. He considered suggestions that the mockery feels different. “I don’t know if you’re trying to lead me to say anything,” he said. “It doesn’t affect me. I’ve been prepared to do this job for years, for decades, and I knew what would come with it. And it actually doesn’t affect me at all, because I know the focus is doing the job and enjoying it.“I love this job. I’m enjoying it. I’m not afraid to be myself. If I wear glasses, if I sound a little bit over the top when I speak, or articulate myself in a certain way, or I don’t look like a manager, it doesn’t bother me at all.”It was put to Rosenior that it seems weird for there to be such a negative response to a young English manager showing promise in a big job. “Yeah, I agree with what you’re saying. Erm, I’ll leave it at that.” Asked whether he put it down to British culture, ­Rosenior said: “I’m not going to go into that. People make their own judgments on people before they meet them. That’s part of life.”Rosenior hopes Reece James will be fit to face Leeds after missing games against Arsenal and Wolves. The captain has been out with a minor knock and felt unwell on Monday. Andrey Santos is available after going off with a sore ankle during the3-1 win against Wolveson Saturday.Explore more on these topicsChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

Then came more of the individual errors that have ruined Liverpool’s title defence. Aching weaknesses within Slot’s squad were exposed again. Dominik Szoboszlai playing Bernardo Silva onside for Manchester City’s equaliser was an error midfielders playing full-back will make. Szoboszlai’s late red card was, though, foolish. Alisson’s foul on Matheus Nunes for Erling Haaland’s decisive penalty was another rush of blood. Liverpool’s huge summer spend was motivated by their executives’ belief in buying the best individuals to unlock the Premier League’s tactical cages. City’s key individuals showed such a policy can pay off, with Silva inspirational, Gianluigi Donnarumma making the save that sparked the game’s chaotic final scenes, Marc Guéhi looking an astute defensive signing and Haaland supplying Silva’s goal. City had been unconvincing but their mentality held, allowing them to eventually profit from Hugo Ekitiké’s misses and the waning of Mohamed Salah.John BrewinMatch report:Liverpool 1-2 Manchester City2Strand Larsen strikes right note for GlasnerOliver Glasner revealed that Jean-Philippe Mateta will decide whether to have an operation on his injured knee after seeing a specialist on Monday – a move that could rule him out of the World Cup. But theCrystal Palacemanager was delighted with the impact his replacement, Jørgen Strand Larsen, made on his debut against Brighton. The Norway striker looked rusty but provided Palace’s attack with a focal point in a much-needed victory that eased any relegation concerns – and could have added to his solitary Premier League goal so far this season. “I think three, four times we didn’t find him with our crosses, because he has great movements,” said Glasner. With a £48m price tag, the pressure will be on Strand Larsen to deliver. Wednesday’s home game against struggling Burnley will be a good opportunity for him to break his duck.Ed AaronsMatch report:Brighton 0-1 Crystal PalaceView image in fullscreenJørgen Strand Larsen made a promising start to his Crystal Palace career.Photograph: Jeff Mood/ProSports/Shutterstock3Gyökeres finds his shooting bootsNot everybody is convinced by Viktor Gyökeres but, after coming off the bench to score twice againstSunderland, the Sweden striker now has eight goal involvements in his last eight games. Mikel Arteta was clearly delighted. “He has the type of character that we expected,” the Arsenal manager said. “I love that he is so focused on the pressing and he has a genuine desire to help the team. He came on when the game was a little more open. Today he had more help around him. What really makes a difference is the consistency he shows to train and to understand every day. It’s difficult to know what he is feeling: he looks at you and he is just the same but when you feel confident, when you feel important, when you feel at your best, that’s when you can take your game to the highest level.”Jonathan WilsonMatch report:Arsenal 3-0 Sunderland4Bees’ wing switch works wondersPartway through the first half at St James’ Park, Keith Andrews asked Keane Lewis-Potter and Dango Ouattara to swap wings. Both were already playing well but Brentford’s manager decided Lewis-Potter would be better deployed down the right, where he could cramp the style of Lewis Hall. Ouattara was ideally suited to remind everyone that Kieran Trippier is now 35. The switch formed the bedrock of a 3-2 victory for the visitors, with the excellent Ouattara creating one goal and scoring the late winner. It was Newcastle’s third straight league defeat and left Eddie Howe in an introspective mood. If many of his team’s problems stem from the fatigue engendered by a congested fixture list, the fact his side scored from a corner and a penalty and only asked Caoimhín Kelleher to make one serious save suggests they need to do more with the ball. Andrews, tellingly, said: “It’s always slightly chaotic here and you need to deal with the chaos.” Unless Newcastle’s passing becomes more considered, that chaos threatens to engulf them.Louise TaylorMatch report:Newcastle 2-3 BrentfordView image in fullscreenDango Ouattara (left) wheels away after making it 3-2 to Brentford late on.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/Reuters5Practice makes perfect for MbeumoBryan Mbeumo’s opener featured Kobbie Mainoo running from Tottenham’s goal towards Bruno Fernandes’s corner from the left and turning the ball, without looking, to the forward, whose finish was guided, inch-perfect, into the bottom right corner. Yet in practice the routine did not go well.“We did it once, it didn’t work out, but this one was the most important,” Mbeumo said of a goal that helpedManchester Unitedto a fourth consecutive league win. Michael Carrick’s team are up to 44 points with a goal difference of +10 yet Mbeumo is keeping calm. “We just want to take it game by game, train as hard as possible and keep working,” he said. He now has 10 goals in 21 appearances since signing last summer.Jamie JacksonMatch report:Manchester United 2-0 Tottenham6Angel can be more than fourth GomesIn the end, there were just the three Gomeses on the pitch at the same time for Wolves at Molineux: Rodrigo Gomes entered at half-time to join João Gomes and the new signing Angel Gomes. Toti Gomes was absent with a thigh injury. Angel Gomes, who joined on loan from Marseille on deadline day, enjoyed a decent debut against Chelsea. The 25-year-old, who aged 16 became Manchester United’s youngest player since Duncan Edwards, impressed in difficult circumstances. Wolves were 3-0 down inside 38 minutes but the midfielder showed glimpses of quality. Sixteen months on from his England debut, aPremier Leaguechance could help get his career back on track. “He’s got that killer pass, maybe something we haven’t quite had,” said the Wolves head coach, Rob Edwards, who worked with Gomes when he was part of England’s Under-20s setup. “He’s got those forward passes in the locker and hopefully we’ll see a lot more of it, the more integrated he gets.”Ben FisherMatch report:Wolves 1-3 ChelseaView image in fullscreenAngel Gomes gave Rob Edwards some cause for cheer.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/Shutterstock7Rayan shines again on stellar home debutRayan has played just 109 minutes for Bournemouth but Andoni Iraola is already having to tamp down the hype. Aston Villa’s defence gave the Brazilian teenager little room in the first half but one run past a dumbfounded Lucas Digne set the scene. When Rayan set off for his solo equaliser Digne looked around desperately for help, but it was already too late. Rayan also showed off his physical capabilities and headed one loose ball off the crossbar. Iraola gave a reminder that playing with flair is only part of the job, saying the 19-year-old can “cover a little bit our lack of physicality, to help us even in the aerial duels, in the set plays”. A cramping Rayan departed on 87 minutes and Iraola preached caution before Tuesday’s trip Everton. “He’s 19, comes to the best league in the world probably, he is used to playing a different rhythm.”JBMatch report:Bournemouth 1-1 Aston Villa8Disasi adds steel to Nuno’s defenceIt has taken a while but Nuno Espírito Santo finally has a clean sheet in his West Ham reign, at the 24th time of asking. In many ways, keeping outBurnleyfor 90 minutes is a limited achievement considering the hosts’ lack of cutting edge in the final third, but at least it’s a platform to build on. The goalkeeper Mads Hermansen was recalled to the starting lineup for the first time since September and, despite early nerves, put in a solid performance. More promising was the calm and measured debut of Axel Disasi, who arrived without playing a minute this season at Chelsea. Having been part of Enzo Maresca’s infamous bomb squad, the centre-back was able to ease his way through the afternoon at Turf Moor and could prove a shrewd signing in what will be a tight relegation battle.Will UnwinMatch report:Burnley 0-2 West HamView image in fullscreenAxel Disasi on the ball for West Ham.Photograph: Phil Oldham/Shutterstock9Silva exposed in game of two halvesMarco Silva’s in-game management was lacking during Fulham’s defeat. The match changed after half-time.Evertontook control in midfield and David Moyes made two attacking substitutions when they were 1-0 down. Silva did not turn to his bench until it was 1-1. The frustration for Fulham is they should have been out of sight by the end of the first half. They were the better side but missed a host of chances. Silva said he warned his players that a reaction was coming from Everton. Did he tell himself the same thing? Everton pressed higher and forced Fulham back. A problem for Silva is that his go-to defensive midfielder, Sasa Lukic, is injured and was not available to shore things up during the second half. Did Fulham miss a trick by not signing cover for the Serbian? Silva had other options on the bench but was outdone by Moyes.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:Fulham 1-2 Everton10Calvert-Lewin for England?“England’s No 9” was the chant reverberating around Elland Road as Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored his 10th Premier League goal of the season. Slightly tongue in cheek but a compelling narrative is starting to form around an international recall. The facts speak volumes. This is Calvert-Lewin’s best goal-scoring season since 2020-21, when he was an England regular and in the best form of his career at Everton. No Englishman has more goals in the Premier League this season than the 28-year-old, who was instrumental in Leeds’ 3-1 victory overNottingham Forest. Thomas Tuchel will clearly need cover and backup for Harry Kane at the World Cup. While Ollie Watkins and others are options, Calvert-Lewin’s form is becoming difficult to ignore. His move to Leeds was a gamble for both parties, but it has paid off handsomely.Aaron BowerMatch report:Leeds 3-1 Nottingham ForestPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal2532562Man City2527503Aston Villa259474Man Utd2510445Chelsea2517436Liverpool255397Brentford255398Everton250379Sunderland25-23610Fulham25-23411AFC Bournemouth25-33412Newcastle25-13313Crystal Palace25-33214Brighton2513115Tottenham Hotspur2502916Leeds25-92917Nottm Forest25-132618West Ham25-172319Burnley25-241520Wolverhampton25-328Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballLiverpoolManchester CityBrighton & Hove AlbionCrystal PalaceArsenalSunderlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are times when you can get a decision absolutely right and still you get criticised on all sides.In the final seconds at Anfield on Sunday, with theLiverpoolgoalkeeper Alisson caught upfield, Rayan Cherki rolled the ball towards the Liverpool goal. Erling Haaland gave chase and would have gotten there to nudge the ball definitively over the line but he was pulled back by Dominik Szoboszlai, who would then have caught up with the ball to clear had he not been pulled back by Haaland. The ball crossed the line but the referee Craig Pawson, after a VAR review, gave not a goal but a free-kick for the first offence, sending Szoboszlai off for the denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.Erling Haaland admits ‘statement’ Manchester City win means more than three pointsRead more“Common sense no?” said Pep Guardiola, put in the strange position of opposing a decision that technically went for his team. “We won the game [but] now Dominik Szoboszlai cannot play. I know he pulled him but how many pulls [are there] and the referee says play on in this country, in this league? Give a goal, 3-1, Szoboszlai can play and we are happy.”“I can live with the fact, although I don’t like it, that the referee follows the rulebook,” said Arne Slot. “Dominik makes a foul on Haaland in that last situation, which is a clear shirt-pull and he was through to goal so he would have scored. So that’s a red card. And I think the Sunderland manager is really happy that he gives the red card. So that’s the rulebook and you follow the rulebook.”Szoboszlai will be suspended for Wednesday’s game away to Sunderland.“Just give the goal, don’t give a red card. Simple as that,” Haaland said.Many pundits seemed to agree. On commentary on Sky, for instance, Gary Neville called it a “killjoy” decision that “killed one of the great moments” and lamented “a smell of the game that’s completely gone”. There seemed a general sense that this was another example of VAR ruining the game. “Before VAR it’s a goal,” said Wayne Rooney on Match of the Day, “so let’s go back to it.”But this isn’t really a VAR issue. This isn’t technology exposing a microscopic detail to penalise that which would previously have gone unnoticed. If there is a criticism of Pawson in this instance, it’s that he needed VAR to get the decision correct – although it’s understandable that he should stand behind it. This is simply process. Referees have a certain amount of discretion but they can’t simply ignore offences because they have a sense that to do so somehow feels right.Szoboszlai would have cleared the ball had he not been fouled by Haaland. Therefore it cannot be a goal. But Haaland would have scored had he not been fouled by Szoboszlai so Pawson goes back to that offence: free-kick and a red card. Fouls don’t just cancel out. It might have been more fun for the goal to stand but fun is not the referee’s job. He has to ensure the laws are followed and that it’s fair for everybody – including teams who were not involved in the game.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo attempts to burst past Milos Kerkez during City’s win over Liverpool.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAArsenal are six points ahead of City with a goal difference that is five better. With 13 games to go there remains a significant possibility of a tight title race. Imagine Cherki’s goal is given and the sides finish level on points, but City take the league because their goal difference is one better. Would it be fair that Arsenal lost the title because of a goal scored after an obvious foul by Haaland? Or say the goal had been given, Szoboszlai had stayed on and he then scores the winner against Sunderland on Wednesday: would that be fair to Liverpool’s challengers for Champions League qualification? Or on Sunderland for whatever places in the league table and prize money that costs?There has been a lot of resigned talk since the incident of how the decision may be correct within the letter of the law, as though the law should somehow not be as it is. But think of the incentives created if the goal were given. Do we really want players who have been fouled but an advantage played to have carte blanche then to foul the player who fouled them? Fouls are bad: if this situation is unsatisfactory it is because Szoboszlai cheated, which is why he had to be sent off.Refereeing is an extremely difficult job. They are often making fractional decisions at high speed with a view that can be impeded. Their decisions are often necessarily subjective: Earlier in the game, when Marc Guéhi fouled a through-on-goal Mohamed Salah, was that the denial of a goalscoring opportunity? Possibly, but probably not. Neither decision, though, would have been categorically wrong. Pawson determined that it wasn’t, and Guéhi stayed on.Slot moaning about that decision is tedious but understandable and predictable. But complaining about a decision that was not merely correct, but the only possible decision, makes no sense at all.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Hackney went close to putting Boro further ahead, firing inches wide of Cooper’s right-hand post before Bamford had a great chance to equalise, bringing the ball down from a superb Hamer pass and firing a fraction wide of the target.Brynn came to Middlesbrough’s rescue with a superb save to keep out Hamer’s well-struck effort and Cooper did likewise for Sheffield United, getting down well to turn Whittaker’s shot wide.The visitors went 2-0 up in the final minute of the half when Hackney’s drive struck Cooper’s right-hand post, the ball bounced up and McGree was quickest to react, heading the loose ball into the unguarded net.As the home side looked for an early second-half goal to inspire a revival, an inviting ball across the face of goal from Callum O’Hare was just too far in front of the lurking Bamford. Bamford did pull a goal back in the 73rd minute, controlling a great ball into the area from Hamer before beating Brynn from 12 yards.Rothwell, who came on as a substitute at the start of the second half, was shown a red card in the 80th minute following a reckless challenge on Alan Browne and that all but ended any hopes of getting anything from the game.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedMiddlesbroughmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the intervening years they formed a formidable ­partnership, sharing an office throughout, with Green an architect, alongside Hayes, of an ambitious blueprint that would take the women’s team to the top of English and European football. He was particularly involved in the club’s recruitment strategy alongside Hayes, masterminding a process that would have Chelsea operating three or four transfer windows ahead.WSL talking points: Arsenal punish City and Chelsea get into the grooveRead moreGiving an insight into their relationship in 2023 Hayes said that she would “tell him I want to get to the moon, he’ll tell me the rocket isn’t built yet”.Green also stepped in, alongside assistant manager Denise Reddy, to lead the team when Hayes missed six games due to an emergency hysterectomy.During his time at the club they won 19 trophies, including eight league titles and six FA Cups.Sam Kerr praised his influence on social media: “Thank you PG for everything you have done for us!” the forward wrote. “We wouldn’t have all the success we have had without you! Big big loss for the club.” Erin Cuthbert also posted on Green’s impact on her career.The loss of Green’s experience and wider influence within the game marks a sea change at Chelsea, with the head of women’s football having been widely considered a key ­continuity piece following Hayes’s decision to leave the club to become head coach of the US women’s national team.The Guardian understands that Green’s influence and role in decision-making has been increasingly impeded at Chelsea, with co-sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, taking more of an active role around the women’s team.Green’s departure comes days after the club announced anew long-term contractfor the manager, Sonia Bompastor, who he helped recruit following the departure of Hayes, and who achieved an unbeaten domestic treble in her first season in charge. However, Bompastor has come under fire from a section of Chelsea fans in recent weeks after back-to-back defeats to Manchester City and Arsenal compounded feelings around a string of poor performances. It was the first time the Blues had suffered successive losses since 2015.Chelsea’s statement said: “His commitment, experience and professionalism have been valued across the club, and his work has helped support a sustained period of success and progress forChelsea Womenduring which we won 19 trophies. The club would like to thank Paul for his dedication and service over more than a decade and wishes him well for the future.”Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Victory would be their first in an away match since December but the 48-year-old manager remains confident he can navigate his fatigued side out of their slump.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead more“I think the key question I always have to ask myself is: ‘Am I the right person to take the team and the club forward?’ There’s no doubt in my mind [that I’m the right man],” said Howe, whose players have sometimes failed to cope with a relentless fixture list prompted, partly, by their ongoing involvement in the ­Champions League. “If there was [doubt] I wouldn’t be [here] because the club’s the most important thing. I’d never put myself before the club.”Howe appears cautiously optimistic that arguably the most testing period of his near four and a half years in charge at St James’ Park will prove a temporary phase.“If I didn’t think I was the correct man to take the team forward and could give the players what they need, then I would step aside and let someone else do it,” he said. “The momentum is against us at the moment. We have to swing it back – the world can look a very different place within a couple of games.”Although the manager is understood to retain the full support of the Saudi Arabian-owned club’s UK‑based hierarchy, some ­Newcastle supporters are becoming noisily disgruntled as they deconstruct the team’s tactical approach.Howe’s preferred high-intensity, hard-pressing, often counterattacking style – or “going for opponents’ throats”, as he puts it – has real ­merit but he acknowledges there are ­serious questions to be answered about his players’ frequently poor ball retention. Not for nothing have the Brentford manager, Keith Andrews, and his Leeds counterpart, Daniel Farke, described recent games at Newcastle as “chaotic”.“There are challenges for us in possession,” said Howe, whose players look increasingly exhausted. “I think we need to be better with the ball. I think that was evident on Saturday [during the3-2 home defeat by Brentford]. The control aspect of our game was poor. It was a very transitional game.“In some senses though, history tells us that we’re really good at the transition games. Inthe Leeds game[won 4-3 at St James’ Park in ­January] being transitional helped us win. The fact that it was end to end and it was open meant our attacking players could take advantage. But against Liverpool and Manchester City in recent games, the transition aspect didn’t help us. So it’s something we need to look at.”View image in fullscreenNewcastle’s No 9, Yoane Wissa, has looked rusty since a knee injury.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesSome observers wonder whether Newcastle’s assiduous manager has become so obsessed with an endless stream of statistics and data that he is losing sight of the bigger, creative, picture and perhaps ­prompting ­players of the calibre of his Italy midfielder Sandro Tonali to consider alternative options. “I don’t think performances have been particularly bad,” Howe said, perhaps tellingly. “Statistically we’re strong in games but the results haven’t matched.”If many of Howe’s problems centre on a raft of recent injuries to key personnel including Tino Livramento, Joelinton and Fabian Schär, uncertainty in the centre-forward position is also a factor. In the past three games Anthony Gordon, Nick Woltemade, Yoane Wissa and Will Osula have taken turns in the role. None have convinced.Although Woltemade and Wissa cost more than £120m combined, they have not yet proved adequate successors to Alexander Isak, whose acrimonious £125m departure for Liverpool last summer arguably prompted some panic buying.Woltemade is gifted but is much more a No 10 than a 9, Wissa looks rusty after a knee injury, Gordon is a winger and Osula inexperienced and highly erratic. Howe has been reluctant to pair Woltemade and Wissa but there seems a case for altering his hallmark 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1 with Woltemade at No 10.“We have new players we’re trying to bed into the team format,” he said. “I’ve got to be honest, it’s not quite functioned fully yet.”For the moment at least, he remains confident of finding a solution. He described his task as being to give value and help the players. “So, as long as I feel that in my heart and in my spirit, then my desire and my motivation levels are as high as they’ve ever been.”That resolve could be tested in the coming days and weeks. After the Tottenham game, a Newcastle side without a win in five Premier League matches travel to Aston Villa for an FA Cup fourth-round tie on Saturday.Then comes a draining midweek trip to Baku to face Qarabag of Azerbaijan in a Champions League playoff followed by a Saturday league engagement at title-chasing Manchester City.“We have to defend better,” said Howe. “And be more clinical at the other end.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HowenewsShareReuse this content"

Under the rules of the Football Association of the Maldives (FAM), however, any team that fail play a match forfeit the game 2-0, a score that was enough to stay up.The club sent down in Green Streets’ stead, Club Valencia, have not taken the matter lying down. Having won their final match, Valencia immediately issued a statement accusing their rivals of “fixing the outcome of the match”. Valencia said Green Streets behaviour was “disgusting” and had violated the rights of Valencia and New Radiant.The FAM responded to the controversy by placing Green Streets under a transfer ban and fining the club 50,000 Maldivian rufiyaa (£2,380). It also warned the club over their future conduct, saying: “If Green Streets repeats their actions, the committee has sent a warning stating they will take even stricter measures against the club.” But, crucially, it allowed the result to stand.In a second statement Valencia said they did not accept the FAM’s verdict. “The club believes that the decision was made to show favouritism,” said Valencia, who suggested they would escalate their complaint to the Asian Football Confederation and Fifa.Green Street said they “categorically deny” any accusations of match-fixing and blamed an outbreak of diarrhea and flu for calling the game off. “The team and management were present at the venue, with club officials and several players arriving on time, clearly demonstrating our intention to compete”, the club said in a statement. “Unfortunately, a significant number of our registered players were affected, which directly impacted squad availability on matchday. At no point did Green Street act with intent to forfeit or manipulate the outcome of the match.”Explore more on these topicsFootballMaldivesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was more of the same in Serie ANicky BandiniMon 9 Feb 2026 07.20 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 07.22 ESTShareYou might not be shocked to learn that Daniele De Rossi thinks football has gone soft. Since retiring and moving into management, the man with the “beware the sliding tackle” tattoo has acknowledged he sometimes misses getting to stick the boot in. But would the stick figure seen flying into an opponent on the back of his right calf even stand a chance in this era of VAR?“I don’t know what to say any more,” lamented De Rossi after his Genoa team lost 3-2 toNapolion Saturday. “The football we played no longer exists. We were naïve, but it seems I don’t know anything. I don’t know what sport I am coaching.”The sentiment was activated by a penalty award in second-half injury time. Maxwel Cornet, who only entered the game moments earlier, was clumsy as he challenged Antonio Vergara, catching the forward’s standing boot. Vergara made the most of the contact, but it was certainly there.That was the conclusion reached, too, by the referee Davide Massa after the VAR booth told him to take a second look. Rasmus Højlund converted the eventual penalty, barely, denyingGenoawhat could have been an important point in their fight against relegation.View image in fullscreenA frustrated Daniele De Rossi during Genoa’s narrow defeat by Napoli.Photograph: Felice De Martino/SPP/ShutterstockHe is hardly the first to air such frustrations. The application of VAR has been a divisive topic in every place it has ever been introduced. De Rossi insisted that he used to be its “first supporter” since “it would have saved me from being robbed a few times in my playing days”, but argued that the notion of clear and obvious errors had been lost. For one reason or another, his lament seemed to resonate this weekend.Gian Piero Gasperini picked up the thread before Roma’s game against Cagliari, saying: “I think we managers need to get together and make our voices heard. I think exactly the same as Daniele and so does every other coach I speak to.“This kind of football is unpopular with us, it’s unpopular with the public, it’s confusing and ugly to see matches with strange cards and penalties that the fans never see. With obvious simulations, everyone on the bench jumping in the air, provoking the referee. Maybe we managers need to do something useful.”On Sunday the baton passed to Luciano Spalletti, who had frustrations of his own after Juventus’s 2-2 draw at home to Lazio. TheBianconerihad a pair of goals disallowed for offside, with the first – when the game was still goalless – preceded by strong appeals for a penalty. Mario Gila was late with his challenge on Juan Cabal, an offence that seemed to get lost in the review of Khéphren Thuram’s positioning for Teun Koopmeiners’s subsequent strike into the bottom corner.View image in fullscreenTeun Koopmeiners shows his dismay after his goal for Juventus against Lazio is disallowed.Photograph: Marco Alpozzi/LaPresse/ShutterstockSpalletti almost moved the topic on from a conversation about contact into one about consent. Speaking to Dazn’s Federica Zille at full time, he was monologuing on the need for more nuance in the interpretation of footballing laws. To illustrate his argument, he asked: “Can I give you a kiss?” Then, without waiting for a reply, leaned in to give her one on the shoulder.“I gave you a kiss, and that’s a form of contact,” said Spalletti. “I touched you, that’s a form of contact. You need to see what kind of contact it is. The difficulty always comes when people think they can make rules that say: ‘A handball is always a penalty, a step on a foot is always a penalty.’”Zille was visibly caught off guard but laughed as she turned back to the camera. Diletta Leotta in the studio checked in on her colleague, asking “everything OK?” and Zille replied: “I needed to reassure everyone at home.”Much like the fouls Spalletti was discussing, this felt like a moment to interpret with nuance. These were not the actions of Luis Rubiales, grabbing Jenni Hermoso and forcing a kiss on her lips. Spalletti was deliberate in avoiding Zille’s face, to make his gesture more innocuous.Still, we can wonder if he would have used the same analogy with a male reporter. Asking Zille for permission to kiss her was an unfair position to put her in live on air and if you are going to seek consent then you should give the other person time to respond.Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowBologna 0-1 Parma, Fiorentina 2-2 Torino, Genoa 2-3 Napoli, Juventus 2-2 Lazio, Lecce 2-1 Udinese, Sassuolo 0-5 Inter, Verona 0-0 PisaMonday(Times GMT) Atalanta v Cremonese (5.30pm), Roma v Cagliari (7.45pm)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.On the substance of his argument, manySerie Amanagers are agreed. Spalletti extended his point by calling for professionalisation of refereeing in Italy. Although match officials are paid at a comparable rate to other top leagues, they have lacked a professional body. Moves are under way to form one, along the lines of England’s PGMO, though not without resistance.Then again, complaints about refereeing are nothing new. As much as they became the hot topic this week, perhaps this column has done the actual football a disservice by joining that discussion. De Rossi’s underlying frustration doubtless grew from seeing his team throw away points at the end of another spirited performance.View image in fullscreenRasmus Højlund (front in centre) takes the acclaim of his Napoli teammates.Photograph: Luca Zennaro/EPAGenoa have been transformed since his appointment to replace Patrick Vieira last November. Winless, and bottom of the table, under the Frenchman, they scored more goals in De Rossi’s first three games than they had in the opening 10 without him.Three months later, they remain an imperfect team, but a competitive one. De Rossi’s formation change to a 3-5-2 has been vindicated. Vieira mostly used a back-four and a lone striker, but the current forward pairing of Lorenzo Colombo and Vitinha have gone from zero goal contributions in that opening part of the campaign to now having nine strikes and two assists between them.They got some help from a catastrophic Alessandro Buongiorno. Within 10 seconds of kick-off, the Napoli centre-back had played his team into trouble with an ill-judged back-pass that resulted in the goalkeeper Alex Meret bringing down Vitinha for a penalty. Ruslan Malinovskyi buried it.It took another Scott McTominay masterclass to drag Napoli out of trouble. His shot after 20 minutes was spilled into the path of Højlund for an easy finish. Then the Scotland international scored a 25-yard screamer of his own.But Genoa pulled level in the second half when Colombo stole the ball from a lackadaisical Buongiorno in the middle of the pitch, sprinting away and scoring into the bottom corner. At 23, striker Colombo is starting to show the sort of form that could capture the attention of Italy’s manager Gennaro Gattuso. His six goals in this brief chapter under De Rossi are as many as he managed in 37 Serie A appearances for Empoli last season, and more than he got in full seasons at Monza and Lecce before that.When Juan Jesus was sent off with a quarter of an hour to go, Genoa looked the more likely team to go on and win. They have shown tremendous battling spirit in recent weeks, fighting back from 2-0 down to beat Bologna, then almost repeating the trick against Lazio, only to lose to a goal scored from a penalty awarded after a VAR check and converted in the 10th minute of second-half injury time.That context makes it easier to understand why De Rossi’s frustrations boiled over, the replay booth once again coming to the rescue of Genoa’s opponents. “We’re giving [the technology] a dangerous power,” he reflected. “But there’s no turning back now. The game will change, and that will be a loss for everyone.”PosTeamPGDPts1Inter Milan2438582AC Milan2321503Napoli2413494Juventus2421465Roma2313436Como2321417Atalanta2310368Lazio243339Udinese24-93210Bologna2413011Sassuolo24-72912Cagliari23-32813Torino24-182714Parma24-142615Cremonese23-112316Genoa24-82317Lecce24-162118Fiorentina24-111819Pisa24-211520Verona24-2315Explore more on these topicsSerie AEuropean club footballNapoliGenoaJuventusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She bombed down the ramp – part Evel Knievel, part Simone Biles – flew off it, and then twisted her body through four and a half rotations. The trick? A backside 1620 – one that had been completed only once in history.It looked perfect. Until she overspun slightly and landed on her heels. And with that her dreams of an Olympic medal had faded into fourth place.Later the 19-year-old revealed that she had no plans to attempt the trick – until she stood in fourth place before her last jump.“It’s not like it’s a trick that I could do,” she said. “I’ve only ever done it on the airbag and the last time I tried it was five months ago. So that was the first time I’ve ever tried it on snow. But sometimes you’ve just got to grit your teeth and get it done.“I thought I’d got it and I did get it. I got it to my feet but I just gave it too much power, listening to my music too loud, I spun it too quickly. But yeah, I’m pumped.“I was ­listening to a lot of Pantera. I tried it and I’m not lying in a hospital bed after this, to be honest. All jokes aside, it’s a gnarly trick to do. There is a higher risk, ­especially when you know I would be the second woman to do it. So, yeah it’s pretty scary.”Most agreed that had Brookes landed it she would have secured at least a bronze medal, and possibly silver. Instead she could only applaud as Japan’s Kokomo Murase took gold, New Zealand’s Zoi Sadowski-Synnott won silver, with the Korean Yu ­Seung-eun claiming bronze.So close. Yet so far. And alas, it was that sort of day for Team GB. Before the start of play there were hopes within the British ­contingent that they could witness Magic Monday, with potential medals for Brookes, Kirsty Muir in the freeski ­slopestyle, and the mixed curling team, who were ­favourites in their semi-final against ­Sweden.But this was a day where Magic Monday turned into Tragic Monday. First Muir missed out on a medal by 0.41 of a point, after­thinking she might have done enough. No wonder she was in tears after finishing fourth.Soon afterwards it was the turn of Team GB mixed curlers to disappoint. Having won eight of their nine group games, Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds were strong favourites for their semi-final against Sweden. But having gone into an early 1-0 lead, everything started to go wrong. In the second end, a poor clearance from Mouat allowed the Swedes to go 2-1 up. They lost the hammer to go 3-1 down. But having clawed it back to 3-3, the British pair made three mistakes in a row during a Swedish powerplay and dropped five shots.View image in fullscreenJen Dodds and Bruce Mouat lost their semi-final to Sweden and will have to try for a bronze medal on Tuesday.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockSoon afterwards it was over as Team GB lost 9-3 in a puzzlingly meek performance. “That was my worst game of the week and it put us behind from the get-go,” Dodds said. “Obviously not the result we were after. They played great. They capitalised on all of our mistakes. They’ve been on a roll the last ­couple of games with the round robin as well.”There was more disappointment as Team GB’s ice dancers, Lewis Gibson and Lilah Fear, were left in fourth place after scoring 85.47 in the rhythm dance. They lie behind the French pair of Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron (90.18), the USA’s Madison Chock and Evan Bates (89.72) and Canada’s Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier (86.18) and face a battle to win a medal.Still, all of them will have chances of redemption. On Tuesday, Mouat and Dodds will play the defending ­champions Italy, who lost 9-8 to the US in the other semi-final, in the bronze medal match. Fear and Gibson have the free programme on ­Wednesday. And Muir and Brookes compete in their best events next week.View image in fullscreenLilah Fear and Lewis Gibson danced to music by the Spice Girls but were fourth after the rhythm dance with their free programme to come on Wednesday.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesBrookes, for one, is still buzzing after coming so close to making Olympic history. “And the girl that won, Koko, she’s the only girl that has that trick right now,” she said.“So if I’d have landed it I would have been the second woman to do it. It’s really special. For women snowboarding if I’d have landed that it would have been insane.”Brookes also reminded us that these freeskiers and snowboarders are built differently. For while they would love an Olympic medal, ­pushing the boundaries of what is possible is just as important.“I think everyone will be just as stoked about me trying a 16 than me getting a medal,” she said. And when asked if she would go all out again next week, Brookes’ response was unflinching. “Oh yeah, 100% definitely.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Much of the opposition centres around antisocial behaviour experienced during England matches and, as revealed by the Guardian, theRFU hosted a drop-in event for residentsin an effort to convince them that their concerns were being taken seriously.Six Nations on road to perdition unless chastening Celtic wake-up call is heeded | Robert KitsonRead moreLast Saturday, it is understood that 24 FPNs were handed out to those committing urinating offences which took place in a number of places including front gardens, alleyways, main roads, and bushes. That is despite attempts to tackle the problem by installing barriers in hotspots and deploying plain-clothed officers and stewards to ward off potential offenders. The FPN amount is £150 but if paid within 10 days it goes down to £100.Councillor Gareth Roberts, leader of Richmond council, said: “We love the fact that Twickenham is the home of English Rugby and that people come from round the world to visit our borough and watch a match, but rugby fans should take this as a warning. If we catch you using our borough as a toilet, we will fine you. No ifs, no buts.”As revealed by the Guardian in October, theunion raised the possibility of using “anti-pee paint”, which is designed to leave offenders “covered in their own urine”, when applying for a new licence, which would have paved the way for more concerts.View image in fullscreenThe RFU tried to crack down on antisocial behaviour from rugby fans going to and from Twickenham for the England-Wales game.Photograph: Simon King/ProSports/ShutterstockLast month, the RFU laid out its plans to tackle antisocial behaviour. The union said it was “strengthening coordination with the relevant authorities and ensuring that antisocial behaviour has clear consequences, including working with the Metropolitan police, TfL, and Richmond council so matchday issues can be dealt with quickly and appropriately, and that fixed-penalty notices are being issued for offences such as public urination”.When applying for a new licence in September, the RFU had a setback when Richmond council determined that the limit of three concerts – and only one not on a Saturday – must remain. The licensing subcommittee meeting was told that there were 192 representations against extending the RFU’s licence and only 13 in favour. One representation read: “The pavements and roads are unhygienic, and children are having to walk and scoot through dried urine and excrement,” while another provided evidence showing “urination and indecent exposure” on the individual’s property.The RFU’s push for more concerts is running in two parts: licensing and planning. The union also had a setback with its planning application last summer but intends to reapply after the local elections in May as well as request a new licence. Before then, the union is on a charm offensive with local residents, vowing to “be the best neighbour we can be”.There is only one more men’s international – against Ireland later this month – before the RFU resubmits its application to the council. Only five days before the local elections, however, Twickenham will host the annual Army v Navy match which has been notorious for antisocial behaviour in the past.Meanwhile, Steve Borthwick is set to keep changes to a minimum for England’s trip to Scotland on Saturday after his side put Wales to the sword in a 48-7 win last weekend. Ollie Lawrence is expected to miss out on a return to the side with Tommy Freeman remaining in the centres with Fraser Dingwall. Borthwick is also poised to keep faith with hat-trick hero Henry Arundell and Tom Roebuck, who was a late call-up to replace the injured Immanuel Feyi-Waboso against Wales. In the pack, it would be a major surprise if Borthwick does not restore Maro Itoje to the second row and the captaincy.England head to Murrayfield on the back of 12 straight wins to face a Scotland side who were stunned by Italy in Rome last week but the fullback Freddie Steward said: “Regardless of what has been before, when Scotland play England, you get the best of them. I don’t think it will affect their mentality too much but we know that when they come and play us, they’ll be full of emotion and ready to go.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026England rugby union teamWales rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

We are ­looking into what exactly the ­problem is.“We will pay maximum attention to the medals. So that everything will be perfect because this is one of the most important things for the athletes.”Organisers have since suggested that the problem may stem from the medal’s cord, which is fitted with a breakaway mechanism required by law. The system is designed to release automatically if pulled with force, preventing the wearer from being choked.There were similar issues with the Paris 2024 Olympic medals, with more than 200 requests for replacements – roughly 4% of those awarded.Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026newsShareReuse this content"

It was lovely to see them and know they are so proud of me, no matter what.”Winter Olympian Gus Kenworthy says he has received death threats over anti-ICE protestRead moreEveryone knows that fourth is the worst place to finish at an Olympics. But, for Muir, this result stung like pouring a gallon of antiseptic on an open sore.Coming into this final, Muir knew she was a strong favourite for a medal. She had won this event at the X Games two weeks ago with a score of 93.66, before qualifying third here. On this day, it just wasn’t to be.Instead the Swiss star Mathilde Gremaud defended her Olympic title with a score of 86.96 points, while China’s Eileen Gu repeated her second place in Beijing with 86.48. While Muir knew she was not at her best, she felt that bronze was there for the taking.Slopestyle involves three runs, involving skiing on rails before attempting three big tricks, with the highest-scoring run counting. And having fallen on her first run, and made a minor mistake on her second, Muir approached her final attempt knowing she needed to beat the 76.46 by Canada’s Megan Oldham to make the podium.The rails went well. The first trick was nailed. Then came a wobble on the second. It meant Muir needed to be perfect on a final jump, a huge double cork 1440, to give herself a chance. She was – and the reaction of the British team afterwards suggested it might be enough. But after a long wait, the judges had other ideas. Muir had scored 76.05 – and missed out on bronze by 0.41 points.View image in fullscreenMathilde Gremaud celebrates winning gold in the women’s freeski slopestyle at the Winter Olympics.Photograph: Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“I’m obviously a bit sad,” she said. “It’s just a tough place to be, fourth. I had a bit of difficulty in the first two runs. I got a bit annoyed at myself after my second run, and I’m really happy that I managed to pull myself back before my third run.“On the second jump, I was trying for a mute grab in my double just because it just makes it a little bit harder,” she said. “And I was really pushing for that extra boost that that might give me. And today it slipped away from me.“So I went back to safety to just get a run down and get my 14 in the last jump, because that’s one of my biggest tricks.”Muir will have another chance to win a medal when she competes in the big air next week, an event in which she finished fifth in Beijing. But, for now, this defeat has hit much harder than four years ago.“It feels completely different from 2022 because the last time I was 17, I put the tricks down to come fifth, the best I’d ever done them,” she said. “I was so proud of myself. It’s hard to say how I’m feeling right now. I’ve got a lot to process.As she spoke, Oldham was revelling in her surprise bronze medal. “I can’t even believe it, it’s crazy,” she said. “I’ve been dreaming about this for so long. I had a concussion two months ago and wasn’t really sure if I’d be able to ski.”The Canadian’s smile was a picture. The contrast with Muir could hardly have been greater.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She pulls off her racing hood, shakes her long hair loose, and glides around the track for a little longer, then eventually pulls up at one of the soft barriers and collapses across it, eyeliner leaving tracks across her cheeks as she weeps and weeps.Her opponent in that race, the gold medallist last time, Tigaki Miho finishes with brozne this time for Japan, a much more reserved expression on her face as she slows down.Tears for Jutta Leerdam after taking gold!..Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/Reuters… and tears from fiance Jake Paul!Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APShareUpdated at12.50 EST"

No. Possibly not even the greatest of half-term. This loud, chaotic and unlovable animated kids’ comedy feels as though it is bordering on AI slop, algorithmically generated and instantly familiar fromZootropolis,Singand other movies with talking animals. It is a shame, because it has a real-life inspiration: basketball star Stephen Curry, who was repeatedly told at the start of his career that he was too skinny and too small to make it as a pro. Curry is a producer here, and has a performing role. But in spite of this connection, Goat lacks heart and soul, and a sense of genuine emotions.What it does have is some pretty decent voice acing, bringing a degree of charm to the movie. Will Harris (voiced by Caleb McLaughlin) is a goat who has grown up dreaming of playing professional “roarball”, a fiercer and faster version of basketball. But Will is a “small” and roar players are all “bigs” – powerful beasts such as rhinos and horses. Will’s hero and the star of his favourite team, the Thorns, is a panther called Jet (Gabrielle Union), a champ close to retirement but determined to win the league. When Will gets a shot at joining the Thorns, he is laughed at, underrated but undeterred.There are some decent jokes, but they are lost in all the noise. Watching Goat is like standing next to a helicopter as it’s taking off. The roarball games are deafening, and pitched at lightning speed, in courts that switch from jungle settings to an arctic ice experience. The underdog plot is as old as time, and for a film targeted at under-eights there are a lot of scenes with mobile phones, and characters constantly checking their socials. The only thing that lingers after leaving the cinema is a headache.Goat is out on 13 February in the UK and US, and on 26 March in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsComedy filmsBasketballStephen CurryComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his2008 convictionin Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.Despitemurmuringsamong crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.Coinbase’s questionable cashThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong,has heavily influencedcrypto regulation in the United States.Epstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder ofTether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.Documentspublished by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additionalfilingssuggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.A spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.Backing bitcoinEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MITacceptedmore than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.In communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.In 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment inBlockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, wereinvitedby Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.On Twitter, Backclaimedthat Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.In communications with an Italian investor, Epsteinnotedthat he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017,checking inwith his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.Epstein emails elicit muted backlash from crypto industryLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, hascalled forAdam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.Charlotte Fang, the founder ofRemilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann ofKomodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchangesmightsee new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.As to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.Cryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor atYork Universitywhostudiescrypto.“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.In my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonistSteven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.It’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny.

Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”View image in fullscreenA friend, but not my wife: fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overviewwas “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically isnotmy wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:Textile designerFiona Scott-Wilson.PoetBridget Rose.ActorFiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.EconomistAnn Pettifor.Julia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this isthe fantasy author,the illustrator,the late powerlifteror another Julia Mills altogether).Writer and journalistEmily Rees.Lawyer and academicSiva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmasterJonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.Writer and journalistCarrie McLaren.Channel 4 News presenterCathy Newman.CNN correspondentClarissa Ward.Journalist and broadcasterRachel Johnson.My own daughter.View image in fullscreenEconomist Ann Pettifor.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.Then it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does heexist?There was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. PlaywrightLee Hallgot a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.As for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).Another search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalistAnn Widdecombe(hisex-wife),Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author,Polly Toynbeeis a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”View image in fullscreenCNN’s Clarissa Ward.Photograph: John Lamparski/Getty Images for Concordia SummitFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”I suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.While my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imaginethatfamily Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.We should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?I wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”Martin Rowson is a cartoonist and authorExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)OpinionComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

As he publishes a polemic about surveillance and state control, the artist relives a momentous trip to see his motherMon 9 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 10.29 ESTShareAi Weiwei is talking me through the decision-making process before his first visit to China in over a decade. The artist, known around the world as the most famous critic of the Chinese communist regime, had to do some fraught arithmetic before deciding to head back home.Before boarding a flight with his son, who had never met the artist’s elderly mother, Ai thought back to his time in detention when his captors told him he would spend the next13 years in custody on bogus charges: “They said, ‘When you come out, your son won’t recognise you.’ That was very heavy and really the only moment that touched me.”I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. That’s my only relationship to China. I’m not patrioticHe ended up spending several months in captivity. Lao, his son, is now 17. Ai says Lao doesn’t really need his guidance any more so he decided to book their flights and roll the dice. “People said, ‘Are you scared?’ I said, ‘No, why should I be scared?’ I’m Chinese. I have a Chinese passport. I’m entitled to go back and see my mum. So I went back.”View image in fullscreen100m hand-painted seeds … Ai’s famous Turbine Hall exhibition.Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty ImagesWelcome to the life of Ai Weiwei. For most people, returning home doesn’t involve weighing up the risk of whether you’ll see close family ever again, but that’s the reality for a 68-year-old whose whole existence has been shaped by authoritarianism and the struggle against it.His trip to China went well. He ended up being interviewed at the airport and released after a couple of hours into a country whose smells, sights and sounds were soothing to him. Ai described the journey as being like “a phone call suddenly reconnecting”. Today, he’s more poetic, describing it as “a piece of jade broken that you can put back together because it matches very well. Everything’s so familiar: the light, the temperature, the people.”Ai is meeting me in the London offices of his publisher to talk about his new book,On Censorship, a 90-page polemic on the nature of state control, AI and surveillance. The man certainly knows about these things. Born in Beijing in 1957, he grew up in labour camps in north-west China following the exile of his father, the poet Ai Qing. In 2011, he was detained for 81 days in a 170 sq ft windowless prison because of his own activism. Upon his release, he was tracked, interrogated and threatened by the Chinese state; then his passport was returned in 2015 and he began a life in exile. He currently divides his time between Lisbon, Berlin and Cambridge.I feel the same kind of surveillance and censorship in the westHis artworks are as dramatic as his backstory. An army of 1,600 Chinese artisans created100m hand-painted porcelain“seeds” that were scattered over the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in London 16 years ago. He cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus in 14,000 fluorescent orange lifejackets worn by refugees; and made a film dedicated to the children who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. That direct challenge to the official state narrative made him “the most dangerous person in China”.His upcoming work, at Aviva Studios in Manchester, involves 30 tonnes of buttons, which weresaved from a London factorythat was closing down and smuggled into China to be turned into huge hanging artworks by craftspeople.The book is a startling read, arguing that those in the west misunderstand the nature of censorship. He defines it as “the exercise of power over intellectual space”, both “an indispensable tool of mental enslavement and a fundamental source of political corruption”. It is not just authoritarian regimes, he warns. Liberal societies think that censorship is rare, “but people forget that even on sunny days, shadows are inevitable”.View image in fullscreenWorn by refugees … some of the 14,000 lifejackets that cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus.Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/EPASome of the arguments are perplexing. In a section about the limitations of AI, the artist refers to the selfie he took with AfD leaderAlice Weidel in 2018. He says AI decided that the image, which is real, must have been fake because the pair seemed to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At the time of the selfie, Weidel,whose grandfather was a Nazi, was considered to be in the more moderate wing of the far-right party, but since becoming leader has called for“large-scale repatriations” of foreigners, saying the country’s focus on the Holocaust is akin to a “guilt cult”.Does Ai regret the selfie? He tells me that on many issues, her political demands “could be wrong”, but she’s still “more rational than other political opponents in Germany”. What about her anti-immigrant rhetoric – isn’t that anathema to him? “Some states don’t even accept one [immigrant] and Germany accepts 1.2 million, which is a pretty generous decision,” he replies. “So if they change the policy and they want to limit it, then there is nothing wrong.”He’s also impressed by the fact that Weidel “openly wants Germany to be more independent from American influence”. He adds: “I think those are some of the things that we need to do.” Those who know German politics would find that argument surprising because the AfD are seen as the party who are closest to Trump and nearly all parties in the country want more independence from the US. A ringing endorsement of someone at the outermost reaches of far-right European politics might cause a few double takes, and there are more surprises.My position with China started before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in a black hole with my fatherAi’s attitude to China has shifted dramatically. The nation, he said recently, is “in an upward phase,” pointing to the technological advancements made and increased personal freedoms. The west, however, struggles to “sustain its own logic”, has lost its “ethical authority” and has “descended into something barely recognisable”.Although a quick glance across the Atlantic at America in the age of ICE raids does somewhat make his point, he means Europe, too. So is the Chinese regime’s most famous critic now toeing the party line? “My position withChinastarted before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in this black hole with my father,” he says, pointing to a picture on his iPhone of a desolate location in north-west China.He’s not angry exactly, but the suggestion that he’s softened on the Chinese government has touched a nerve. “I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. So that’s my only relationship to China,” he says. “I’m not nostalgic. I’m not patriotic.” What about the claim that the west embraces censorship? Is that his experience in the UK?“I cannot get into details,” he says cryptically. “But I feel the same kind of surveillance, same kind of censorship in the west.”View image in fullscreenDetail … the artist at work in his Berlin studio.Photograph: Steffen Roth/The ObserverPressed for an example, he tells me a story about the Royal Academy in London, an institution that gave him alandmark exhibition in 2015and made himan honorary member in 2011following his detainment in China. In November 2023, an exhibition of new works to be shown at the Lisson Gallery was pulled after he posted a tweet that began: “The sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world.” The tweet was deleted, with the artist telling journalists his show had “effectively [been] cancelled”.In the aftermath, a vote was then held at the RA to determine whether his membership should be revoked because of accusations that the post was antisemitic. “I don’t have the intention of an antisemite. My best friends, they’re all Jewish people,” says Ai. “I tweeted millions of tweets on Twitter, but [how is it that] this tweet can cause such trouble? Then they said the procedure is to let the Academicians vote.”His peers supported him and he won the vote. Ai was then asked to write an article about freedom of speech for the RA’s magazine, which he did, arguing: “Speaking the truth and insisting on one’s own perspective is dangerous and may come at a heavy price. Books may go unpublished, exhibitions may be closed, concerts cancelled.”On Censorship by Ai Weiwei review – are we losing the battle for free speech?Read moreAfter he sent it, there was silence. Then he says the RA claimed they didn’t have room to run the piece. For him, this is the censorship in the west, which he argues in OnCensorshipcan be “more covert, more deceptive and more corrosive” than in authoritarian regimes. “I have several cases like this,” Ai adds. “Happens in Britain and in Germany.”The RA disputes this account, claiming the decision to drop the piece was made before Ai submitted it. A spokesperson added: “Plurality of voices, tolerance and free thinking are at the core of what we stand for and seek to protect.”I wonder how Ai feels about the world in 2026. His new book paints it as a place without refuge for those who value self-expression and freedom of speech. “I think today we are living in a complicated world, where life is more like a shattered mirror,” he says. “It reflects the reality, but the reality can be a broken reality.”Did his trip to China restore his faith in humanity? There’s a pause. “If we were in the time of the Tang dynasty, someone like me would go back and write beautiful poetry,” he says, smiling. “But not today. I just take a few selfies.”On Censorship by Ai Weiwei is published by Thames & Hudson (£12.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Instinctively tapping on the usual suspects on your phone’s home screen becomes a reflex, and vast quantities of money and user data have been specifically employed to keep you reaching for the phone, ingraining it into our work, leisure and social lives. You’ll get no shame from me if you love your phone and have a healthy relationship with your apps, but I’ve found myself struggling lately.This year, I’m attempting to cut back on screen time – sort of. I’m replacing the sleek oblong of my smartphone with something a little more fuzzy and nostalgic. In an attempt to dismantle my bad habit, I’m closing the feeds of instant updates and instead carrying around a Game Boy Advance. I’ve been playingPokémonFireRed, a remake of the very first Pokémon games, which turn 30 this month. Even this refreshed version is more than two decades old.Improving your digital wellbeing doesn’t necessarily mean cutting out screen time completely. Not all screens are created equal. I’m hoping that swapping one screen for another isn’t like Indiana Jones switching out the golden idol with a big bag of sand, only for the booby trap boulder to crush me all the same.View image in fullscreenA remake of the very first Pokémon games … Pokémon FireRed.Photograph: Nintendo/MobyGamesI’d not played Pokémon regularly since 2006’s Pokémon Diamond on theNintendoDS, which was my introduction to the franchise. I dabbled in Pokémon Black on the DS and Pokémon Legends: Arceus on the Nintendo Switch, but neither stuck. I’d convinced myself that once you’ve played through one Pokémon game, you’ve pretty much played them all. But as Hollywood has profitably realised, 20 years is a long enough gap for something to feel fresh again.My first steps in Pokémon were taken in the Sinnoh region, so the prospect of visiting the Kanto region from the first games and catching the original 151 Pokémon felt exciting to me. But I couldn’t bring myself to start playing the original Red or Blue on a chunky old Game Boy. I might be trying to embrace a more analogue existence, but gaming without colour is my line in the sand.FireRed’s positive effects on my life arrived unexpectedly quickly. It only took a couple of hours of exploration and encounters with wild Pokémon to make me forget about my phone. It was sat right next to me, but it was no longer calling to me like Gollum’s ring. Usually my device would find its way into my hand during loading breaks and elaborate cutscenes on narrative-heavy and beautiful modern PlayStation games.Perhaps there’s some magic in FireRed’s more freeform approach to story and less overstimulating retro graphics. Maybe those gaps left by implied details in the design and dialogue leave space for my imagination – which my doomscrolling habit had nearly atrophied. The world of Pokémon is serene and charming, despite constant trainer battles and gruelling gym leader face-offs, and even those are quite low stakes. A gaming experience hasn’t offered me such tranquility since I first picked upAnimal Crossing. Try as he might, even Tom Nook can’t patent escapism.Curiously, this adventure, though fresh for me, feels nostalgic. I’ve never played with a team solely made up of monsters from the original Pokédex, yet somehow I’m transported back to the late 90s when it seemed like the world was going Poké-mad. I even named my rival after one of my childhood best friends. All these years later, it’s so satisfying to finally, thoroughly embrace this canon.Pokémon is hardly counterculture: it’s the most profitable video game franchise in history. Pokémon is gearing up for a 30th anniversary year with a McDonald’s Happy Meal promotion, a new theme park, a partnership with theNatural History Museumand a Uniqlo line among much else – so, if anything, it feels more zeitgeisty and omnipresent than it has in years. And yet it does feel rebellious to pick up an old Game Boy instead of my phone. It’s somehow unruly to take myself offline, just for a bit, to just have fun with a retro game. I’m able to enjoy technology on my own terms: I’m not coerced into microtransactions, I’m not relying on the latest oh-so essential firmware update, I’m not endlessly instructed tolike, comment, subscribe for more.View image in fullscreenVideo game developer Shigeru Miyamoto holds up the Nintendo Game Boy Advance during its launch in May 2001.Photograph: John Barr/APFilling the natural breaks in my day with an old video game has done me the world of good, even if it’s evolving my Psyduck while dinner is in the oven or taking down a gym leader while waiting for a package. My phone’s screen time is already down by three hours a week since beginning this adventure. In a small way, it’s helping me to stop comparing myself with others and begin to tackle some existential dread that doomscrolling seems to encourage. Playing Pokémon FireRed in 2026 is utterly nourishing, and wonderfully low stakes compared to a social media ecosystem where everything is trying to appear equally urgent and meaningful.If you’re trying to combat overthinking, insecurity or exhaustion by committing to the herculean task of using your phone less, take a quick trip to the Kanto region – or another resolutely offline game world.Explore more on these topicsGamesPokémonNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

While playing as an eight-year-old girl, the reporter was given a sexualised avatar, cyberbullied, aggressively killed, sexually assaulted and shat on – all with parental control settings in place.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWhile platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Kick were included in Australia’s under-16s social media ban, gaming sites such as Roblox were not.Wells and her department were investigating other levers to regulate services such as Roblox.The minister has written to Roblox requesting an urgent meeting, saying she was “alarmed by reports of children being exposed to graphic and gratuitous user-generated content on the platform, including sexually explicit and suicidal material”.“Even more disturbing are ongoing reports and concerns about children being approached and groomed by predators, who actively seek to exploit their curiosity and innocence,” she said in the letter.Guardian Australia understands Roblox has not yet responded to the letter. In a statement on Tuesday, a Roblox spokesperson said it was committed to keeping users safe, saying it had recently rolled out features like age checking systems, and was working with Australian law enforcement to keep users safe.“We look forward to the opportunity to inform the minister of the steps we take to help keep our community safe. Roblox has robust safety policies and processes to help protect users that go beyond many other platforms, and advanced safeguards that monitor for harmful content and communications,” they said.“While no system is perfect, our commitment to safety never ends, and we continue to strengthen protections to help keep users safe.”In her letter, Wells pointed to media reports alleging children can access spaces on the game meant for adults which include explicit sexual content, and charges laid against a Queensland man accused of grooming hundreds of children on platforms such as Roblox, Fortnite and Snapchat.Wells has also asked the eSafety commissioner about any short-term measures that could be taken, and separately has written to the classification board to ask if Roblox’s PG rating remains appropriate.In the letter to Roblox, Wells noted the company had worked with the eSafety commissioner on additional safety measures for children but that issues appeared to continue.“This is untenable, and these issues are of deep concern to many Australians parents and carers,” she wrote, saying she was keen to hear what Roblox was doing to prevent adults contacting children, and to protect children from inappropriate experiences.The eSafety office said it had also written to Roblox last week, saying it planned to test how the platform was complying with commitments such as making under-16s private by default, new tools to prevent adult users from contacting children and restricting chat features. After that testing, eSafety foreshadowed it “may take further action under the Online Safety Act”.“I welcome the minister for communications’ correspondence and the Australian government’s support on this important issue as we use all of the tools available to us to keep Australian kids safe online,” Inman Grant said.Explore more on these topicsRobloxAustralian politicsSocial media banGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The MX Master 4 is the latest evolution in a line of pioneering mice that dates back more than 20 years and has long been the mouse to beat for everything but hardcore PC gaming. Having given it a magnetic free-spinning scroll wheel, plenty of buttons and precise tracking, now Logitech is trying something different for its seven-generation: the ability to tap back at you.This level of innovation doesn’t come cheap. The MX Master 4 costs £119.99 (€129.99/$119.99/A$199.95), placing it firmly in the premium market alongside high-end gaming mice and expensive peripherals aimed at creative professionals.The overall ergonomic shape of the mouse remains very similar to the previous outstanding versions from2019and 2022. It is finely balanced providing great grip, support to your palm and eight buttons all within easy reach – no stretching required – but it is only available for the right-hand.View image in fullscreenThe MX Master 4 is a mouse designed for comfortable use during long office hours.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianEverything about the mouse feels high quality and satisfying to use. After user feedback, the materials have since been updated to be harder wearing and easier to clean (no one likes a grubby mouse).The button clicks feel strong but are virtually silent, which will please those around you. The best-in-class MagSpeed scroll wheel uses magnets to create a silent ratchet for line-byline movement, but flick it hard enough and the magnets disengage to allow it to spin freely like a flywheel so you can effortlessly shoot through documents or pages.The thumb scroll wheel, back and forward buttons and the gesture button are better placed than previous iterations and are particularly useful for scrolling around in photography or design packages. Press the gesture button to switch between windows by default without having to reach for the keyboard.View image in fullscreenThe haptic button has the actions ring icon on it and forms part of the rubber grip for your thumb.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBelow this is the new haptic button. Press it to invokeLogitech’s “actions ring”, which is a circle of app-aware actions around your cursor you can quickly click without reaching for a menu or keyboard shortcut.The haptic feedback is a click or tap similar to a modern laptop trackpad or the little vibrations from virtual buttons on your phone, first when depressed and again when you mouse over an on-screen button.

Cue: tears.Endings bring memories to the fore and, rather than reflect on the big celebrations and milestones, I find myself capturing glimpses of the most ordinary days accompanied by a visceral longing for what was: his curious face in the rear-view mirror as I drove, a small hand tugging on my skirt, the lull of his sleepy body curled into mine. Early parenthood is rooted in the monotonous and the domestic but there is an undeniable comfort in the humdrum of home life.We are inundated with parenting advice from birth, but no one seems to be talking about the fact that, in an increasingly artificial and overwhelming world where most things are immediate, we have to show our children how to be human. We have to remind them that, just like the birds, the bugs and the trees, we are nature; nothing about our energy or productivity is robotic. Yet we are conditioned to chase the aspirational; we’re always clinging to the next big thing. We do it as parents, too – we think about what’s best for our kids and then what could be better.Five young teens on life under Australia’s social media ban: ‘It’s not a big deal any more’Read moreThese days, childhood is largely scheduled; we are teaching (training!) our kids to be busy, ingraining in them the belief that a full diary equates to a successful life, that a good life is measured by our performance. But as we eke out every minute in the day to get things done and do them well, we are in danger of eradicating any semblance of breathing space. For children and teenagers, this lack of free play and time to just be in nature correlates to adecline in mental health. For adults, it’s informing an epidemic of exhaustion and burnout.Researchshows the brain – more specifically the hippocampus – segments each day into chapters, a neurological filing system that actively organises our experiences according to meaning based on what we care about and what we’re paying attention to. The details we notice influence each new chapter in our life story, the one that is noted and stored in our memory like a script. In our truest form, we are creatures searching for meaning, and our memories are ordered accordingly.I think about this often, what the chapters are titled, how big they are, the details that are being stored for safe keeping. I home in on “what we’re paying attention to” and I wonder: is there a chapter in my brain called “scrolling”? Ugh!I shift my awareness to the impressionable minds of my children and consider the foundation of their memories and where they’re searching for meaning. I will never know their internal stories but I do know they’re growing up in a world that has eradicated the need to wait and wander; the mellow states that are vital for a bright mind and a settled nervous system; for optimism and contentment. With asocial media ban now in place in Australia, perhaps their generation will begin to experience what millennials long for: boredom, languid days without plans, the sweet simplicity of a logged-off life.Or perhaps this is now filed under parental duty: introduce your child to the blank slate of boredom. Stay long enough and it’s here, in this undoubtedly uncomfortable state where they’ll eventually experience curiosity which helps them understand the world and their place in it. Being curious, foraging for clues and seeking answers increases the neural activity in the brain circuits that release dopamine, the feelgood hormone associated with reward and motivation. It’s enough to keep them focused so they eventually get clear on what they want to explore and create.Curiosity also improves memory.If we are raising children to become independent adults in this productivity-driven world, we need to teach them how to rest, the importance of nourishing food each day, sun on their limbs and connection with people they trust, the comfort of a favourite movie, a warm bed and a hot drink when they’re stressed.This is simple stuff, but in the busyness of our normal lives we all need reminding. We’re all grappling with the incessant pull of our phones which yank us out of the present and far away from the living and growing that is unfolding right in front of us.Tiny moments make a life; in our memories, patched together in whichever way they land, is a story of who we are – and who our children are becoming.Jodi Wilson is a health journalist and the bestselling author of four books, including A Brain That Breathes: Essential Habits For an Overwhelming World, out now.

I say, get a grip or get thrown outMon 9 Feb 2026 13.52 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 13.55 ESTShare“It’s nice, isn’t it. The quiet.” Thenow-infamous social media postproduced by a Starmer supporters at the start of his time in office is now written only in sarcasm beside yet another terrible news headline. Rayner resigns: “Nice, isn’t it. The quiet”; Mandelson sacked: “Nice, isn’t it. The quiet”; the prime minister loses his chief of staff – you get the picture.Around the time of that post, we had our glorious first conference in Bournemouth after winning our best election result in a century, and a prominent BBC journalist said to me: “We won’t have to cover the soap opera like before – it’s going to be about policy.” Imagine being the leader of theLiberal Democrats, known for our torrents of policy, and being told this by a BBC journalist; the phrase pig in excrement comes to mind.However, that wasn’t meant to be. I have never agreed withKeir Starmeron much. He is weak on political reform, and we have never needed it more. He was never going to end the cost of living crisis by doing a proper deal with Europe, as he could and should have done. And of course, he is Labour – so I knew the party’s instincts would be to centralise and bureaucratise everything possible. But I did think he would end the soap opera. He is a decent man; I did not see in him the same zest to attain power just for the sake of it. And like many people across the country I genuinely did want this Labour government to succeed.Regretfully, No 10: the Box Set continues from the last government, just with a new cast. Bad decisions on pensioners’ warm home discounts, the farm tax and compulsory ID cards all showed a severe lack of judgment – and that is before you get to the Mandelson debacle, a deep shame onLabourand on our country.So why haven’t I joined the chorus calling for the prime minister to resign? Isn’t that what Lib Dems do, I hear you say. Largely because I don’t think it is just Keir Starmer. The Conservatives tried endlessly changing the face behind the Downing Street door – and the rot at the heart of their government only deepened.I fear we could be in for the same with Labour: a neverending tussle over the keys to No 10, consuming all the energy of government that should be focused on the things that matter. Making sure people don’t die on trolleys in hospital corridors, for example.So here’s my ultimatum to Labour: sort yourselves out. Stop all your infighting and navel-gazing, settle your internal spats one way or the other, and get on with actually governing the country. Do the job you begged voters to give you.And if you can’t? We’ll need a general election. Because the country just can’t afford another three and half years of this.Some people will say, “Not another one!” Others will say this will putNigel Faragein No 10. On the first point, I have some sympathy. I’ll need new trainers for door-knocking; the wetsuit will come out of storage; I’ll have to check my bungee guy isn’t already booked up for the summer. But in all seriousness, we’ve had six prime ministers in the past 10 years – the “not another one” ship has already sailed. Either Labour MPs change the prime minister, or we all do.Let’s talk about Nigel Farage. Could a general election lead to that most horrible of outcomes – a Farage victory? I’d argue that limping on with a failed Labour government for three more years makes that more, not less, likely. And we know this threat isn’t inevitable: the Liberal Democrats have shown in local elections that in whole swathes of the country, Reform can be beaten.Reform UKand their patron saint, Donald Trump, feed on government failure. When the economy is failing, when hospitals are full of people needing care, when petty crime feels rampant on our streets, the populist right convinces voters that we don’t need a better, fairer system – we need to destroy everything.I’m really frightened that this is exactly the future Labour are sleepwalking the country into. We need to change course now – and that means more than just changing who sits in No 10. Labour need to get a grip on themselves and a grip on the problems ordinary people are facing. And if they can’t – better to go now and let those of us who can make our case in a general election.Ed Davey is leader of the Liberal DemocratsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was not just failed vetting: there was a failure of moral seriousnessStreeting wrote off his re-election chances in WhatsApp exchanges with MandelsonMon 9 Feb 2026 13.15 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 13.21 ESTSharePolitics has a problem with sexism and misogyny. We need to be clear what it is and why. With every scandal there is a call to clean up the system, to reform vetting procedures and the laws governing the release of sensitive information. Those are serious issues, but we will not fix the problem by starting there because the problem is not procedural. It is about culture and behaviour.In the scandal of Peter Mandelson’s appointment to be the British ambassador to the United States, of course we need to establish the timeline of who said what, to whom and when.Gordon Brown is right to insiston a more rigorous process and a renewed commitment to the redistribution of power. But if we focus solely on what happened we will miss the important question of why it happened.This is more than a story about the flaws of individuals and the flaws of a system. This is about culture and moral character. About how, for too long, proximity to power insulated powerful, wealthy and well-connected men from the consequences of their appalling behaviour towards women and girls. The really worrying aspect is not what took place in secret. It is what happened in plain sight. A candidate’s knownassociation with a convicted sexual predatordid not weigh heavily enough on decision-makers. And we need to think too about the silence of those who stood by, who knew enough to feel uneasy and yet did not speak loudly enough to influence the decision.This is a group I include myself in. Contrary to what has been widely reported, I was not a close friend ofPeter Mandelson, but I am not going to wash my hands of my actual association with him either. After a weekend of smear and innuendo that I have something to hide, I have decided to publish my messages with Mandelson. From these messages, people will see that the main issue I have had with their publication is that I will put some of my colleagues in a difficult position because of what I said about the Israeli government ahead of the recognition of the state of Palestine. Mandelson and I saw each other for dinner on average once a year, in a group setting. He offered advice. My partner worked for him 25 years ago and I therefore got to know him better than others of that generation in politics, a generation I have always admired since I joined the Labour party as a 15-year-old in 1998. I wasn’t involved in his appointment, but like many other people I thought it was a good move at the time. The painful truth I have spent the past few days wrestling with is that, like many others in Westminster, I just didn’t think enough about the appointment or the past that was known. Also, like many others in Westminster, I filtered the news of it entirely through the lens of whether it seemed a sensible way to help our relationship with a critical ally at a crucial moment.And so, the real question is not simply how vetting failed, but how moral seriousness failed. A quick rush to fix the system – which will probably not stop the next scandal in any case – will close down the space in which we can arrive at serious changes; not just in process, but in culture and behaviour.People join theLabourparty because of a belief in equality and social justice. Yet that very motivation conceals a danger. As George Orwell warned, belief in a righteous cause can easily become a licence for cruelty, deception and moral indifference. If you believe you are on the right side it is easy to turn a blind eye.We need to be honest about the fact that if women such as Jess Phillips had been in that room when the decision was taken, Mandelson would never have been sent to Washington. I was struck listening to the debate in the Commons last week that powerful speeches made by women such as the Labour MP Polly Billington were also accompanied with exhaustion at having to make the same points that they, and many others, have raised before about the culture of sexism and misogyny in public life, as well as in every school, workplace and community in our country.“The standard you walk by is the standard you accept,” as the saying goes. That is why diversity in leadership is so important and why we need to push back hard at those who think that equality, diversity and inclusion are tick-boxes or fringe issues. Diversity brings different perspectives to every place where power resides. Who is in the room shapes what is said out loud, what is noticed, what is deemed to count, and what is silently laid aside. The absence of women’s voices in moments like this is not incidental; it is part of the explanation. This is a scandal, first and foremost, about the way men treat women and girls – and not just monsters such as Epstein, but through everyday sexism. We cannot allow that terrible truth to disappear.I have seen it in the NHS I lead. From victims of some its worst scandals to women such as a close female relative, whose severe pain was ignored by her male doctor not once but twice until her male partner vouched for her pain. Even the NHS, founded on principles of equality, ignores women’s voices and experiences.We can’t let this scandal be another that passes by without real change. The rules we live by cannot substitute for behaviour. There is no vetting good enough, no rules tight enough, no system of accountability strong enough if we do not understand this. We have to have the courage to speak up when silence is easier. We have to confront these moral questions. Politics is hard. Most of the choices are hard and some of them are tragic. But we need to accept that some forms of power are not worth the moral price they extract.Wes Streeting is health secretaryDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now all of Britain faces the falloutOwen JonesPeter Mandelson helped Morgan McSweeney privilege Labour’s reactionary forces in a Faustian pact to sustain the PM. What they sowed, we’ll reapMon 9 Feb 2026 09.27 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 14.08 ESTShareAchicken that loses its head can still, for a short period, run around and flap its wings: the illusion of life sustained by residual nerve impulses. After thedownfall of Morgan McSweeney– our de-facto prime minister – this is the phase Britain’s government has now entered. Those who have worked closely with Keir Starmer emphasise his lack of politics, while his own aidesprivately boastthat he is merely their frontman. McSweeney was the head, and the head has gone. There will be some flapping about in every direction. Starmer’s director of communications,Tim Allan has stepped down, the Scottish Labour leader,Anas Sarwar, is calling for Starmer’s resignation and the question of whether and when he will go is still open. But this political project is all over.This was not supposed to happen, at least according to conventional political wisdom. Before his collision with real power, Starmer was sold as competence incarnate: a figure committed to public service, presiding over a team of adults in the room who would spare us from the psychodramas of the Tory era. They had, we were told, discovered an electoral elixir. Ruling out significant tax rises on wealthy elites, attacking the welfare state and bashing migrants placed them in the fabled centre ground and would appeal to mainstream public opinion.In short, Starmerism was destined to thrive in office. “Starmer instantly looks comfortable as prime minister,”cooed Philip Collins, his former speechwriter and now editor of Prospect magazine, after Labour’s election victory. “I always thought he would and this hard-to-define sense is part of the reason he is PM in the first place.” Instead, the Starmer premiership turned out to be theFyre festivalof British politics: lavishly hyped in advance, buoyed up by elite enthusiasm, and collapsing into fiasco almost as soon as it began.Those ofus on the leftwarned this project would disintegrate once it encountered reality. The obvious retort is that opponents always predict failure. But the point is not that we predicted Starmerism would implode: we predictedwhy.When Jeremy Corbyn won the Labour leadership in 2015, the party’s right faced a choice. They could admit that their ideas were exhausted, that the financial crash had shattered old certainties and demanded new answers. When Labour secured40% of the votein the 2017 general election, overturning the Tory majority on an unashamedly leftwing manifesto, it was fair for critics to say this still fell short. But it was also reasonable to conclude the platform that delivered the party’s biggest surge in vote share since 1945 was something to build on, even as the Brexit culture war overwhelmed it in the lead-up to 2019.The party’s right chose a different path. McSweeney had run the leadership campaign of the Blairite torchbearer Liz Kendall in 2015, when she offered a political agenda similar to the eventual Starmerite offering. When Kendall secured 4.5% of the vote, McSweeney and his ilk concluded they could only retake the party through deceit. Starmer was the perfect candidate: a politician who wanted to be prime minister for its own sake, who served in Corbyn’s shadow cabinet and opportunistically sounded off against Brexit, and thus could rub the belly of theLabourmembership.It should have been obvious that this project was doomed when the leftwing policy pledges of Starmer’s successful leadership campaign – run by McSweeney – were so swiftly abandoned. As Paul Holden’s recent devastating book, The Fraud, meticulously documented, this strategy exposed that Starmerism was defined by deceit, cynicism and a desire for power for its own sake. And that it lacked any coherent policy vision of its own. McSweeney’s dominance symbolised the Faustian bargain that Starmer struck with Labour’s most reactionary forces in exchange for the leadership.“Morgan wouldn’t breathe without consulting Mandelson first,” aformer McSweeney associatereportedly confessed, and just days before his downfall as the US ambassador, the man dubbed the Prince of Darkness was in No 10 to help design Starmer’s reshuffle. Mandelson’s influence was not incidental. It was the inevitable consequence of a political vacuum being filled with Blairite retreads whose answers belong to another era.That Starmerreceived more freebiesthan every Labour leader on record including Tony Blair, and that Mandelson established a deep friendship with the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, are symptoms of the same problem. This faction of Labour is mesmerised by wealth, proximity to power and elite approval. This is what doomed Starmerism – exactly as the left warned.So what now? A third of Britain’s postwar prime ministers have occupied No 10 in the past decade, despite only one change of governing party. This instability has much to do with an unprecedented squeeze in living standards and a hollowed-out public realm, all of which has driven mass political disillusionment and anger. The basic truth is this. Our economic system fell apart in 2008. In the absence of a credible alternative, politics is defined by instability and an emboldened far right that thrives on the fiction that the key issue of our time is a zero-sum struggle between citizens and migrants.At the last election, little attention was paid to Labour winning barely a third of the vote amid the lowest turnout in modern democratic history. Given the extraordinary unpopularity of the outgoing Tory government, the lack of popular enthusiasm should have been a warning. Instead, commentary fixated on vibes. Starmer looked prime ministerial. His politics were deemed respectable.What links Jeffrey Epstein and Keir Starmer’s government? A thick seam of contempt | Nesrine MalikRead moreHad the left critique been taken seriously, none of this would be surprising. As the same pundits who once cheered Starmer on now tour the studios explaining his collapse, that truth is quietly buried. This was always a project rooted in cynicism and a desire to neutralise Labour as a threat to wealthy interests. It achieved its goal, and the very survival of the party may be the price.Alas, McSweeney has not just left Labour facing disaster but the rest of us, too. Even if Reform UK falls short of victory in the next election, a pact with the increasingly extreme Tories could deliver us to rightwing authoritarianism. If Labour had sense, it would understand that a broken economic model is the root of Britain’s malaise. It would adopt a programme of progressive taxation to fund investment in broken services and struggling communities. It would end the failed privatisation experiment and deliver a mass public housebuilding programme.To his credit, Andy Burnham is one Labour politician who gets this, but the hierarchy hasblocked himleaving Greater Manchester. Even if he somehow found a path to the leadership, the large number of Starmerite Labour MPs would probably bar such an agenda. Angela Rayner, too, would likely have to strike an accommodation with the party’s right, and deliver Starmerism with a Stockport accent. So the party may as well install Mandelson’s favourite candidate, Wes Streeting, and double down on its failure, stripping away all remaining illusions anyone may have about what this Labour party is about.The Greens are now the best bet to replace Labour in urban heartlands. One Labour MP – no past supporter of Corbyn – tells me that his wife plans to vote for them. A hung parliament with a large Green contingent could force a change in the voting system and offer a real chance of ending our failed economic model. In the wreckage that McSweeney has left us, it is our best hope.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourMorgan McSweeneyPeter MandelsoncommentShareReuse this content"

Can we really depend on this technology?Mon 9 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 05.59 ESTShareRecently, the Rowsons accidentally invented a new game that anyone can play at home. I have yet to come up with a world-beating name for it, so for now let’s just call it “How bloody stupid is AI?” The playing of the game will change from player to player, depending on their circumstances – but essentially the rules remain the same. Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.In my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonistSteven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.It’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny. As a satirist, I have always been a fool for anything that points up the even greater folly of our leaders, the tools of their techbro masters or the true capabilities of our new robot overlords. Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”View image in fullscreenA friend, but not my wife: fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overviewwas “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically isnotmy wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:Textile designerFiona Scott-Wilson.PoetBridget Rose.ActorFiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.EconomistAnn Pettifor.Julia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this isthe fantasy author,the illustrator,the late powerlifteror another Julia Mills altogether).Writer and journalistEmily Rees.Lawyer and academicSiva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmasterJonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.Writer and journalistCarrie McLaren.Channel 4 News presenterCathy Newman.CNN correspondentClarissa Ward.Journalist and broadcasterRachel Johnson.My own daughter.View image in fullscreenEconomist Ann Pettifor.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.Then it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does heexist?There was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. PlaywrightLee Hallgot a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.As for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).Another search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalistAnn Widdecombe(hisex-wife),Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author,Polly Toynbeeis a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”View image in fullscreenCNN’s Clarissa Ward.Photograph: John Lamparski/Getty Images for Concordia SummitFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”I suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.While my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imaginethatfamily Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.We should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?I wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”Martin Rowson is a cartoonist and authorExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)OpinionComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

A bad situation could get worseMon 9 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 04.30 ESTShare‘Lawful protest and free speech are fundamental rights, but we cannot allow them to be abused to spread hate or cause disorder. The law must be fit for purpose and consistently applied.” So said the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, last year on appointing Lord MacDonald, the former director of public prosecutions, tolead a reviewof public order and hate-crime legislation. He will soon report. For all who prize the historic right to protest, as have so many generations before us, the omens aren’t good.Laws govern the right to protest, but one of the lessons I learned from my time as the solicitor for the family of Stephen Lawrence is that the law is not, as Mahmood put it, “consistently applied”: it does not listen to everyone in the same way. The law was available, for example, to Stephen’s parents in theory, but in practice it did not respond to them as equal citizens.Thirty years on from Stephen’s murder, it is difficult to say this lesson has been fully absorbed, and that will be important as we consider this review of how groups are treated and what happens when they organise – on a single occasion or on multiple high-profile occasions – to raise a voice.We know that racialised groups remain disproportionately unprotected because perception still shapes how the law is applied. Despite repeated calls from Muslim communities, who experience thehighest levelsof recorded hate crime in England and Wales, objections are raised when it comes to legally addressing Islamophobia.There is a palpable unfairness. Muslims are told they do not fall within the scope of race law, but at the same time the threshold for religious discrimination is often set too narrowly to capture howIslamophobia operatesin practice. They are treated in public life as a single group and ascribed shared characteristics, regardless of individual belief or behaviour. Scholars of race have long shown that racial groups are not produced by biology but by societal and institutional practice.So think now of how that affects Muslims as they exercise their rights as citizens: of the treatment of Muslims who protest against the genocide in Gaza. It is clear that this racialisation affects them in practice. Demonstrations calling for an end to the violence, many of thempeaceful and family-oriented, are met with preemptive restrictions, heightened policing and public warnings that blur the line between protest and criminality. Protest is viewed as a source of risk rather than a democratic right.Counterterrorism language seeps into decisions about policing, conditions and enforcement to justify extraordinary measures such as false imprisonment and terrorism charges.A similar pattern is familiar to Black communities, who have seen assumptions about aggression and disorder used to shapestop-and-search practices, public-order policing and criminal-justice outcomes across generations. These assumptions are rarely set out in statute, yet they exert powerful influence over how discretion is exercised on the ground. And what connects these experiences is racialisation.It is against the background of that skewed thinking and uneven enforcement that this looming ominous debate about protest and public order must be understood. Rather than starting from the premise that protest is a right to be facilitated, we have a review urged to focus on ways to constrain it.And there is the particular threat of a focus on thecumulative impactof protest. That is contrary to everything we have known. Indeed, articles 10 and 11 of theEuropean convention on human rightsare framed as they are precisely to protect political expression and assembly as rights exercised each time they occur – not as privileges that diminish through repetition.The growing emphasis on cumulative impact treats lawful protest as a collective nuisance rather than as a series of individual exercises of protected freedom. The inconvenience caused by repeated protest is recast as justification for restriction.Claudette Colvin’s life should teach us this: resistance is collective, and it never stops | Gary YoungeRead moreThink of what that means in other contexts. If transport workers, for example, were told they could strike once, but not again, because repeated action caused too much disruption, collective bargaining would be emptied of any real force. Pressure works because it is sustained. It does not work if it is allowed only when it remains tolerable.Think of our history. The suffragettes did not secure the vote for women through a single demonstration or a moment of polite persuasion. Their campaigns were persistent, disruptive and widely condemned at the time, yet are now recognised as having been integral to securing change. The same is true of movements for racial justice. Civil rights campaigns reshaped law and public life through sustained protest over time, in the face of significant inconvenience to those in power. Had those protests been curtailed on the basis of cumulative disruption alone, much of that progress would never have been achieved.So there is much to be concerned about from a review that threatens to entrench already evident inequalities and to restrict the rights of some to preserve the comfort of others.This is a moment. Because once the law, already erroneously applied to many citizens, also begins to treat persistence as a problem rather than a feature of democratic participation, free speech stops being a right. It then becomes what it has never been and never should be: a matter of political permission.Imran Khan KC is a practising solicitorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A thick seam of contemptNesrine MalikWe’re often told the PM is a ‘decent’ man. But in appointing Peter Mandelson he chose political convenience over doing right by trafficked women and girlsMon 9 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 09.07 ESTShareContempt everywhere. From Jeffrey Epstein’s email exchanges to the scandal ofPeter Mandelson’s appointment, contempt radiates. Contempt for women and girls, for the law, for the public. A continuum of disdain runs from Epstein on the one end to our political establishment on the other. The other thing that joins them is a restless pursuit of power.Contempt is not a byproduct of that power, it is the point of it. Procuring, trading, objectifying and violating women and girls is the summit of potency for those who already have everything else: money, status, respect. To subordinate another human being to your urges, to reduce her in all ways, is to be initiated into a club of super-predators who are above the law. The Epstein emails are a demonstration of how misogyny – there really should be a stronger word for it in this context – is a currency, lavishly spent to show how much power you have. The gut-twisting way that casual references to body parts would come up in correspondence is part of a whole language of signalling. Referring to women as “pussy” –or just “P”– is to flash your exclusive club membership card.What facilitated that is a wider climate of scorn and impunity: the value system that still, even after Epstein was convicted, did not disqualify him from his friendship with others, nor disqualified those others from being appointed to roles such as British ambassador to the United States. Those caught in the revelations resort to the same excuses. We didn’t know. We were lied to. We did not know the full extent. Some perhaps took the word of a convicted criminal that it was a bit more complicated than that; others took the word of a man who was twice forced to resign from government, and who continued his relationship with Epstein even after his conviction.Now that it is all out in the open, there isregret, so muchregret. “The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong,” Morgan McSweeney now says, in his resignation letter as Keir Starmer’s chief of staff. But to regret something is to suggest that it was all an unfortunate accident during which you should have had your wits about you. What people really regret is not realising that abuse of women and girls would ever be taken seriously.The world of corruption has its own rules. It develops its own norms, its own codes. There is a definitive similarity in the way both Epstein and Mandelson conducted their business. They were favour merchants, fixers and facilitators; men who traded in networks, tribal hookups and fraternal flattery. Within that dynamic there was still an understanding that there were certain gentlemen’s agreements that should be honoured – we can see that in the email in which EpsteinaccusedMandelson of taking and never giving. The only sin in this world is to not understand that the value in relationships is that favours are to be appreciated and returned.Female victims, the law, the public, are all remote and potentially treacherous things that need to be kept as far as possible from infringing on this vast, self-contained and sophisticated reciprocal system of power. It is only by understanding the Epstein network as one designed to circumvent the rules and shield its members from them through mutual reinforcement that the real nature of what happened in Downing Street when Mandelson was appointed becomes clear.The decision was not about ensuring a trustworthy man was in DC; it was about putting in action a player who knew how to network, trade favours and shore up a closed circle back home with his aptitude for cultivating connections across influential domains without qualms or scruples. The euphemisms for what is essentially a flair for corruption are a tell that Mandelson’s dubious character was his main asset, not a liability. “ThePrince of Darkness”, a “master of the dark arts”, a “Dark Lord” – these are all ways of saying that the media and politics respect a person who does not shy away from the means in the pursuit of the ends. In a Labour party defined by its relentless hounding of internal dissenters and purges of candidates, that sort of man is at home among a cohort for whom power is something not only to be attained, but hoarded, monopolised, leveraged.In Mandelson’s appointment, despite private and public questioning of the decision, there is an echo of that contempt for those outside the inner circle and insistence on the leadership’s prerogative to do as it pleases in the service of political agendas that really have nothing to do with integrity, but utility. Which brings us to Keir Starmer. A prime minister who we are repeatedly told is a “decent man” who “actually does care” about victims and will beovercome with shameover this whole affair. Or simply, a useless politician who outsourced too much and has been let down by people he shouldn’t have trusted.But Mandelson’s appointment could not have happened without Starmer making a conscious decision to relegate the seriousness of Mandelson’s associations. In these excuses for Starmer, there is an implication that such political calls are not subject to the naive morality of the outside world, but occur in a complicated sphere that functions high above the average citizen’s paygrade. This is not a fashionable thing to say under Labour’s “pragmatism” regime, but some moral issuesareblack and white. Call Starmer’s decision shortsighted, stupid, unwise, but it cannot be described as uncalculated. Mandelson’s value to the party leadership simply mattered more than his associations with the world’s best-known child sex offender. And therefore must have mattered more than the victims.It is as simple as that. The radius of Epstein is populated by those who just didn’t think it was all serious enough to forgo the benefits of associating with him. None of those now reportedly having a dark night of the soul, including our prime minister, could resist that. To speak of a thwarted “decency” in this scenario is to implausibly separate action from intention, from character. To paraphrase Forrest Gump, decent is as decent does.And so here is Starmer, blinking in the light of a problem that was supposed to remain manageable. And here is the whole putrid horror of it, spread out over millions of documents and “pussies” and “bitches” and young victims. Here is the public, suddenly too close and informed for comfort. And here is accountability, too late for too many, but better than never. But still not upon us, as a political crisis overtakes government, is a wider reckoning with the utter decoupling of principle from politics. With the chronic devotion to “grown ups” and admiration for their ruthlessness in the pursuit of power, this is the bitter harvest.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

As high school students, they were thrown into one of the darkest chapters of humanity’s history, surviving nearly five years in forced labour camps under the Khmer Rouge genocide. An estimated 2.7 million of my kin perished during that time. Fortunately for my family, they were accepted under Australia’s humanitarian program and arrived in Australia on 26 January, a date heavy with complexity for Australian identity, and our refugee story became another layer within it.Our journey began when my mother discovered she was pregnant. Together with my father, they decided to flee on foot through landmine-ridden jungle toward the Thai-Cambodian border, carrying nothing but their lives and the hope that their unborn child might escape the suffering they had endured.It was there I was born. In a refugee camp shaped by loss, fear and uncertainty.In America, the social fabric is starting to collapse. Australia must also learn that words shape our world | Martin Luther King IIIRead moreWhat met my parents next was not perfected policy or market-based solutions.It was civil society.Volunteers from around the world stepped into the chaos where states, borders and institutions had failed. Among them were nurses from the US who gave their time, skill and care in conditions few would willingly choose. One nurse, in particular, took my parents under her wing. She helped them navigate medical checks, paperwork, survival and dignity. She cared for them, and for me, as if we were her own family.She was from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Four decades later, another Minnesotan nurse would lose his life supporting migrants in distress. Alex Pretti was shot by ICE agents and made the ultimate sacrifice in service to others. His final words were reported to be: “Are you OK?”View image in fullscreen‘It was nurses who cared for me before I had a passport, a nationality or a future anyone could name’ … Rathana Chea as an infant with his mother Charanay Chea and father Siri CheaI watched this unfold on the news in horror, sitting side by side in front of the television with the nurse who had saved my family’s life. Sandra Evenson, a humble Minnesotan nurse whom I had spent months trying to find nearly a year earlier, was visiting my family in Sydney the week the shooting unfolded. Every morning, she was calling home to check on friends and family and to express how proud she was of the community response.I was too young to remember her kindness. My life is the evidence of it.In the chaos of resettlement in Australia four decades earlier, with Sandra’s later relocation to Rwanda, we initially lost contact.What remained after 40 years of silence were photographs. A small album of black-and-white and grainy colour images, the only record of an era defined by survival against all odds. In many of them, the same woman appeared again and again. My parents would sometimes speak of her: her booming laugh, her relentless optimism, the $50 she pressed into their hands from her own pocket when she learned we had been accepted for resettlement, so they could buy clothes for the journey ahead.For 40 years, she lived only in my parents’ memory. As they entered their later years, the smiles that once accompanied these photos gave way to long sighs and quiet grief. Like so many nurses, she risked becoming an unsung hero lost to history. I decided this would not be Sandra’s story, and it would not be my parents’ story either. I had to find her.I searched the internet for Sandra Evenson, which turned out to be an unfortunately common name in the US. I narrowed it down to nurses who had served or studied at one point or another in Minnesota. Of the dozens I called and emailed who fit these criteria, some never replied. Then, one Sunday morning, I opened my inbox to a single-line reply to my long account of our refugee story.“Yes, this is me. More to come.”We found each other.View image in fullscreen‘A reunion shaped by time, tears and the recognition that some acts of humanity do not expire’ … Rathana Chea’s mother Charanay Chea and father Siri Chea reunite with Sandra Evenson and Patty Seflow in SydneyAfter months of tearful video calls, Sandra decided to make the journey to Australia with her former supervisor from the camp, Patty Seflow. We woke at dawn to greet them after their epic journey from minus-20C Minnesota winter to the heat and humidity of a Sydney summer.There was no stage and no fanfare. Just a quiet car park at Sydney airport on a bright summer day. A reunion shaped by time, tears and the recognition that some acts of humanity do not expire.We are living through a time when migrants and refugees are increasingly dehumanised, politicised and reduced to slogans. In the US, aggressive ICE raids, including in Minnesota, have torn families apart in the name of enforcement and spectacle. Fear has become a tool of governance. In Australia, far-right groups are undermining the very fabric of our social and economic success, and one of the cornerstones of our regional security: multiculturalism.There is a bitter irony here. America’s greatest power was never its military reach or economic dominance. It was its humanitarianism. Its civil society. Its capacity, often paradoxically, to challenge its own excesses through moral courage at the margins. That quiet, decentralised force once stood in tension with America’s impulse to police the world. And that tension mattered. It saved lives.Today, that legacy is being hollowed out.In Minnesota, Pretti’s death sits uneasily alongside images of armed raids and terrified families, revealing a painful contradiction.Nurses are, almost everywhere, the carers of the world in times of crisis. They stitch wounds, hold hands and translate fear into reassurance. They are often invisible. And yet they carry the moral infrastructure of society, and more often than not, our moral compass.It was nurses who cared for my parents when they were stateless.It was nurses who cared for me before I had a passport, a nationality or a future anyone could name.My life exists because someone chose compassion over convenience, service over safety and kindness over borders. Because a nurse from Minnesota followed a moral compass that extended beyond self-interest or nationality.Pretti’s final question was not political. It was human.“Are you OK?”It is a question worth asking ourselves, and our societies, before we decide who belongs, who is protected and who is left to fall. As we watch our American cousins across the Pacific navigate a period of turbulence not seen for generations, it is time to ask it again.Are you OK?And, quietly, more urgently: are we?Rathana Chea is CEO of the Multicultural Leadership Initiative and co-CEO of global social impact consultancy The Rathana Group, co-chair of Asian Australians for Climate Solutions and on the board of New York-based Mobilisation LabExplore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumOpinionMigrationRefugeescommentShareReuse this content"

Cathy is a primped belle quivering in the presence of Heathcliff, who himself is a moody, long-haired, bearded outsider, as if Scarlett O’Hara were going to melt into the arms of Charles Manson. However, he does get substantially Darcyfied up later on, rocking a shorter and more winsome hairstyle, his gossamer-thin shirt never dry.As a child, young Cathy Earnshaw (Charlotte Mellington) is a pert miss, indulged by her roistering old twinkly eyed squire of a dad, in which role Martin Clunes pretty much pinches the whole film.Fennellincidentally abolishes the character of Cathy’s elder brother Hindley from the book (along with his wife and son) reassigning Hindley’s ruinous boozing and gambling to the father; Fennell also, in line with traditional WH adaptation, loses the next-gen second half of the novel, about the grownup children of Cathy, Hindley and Heathcliff. She also very feebly erases the issue of Heathcliff’s dark skin – and maybe those inverted commas are intended to shrug off issues of “authenticity”.On a lordly whim, Mr Earnshaw rescues a young scallywag from the streets of Liverpool while there on business, and adopts him as a step-brother to Cathy; this, of course, is Heathcliff, played as a pinch-faced boy byOwen Cooper(the young star of Netflix’saward-winning drama Adolescence). They run around ferally together as kids, but as adults of the near-aristo and servant class respectively, there seems no way to consummate or even acknowledge their feelings for each other.The family’s fortunes being in dire straits, Cathy marries wealthy milquetoast neighbour Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif), thus breaking the heart of Heathcliff, who storms off; he returns, wealthy, after a few years and has a passionate affair with Cathy, who learns the truth about why he left. When he ends up spitefully marrying Edgar’s simpering sister Isabella (played by Alison Oliver, amusingly channelling Sophie Thompson). Fennell makes light of his cruelty to her by casting Isabella as a smirkingly consenting sub.View image in fullscreenA luxurious pose of unserious abandon … Margot Robbie in Emerald Fennell’s adaptation.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyAs for the all-knowing housekeeper Nelly Dean (played by Hong Chau), she is the trickiest figure in the book, the person through whose eyes almost all the action is seen. Nelly is English literature’s uncrowned queen of the unreliable narrators, the deadpan witness-instigator of the central catastrophic misunderstanding that destroys Heathcliff and Cathy’s happiness. Interestingly, Fennell does get Cathy to confront Nelly on this point. At some stage, of course, things get real and a tsunami of tears is uncorked; it’s all in a frantically, exhaustingly Baz Luhrmann-esque style and the movie begins to resemble a 136-minute video for theCharli xcxsongs on the soundtrack.Wuthering Heights doesn’t have the live-ammo impact of Fennell’s earlier filmsSaltburnandPromising Young Womanor, indeed,Andrea Arnold’s flawed, brilliant, primitivist takeon Brontë’s novel from 2011, which really did believe in the passionate truth of Cathy and Heathcliff’s love. For Fennell, it looks like a luxurious pose of unserious abandon. It’s quasi-erotic, pseudo-romantic and then ersatz-sad, a club night of mock emotion.Wuthering Heights is out on 12 February in Australia and 13 February in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmMargot RobbieEmerald FennellJacob ElordiMartin ClunesFilm adaptationsEmily BrontëreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the new musical director is up for a challenge. We meet the man with the hardest job in musicMon 9 Feb 2026 11.22 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 12.23 ESTShareAndré de Ridder is either brave or stupid. He has accepted the role as the music director of English National Opera – its chief conductor and keeper of its musical flame. He will take up the role formally in 2027. The post has been empty for several anguished years, sparked byArts Council England’s 2022 announcementthat the company would lose all its funding unless it moved out of London. Amid a fightback that, to cut a long story short, resulted in the company retaining a foothold in the London Coliseum, but partially moving to Manchester, De Ridder’s predecessor, Martyn Brabbins, abruptly quit in 2023, saying that the company was heading into “managed decline”. Brabbins’s predecessor, Mark Wigglesworth, had also resigned suddenly in 2016, saying ENO was evolving into “something I do not recognise”. It was beginning to sound like an opera plot.Bluebeard’s Castle, maybe. A murdered conductor behind every door in the mansion.And yet: De Ridder’s enthusiasm is irrepressible. For some, it would be daunting to come into a company whose world-class orchestra and chorus have had their full-time contracts slashed to seven months of the year; from which the chief executive has just resigned; where morale (insiders tell me) is rock bottom. But the Berlin-raised 54-year-old sees only the opportunities. From his perspective, the shake-ups are in the past.View image in fullscreen‘Make-or-break feeling’ … André de Ridder.Photograph: Drew Forsyth/(c) English National Opera“I like this construction of London andManchester,” he tells me, at the Coliseum. “And I like the spirit of pioneering, of becoming an opera company in a city that previously hasn’t had a resident opera company.” We are speaking before rehearsals of the show he’s conducting, Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill’s rarely performed morality tale about rapacious capitalism.He feels a strong connection to Manchester: he studied at the Royal Northern College of Music for two years, and was later assistant to Mark Elder at the Hallé. The new setup presents a “great chance for an opera company and a great chance for opera at large” to develop a new audience inGreater Manchester, “and maybe one that has no preconceived ideas of what opera is”. Opera North regularly visits Salford (and, a fact seemingly overlooked by the Arts Council, was set up in the 1970s to be ENO in the north). But the more the merrier, he thinks. The scene “should just get richer and richer”.He knows his predecessors well – including Edward Gardner, who did the job brilliantly from 2007 to 2015. The two actually studied together inLondon, and took classes from Brabbins, who was a guest teacher on their conducting course. So was Elder, who was music director of ENO in the 1980s and 1990s. De Ridder says of Gardner and Brabbins: “I love them both dearly, and admire them greatly as conductors, but for the moment, I’ve chosen to not speak to them because I wanted a clean beginning, no baggage. I just want to make up my own mind about how things are standing.”Manchester makes us rethink what opera means, what it can beHe talks about the Manchester plans ENO recently announced – among them the UK premiere ofAngel’s Bone, by Chinese-American composer Du Yun, which will be staged at Aviva Studios in May. With works like this, its subject modern slavery and human trafficking, there is a chance to expand the boundaries of the form, he says. “Du Yun is a modern example of the kind of thing Kurt Weill did 100 years ago,” he says, “incorporating punk and cabaret in classical contemporary music in a new way”. He adds: “The opera world can be quite an inward-looking and closed-up sort of place, a famous museum. Manchester makes us rethink what opera means, what it can be.”The orchestra for Angel’s Bone will be the Manchester-based BBC Philharmonic. But surely ENO is by definition a company: it consists of its chorus and its orchestra, its backstage staff, its people. If you produce work in Manchester without the company, is it really ENO at all? On the other hand, bringing London-made ENO productions to Manchester is not only expensive but a little imperialistic. Is there not a fundamental problem with the dual-centre theory? “It’s not just a one-way street,” says De Ridder. Work created in Manchester may come to London, while “we are trying to find ways to present work with our core ensembles in Manchester”. (One example is a semi-staged performance of ENO’s Così Fan Tutte at Bridgewater Halllater this month.)De Ridder has, above all, history with ENO. As a student in 1996, he watched shows such as Bernd Alois Zimmermann’s vast operaDie Soldatenat the Coliseum. (He would love to see ENO in the future similarly performing landmark near-contemporary works that have never been seen in the UK before – Messiaen’s Saint François d’Assise, say, or Kaija Saariaho’s Adriana Mater.) Most importantly, 20 years ago, when he was in his early 30s, he conducted the premiere of Gerald Barry’s remarkable operaThe Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, based on Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 1972 film.View image in fullscreen‘The buzz in the room was incredible’ … rehearsing Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny.Photograph: Tristram Kenton“ENO schooled me, ENO formed me as an artist on the operatic stage,” he says. “It was a lucky time and place. Richard Jones was directing, one of the greats, and Barbara Hannigan [Canadian soprano and now conductor] was making her operatic debut in the UK.” There were “seven or eight intense weeks in the rehearsal room”, he remembers. “The togetherness, the vision, the knowing that we’re doing something quite special, how everybody pulled together – I was spoiled for life by this experience. And I tell you, it’s not the same everywhere. I expected it to be like this everywhere. It wasn’t, and it’s not. And so when this job came up and we started talking, I thought, ‘I have to put my hat in the ring.’”It’s not the same now, though, is it? The musicians and choristers are depleted. He’s getting three, not eight, rehearsal weeks for Mahagonny, and only three performances. But he still believes. “The core of the orchestra is there. The chorus is there. And the spirit of ‘Let’s do it’ is there.” A couple of days after we speak, he messages me. “It wasn’t, nor would it have been, my choice to shorten contracts of the core performing groups of ENO,” he clarifies. “I’ve come in after this was decided and resolved, and I can only imagine how tough that must have been. But now my brief is to hold up ENO’s excellence and goals for everyone.”He talks passionately about Weill – whose numbers, such as Alabama Song, long ago took on a life of their own thanks to, among others, theDoorsandDavid Bowie. Mahagonny comes out of the heady musical melting pot of 1920s Berlin – the city, too, of Schoenberg and Hindemith. “Kurt Weill is often seen as the guy who did the jazzy thing and the sassy thing. But in this piece, you can see he grew up through the school of Schoenberg and using old forms – canons, fugues, chorales, and some of the tonal-based, modal framework that Hindemith ended up with. You see all these influences, but also ragtime, tango, American blues music. There are moments of pure Gershwin.” His own father used to conduct the opera, along with other Brecht and Weill masterpieces, in West Berlin in the 1980s. He’s using his dad’s score.View image in fullscreenA morality tale about rapacious capitalism … rehearsals for Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny.Photograph: Tristram KentonDe Ridder is currently music director of the opera in the German city of Freiburg. Why exchange comfortable funding and long rehearsal periods for ENO’s shaky situation in a cash-strapped country that may well get a far-right government after the next election? He laughs. “I think we’re far closer to getting a far-right government in Germany than you are,” he says. “It’s not the reason I’m leaving Germany, but you just said the word ‘comfortable’, and that’s the operative word. It is comfortable, yes, maybe a little bit too comfortable.”When we speak, he has just been working at 3 Mills Studios in east London. “There were three ENO productions being rehearsed there at the same time, Così Fan Tutte, Mahagonny and a brush-up of [Gilbert and Sullivan’s] HMS Pinafore – and the buzz in the building was incredible. It felt like life and death.”He adds: “I love working in Germany. I love that in every city there’s an opera house. But people are comfortable.” He looks around the Coliseum and says: “That make-or-break feeling I had when I first came here? I love it.”Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonnyis at the London Coliseum, 16-20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsEnglish National Opera (ENO)Classical musicOperaManchesterGreater ManchesterLondoninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Coming from a working-class family, I’d never seen such a thing’Interview byJack WatkinsMon 9 Feb 2026 10.16 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 14.40 ESTShareGary Daly, singer, songwriterEd and I had just come off a long tour of Europe and North America supporting Simple Minds and needed a break. I immersed myself in music-making with a synth, drum machine and a four-track Tascam Portastudio. I was very inspired by Brian Eno. I’d seen the words “found sounds” on his album credits. The notion that any sound could be included in a recording struck me as magical. I just held a mic out of my bedroom window. Black Man Ray started out as an ambient number with an intro featuring the sound of a boy I recorded singing in the street below. In the end, he actually featured in the opening bars of our songThe Highest High.Black Man Ray has that classic China Crisis synth sound, but our producer Walter Becker did a huge amount of work on it, as he did on all the tracks on Flaunt the Imperfection, our third album. Virgin Records were keen to follow up the success of our single Wishful Thinking and would have been bending Walter’s ear, telling him to focus on songs that sounded like potential hits. We recorded Black Man Ray at the Parkgate Studio in Sussex – in the kitchen! I have a vivid memory of it, mainly because Walter had sesame seeds in the pan, toasting them. Coming from a very working-class family, I’d never seen such a thing.There’s something very 1980s about the song’s intro, but there’s always been an awful lot of melody in our compositions. Even before Ed or I start singing, there’s a keyboard trilling away on Wishful Thinking, Red Sails and Papua. A lot of bands at that time didn’t do that.People find the title and lyrics of Black Man Ray mysterious. Being interested in photography, I had a copy of Creative Camera magazine which had an article on the surrealist Man Ray. His name intrigued me. But the song was quite autobiographical about being in a band, so the title was like Ray Charles singing about his life. Again, it’s that Eno-esque idea of singing oblique, enigmatic lines that appear to mean something on their own, buried among the rest of the lyrics. There’s an element of truth there, but it’s not The Long and Winding Road.Eddie Lundon, backing vocals, songwriter, guitarAfter our US tour, Gary and I decided to take a break from each other, working separately on songs for Flaunt the Imperfection. The first time I heard Black Man Ray was a rough version Gary played me on a lovely summer’s day in the garden of his mother’s house. I could hear its pop potential right away, it was so melodic and catchy. But it’s always been the way our songs start out with one of us writing the fundamentals, having the inspiration, building around a certain melody, and only evolving into the sound that’s ultimately recognisable as China Crisis when Gary and I come together.One of the best parts of Black Man Ray was where I joined Gary, who sings the lead vocal, harmonising on the chorus: “Ye-e-s ye-e-s, I could be wrong.” That section is anthemic really and irresistible to sing along to. It’s the part of every live performance that unites our audience and reminds us why we love what we do so much.While we’d been in the US, our label Warner Brothers asked us who we’d like to work with to produce the album. We mentioned the likes of Richard Carpenter and Steve Winwood, and said we’d love to work with some of the classic Steely Dan adjacent team like Gary Katz. Word of this got back to Walter Becker who, it turned out, was already a fan of China Crisis. He flew over from the States to meet us and we hit it off immediately. He was an absolute perfectionist and hard taskmaster, very precise in his instructions, insisting on multiple takes.At one point he mentioned how Black Man Ray reminded him of the Beatles. I think he was mostly referring to the arrangement, the intro, verse, chorus and repeat, followed by a middle eight, then a double chorus and outro. But for two young lads from Liverpool to hear him say that, well, you can imagine how that would have felt.The 10th Anniversary edition of China Crisis’s Autumn in the Neighbourhood album is now available on vinyl and CD from Last Night from GlasgowExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeShareReuse this content"

The mood is more like a stray dog has sidled up to that lamp-post and cocked its leg. The lamps multiply on these squalid, mean streets: uprooted, they become giant props for performers to illuminate and edit the action on a vast stage with its wings exposed and no artificial backdrop. A suspicious figure roams the outskirts with a torch; another drives a vehicle back and forth in the distance. One long-necked light snakes down from above like a tendril, its glow deepening the chiaroscuro. Bodies melt and morph. It is as if a film noir has caught fire in the projector, distorting each scene.Nederlands Dans Theater’s production, at the 20th edition ofHolland Dance festival, confounds from its ragged beginnings to the final seconds, when even the curtain is not allowed to fall in peace. Horses starts with the house lights up and a solo with instinctive flinches and hoof-like hands suggesting hunter and hunted before a second dancer arrives nose-first, as if led by scent. The animality briefly evokes NDT’sFigures in Extinctionbut this is an acutely urban nightmare, with humans’ survival skills put to the test. Suddenly, the auditorium’s doors slam shut and we are plunged into darkness.On Max Glaenzel’s set, lit by Tom Visser, there are vaudeville vignettes of peril, the intrigue heightened by Andrzej Panufnik’s unsettling strings and the clowning overlaid with heavy breathing, canned laughter, comical splish-sploshes and other sound effects. The interactions are at times documented by a pair of figures who resemble wildlife photographers, yet the setting evokes a huge soundstage and revels in artifice.View image in fullscreenUncanny … Horses by Nederlands Dans Theater.Photograph: Rahi RezvaniMorau tests this supple squad of dancers with choreography suggesting limbs that won’t behave, startling their owners with angular thrusts. Bodies are cradled but also dragged and disposed of in a desolate landscape where the lamp-posts are arranged to frame a jolting ensemble or, in a spellbinding sequence, spin like a pendulum held by one dancer for another’s solo beneath. The 11th hour surprise, in this pungently atmospheric work, is that the lost souls whose cries sound like tortured creatures manage to construct a shelter from all those beams. It’s done to the balm of And the Swallow, composerCaroline Shaw’s paean to laying your head safely. A performance that has majored in the uncanny becomes a tribute to human ingenuity: the herd comes together by sensing shared threat.Horses, from 2024, is part of NDT’s double bill,Wildsong, paired with Belgian choreographerJan Martens’s premiere, Kid in a Candy Shop, which is set at first toJulia Wolfe’s Pretty. It is hard to imagine more instantly propulsive music but as the Dutch Ballet Orchestra delivers the surging opening, the dancers are caught in a spectral slow motion, each body still tuning up. They gather speed but when the waves of Wolfe’s music subside, their balance is challenged by forming frozen tableaux, some on one leg. Uniformity is rare among the movements of this huge ensemble, often locked in individual patterns under the abrupt switches in Jan Fedinger’s colourful lighting design, which complements huge projections from British naturalist F Percy Smith’s 1910 filmThe Birth of a Flower, with snowdrops and roses coming into bloom. As these become kaleidoscopic on screen there is no tessellation on stage to match nature’s symmetry, rather industrious individuality, with an occasional floral motif as a dancer curls into a tight bud or extends a limb like an unfurling petal.View image in fullscreenKid in a Candy Shop features excerpts from F Percy Smith’s film The Birth of a Flower.Photograph: © Rahi RezvaniSeveral sections feel like rehearsal games that have not been transformed into a compelling whole in performance. But the dancers’ precision is showcased in a second half set to Hanna Kulenty’s GG Concerto, harpsichordist Gośka Isphording sending the dancers into pinballing, glitching sequences as they bounce, hop, bend and spin in turn. Performed in muted candy-colour costumes, these are pick’n’mix routines befitting the title, but while some sequences fizz the overall result is never as fun as perhaps intended, nor as beautiful as the flower videos that continually threaten to upstage it.Elsewhere at the festival, petals fill the stage inPlease Hold My HandbyCompagnie Tiuri, the Dutch group which creates work for performers with and without disabilities. Its artistic director, Jordy Dik, has crafted a resonant dance-theatre response to shocking statistics about femicide in his homeland and around the world. It is delivered by a cast of four women within the fringe curtains of Loura Sita van Krimpen’s boudoir-style set, established as a safe space yet invaded by violent episodes as the piece unfolds.View image in fullscreenHealing quality … Please Hold My Hand by Compagnie Tiuri.Photograph: Noortje van GestelIt opens with a tender ritual: one woman washes herself, joined by others who brush her hair and dress her. Only slowly does the impact of what may have happened before the scene sink in. A sense of trauma hangs over this tribute to togetherness, as the dancers shield each other, lend their bodies for support in a duet of alternating back bends or simply clean up after each other. But there is abundant joy here, too, as they twirl with silken movements. Red petals are scattered from an upturned umbrella, piling up like autumn leaves. As bodies are dragged through them, the patterns can resemble smeared blood.The piece cleverly plays with romantic gesture and cliche, as partners share caresses and sweep each other off their feet, before the movement evokes coercive control instead. Gaiety is often a step away from brutality, an embrace turning into a grip; the lights are dimmed for a scene in which a woman is punched and kicked in the stomach. Dik reminds us that women’s attackers have frequently been their partners.In a scene akin to Ontroerend Goed’sSirens, the women take turns at a microphone to ape everyday sexism and abusive threats, their tone veering from sly to sinister (“This stays between us, right?”). There is a steely grace to the performances by Andrea Beugger, Margriet Jacobs, Sabine van Riel and Annemieke Mooij and an overall healing quality in Dik’s appeal to give people their flowers.View image in fullscreenParable … Fernando Melo’s The Longest Distance Between Two Points.Photograph: Hans GerritsenThe unnerving blend of material – now horrifying, now humorous, elegant then messy, always sensorial, a rich musical collage – is pure Pina Bausch. One dancer’s lipstick kisses on paper are given to the audience and another scene, featuring balloons and hot pants, is more straightforwardly derivative. It provides an oddly abrupt ending to the piece, which has an activist coda outlining global statistics of violence against women and asking us to illuminate tealight candles for the women we love.Dik’s short piece Live, Live, All We Can Do Is Live – a boyband mini-concert, featuring one dancer’s memories of his dreams to become a Spice Girl – is included in the festival’sHubClubprogramme, presented byIntrodans. An inclusive platform for disabled and non-disabled talent, HubClub is styled as an irreverent cabaret, with five short works (mostly fragments from existing pieces) sandwiched between an overture and a finale. These dancers are introduced in spangly evening wear, gathered around – and even under – a dining table, cigarettes dangling from lips.The scene changes between each segment are handled with wit and invention. For Fernando Melo’s nifty piece The Longest Distance Between Two Points, that table is stripped bare, its long planks becoming partners for the cast and even used as impromptu stages for them, held at various angles. Steve Reich’s Music for Pieces of Wood adds pace as plank-carrying dancers circle each other to create human-made borders that appear almost out of thin air in a piece that is free-flowing and claustrophobic as it becomes a parable about division and confined identities. In the wrong hands, these structures oppress; in others, they provide support. It’s deceptively simple, surprisingly moving when two yearning men are separated by a wall and is – beware splinters! – performed without gloves or socks by a deft company. The potentially lumbering concept proves instead extremely malleable.View image in fullscreenCircus spirit … Boulevard of Broken Dreams by Inbal Pinto.Photograph: Hans GerritsenTwo pieces in HubClub reveal Inbal Pinto’s gift for quirky choreography with a troubling undercurrent. Salty Pink is a seaside folly, with pelvis-thrusting bathers stretching out against a bucolic backdrop and seeking picture-postcard fun, their ruddy demeanour cracking to reveal despair. Boulevard of Broken Dreams, featuring a Foley sound artist, has a circus spirit and trompe l’oeil effects, as a floaty dress is pulled on and off each dancer, taking on a different meaning each time. The costume becomes almost as charged a symbol as the red dress in Bausch’s Rite of Spring, sparking joy, jealousy and fury at different turns, depending on the combination of wearer and observers. This disrobing and dressing is done with smooth grace, Pinto’s call for communal respect and liberty as understated as Melo’s.Conny Janssen’s Manoeuvres is short and sweet: an escapist tea break in a drab canteen for a group of workers. To a medley of golden oldies, they are first seen daydreaming – reading a novel or building a castle from sugarcubes. Then they are dancing in their seats, up on tabletops, sharing loose-hipped rock’n’roll duets or scampering across the floor. Percussion is provided by spoons and cups. Pointedly, they turn to look at the clock on the wall: how will you choose to spend your time off? It’s an irresistible 10 minutes that you don’t want to end – much like the last dancer, still lost in movement as the cleaners pack up around him.View image in fullscreenIrresistible … Conny Janssen’s Manoeuvres.Photograph: Hans GerritsenHubClub’s party spirit is matched by Gauthier Dance’s exuberant if inconsistentFireWorks, conceived to celebrate 40 years of Theaterhaus Stuttgart, where the company is based, and now relaunched for Holland Dance festival’s 20th jubilee. Artistic directorEric Gauthieris the antithesis of lofty pretension: he has an eye for crowd-pleasing concepts and a knack for opening up the artform. Bouncing on to stage in a leather jacket, he gives a showman’s introduction to an evening whose logistics are dizzying: the 16 dancers and a charismatic, eight-strong young company deliver more than a dozen short works including Gauthier’s own jokey ABC of dance, a whistlestop solo encapsulating key positions, choreographers and other essentials.It all adds up to 150 minutes yet flies by and the evening culminates in an eye-popping Bolero performed on trampolines that suggests Gauthier is also an aficionado of DanceTok. Tonight’s audience can’t keep their cameraphones in their pockets as it builds steam. The concept may seem ridiculous but it is infectious fun, each dancer’s bounce accentuating the insistent repetition of the sultry rhythms. Andonis Foniadakis’s choreography is transformed into a tongue-in-cheek exercise class as dancer after dancer arrives on stage with their own trampoline to join in, the increasing spectacle of endurance adding to Ravel’s epic crescendo.View image in fullscreenSpectacle of endurance … Andonis Foniadakis’s Bolero+ from FireWorks by Gauthier Dance.Photograph: Jeanette BakIn this daisy-chain of performances on a bright red stage, the music choices are as eclectic as the dance styles: Dominique Dumais’s corps pulsating to Laurie Anderson’s O Superman, Marco Goecke (of thedog faeces attackon a critic) fusing a solo and duet to Mercedes Sosa, or the summery fun of Benjamin Millepied performed by a bright athleisure-clad crew to Oscar Peterson.Johan Inger’s A Thousand Thoughts melds the Kronos Quartet’s ominous Bells and its version of the traditional Swedish folk music Tusen Tankar for a haunting duet with a fairytale quality, the dancers joining souls (and, in some bewitching floorwork, soles) for movement that is rich in mystery and bracingly pure in its vision of companionship. These snatched minutes together seemingly amount to a lifetime. No less gripping is Virginie Brunelle’s Carousel, to Philip Glass’s music for Les Enfants Terribles, where the central couple’s revolving encounters are scrutinised by the other dancers.The bright young performers of Gauthier’s Juniors company (at 19-23, older than they sound) are a great match for the playful humour of aDevendra Banhartmedley that accompanies Alejandro Cerrudo’s Lickety-Split. These insouciant duets and carefree encounters are a delight, down to one dancer playfully head-butting another’s rear into just the right position. After all, in Gauthier’s alphabet of dance, A is not just for arabesque but also for ass.Holland Dance festivalruns until 21 February, with many performances then touring.

FromRihanna’s pregnancy revealtoKendrick Lamar’s show-stealing jeans, the 13-minute showcase has long doubled as a luxury fashion parade.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny and his dancers brought Puerto Rican imagery to the Super Bowl stage.Photograph: Kindell Buchanan/PAAnd few musicians are as plugged into that world as the Puerto Rican megastar.Bad Bunnyhas fronted underwear campaigns for Calvin Klein and Jacquemus, and on 1 February he attended the Grammys in a black velvet Schiaparelli suit sculpted into an hourglass with gold corsetry laced down the back.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny in Schiaparelli at the Grammys.Photograph: John Shearer/Getty Images for the Recording AcademyAsSpotify’s most-streamed artist of 2025, Bad Bunny is about as famous as a musician can be. But he is also one of the most visually astute performers. Just as this all-Spanish lyrics underlined the fact that English is no longer pop music’s lingua franca, his decision to wear high street at television’s most-watched event suggests couture is no longer pop’s default uniform either.With its affordable interpretations of catwalk trends,Zararemains the emblem of budget-friendly – albeit unsustainable–chic, sitting at the centre of the runway-to-high street pipeline. Almost anyone can wear Zara.Bad Bunny’s first look comprised a collared shirt and tie, cropped off-white trousers, Adidas Resilience trainers and a cropped padded American football jersey with the word Ocasio – part of his full name, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio – across the back.View image in fullscreenThe rapper and singer redefined Super Bowl style in a bespoke off-white Zara ensemble.Photograph: Kindell Buchanan/PAWorn at the start of his performance within a sugar cane field surrounded by dancers in the straw hats worn by jíbaros, Puerto Rico’s rural farmers (Benito also wore a jíbaro-style rope belt), the outfit initially sparked speculation about the number 64 emblazoned across the front. Online sleuths variously suggested it referred to the year of his mother’s birth and the US Congress that granted Puerto Ricans citizenship in 1917. According to Complex magazine, it was in fact his uncle’s football jersey number.It was not until he re-emerged midway through his 13-minute set for a duet with Lady Gaga, wearing a broad-shouldered off-white suit and tie, that Zara confirmed it was behind both looks. Styled by Storm Pablo and Marvin Douglas Linares, the outfits were bespoke; off the rack, a Zara suit would cost about £250.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny and Lady Gaga perform.Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPAAndrew Groves, a professor of fashion design at the University of Westminster in London, UK, said: “The suit still reads as authority, but the authority comes from Bad Bunny’s cultural position, not from a luxury house’s stamp of approval.“Though Bad Bunny isn’t wearing a zoot suit [the wide style worn byyoung Black and Latino people in the 30s and 40s that became a symbol of rebellion against marginalisation] it uses the same proportional logic: exaggerated volume as a way for Black and Latino communities to claim public space when visibility was policed.“On a stadium stage it reads as controlled presence, not decoration. Zara on a Super Bowl stage is a statement about power-shifting.”The suit’s fluid cut even drew comparisons to Francisco Goya’s anti-war masterpiecethe Third of May 1808, which depicts a Spanish civilian wearing a billowing white shirt facing a French firing squad.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny blended high-street fashion with personal symbolism on the Super Bowl LX stage.Photograph: Dave Shopland/ShutterstockOther cultural references were more overt. Lady Gaga wore a custom blue pleated ruffle dress with aflor de maga(Puerto Rico’s national flower) brooch by Luar, the New York label led by the Dominican designer Raul Lopez, echoing the colours of the Puerto Rican flag. Within the set design’s pinkcasita, inspired by the island’s candy-coloured homes, dancers wore knitted outfits by the Puerto Rican designer Jomary Segarra’s brand Yo+.Super Bowl half-time shows have long been style spectacles, but they occasionally veer into politics. Beyoncé’s 2016 Formation performance,with its Black Panther references, made global headlines.After saying “ICE out” at the Grammys last week, there had been speculation that Bad Bunny could make another political statement. He did not wear an Ice Out pin. Instead, he wore something his fans could afford – paying homage to a pop culture that is increasingly multilingual, international and, at its heart, accessible.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnySuper BowlSuper Bowl LXNFLZaraPuerto RicofeaturesShareReuse this content"

As he publishes a polemic about surveillance and state control, the artist relives a momentous trip to see his motherMon 9 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 10.29 ESTShareAi Weiwei is talking me through the decision-making process before his first visit to China in over a decade. The artist, known around the world as the most famous critic of the Chinese communist regime, had to do some fraught arithmetic before deciding to head back home.Before boarding a flight with his son, who had never met the artist’s elderly mother, Ai thought back to his time in detention when his captors told him he would spend the next13 years in custody on bogus charges: “They said, ‘When you come out, your son won’t recognise you.’ That was very heavy and really the only moment that touched me.”I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. That’s my only relationship to China. I’m not patrioticHe ended up spending several months in captivity. Lao, his son, is now 17. Ai says Lao doesn’t really need his guidance any more so he decided to book their flights and roll the dice. “People said, ‘Are you scared?’ I said, ‘No, why should I be scared?’ I’m Chinese. I have a Chinese passport. I’m entitled to go back and see my mum. So I went back.”View image in fullscreen100m hand-painted seeds … Ai’s famous Turbine Hall exhibition.Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty ImagesWelcome to the life of Ai Weiwei. For most people, returning home doesn’t involve weighing up the risk of whether you’ll see close family ever again, but that’s the reality for a 68-year-old whose whole existence has been shaped by authoritarianism and the struggle against it.His trip to China went well. He ended up being interviewed at the airport and released after a couple of hours into a country whose smells, sights and sounds were soothing to him. Ai described the journey as being like “a phone call suddenly reconnecting”. Today, he’s more poetic, describing it as “a piece of jade broken that you can put back together because it matches very well. Everything’s so familiar: the light, the temperature, the people.”Ai is meeting me in the London offices of his publisher to talk about his new book,On Censorship, a 90-page polemic on the nature of state control, AI and surveillance. The man certainly knows about these things. Born in Beijing in 1957, he grew up in labour camps in north-west China following the exile of his father, the poet Ai Qing. In 2011, he was detained for 81 days in a 170 sq ft windowless prison because of his own activism. Upon his release, he was tracked, interrogated and threatened by the Chinese state; then his passport was returned in 2015 and he began a life in exile. He currently divides his time between Lisbon, Berlin and Cambridge.I feel the same kind of surveillance and censorship in the westHis artworks are as dramatic as his backstory. An army of 1,600 Chinese artisans created100m hand-painted porcelain“seeds” that were scattered over the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in London 16 years ago. He cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus in 14,000 fluorescent orange lifejackets worn by refugees; and made a film dedicated to the children who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. That direct challenge to the official state narrative made him “the most dangerous person in China”.His upcoming work, at Aviva Studios in Manchester, involves 30 tonnes of buttons, which weresaved from a London factorythat was closing down and smuggled into China to be turned into huge hanging artworks by craftspeople.The book is a startling read, arguing that those in the west misunderstand the nature of censorship. He defines it as “the exercise of power over intellectual space”, both “an indispensable tool of mental enslavement and a fundamental source of political corruption”. It is not just authoritarian regimes, he warns. Liberal societies think that censorship is rare, “but people forget that even on sunny days, shadows are inevitable”.View image in fullscreenWorn by refugees … some of the 14,000 lifejackets that cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus.Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/EPASome of the arguments are perplexing. In a section about the limitations of AI, the artist refers to the selfie he took with AfD leaderAlice Weidel in 2018. He says AI decided that the image, which is real, must have been fake because the pair seemed to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At the time of the selfie, Weidel,whose grandfather was a Nazi, was considered to be in the more moderate wing of the far-right party, but since becoming leader has called for“large-scale repatriations” of foreigners, saying the country’s focus on the Holocaust is akin to a “guilt cult”.Does Ai regret the selfie? He tells me that on many issues, her political demands “could be wrong”, but she’s still “more rational than other political opponents in Germany”. What about her anti-immigrant rhetoric – isn’t that anathema to him? “Some states don’t even accept one [immigrant] and Germany accepts 1.2 million, which is a pretty generous decision,” he replies. “So if they change the policy and they want to limit it, then there is nothing wrong.”He’s also impressed by the fact that Weidel “openly wants Germany to be more independent from American influence”. He adds: “I think those are some of the things that we need to do.” Those who know German politics would find that argument surprising because the AfD are seen as the party who are closest to Trump and nearly all parties in the country want more independence from the US. A ringing endorsement of someone at the outermost reaches of far-right European politics might cause a few double takes, and there are more surprises.My position with China started before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in a black hole with my fatherAi’s attitude to China has shifted dramatically. The nation, he said recently, is “in an upward phase,” pointing to the technological advancements made and increased personal freedoms. The west, however, struggles to “sustain its own logic”, has lost its “ethical authority” and has “descended into something barely recognisable”.Although a quick glance across the Atlantic at America in the age of ICE raids does somewhat make his point, he means Europe, too. So is the Chinese regime’s most famous critic now toeing the party line? “My position withChinastarted before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in this black hole with my father,” he says, pointing to a picture on his iPhone of a desolate location in north-west China.He’s not angry exactly, but the suggestion that he’s softened on the Chinese government has touched a nerve. “I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. So that’s my only relationship to China,” he says. “I’m not nostalgic. I’m not patriotic.” What about the claim that the west embraces censorship? Is that his experience in the UK?“I cannot get into details,” he says cryptically. “But I feel the same kind of surveillance, same kind of censorship in the west.”View image in fullscreenDetail … the artist at work in his Berlin studio.Photograph: Steffen Roth/The ObserverPressed for an example, he tells me a story about the Royal Academy in London, an institution that gave him alandmark exhibition in 2015and made himan honorary member in 2011following his detainment in China. In November 2023, an exhibition of new works to be shown at the Lisson Gallery was pulled after he posted a tweet that began: “The sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world.” The tweet was deleted, with the artist telling journalists his show had “effectively [been] cancelled”.In the aftermath, a vote was then held at the RA to determine whether his membership should be revoked because of accusations that the post was antisemitic. “I don’t have the intention of an antisemite. My best friends, they’re all Jewish people,” says Ai. “I tweeted millions of tweets on Twitter, but [how is it that] this tweet can cause such trouble? Then they said the procedure is to let the Academicians vote.”His peers supported him and he won the vote. Ai was then asked to write an article about freedom of speech for the RA’s magazine, which he did, arguing: “Speaking the truth and insisting on one’s own perspective is dangerous and may come at a heavy price. Books may go unpublished, exhibitions may be closed, concerts cancelled.”On Censorship by Ai Weiwei review – are we losing the battle for free speech?Read moreAfter he sent it, there was silence. Then he says the RA claimed they didn’t have room to run the piece. For him, this is the censorship in the west, which he argues in OnCensorshipcan be “more covert, more deceptive and more corrosive” than in authoritarian regimes. “I have several cases like this,” Ai adds. “Happens in Britain and in Germany.”The RA disputes this account, claiming the decision to drop the piece was made before Ai submitted it. A spokesperson added: “Plurality of voices, tolerance and free thinking are at the core of what we stand for and seek to protect.”I wonder how Ai feels about the world in 2026. His new book paints it as a place without refuge for those who value self-expression and freedom of speech. “I think today we are living in a complicated world, where life is more like a shattered mirror,” he says. “It reflects the reality, but the reality can be a broken reality.”Did his trip to China restore his faith in humanity? There’s a pause. “If we were in the time of the Tang dynasty, someone like me would go back and write beautiful poetry,” he says, smiling. “But not today. I just take a few selfies.”On Censorship by Ai Weiwei is published by Thames & Hudson (£12.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Born Hosato Takei in Los Angeles to Japanese-American parents, he was renamed George by his father after King George VI’s coronation. He and his family were forced to live in variousUS Japanese concentration campsduring the second world war, after which Takei went on to study architecture and theatre, including time at the Shakespeare Institute at Stratford-upon-Avon.Takei’s early acting career included providing English dubbing voices for 1950s Japanese monster films, including Rodan and Godzilla Raids Again. He got a few small roles on the big screen, largely in war films (including Never So Few and Hell to Eternity), but was more successful on TV, getting cast in a number of popular shows including Perry Mason, The Twilight Zone, My Three Sons and Mission: Impossible. In the same year as his M:I role – 1966 –Star Trekcreator Gene Roddenberry cast him as physicist Hikaru Sulu in the second pilot episode, leading him to play Lieutenant (later Captain) Sulu in all three seasons of the original 1960s Star Trek series and in the first six Star Trek films between 1979 and 1991.Since then, it’s almost a case of “where hasn’t he popped up?” On TV, he’s appeared in Miami Vice, Scrubs, Will & Grace, Malcolm in the Middle, and five episodes of The Simpsons (most famously as the sushi chef who nearly kills Homer with the deadly fugu blowfish). He came third on I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, where he gamely ate a kangaroo penis during a bush tucker trial, but was fired early in the US Celebrity Apprentice by Donald Trump after taking the fall as project manager on a task promoting Ivanka Trump’s clothing line.On stage, Takei starred with Martin Sheen and Jamie Lee Curtis in the play 8 about the Proposition 8 same-sex marriage trial, and in the musical Allegiance, which ran on Broadway and in the West End, inspired by his own experiences in the camps. He’s written seven books, including his autobiography and an award-winning graphic novel memoir. He voiced Emperor Yoshiro in the video game Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3, and is so well known for his catchphrase “Oh my” – which originated from an accidental exclamation on a US radio show – that he even starred in a 2017 Pizza Hut Super Bowl ad riffing on it. He is also a prominent advocate for the LGBTQ+ community; Takei came out as gay in 2005, prompted in part by then-California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s veto of same-sex marriage legislation.So, that should be more than enough for when Takei sits for the next reader interview. We’re back to his specialist subject, Star Trek, as he appears in Beam Me Up, Sulu, a documentary about a long-lost Star Trek fan film created in 1985 that, in the words of the producers, “becomes a gateway into a much larger conversation about representation in Hollywood, the evolution of fandom and the enduring power of science fiction to inspire social progress”.So please get in your questions by 6pm on Thursday 12 February, via subspace radio, flip-phone communicator, patching through to Lieutenant Uhura, or ideally by posting in the comments below, and we’ll print his answers in Film&Music.Beam Me Up, Sulu is on digital platforms in the US from 17 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewStar TrekTelevisionUS televisioncalloutShareReuse this content"

The artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio transformed the pitch of the Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, into his own love letter to the island, with cinematic set pieces including sugarcane fields, a house party, and a livelywedding ceremonyfeaturing a surprise performance byLady Gaga.By contrast, the rightwing Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show drew just 5.2 million viewers. The event promised to offer an alternative by celebrating “American culture, freedom and faith” and featured the country singer Kid Rock performing in a fedora and jean shorts against a stars and stripes backdrop, in a performance that appeared to be partly lip-synced.Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time show review – a thrilling ode to Boricua joyRead moreMeanwhile, Bad Bunny tapped into just how broad a definition of “America” could be, shouting “God bless America” before reeling off a list of countries and territories including the US and “mi madre”,Puerto Rico.On Truth Social,Donald TrumpcalledBad Bunny’s show “absolutely terrible, one of the worst”, and a “slap in the face to our country”. Piers Morgan later hit back at Trump,writing: “Couldn’t disagree more, Mr President. I absolutely loved Bad Bunny’s halftime show … Oh, and Spanish is 1st language for 50m+ Americans!”Meghan McCain also showed her support,writing: “I’m sorry but I just genuinely question your taste level if you didn’t enjoy the Bad Bunny halftime show.”Celebrities supporting Bad Bunny’s performance included the Grammy-award winning artist Kacey Musgraves, whowrote on X: “That made me feel more proudly American than anything Kid Rock has ever done.” Rapper Doechii alsowrote: “Bad Bunny WOW ! Fucking, WOW . History.”Country star Zach Bryan also mocked the alternative show, sharing a video of someone blocking Bad Bunny’s set with a hand and watching the Turning Point performance. “What kid rock actually thinks is happening across America,” he wrote in an Instagram story.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny and Lady Gaga during half-time show.Photograph: John Angelillo/UPI/ShutterstockThe Brazilian directorKleber Mendonça Filho, whose film The Secret Agent is up for Oscars next month, alsowrote: “What a beautiful and extraordinary thing, Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl reminding the US who they are and where they are.”California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,wrote: “America, the beautiful. THANK YOU, BAD BUNNY.” Previously, Newsom had declared Sunday “national Bad Bunny day” in California. Tom Brady summed up the overall response, writing “Amazing!!!!!!!!!” on an Instagram story.In afive-star review, the Guardian’s Stefanie Fernández called it a celebration of “the love, the community and the absolute joy that we create together every day in spite of everything else”.‘A statement about power shifting’: why Bad Bunny wore Zara for his Super Bowl showRead moreEarlier this month, Bad Bunnytook homethe album of the year Grammy for his 2025 release Debí Tirar Más Fotos, which blends traditional Puerto Rican genres with hip-hop and reggaeton. During one his speeches that night, he said: “We are not savages, we are not animals, we are not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans … The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love.”Last year he was Spotify’s most-streamed global artist with more than 19.8bn streams, dethroning Taylor Swift, who had held that title for the previous two years.The half-time show’s references to politics were subtle but frequent. On stage Bad Bunny carried the Puerto Rican flag of independence, the original flag of the territory that was outlawed until 1952 and is distinguished by its sky blue triangle. While performing a salsa version of her 2024 Bruno Mars duet Die With a Smile, Lady Gaga wore a dress in the same shade.Ricky Martinguested and performed Lo Que le Pasó a Hawaii, a plea against gentrification and white tourism in Puerto Rico with a Spanish-language hook translating to “I don’t want them to do to you what they did to Hawaii.” He laterwroteon social media: “I need several hours to process the tsunami of emotions I’m feeling.”While performing El Apagón, Bad Bunny referenced the territory’s frequent power outages alongside dancers who climbed fizzling electricity pylons.As well as showing the artist’s humble side, it also proved his pulling power with a house party segment, which featured starsincludingthe rapper Cardi B, actor Pedro Pascal and the Colombian singer Karol G.Ahead of the performance, Bad Bunnysaid: “I really want people to have fun.

As a result Jonny and Paul Thomas Anderson have asked for it to be removed from the documentary.”Melania, directed by Brett Ratner, purports to provide an inside look at the life of the former Melania Knauss, the Slovenian model who married Donald Trump and now serves as first lady of the United States. It has been uniformly panned by critics as dull and unrevealing; in a rarezero-star review, the Guardian’s Xan Brooks called it “deadly”, “dispiriting” and “one of those rare, unicorn films that doesn’t have a single redeeming quality”.Melania review – Trump film is a gilded trash remake of The Zone of InterestRead moreThe film has made $13.35m domestically over two weeks in theaters – a high tally for a documentary, powered in part byorganized groups of Republican womenwho view the film as a political cause, though not nearly enough to recoup its budget. The past weekend saw the filmdrop 67%in its second weekend in the US.Amazon MGM paid a staggering $40m to acquire streaming rights for the film, then paid another $35m to market it in theaters, an unprecedented sum for a nonfiction film not about nature or music.The unusual numbers have prompted industry speculation that Amazon made the purchase to cozy up to Trump, who has been helping to engineer a comeback for Ratner after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct during the #MeToo movement.In November 2025, it wasreportedthat Rush Hour 4, a sequel to the Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker buddy-cop series that Ratner had long sought to revive, was a go at Paramount Skydance, after Trump intervened. The president reportedly lobbied his friend and backer Larry Ellison, the largest shareholder of the new Paramount Skydance – which, earlier this year, as Paramount Global,settled a lawsuit with Trumpover a critical CBS News interview with the president – to secure funding for the film.The women who saw Melania in theaters: ‘If you’re Republican, this is girls’ night’Read moreLast week, while accepting a screenplay prize from the London Critics’ Circle, Andersonsaidhe wanted to share the award with the Guardian’s Brooks for his Melania review calling the film “a gilded trash remake of Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest in which a button-eyed Cinderella points at gold baubles and designer dresses, cunningly distracting us while her husband and his cronies prepare to dismantle the constitution and asset-strip the federal government”.“It was one of the best pieces of writing,” said Anderson. “Pretty damn good.”Phantom Thread received six Oscar nominations, including best original score.Explore more on these topicsMelaniaPhantom ThreadMelania TrumpPaul Thomas AndersonJonny GreenwoodnewsShareReuse this content"

A colossus of African music. Ebo Taylor passed away yesterday; a day after the launch of Ebo Taylor music festival and exactly a month after his 90th birthday, leaving behind an unmatched artistry legacy. Dad, your light will never fade.”A spokesperson for the Ghanaian president told the BBC’s Newsday programme that Taylor would “be remembered as one of our greatest musicians ever ... a man who strove to put Ghanaian music on the global map at a time when other genres of music were prominent”.A recent interview on the music website Passion of the Weisshailed Taylor as“the greatest rhythm guitarist in history … with complete originality, he incorporated the diverse rhythmic traditions of the Ga, Ewe, Dagomba and his own Akan people into his compositions.”Taylor was born Deroy Taylor on Ghana’s Cape Coast on 6 January 1936. He started playing piano at the age of six, his tastes shaped by American and English music, in part as a result of Ghana being a British colony at the time.Growing up during the blossoming of highlife, he switched to guitar while he was at college, and subsequently joined the Stargazers – whose members Teddy Osei and Sol Amarfio would later form the UK-based Afro-rock bandOsibisa– and a succession of other bands. He became known for his rare embrace of both highlife – largely played in a major mode – and Afrobeat, which hews to minor modes.View image in fullscreenTaylor at the 2011 Womad festival.Photograph: C Brandon/RedfernsAt the Eric Gilder School of Music in London in the early 1960s, Taylor studied Dvořák and cited the complexity of the Czech composer’s music as an influence on his own. But he also said that he learned more outside of the classroom, by sitting in with bands and attending jazz and highlife jams, and meeting acts including the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.At the time, Nigerian musicianFela Kutiwas studying at Trinity College in the capital. The pair became friends, bonding over a common interest in highlife and often jamming together. “We also had the desire to become a Miles Davis, a Charlie Christian, or a Kenny Burrell,”Taylor told Post Genre in 2025. “So we had the same mood … He was such a playful and lively person.”The two musicians became genre innovators. In 2014, Taylortold the BBCthat “with the advent of James Brown and funk music there was the opportunity to develop highlife music. Fela did a lot of work introducing the funk into the Yoruba music while comparatively I did almost the same thing in Ghana.”Taylor credited Kuti with encouraging him to write distinctly African music, and he combined the influence of Dvořák and Davis with a strong sense of his own musical traditions, both from Ghana and his Malian grandmother. “I do believe that it is important for music to progress, otherwise it just becomes something for museums, but you have to know your traditional culture before you start addings things to it,”he told the Vinyl Factory in 2018.After forming the Black Star Highlife Band in London in 1964, he returned to his home country a year later, and formed bands including the New Broadway Dance Band and the Blue Monks, which both featured, for a time, fellow Ghanaian musician Pat Thomas – now a member ofأحمد [Ahmed].View image in fullscreenTaylor performing in Spain in 2012.Photograph: Esteban Martinena Guerrero/EPA/ShutterstockIn the early 70s, Taylor worked as in-house guitarist, arranger and producer at the Essiebons label, run by Dick Essilfie-Bondzie, a former government worker turned music impresario who released what a 2021 reissue called “the best in modern highlife”. Taylor recorded several of his own albums for the label and worked on records by artists such as Thomas and Gyedu-Blay Ambolley.In the 80s, Taylor stepped back from fronting his own bands to work on other artists’ records. In the 2000s, he taught music at the University of Ghana.His first internationally released album, Love and Death, came out in 2010. Taylor’s music had become more widely disseminated thanks to increased international interest in highlife, which was the subject of many reissue records and compilations. His songs were also sampled by artists including Usher, the Black Eyed Peas, Kelly Rowland, Jidenna and Vic Mensa. Love and Death prompted a renewed run of activity for Taylor, which included the albums Appia Kwa Bridge (2012) and Yen Ara (2018), and international touring.In 2018, Taylor had a stroke that impaired his ability to speak English. For the 2025 album Ebo Taylor JID022, a collaboration with Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Adrian Younge’s Jazz Is Dead project, his son Henry facilitated communication between the three musicians – and played guitar on the project himself. Taylor also often played with his son Roy. It is unclear how many children Taylor had; his eldest son Ebo Taylor Jr died in 2022.At the age of 90, Taylor was no longer able to play guitar. He lived much of his life, including his later years, in the small coastal city of Saltpond, where he was known locally as Uncle Ebo. He received several lifetime achievement awards from organisations representing Ghanaian and highlife music.The contemporary singer and rapper Black Sherif paid tribute to Taylor: “We lost a legend whose contribution to music has created worldwide ripples. I take solace in the fact that I witnessed greatness in Uncle Ebo Taylor’s art form. Rest In Power!”Explore more on these topicsMusicGhanaFela KutiAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Rothman said in his speech: “I was thinking … that in the face of the regressive and despicable video that we were subject to last week – from the leader of the free world no less – that stories like these remain ever more urgent and important.”He added: “We’re very grateful to the creators who trust us with those stories and to audiences around the world … It feels kind of silly for the old white dude to be standing up here accepting this award as it belongs to all the people at the motion picture group – one that I’m very proud to say is a diverse and inclusive group.”Trump has since deleted the video,and blamed aides for not watching it, but its posting on Thursdaytriggered widespread outrageacross the political spectrum for its depiction of the Obamas as cartoon apes.

It is like saying that my love of Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather makes me a mobster. It’s extraordinary.”She is hopeful the amendment will be supported by the deputy prime minister, David Lammy.The amendment wasdrafted by Keir Monteith KC, who is part of the Art Not Evidence campaign group, which has argued that lyrics should not be read literally and are often entirely false, exaggerated or simply part of artistic expression.Anopen letterthe group sent to Lammy when he was the justice secretary argued that “these creative expressions have no connection to the serious crimes alleged, and are used to paint a misleading and prejudicial picture, conflating art with evidence.”The amendment would not rule out the use of lyrics but would only permit the practice when they are directly related to a case.Chakrabarti said: “It has to be very limited and it has to be particular to the facts of the case and not just a general interest in this music, which somehow demonstrates a general proclivity to dishonesty or violence.”The campaigners also want to see expert witnesses on this form of music in criminal prosecutions be independent, along with procedural safeguards against stereotyping.Chakrabarti added that at present ex-officers are often used as experts, which she said amounted to “retired police officers enjoying a nice little side hustle as independent experts on rap and drill, which is where something that is abusive becomes positively absurd.”The number of appeals involving cases where lyrics have been used by the police hastripled in recent years. The Metropolitan police in London has specific units that monitor behaviour on the internet, includingrap videos and content.The Crown Prosecution Service haspreviously told the Guardianthat it “has never prosecuted anybody solely on the basis of their involvement with drill/rap music” but that “drill/rap music may be of specific relevance to the case against a suspect, in which case it may be used as evidence.”However, research released in 2023 identified more than 70 trials from 2020-23 in which rap evidence including lyrics, music videos and audio recordings has been used by police and prosecutors to build their cases. Successfulappeals against the use of lyricsor music video appearances are rare.London and Manchester are the two cities where this kind of evidence is used in cases most often, while lyrics and music videos are regularly presented as evidence in joint enterprise cases such as theManchester 10.Explore more on these topicsMusicDrillRapUK criminal justiceCrown Prosecution ServicenewsShareReuse this content"

No. Possibly not even the greatest of half-term. This loud, chaotic and unlovable animated kids’ comedy feels as though it is bordering on AI slop, algorithmically generated and instantly familiar fromZootropolis,Singand other movies with talking animals. It is a shame, because it has a real-life inspiration: basketball star Stephen Curry, who was repeatedly told at the start of his career that he was too skinny and too small to make it as a pro. Curry is a producer here, and has a performing role. But in spite of this connection, Goat lacks heart and soul, and a sense of genuine emotions.What it does have is some pretty decent voice acing, bringing a degree of charm to the movie. Will Harris (voiced by Caleb McLaughlin) is a goat who has grown up dreaming of playing professional “roarball”, a fiercer and faster version of basketball. But Will is a “small” and roar players are all “bigs” – powerful beasts such as rhinos and horses. Will’s hero and the star of his favourite team, the Thorns, is a panther called Jet (Gabrielle Union), a champ close to retirement but determined to win the league. When Will gets a shot at joining the Thorns, he is laughed at, underrated but undeterred.There are some decent jokes, but they are lost in all the noise. Watching Goat is like standing next to a helicopter as it’s taking off. The roarball games are deafening, and pitched at lightning speed, in courts that switch from jungle settings to an arctic ice experience. The underdog plot is as old as time, and for a film targeted at under-eights there are a lot of scenes with mobile phones, and characters constantly checking their socials. The only thing that lingers after leaving the cinema is a headache.Goat is out on 13 February in the UK and US, and on 26 March in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsComedy filmsBasketballStephen CurryComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the question hovering over Catherine Dyson’s The Last Picture – first shared in a rehearsed reading at YorkTheatreRoyal as part of the RSC’s 37 Plays initiative in 2023 and now receiving a full production. It’s a piece that moves constantly between past and present, testing the empathic capacities and limits of theatre as an art form.There’sa touch of Tim Crouchto Dyson’s writing, which invites the audience into the imaginative act of bringing her words to life. This is a play about pictures in which not a single image is shown. Addressed in the second person, we are cast as audience members in a theatre as well as a class of year 9 students on a school trip to an exhibition about the Holocaust. As the unseen photographic evidence of genocide is described, the play flings us backwards into the scenes captured, placing us in the position of those being led to their murders – as well as that of the neighbours who looked the other way.Guidelines review – teens try to escape the aftermath of a murder filmed on a phoneRead moreOur guide throughout is the excellent Robin Simpson as Sam, the students’ emotional support dog. Radiating a comforting canine energy, Simpson talks us gently through the exhibition, periodically pausing to do a headcount and check how we’re feeling. John R Wilkinson’s absorbing production thrives on simplicity and space, allowing the storytelling and subtle shifts in lighting and sound to transport our imaginations – as well as leaving the gaps that expose where imagination and empathy fall short.Though the play can’t resist closing on a note of hope, there’s nothing neat about The Last Picture’s take on history or humanity. If these images and the responses to them show us anything, it’s that we remain capable of it all: selflessness, brutality, compassion, indifference, kindness and atrocity alike.At York Theatre Royal until 14 February, then touring.Explore more on these topicsTheatreYorkHolocaustAntisemitismreviewsShareReuse this content"

It follows Bickle, a lonely, mentally unstable Vietnam war veteran working as a New York cab driver who, disturbed by the crime, corruption and moral decay he sees around him, develops a dangerous saviour complex.‘We have to stop what’s going on, it’s insane’: Robert De Niro on battling age, apathy and TrumpRead moreBickle narrates: “All the animals come out at night: whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies – sick, venal.

This went on for a couple of weeks.”He would haunt New York’s adult cinemas because they were open day and night. “You could sleep four or five hours in the balcony of the old porn palaces. You would occasionally be awoken by people around you but you could get a few hours of sleep that way.”One day Schrader felt a pain in his stomach, went to an emergency room and was found to have a bleeding ulcer. He was 26. “In the hospital this image came to me of a taxi cab and I said, ‘That’s me: I’m this kid locked up in this yellow box floating in the sewer, who looks like he’s surrounded by people when he’s absolutely alone.’“Whereas other people at that time associated taxi drivers with your garrulous, friendly brother-in-law, I saw inTaxi Driverthe heart and soul of Dostoevsky’s Underground Man.”Before he started writing, Schrader reread works byJean-Paul SartreandAlbert Camus. “I wanted to take this character, who had existed in European literature and American literature – which is the underground man, the existential hero – and bring him to film.”He got the first draft written in just 10 days.“I wrote one draft and immediately started rewriting. I needed to exorcise this character. If I didn’t write about him, I’m afraid I might become him.”Among Taxi Driver’s many memorable scenes is Bickle, his head shaved into a mohawk, attending a political rally with the intention of assassinating a presidential candidate. But Secret Service agents spot Bickle putting his hand inside his jacket and approach him, which escalates to a chase.An inspiration for this wasSara Jane Moore’s attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford in San Francisco in September 1975. “She took a shot at Gerald Ford. She missed and was on the cover of Newsweek magazine the next week.“That’s where I said, ‘That’s what our culture has come down to? You shoot at the president, you miss, and now you’re on the cover of the largest publication in the country.’ That’s where the early ending of Taxi Driver comes: the irony of becoming famous.”Schrader offered the screenplay to the film directorBrian De Palma, who passed it on to Scorsese, who immediately believed in it and even saw something of himself in the underground man. Who, then, would play Bickle? Harvey Keitel was the early favourite. Schrader says: “Bob had been in Mean Streets but Marty went further back with Harvey.“I had gotten [co-producers] Julia and Michael Phillips involved. He showed us an early cut of Mean Streets. Julia and I walked out and we both looked at each other and said, ‘It’s not Harvey, it’s Bob.’ Marty recognised that was the truth but then he had a little problem with what to do about Harvey.”View image in fullscreenRobert De Niro in Taxi Driver.Photograph: Columbia/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockSchrader, Scorsese and De Niro did not talk much about Bickle ahead of production. They did not need to.“We all knew this kid,” Schrader says.Schrader originally wrote the character of Sport, a pimp, as Black to reflect what he had observed on the streets. But executives at Columbia Pictures demanded the role be changed to white, fearing that a white protagonist killing only Black people in the final shootout would incite riots and cause liability.“I had written the pimp Black because he [Bickle] is a racist character and he kills Black people. The studio said, ‘If he only kills Black people, you’re gonna have violence in the theatre.’ Then all of a sudden there was a role for Harvey.”Keitel asked Schrader to find a real life white pimp to model the character on. “I never did find the Great White Pimp,” Schrader admits, but Keitel took the role anyway. Foster, just 12 years old, wascast as the young sex workerIris and held her own when she and De Niro ad-libbed dialogue.There was more improvisation required when Bickle stares at himself in a mirror and imagines a confrontation. Schrader explains: “It was in the script that he takes the gun, plays with it in the mirror, points it at the mirror, pretends to shoot it, talks to himself.“‘What does he say to himself?’ Bobby asked me. ‘What line would it be?’ I said, ‘Hey, it’s like when you’re eight years old and you’re playing cowboy, you’re shooting in the mirror and say, “Hey, gotcha! I’m faster than you!” Stuff like that.’”When the moment arrived, De Niro came up with a line for the ages: “You talkin’ to me?” In 2016, at a screening of Taxi Driver at the Tribeca film festival in New York,he told fans: “Every day for 40 fucking years, at least one of you has come up to me and said – what do you think –‘You talkin’ to me?’”To achieve an R rating without cutting footage, Scorsese desaturated the colour of the final shootout, turning the bright red blood into a “tabloid” brown. Also vital was the musical score by composer Bernard Herrmann, who completed the recording sessions hours before his death.Taxi Driverwas released on 8 February 1976. Schrader remembers talking to someone at Columbia Pictures who thought the film would flop but feeling more optimistic himself. “We made a $20 bet and, on the day it opened at the Coronet, I went over. I wanted to be there, first day, first screening.“It was just about ready to start and I noticed around the theatre there’s a line and I thought, ‘Oh fuck, they had a problem and they’re not letting people in.’ In fact, that was the line for the show two hours later. Right about the time I walked in, the words Taxi Driver came up with that music and the audience applauded. This is the first screening in New York, so all that word of mouth had been buzzing around.”The movie’s debut at the 1976 Cannes film festival drew boos and some walkouts. The playwrightTennessee Williams, the then jury president, said: “Films should not take a voluptuous pleasure in spilling blood and lingering on terrible cruelties as though one were at a Roman circus.”Foster has recalled that, apart from a press conference, Scorsese and De Niro hunkered down in their hotel rooms, worrying that everyone would hate the film. That left the young Foster, who could speak French, to do media interviews. Yet Taxi Driver stillwon Cannes’s top honour, the Palme d’Or.It also struck a chord with theHolden Caulfieldsof the world – young men full of resentment, anger, self-loathing and an inability to connect. Schrader says: “It hit the bullseye of the zeitgeist but you cannot plan to do that. Either it happens or it doesn’t.“I remember one day in my office, I came in and my secretary said, ‘Don’t go in there.’ I said, ‘Why not?’ She said, ‘It’s one of those kids.’ So I went in and there was a kid there and he had jumped over the fence and come to my office. I asked him what he wanted. He said, ‘How did you find out about us?’ I quickly checked to see if he had a gun on him and said, ‘What do you mean?’ He said, ‘That movie, Taxi Driver – who told you about me?’View image in fullscreenMartin Scorsese and Robert De Niro during production.Photograph: WWD/Penske Media/Getty Images“I said, ‘Honestly, no one told me about you; there are a lot more of you than you think.’ Then I said to him, ‘Have you ever been on a movie lot?’ I said, ‘Well, let’s get a golf cart, I’ll show you around the movie sets.’ He said, ‘Oh, that would be cool.’ We went around in a golf cart and I had a security guard come over to me and say, ‘Mr Schrader, you’re needed back.’”Schrader’s interloper was not alone in taking Taxi Driver personally. In March 1981, John Hinckley, who had become obsessed with the movie and had been stalking Foster,tried to assassinatePresident Ronald Reagan in an effort to impress her. Foster was subjected to intense, unwanted media scrutiny at the time and has consistently refused to comment publicly on the incident.Years later, Schrader recounts, De Niro asked if they could bring Bickle back in a sequel. “I said, ‘Bob, first of all he’s dead, but if he wasn’t dead, he’s not riding a taxi any more. He’s sitting up in his cabin in Montana setting off bombs and his name isTed Kaczynski.’”A generation later, the natural heir is the disaffected young man hunched over his laptop, wanderingthe manosphereand potentially exploding into violence. “There is now a whole recognised culture of incels. It’s sort of curious. These lonely kids who would sit and fester in their rooms now fester in their rooms and talk to other lonely kids who are also festering in their rooms. Does this alleviate some of their psychosis or does it heighten it? I don’t know which.”Such cultural relevance helps explain why Taxi Driver has endured for 50 years and will doubtless endure for 50 more. Schrader muses: “Every generation finds it. When someone comes up to me and says, ‘Taxi Driver changed my life,’ I always say to them, ‘Let me guess, you saw it when you were 15, and they say, ‘How did you know?’“I say, ‘Fifteen is the age where you’ve been watching action films and you’ve heard about this film and it’s the first time you realise you can have an action film that isn’t just about action.’ Every generation of young men in particular seem to find that through that film. There are few other films like it that epitomise a certain point in your life and so it is a film that won’t die.”Scorsese went on to make films including Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Casino, The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street.De Nirostarred in The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull, Once Upon a Time in America, Goodfellas, Meet the Parents and many others.Schrader, who continued to write screenplays and also directed films such as Blue Collar, American Gigolo and First Reformed, comments: “Bobby should have taken more chances. He got heavily involved in real estate and that became an excuse to take the money gigs.“Marty said to somebody once, ‘I paint frescoes: I paint the ceiling, I paint the floor; Paul paints Dutch miniatures.’ If you want to paint frescoes, you need a lot of money – a lot more than I need to do Dutch miniatures.”For all its modern resonance, Taxi Driver also stands as a precious time capsule that washed down to 2026 from an America disillusioned bythe Watergate scandalandVietnam war. It is a portrait of a city – the New York of high crime and hustlers that nearly went bankrupt in 1975 – but also a portrait of a moment.Richard Brody, a film critic at the New Yorker, comments: “For me, the most powerful experience of Taxi Driver is not rewatching it; it’s having watched it just about in its time as a teenager and feeling it had concentrated all the craziness of the time into that movie – a kind of requiem for the political and social frenzies of the late 60s and early 70s that by the time of the making of Taxi Driver had spun out of politics and spun into an inchoate but grave crisis.“Taxi Driver gave me the sense, when I saw it, that Scorsese felt a breaking point. He felt the old latches ripped off and volatile, unpredictable energies that had formerly been directly channeled now unleashed.”Explore more on these topicsTaxi DriverPaul SchraderRobert De NiroMartin ScorseseJodie FosterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Georgie’s writing is full of heart and vivid energy, matching its extraordinary craft in every scene,” said Ellie Keel, the prize’s founder director.Sapling has at its root the murder of Conor Flynn by another child during the final years of the Troubles – an act that shocks a communityalready scarred by decades of violence. According to a synopsis released by the prize’s organisers, the story then follows his brother Gerry Flynn when aged 16 – 10 years after the murder.“Despite a deteriorating home life, the pains of adolescence, and the lingering shadow of a brother who never grew up, he’s just about keeping it together – until the events of one day shatter everything.“His brother’s memorial garden is destroyed, his killer released from prison, and the arrival of a charismatic stranger, Ryan, forces Gerry to confront the haunting dilemma: is Ryan the solution to his problems or the reason they exist in the first place?“Sapling is a tender and darkly funny story about what grows when deep-rooted pain is left untended.”Organisers said the latest edition of the award, which was launched in 2019 as the only national prize to champion and support playwrights who identify as female or non-binary, received 1,275 entries – the most it has had so far. Open to English-language plays running over 60 minutes, the prize offers its first prize-winner £20,000 alongside an option for Ellie Keel Productions, Paines Plough and Sheffield Theatres to co-produce the work.The judges – whose number included the artistic director of the National Theatre Indhu Rubasingham, the actor Romola Garai and the Guardian’s editor-in-chief Katharine Viner, among others – were put through a “particularly rigorous” meeting, Keel said, “reflecting the impressive standard of all our final five plays”. She added: “These plays and writers have incredible futures on big stages and I can’t wait to follow their journeys.It was also announced that Kristin Scott Thomas is to be the first winner of a newly created lifetime achievement prize named the Leading Light award. It is designed to “recognise a leading female in the arts industry for their enduring influence, distinguished body of work, and outstanding contribution to culture”, organisers said.The winners were announced at an awards ceremony held on Monday at the West End venue @sohoplace.Explore more on these topicsTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

The novelist, Fiona, gets twitchy when he starts recording and balks when he wonders if her fiction is autobiographical. She squirms and stalls until he ends up asking questions with his back turned, to make it less of an ordeal.Things are not quite as overwrought on our video call when Arikha dials in from Paris. She is accompanied, on screen, by the actor Maryam d’Abo, who is starring in the play in London. So is D’Abo, like Fiona, deeply suspicious of journalists? “Of course,” she says in a friendly tone. Maybe I should turn my back as we talk. Or at least “some” journalists, she adds diplomatically, referring to her formative experience as a “Bond girl”. At the age of 26, she played Kara Milovy, a Czech cellist and would-be sniper who – typically – falls for the charms of Timothy Dalton’s 007 inThe Living Daylights.I was quite shy. I hadn’t been a child actor“I’ve never done so much press,” she recalls. “And in those days, there were the Fleet Street journalists who were harsher and more judgmental. You open your heart because you’re inexperienced – and then it’s edited so you think, ‘That’s not how I meant it.’”View image in fullscreenFalling for 007’s charms … with Timothy Dalton in The Living Daylights.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/RexShe mostly loved the Bond experience, though. “It was like a big family,” she says, with producers Cubby and Barbara Broccoli very present. But she lived with a terror of being somehow exposed, in the aftermath. “I take responsibility for not having had enough confidence,” she explains. “I was quite shy. I hadn’t been a child actor. But I’m not blaming Bond for screwing up my career. I’ll never regret it.”Both a producer and actor, D’Abo made a 2002 documentary, Bond Girls Are Forever, in which she spoke to women about their experiences on 007 films. “My pitch was Judi Dench. I said there is no story without her, because she becomes James Bond’s boss. I wanted to show how these roles had evolved and how they mirrored society – how they went from the 60s and villains like Honor Blackman’s Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, in which there was a huge amount of tongue-in-cheek humour, to the 70s where Maud Adams is badly treated. It would be unthinkable now but there is that scene in The Man With the Golden Gun when Roger Moore smacks her in the face.” As the decades passed, women in the films became more empowered.The only thing D’Abo might change, in hindsight, would be her decision to stay in Los Angeles when she might have built a theatre career in France. She is English but spent some of her childhood in Paris, speaking French as her first language. It is one of the affinities she found with Arikha, a friend of many decades who was born and brought up in Paris.Without our imagination, what are we supposed to write about? How would Tolstoy have written War and Peace?Arikha is better known as a novelist. Her first foray into professional playwriting was inspired by Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf and Ingmar Bergman’s Scenes from a Marriage. “I love writing about dysfunctional families because of the complexities and all that’s unsaid. I love the idea of dissecting a couple but also the imbalance between one, the writer, who is on the brink of fame, and her husband, who is about to sink. So the seesaw of emotions, truth, fame and success – the hodge-podge of it all.”In the play, Fiona has written a book using someone else’s story. Is this theft or a legitimate gathering of material? Her actor-husband, Ivo, has recently been cancelled after charges of violence against a woman. Are these fabricated or real? The play also asks what it takes from family life to be an artist, specifically for mothers.Arikha grew up within a thoroughly artistic milieu, and you get the impression that she has thought deeply about these questions on artistic endeavour. She is the daughter ofRomanian artist Avigdor Arikhaand American poet Anne Atik. Samuel Beckett was her godfather and she would send him poems and plays she had written. She likes the mix of reality and fiction in art, and has interwoven them in her books. “I think life does inevitably come through in fiction, unconsciously sometimes.” When she wrote her memoir,Major/Minor, her sister said: “That never happened.” “I said: ‘It’s my truth’ and she said: ‘No it’s not. It didn’t happen.’ So what is truth?” There are some real-life parallels in the production of Spanish Oranges. Arikha’s 23-year-old daughter, Arianna Branca, is playing the daughter of the fictional couple.View image in fullscreenDysfunctionals are forever … D’Abo and Jay Villiers star in Spanish OrangesPhotograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianBoth D’Abo and Arikha know what it is to be married to fellow artists: the former to the late film-makerHugh Hudson, the latter to the composerTom Smail. Neither speak of experiencing the highly freighted artistic rivalry of the play. Does Arikha draw a line around what to take or leave out from real life based on ethics or privacy? Yes, for her novelTwo Hours, which was a pared down version of a “pretty difficult moment in my life”.As well as dissecting Fiona and Ivo’s marriage, Arikha pulls on several writerly conundrums around appropriation and identity politics. Both women are vehemently against the idea of only writing, or acting, from personal experience. “I remember Hugh had this wonderful project and Ed Harris was going to play this character who is gay,” says D’Abo. “The possible financiers said, ‘You have to get a gay actor.’ It was killing the whole artistic process for an actor and for a writer.”Some people might say that this is a valid criticism based on representation and authenticity. “Of course, there has to be a healthy balance but it’s also about letting the creatives be free in bringing what is right for that particular storytelling and character,” says D’Abo.Arikha agrees. “Without our imagination, what are we supposed to write about? As long as it’s done accurately and with empathy. Think of Tolstoy. How would he have written War and Peace? You have to use your imagination. You have to try and feel what it would be like to be someone else – or somewhere else.”Spanish Oranges is at thePlayground theatre, London, from 11 February until 7 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreJames BondThe Living DaylightsDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Oscar-tipped director Oliver Laxe explains why he had to organise his own music festival in the Moroccan desert to find deeper meaning in dance-floor ecstasyWhitney WeiMon 9 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Feb 2026 02.03 ESTShareIn the opening scene of Oliver Laxe’s existential mystery thriller Sirāt, a crowd of partygoers stack up a sound system for a rave in the southern Moroccan desert, where the paths of the film’s protagonists cross for the first time. Crucially, Laxe explains, the revellers were no ordinary extras. Most of them were committed, lifelong ravers who had travelled to the makeshift festival from across Europe. One of the DJs who played, Sebastian Vaughan AKA 69db, was a core member of Spiral Tribe, the pioneering British “free party” collective of the 1990s.“In film, reality is usually made to adapt to the rules of cinema,” the French-born Spanish director tells me when we meet in Berlin. “But we do the opposite: we adapt cinema to reality.” When negotiating with the ravers how to best represent them in the film, he recalls, “they told us that the music cannot stop for three days. And we were really pleased with this idea”.Sirāt promises to be one of the arthouse crossover hits of the year. After winning the Jury prize at Cannes last May, it will be released in UK cinemas in February and has a good chance of grabbing an Oscar or two in March, where it is shortlisted in five categories, including best international feature film. On the surface, Laxe’s film is a road movie about a modest family unit – patriarch Luis, his son Esteban and their dog Pipa – searching for a missing daughter, Mar. Their search is complicated when radio reports announce the outbreak of an armed conflict with the unnamed neighbouring country and the army arrives to break up the desert festival.View image in fullscreenDirector Oliver Laxe (third from left) on the set of his film Sirāt.Photograph: Altitude Film SalesBut over the almost two hours of the film, the search-mission plot gradually fades into the background. Far from being just an accidental backdrop, rave culture and its deeper metaphysical meaning emerges as Sirāt’s main subject.Many previous films have tried to explore dance music culture, with varying degrees of success: British coming-of-age drama Beats, Mia Hansen-Løve’s French touch tale Eden, or Warsaw-set docu-fiction All These Sleepless Nights. What sets Sirāt apart is that Laxe sees raving, and the ego dissolution associated with it, as a confrontation with mortality. “If you die on a dancefloor, it’s considered a mythological death,” says the director, who observes Sufism and personally studies gestalt psychotherapy.The unusual way Laxe’s film portrays the death of certain characters has been key to its growing cult status. But he insists that his intention is far from cruel. Rather, his depiction alludes to the spiritual practice of shedding worldly attachments or the false self to achieve true liberation. “This is the same in all the core of all the cultures, where the hero transcends the idea of his own death,” the director says, referencing the work of scholar Joseph Campbell. “He knows that his death is not the end of anything, it’s the door to eternity. It’s like a triumphant death.” His film is his own take on the hero’s journey, a universal narrative archetype.The poetry of Rumi was another one of Laxe’s many inspirations. The 13th-century Sufi mystic roused others to dance “when you’re broken open” and “in your blood”, which informed the film’s portrayal of raving and psychedelics use as an ecstatic rite amid life’s suffering. “As a film-maker, I would like to evoke transcendence,” he explains, “even the worst disasters, tragedies, obstacles, the worst thing that can happen to you – it’s a gift, in a way. It has to be like this. It’s painful at some point, but I think there is serenity.”Laxe intentionally cast non-professional actors with disabilities – Tonin Janvier (“Tonin”) has a prosthetic leg, Richard Bellamy (“Bigui”) has a missing hand, others have visible scars – to externalise the emotional imperfections of those searching for solace on the dancefloor.Raves, he says, are unique in that they allow for uninhibited, even extreme forms of expression. “You can scream, you can cry, you can fall on the floor,” he said. “At some point, you see yourself and you see the construction of your ego, you see how fake you are, your personality, that’s not your essence. In this moment, the beat, the kick, the music comes. It’s like it’s pushing you up. It’s like you are celebrating your wounds when you land.”View image in fullscreen‘You can scream, you can cry, you can fall on the floor’ … Sirāt.Photograph: Altitude Film SalesIn the film, none of Laxe’s spiritual musings would have come together without Sirāt’s score. For this, the director tapped one of electronic music’s most respected underground producers, Berlin-based David Letellier, AKA Kangding Ray.A veteran musician with legendary experimentalist label Raster-Noton and regular DJ at techno temples Berghain and Tresor, Letellier says he’s seen contemporary electronic music leave behind its roots in DIY and queer subcultures to be “co-opted by big corporations” and transformed into a lifestyle product through social media. What is now often taken for granted, he says, is “the solidarity, the resistance, the anti-authoritarian, anti-system ethos that was once its base”.Laxe contacted Letellier after coming across his 2014 track Amber Decay, and spent five days with the producer in Berlin listening to everything from Steve Reich to Detroit techno. During the making of Sirāt’s score, Letellier withdrew behind a vast wall of modular synths in his studio and spent days matching sounds to the pain, despair, and anger depicted on-screen.He told me his work for Sirāt was less like a composer assembling notes and more like that of a sculptor. “I take sounds and I carve them and I polish them or cut them or destroy them or explode them,” he said. The end result is a soundtrack that appears to disintegrate over the course of the film, from visceral electronics into dark, skeletal ambient noise.Sirāt review – rave in the desert leads to exasperating quest in the sands of MoroccoRead moreIn the second half of the movie, the father character Luis grapples with a sudden devastation in his life. As a low techno heartbeat drones on in the background, he stares around in a state of surrender and lifts his hands in the air. In a moment of crisis, he finds solace in the act of dancing. “The body has memory of the pain, of your pain, the child’s pain, the trauma of a child,” Laxe says, “but also the pain of your lineage, your family, and the pain of the world.”Sirāt is released in UK cinemas on 27 February, and in Australian cinemas on 26 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmThrillersDrama filmsDance musicMusic festivalsElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instinctively tapping on the usual suspects on your phone’s home screen becomes a reflex, and vast quantities of money and user data have been specifically employed to keep you reaching for the phone, ingraining it into our work, leisure and social lives. You’ll get no shame from me if you love your phone and have a healthy relationship with your apps, but I’ve found myself struggling lately.This year, I’m attempting to cut back on screen time – sort of. I’m replacing the sleek oblong of my smartphone with something a little more fuzzy and nostalgic. In an attempt to dismantle my bad habit, I’m closing the feeds of instant updates and instead carrying around a Game Boy Advance. I’ve been playingPokémonFireRed, a remake of the very first Pokémon games, which turn 30 this month. Even this refreshed version is more than two decades old.Improving your digital wellbeing doesn’t necessarily mean cutting out screen time completely. Not all screens are created equal. I’m hoping that swapping one screen for another isn’t like Indiana Jones switching out the golden idol with a big bag of sand, only for the booby trap boulder to crush me all the same.View image in fullscreenA remake of the very first Pokémon games … Pokémon FireRed.Photograph: Nintendo/MobyGamesI’d not played Pokémon regularly since 2006’s Pokémon Diamond on theNintendoDS, which was my introduction to the franchise. I dabbled in Pokémon Black on the DS and Pokémon Legends: Arceus on the Nintendo Switch, but neither stuck. I’d convinced myself that once you’ve played through one Pokémon game, you’ve pretty much played them all. But as Hollywood has profitably realised, 20 years is a long enough gap for something to feel fresh again.My first steps in Pokémon were taken in the Sinnoh region, so the prospect of visiting the Kanto region from the first games and catching the original 151 Pokémon felt exciting to me. But I couldn’t bring myself to start playing the original Red or Blue on a chunky old Game Boy. I might be trying to embrace a more analogue existence, but gaming without colour is my line in the sand.FireRed’s positive effects on my life arrived unexpectedly quickly. It only took a couple of hours of exploration and encounters with wild Pokémon to make me forget about my phone. It was sat right next to me, but it was no longer calling to me like Gollum’s ring. Usually my device would find its way into my hand during loading breaks and elaborate cutscenes on narrative-heavy and beautiful modern PlayStation games.Perhaps there’s some magic in FireRed’s more freeform approach to story and less overstimulating retro graphics. Maybe those gaps left by implied details in the design and dialogue leave space for my imagination – which my doomscrolling habit had nearly atrophied. The world of Pokémon is serene and charming, despite constant trainer battles and gruelling gym leader face-offs, and even those are quite low stakes. A gaming experience hasn’t offered me such tranquility since I first picked upAnimal Crossing. Try as he might, even Tom Nook can’t patent escapism.Curiously, this adventure, though fresh for me, feels nostalgic. I’ve never played with a team solely made up of monsters from the original Pokédex, yet somehow I’m transported back to the late 90s when it seemed like the world was going Poké-mad. I even named my rival after one of my childhood best friends. All these years later, it’s so satisfying to finally, thoroughly embrace this canon.Pokémon is hardly counterculture: it’s the most profitable video game franchise in history. Pokémon is gearing up for a 30th anniversary year with a McDonald’s Happy Meal promotion, a new theme park, a partnership with theNatural History Museumand a Uniqlo line among much else – so, if anything, it feels more zeitgeisty and omnipresent than it has in years. And yet it does feel rebellious to pick up an old Game Boy instead of my phone. It’s somehow unruly to take myself offline, just for a bit, to just have fun with a retro game. I’m able to enjoy technology on my own terms: I’m not coerced into microtransactions, I’m not relying on the latest oh-so essential firmware update, I’m not endlessly instructed tolike, comment, subscribe for more.View image in fullscreenVideo game developer Shigeru Miyamoto holds up the Nintendo Game Boy Advance during its launch in May 2001.Photograph: John Barr/APFilling the natural breaks in my day with an old video game has done me the world of good, even if it’s evolving my Psyduck while dinner is in the oven or taking down a gym leader while waiting for a package. My phone’s screen time is already down by three hours a week since beginning this adventure. In a small way, it’s helping me to stop comparing myself with others and begin to tackle some existential dread that doomscrolling seems to encourage. Playing Pokémon FireRed in 2026 is utterly nourishing, and wonderfully low stakes compared to a social media ecosystem where everything is trying to appear equally urgent and meaningful.If you’re trying to combat overthinking, insecurity or exhaustion by committing to the herculean task of using your phone less, take a quick trip to the Kanto region – or another resolutely offline game world.Explore more on these topicsGamesPokémonNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

While most of us know what to expect from a city break in, say, Paris, Lyon or Bordeaux, Metz throws up surprises at every turn.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The giant feline sculpture is the work of Italian visual artist Maurizio Cattelan (ofbanana-duct-taped-to-a-wall fame), whose works form part ofDimanche Sans Fin(Endless Sunday), an exhibition he has curated that brings together more than 400 works from Paris’s Centre Pompidou, which closed for a five-year renovation last October. Each piece depicts a different way the “day of rest” could be interpreted, whether it’s the innocent play of Picasso’s sculpture Little Girl Jumping Rope(1950-1954) or Max Ernst’s figure playing chess in the King Playing with the Queen (1944).View image in fullscreenIn a room dedicated to artists’ portraits of their mothers, Cattelan’s Shadow (2023) shows his mum hiding in a fridge (the thought of cooking a Sunday roast might drive many of us to take such action).I’m being shown around by Cattelan’s co-curator, Zoé Stillpass. “It was amazing to have all the pieces from the Paris Pompidou to play with,” she says. “The banana exhibit, which makes you question the idea of ‘the masterpiece’ and why we give value to something, has a room to itself here.”View image in fullscreenThe interior of Philippe Starck’s Maison Heler.Photograph: Julius HirtzbergerBut my jaw had dropped before I’d even set foot in the exhibition, when I set eyes on the Pompidou-Metz itself. It opened in 2010 and is an extraordinary feat of design. Japanese architectShigeru Bantook inspiration from a Chinese bamboo-woven hat to create hexagonal lattice of laminated wood and draped white fibreglass roof. The building fills a wide open space that was once occupied by a Roman amphitheatre.The station is more akin to a church than a transport hub, with a striking stained-glass window depicting King CharlemagneMetz was something of a playground for architecture long before the Pompidou arrived. Before I’d left the station, I’d had an introduction to the city’s Germanic Imperial Quarter. Built between 1905 and 1908 during Kaiser Wilhelm II’s occupation of Alsace-Lorraine, the station is more akin to a church than a transport hub, with a striking stained-glass window depicting Charlemagne, the eighth-century Frankish king, carved pillars, mosaics and a beautiful glass-roofed arcade. Outside is a stately water tower that once serviced the steam engines.Architects designed the Imperial Quarter to feel old, with winding streets, leafy squares and the stately Avenue Foch with its ornate mansions. Elsewhere, in Place Saint-Louis in the real old town, the stone arcades occupied by money-changers in the 14th century are now home to cafes and restaurants, with terraces sprawling into the square.View image in fullscreenMaison Heler, with Manfred’s house atop a nine-storey tower block.Photograph: Pierre Defontaine/Grand Est tourismRenaissance architecture also gets a look in with the Maison des Têtes on En Fournirue, which dates from 1529 and has five detailed busts above its leaded windows. All these attractions are easily reached on the free electricshuttle busthat loops round the city centre.Later, asolar-powered boat tripalong the River Moselle gives a view of the city’s monuments from the water, including a Japanese Torii gate and Protestant church the Temple Neuf, with its steel-grey roof tiles shimmering in the sun.The sight of Metz’s new design hotel soaring into the sky makes me feel like I’ve shrunkThe city’s most imposing monument is theCathédral Saint-Étienne. Built in yellow Jaumont limestone, it dates from the 13th century, but some of its most striking features are much more modern. Among its 6,500 sq metres of stained-glass windows – one of the world’s largest expanses – are works from the 1960s by Marc Chagall. Vivienne Rudd from the city’s tourist office is showing me around. She explains how Chagall tells the story of Adam and Eve in his intricate design, with its abstract lines and ethereal figures: “You can see how Eve is in front of the tree of knowledge, holding a snake, and you can see Adam’s face hiding in the blue panes.” In the windows in the north transept, she shows me where to spot Jesus’s head and his crown of thorns. It takes some concentrating, but then I spy it.“If you can’t see it, you have to go and drink a shot of mirabelle eau-de-vie [the local plum-based spirit] and then come back and look,” she laughs.Even without drinking Alice’s elixir, the sight of Metz’s new design hotel soaring into the sky makes me feel like I’ve shrunk. Celebrated Parisian designer Philippe Starck’sMaison Helertook 10 years to complete but finally opened last March, just a few minutes’ walk from the Pompidou-Metz. Its design is extraordinary: a turreted mansion house atop a rather nondescript nine-floor tower block.View image in fullscreenFelix, a six-metre sculpture by Maurizio Cattelan at the Centre Pompidou-Metz.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Verhaegen/AFP/Getty ImagesIts backstory is equally fantastical. Starck devised a novella, titled The Meticulous Life of Manfred Heler, in which the house, belonging to the eponymous main character, a lonely postwar inventor, is dramatically pushed upwards during an earthquake – hence the house on top of the tower block. The story also involves his love interest, a milkmaid named Rose, whose part in the story inspired the gentle pink decor of the bistro restaurant on the ground floor.Bedrooms and corridors have an industrial vibe, with neutral tones and concrete walls, and Manfred’s bizarre scientific experiments are depicted in black-and-white photos. Light and colour come from the stained-glass windows – the work of the designer’s daughter, Ara Starck – which cast a beautiful glow across the wood-panelled restaurant and cocktail bar, set in Manfred’s house at the top.As carefully designed as it is, it’s also affordable, and the food in both restaurants (mains from €23) is excellent. I tuck into white asparagus with hollandaise and cod with a light pea broth and saffron beurre blanc. When I try to read the novella, though, to get a better understanding, it proves utterly baffling – in keeping, perhaps, with this wonderfully curious city.The trip was provided by Tourism Metz and theMaison Heler(doubles from€106 room-only).Dimanche Sans Finruns until25 Jan 2027at Centre Pompidou-MetzExplore more on these topicsFrance holidaysCity breaksCultural tripsEurope holidaysShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I use whatever veg is in season: purple sprouting broccoli is at its best right now, but you could add stalks of rainbow chard, shredded cavolo nero, even halved baby carrots. Play around with whatever veg you have and love.Creamy chicken, purple sprouting broccoli and mustard fricasséeIf you can’t find mustard powder, feel free to use your mustard of choice – wholegrain would work well here.Prep5 minCook30 minServes44 skin-on chicken breasts(about 160g each)Sea salt andblack pepper2 tsp English mustard powder1 tbsp olive oil200g purple sprouting broccoli30g unsalted butter4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced1 tsp dried oregano1 tsp aleppo pepper2½tbspplain flour125ml dry white wine500ml chicken stock200ml single creamPut the chicken breasts on a deep plate and season generously. Add the mustard powder and olive oil, then massage them all over the chicken.Put a wide casserole dish or large, deep frying pan on a medium-high heat and sear the chicken skin side down until it is deeply coloured. Fry on the underside for a few minutes, too. This should take five to eight minutes in total.Meanwhile, trim off and discard the woody ends from the purple sprouting broccoli and halve or quarter any large, bushy stalks. When the chicken is browned all over, return it to the plate skin side up; it doesn’t need to be cooked through at this stage, just coloured.Add the butter to the pan and turn down the heat to medium-low. Add the sliced garlic, dried oregano and most of the aleppo pepper, fry for a minute, then stir in the plain flour. Keep stirring until you have a biscuity-smelling paste, then stir in the white wine until the sauce is smooth and bubbling.Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, then return the seared chicken skin side up to the pan. Cover and cook for eight minutes, then stir in the cream, nestle in the broccoli, cover and cook for a further six to eight minutes, or until the broccoli is tender and the chicken is cooked through. Scatter over the remaining aleppo pepper and a good grinding of black pepper, and serve with mashed potato or rice.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyChickenMeatMain courseVegetablesStewrecipesShareReuse this content"

It’s quiet, intentional and deeply comforting. The stillness just before sunset gives way to movement – the table being laid, the clinking of glasses, the pause as everyone waits for the call to prayer. Then, with a date in hand and water on the tongue, the fast is broken. That moment never loses its meaning, no matter how many times you experience it. Iftar doesn’t begin with a feast, but with small, simple things, such as these two soups.Shurbad(lamb, oat and barley soup – pictured top)Shurbadexists across many cultures, especially in east Africa, the Middle East and north Africa. The word comes from the Arabicshariba, meaning “to drink”, and it refers to something light and warming. This is often served at the start of a meal and, while the ingredients and methods vary across the different regions, the feeling is the same. This is a dish that many, myself included, make only during Ramadan, because it feels tied to the rhythm of the month. This version is gently spiced and comforting; if you prefer, use chicken instead of the lamb. The soup freezes well, too, so you can make it weeks in advance.Prep10 minCook2 hr 45 minServes8-10500glamb shoulder on the bone, diced2 vegetable stock pots400gtin finely chopped tomatoes180gpearl barley4 tbsp rolled oats½ tsp ground cumin½ tsp ground coriander½ tsp curry powder5 tbsp olive oil, or sunflower oil½ large brown onion, peeled and chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled1 small bunch fresh corianderLemon juice or apple cider vinegar, to serve (optional)In a large deep pot, combine the lamb and stock pots with 2½ litres of cold water. Put the pot on a medium-high heat, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for about an hour and a half, until the meat is tender.Lift out the meat with a slotted spoon, then shred it into small pieces; discard the bones. Return the shredded meat to the pot and stir in the chopped tomatoes and barley. Cook uncovered for another 45 minutes on a medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, then stir in the oats, cumin, ground coriander and curry powder. Cook for 20 minutes, then take off the heat.In a separate saucepan, heat the oil on a medium heat. Add the onion and fry, stirring, until browned. Put the garlic cloves and fresh coriander in a mortar, then grind to a paste. Stir this into the fried onion and cook for another minute. Carefully pour the hot onion and oil mixture into the soup, then stir to combine and simmer for a further 10 minutes.This is best served hot with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice or a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar on each portion. The soup can be kept in the freezer for up to three months. To serve, just defrost, warm through and finish with a quick herb oil. Don’t forget the vinegar or a squeeze of lemon to bring it all together.Addas(red lentil soup)View image in fullscreenIlhan Mohamed Abdi’saddas, aka red lentil soup.This lentil soup, known simply asaddas, is made from the most basic pantry ingredients, but somehow always tastes like more than the sum of its parts. I’ve been eating it since I was little, and it was one of the first meals I weaned my daughter with once we introduced spices. It was only recently that a good friend from Algeria introduced me to the addition of ras el hanout, the north African spice blend. The soup thickens beautifully by the next day, almost like a soft dal, so I’ll often serve that over rice; otherwise, I’ll gently loosen it on the stovetop with a splash of water and enjoy it as soup again.Prep10 minCook55 minServes4-62-3 tbsp olive oil1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped4-5 garlic cloves,peeled and crushed1 large carrot,peeled and finely chopped300gred split lentils, rinsed1 heaped tbsp vegetable bouillon powder1⅓ tbsp ground cumin⅓ tbsp ras el hanout1 tsp salt400mlcoconut milk1 large handfulchopped coriander, plus extra to garnishLemon slices, to serveHeat the olive oil in a large saucepan, then add the onion and saute for three to four minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic, leave it to soften slightly, then add the carrot. Stir everything together and saute for a minute or two.Add the rinsed lentils and stir well – the mixture might clump, but keep stirring. Add the bouillon powder, cumin, ras el hanout and salt, and cook over a low heat, stirring occasionally, for 30 seconds. Add the coconut milk, 1.3 litres of cold water and the fresh coriander, and adjust the salt to taste. Cover the pan, bring to a simmer and cook on a medium-low heat for 20 minutes.Half-blend the mixture with a stick blender to give it a creamy texture while keeping some chunks intact. If need be, add more water, and remember to check the salt. Simmer for another 15 minutes, then serve hot garnished with extra coriander and the lemon slices.These recipes are edited extracts from The Ramadan Kitchen: Nourishing Recipes from East toFeast, by Ilhan Mohamed Abdi, published by Pavilion Books at £26.
