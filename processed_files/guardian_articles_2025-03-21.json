Police confirmed on Friday evening that the fire was not thought to be suspicious.Travel chaos as Heathrow airport closes after blaze at electrical substationRead moreHeathrow partially reopened on Friday evening and was expected to be fully operational on Saturday, but airlines said the closure would continue to have a “huge impact” on passengers in the coming days.The airport said passengers should come to Heathrow on Saturday as they normally would.Ministers acknowledged the “immense distress and disruption” caused to passengers, vowing “we will learn the lessons”.Asked about an inquiry and whetherNational Gridhad questions to answer, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “There are questions to answer on how this has happened and what can be done to prevent the scale of disruption we’ve seen from happening again, once the situation is under control.”Passengers were warned to stay away from Heathrow all day on Friday after theLondonfire brigade (LFB) was called to tackle the blaze that started shortly after 11pm on Thursday at a substation in Hayes, north of the airport.More than 70 firefighters worked in “challenging and hazardous” conditions to bring the fire under control, the LFB said, but it was still burning at 8am on Friday, with 25,000 litres of oil having caught fire at the substation. Officers said that despite the acrid smell, there was no air quality danger to the public.Power to 67,000 homes was cut off for several hours and more than 100 people were evacuated. Power supplies have now been restored to all customers, including Heathrow, allowing operations to resume at the airport.More than 1,350 flights carrying at least 200,000 passengers had been scheduled to arrive and depart from the airport on Friday, connecting to around 230 destinations, including those in the US for which the airport acts as the main gateway from Europe.About 120 long-haul flights to Heathrow were in the air when the closure was announced overnight, with arrivals diverted to other airports around Britain and Europe.View image in fullscreenPassengers receive information about their flight to Heathrow from Fiumicino airport, near Rome.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersLondon residents will be disturbed by more aircraft noise at night than normally permitted in the coming days after the Department forTransportlifted restrictions on night flights to ease the backlog.Heathrow has experienced significant disruption from external events, such as the air traffic control outage in August 2023 and the mass groundings during the Covid crisis, but the last time the airport was fully closed for an extended period was during heavy snowfall and freezing conditions in December 2010, when 4,000 flights were cancelled.Senior security and aviation figures expressed consternation that the world’s best connected airport could be closed for so long because of a power cut.The International Air Transport Association (Iata) said it was “yet another case of Heathrow letting down both travellers and airlines”. Willie Walsh, Iata’s director general, added: “How is it that critical infrastructure is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case then it is a clear planning failure by the airport.”David Omand, the former head of the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ), told the BBC’s World at One: “Given the importance of Heathrow I am surprised that the whole airport had to be shut for a day.“I mean, you could understand disruption whilst you change over to alternate systems and so on, but such a complete failure over the period of a day – and who knows the disruption may last longer – is a national embarrassment. It shouldn’t have happened.”However, the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, defended the airport on Friday night, saying the “unprecedented situation” had been “totally outside of Heathrow’s control”.“They have stood up their resilience plan swiftly, and they’ve collaborated closely with our emergency responders and the airline operators,” she said. “They do have backup energy supplies, they have generators, diesel generators.“None of that failed on this occasion because that backup supply is designed to protect the critical key systems within the airport and not to provide power to the whole airport.“I would still advise anyone who has got a flight tomorrow [Saturday] to check in with their airline before travelling to the airport. But given the scale and magnitude of this incident, the response has been swift, although I do appreciate there will have been immense distress and disruption to a very large number of people.”View image in fullscreenThe blaze at the North Hyde electrical substation near Heathrow airport early on Friday.Photograph: Matthew Muirhead/APHeathrow’s chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, apologised to “the many people who have had their travel affected”. But added: “I’d like to stress that this has been an incident of major severity. It’s not a small fire.”The Metropolitan police said it was working with the LFB to establish the cause of the fire, which remains under investigation. A spokesperson said: “While there is currently no indication of foul play we retain an open mind at this time.”Detectives were preparing to take away parts of the substation and its equipment to examine them for signs of interference. It is understood initial checks of CCTV covering the perimeter of the substation showed nothing suspicious.Counter-terrorism detectives were expected to stay on the case until an alternative explanation emerged for the fire.Alice Delahunty, the president of National Grid’s transmission business, said it had been “a very significant and serious incident, which is extraordinarily rare in our network” and that it was not possible to verify any “rumours and speculation” over the cause of the fire.She added: “We’re not in a position to rule anything in or out. Our focus has been getting homes and businesses back on supply safely. There will be a time for a full and thorough investigation, but the focus has been on restoring power.”A Heathrow spokesperson said it would initially work with airlines on repatriating the passengers who were diverted to other airports in Europe.“Our priority remains the safety of our passengers and those working at the airport. As the busiest airport in Europe, Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, therefore getting back to a full and safe operation takes time. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this incident.”British Airways, which operates around half of all Heathrow flights, resumed long-haul services on Friday evening after power was restored. Flights also began arriving at the airport.The chief executive, Sean Doyle, said BA had “been forced to effectively ground our flying operation”, cancelling every short-haul and the majority of long-haul flights scheduled for Friday.“Unfortunately, it will have a huge impact on all of our customers flying with us over the coming days,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportHeathrowAir transportTransportLondonBritish AirwaysNational GridnewsShareReuse this content"

As Britain’s biggest airport, Europe’s main gateway to the Americas, and the apple of Rachel Reeves’s eye for growth, Heathrow’s shutdown gave a supersized significance to a substation fire.Some were quickly out of the blocks to question the creaking state of national infrastructure. Where were the back-up systems – or indeed the further failsafes when the back-ups went up in smoke?Should Heathrow be better prepared, given the critical importance of the hub airport – not least to the 250,000 or so international travellers who were expecting to fly in or out on Friday?Did National Grid, struggling to keep up with the burgeoning demand in developing west London for electricity capacity, have questions to answer about a transformer bursting into flames?Or was it, as the supplier refused to rule out – despite assertions from the Met police that there was “no indication” – foul play? Plenty of online speculation quickly asserted that the culprit was surely one Vladimir Putin, and Moscow may be as happy to be believed culpable as National Grid would be pleased to identify an external culprit.Whilecounter-terrorism detectives are investigatingif anyone was directly responsible, others are calling for an inquiry into just what contingency plans Heathrow had available and what it could do about it. It is not a good look for an airport demanding a third runway to abruptly have no planes on its existing two.Tell us: have you been affected by London’s Heathrow airport closure?Read moreThe shutdown has thrown airlines around the world into disarray and will be leaving many people facing difficult, disrupted, expensive days. Potentially, for some it could be even longer – Heathrow serves 230 international destinations, but not all daily. It is also a hub where long-haul and short-haul passengers connect, with time-sensitive cargo in many planes’ holds.Analysts have already calculated that travel insurers face a bill in the tens of millions; while airlines, which will not be liable for compensation claims but still will have to accommodate or reroute passengers, will probably count higher losses.The latest incident could have been much worse: a saboteur aiming for maximum disruption might have timed it for the morning peak, with Heathrow’s four terminals crammed with passengers and its taxiways and gates primed with planes, rather than cutting the power off after the nightly closure.Heathrow was able to turn back or divert 120 long-haul flights from Asia, Australia and the west coast of America long before arrival, rather than allowing a swarm of planes to circle over London in the morning.Nonetheless, Sir David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, said that having a day-long closure was “a national embarrassment. It shouldn’t have happened.”Willie Walsh, who was long a critic of the airport when he was the boss of British Airways and its owner IAG, and who is now head of the global airlines body, the International AirTransportAssociation, denounced “another case of Heathrow letting down travellers … a clear planning failure by the airport”.Aviation has history with unexpected eventualities; some may recall even angrier BA passengers stranded in their thousands at Heathrow in 2017, when someone pulled out the wrong computer’s plug at the airline’s HQ.But questions over the resilience of infrastructure are valid – now spanning not just maintenance of ageing assets, or security from potential attack, but also increasingly unpredictable extremes of weather as the climate crisis worsens.Across transport, from railways to runways, there are raging debates about how much to invest in something deemed highly resilient, if you own it, or “gold-plated”, if you’re paying to access it.Energy experts say UK power networks have a certain amount of redundancy, or spare capacity – but a guaranteed backup for something the size of Heathrow, a small city’s worth of power, also comes at a price that may outstrip any stoppage costs.As it was, Heathrow’s power was reconnected by early Friday afternoon, although the time needed to ensure the workaround was reliable, durable and safe for thousands of passenger planes kept most flights grounded.When it fully reopens, disruption will persist, and countless planes, crew and passengers of all nationalities will not be where they hoped to be for some time, and at some cost. Industry and parliamentary inquiries into winter resilience followed Heathrow’slast closure, from snow in 2010.But perhaps the fact that a fire described as “apocalyptic” in the night was virtually extinguished by daylight by London’s firefighters; that power was restored before breakfast to most of the 67,000 homes also reliant on the North Hyde substation; and that all that occurred without casualty in the ground or air, also shows a certain resilience worth noting.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportAir transportTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

But Friday was different.“It’s been peace and tranquillity,” said 72-year-old Andrew Melville, who has lived in the village, which straddles the border of London andBerkshire, for 49 years. “Especially not being woken up by transatlantic flights in the early morning.”The travel hub, which is one of the busiest in the world,came to a standstill on Friday morningafter a fire at an electrical substation in Hayes, west London. More than 1,300 flights have been grounded andcounter-terrorism police have launched an investigationinto the cause of the blaze.View image in fullscreenScene of the fire at the substation in Hayes, west London, which caused an outage at Heathrow.Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/ShutterstockThe airport’s closure has caused travel misery for many but those living nearby have been given rare respite from the roaring planes that shatter the illusion of village life.Heathrow closure: what are your rights if your flight has been cancelled?Read more“Usually we get an early morning call and a late-night goodnight,” said Melville, describing the unsociable times that massive, long-haul jets land and take off. “Days like today are blissful because we can go about our normal lives.”The last time people in the village saw the skies this clear was during the Covid lockdowns. “They were awful but this village was great back then. People running around, cycling on bikes and listening to the birds. You could even hear yourself think,” said Melville.David Page, 71, who lives in the nearby village of Longford, has also noticed a change. “It has gotten rid of all the hire cars that park at the top of the village,” he said. While he is enjoying the peace and quiet, Page said people who choose to live in the village should expect some noise. “You don’t move to Longford for peace. You move here because you’re working just over there,” he said, pointing towards the airport.View image in fullscreenDavid Page in Longford was enjoying the quiet on Friday.Photograph: George Cracknell Wright/The GuardianPage, who does contract work for Heathrow, is used to the whirring planes. “You get to the stage where you tune a lot of noise out. It’s not that bad,” he said. “It’s not as busy as people make out. There are quiet patches.”Large chunks of both Harmondsworth and Longford could be demolished to make way forthe airport’s expansion, including the construction of a contentious third runway. “Living here is a strange thing,” said Page. “It probably won’t be here in the future, everything’s gonna go.”As Heathrow fell silent, travellers who booked hotels in the area found themselves stranded in the outskirts of westLondon. Some trekked down long, barren side roads, stumbling into the nearby villages.Tourists wheeling suitcases could be seen walking up and down a strip across from the airport lined with hotels and fast food drive-throughs. Hotel lobbies heaved with disappointed travellers figuring out their next steps.“I should be flying to Canada right now,” said David Lloyd, 72. He was due to travel to Halifax in Nova Scotia to celebrate his brother’s 80th birthday. “He didn’t know we were going. We were going out to surprise him.”View image in fullscreenDavid and Linda Lloyd outside their hotel after their travel plans were disrupted.Photograph: George Cracknell Wright/The GuardianLloyd will not be seeing his brother as planned. “We’ve had to cancel the holiday,” he said. “It’s pointless – by the time we’d get there, the party would be over and done with.”“We’re devastated,” said his wife, Linda Lloyd, 73. The Shropshire couple said they could lose out on about £5,000 when all is said and done.Katy Moss also had plans to see loved ones. “I should be on a flight to Nassau in the Bahamas to see my family,” said the 42-year-old CEO of a concrete company. “It sounds glamorous but my daughter’s there and I haven’t seen her for four weeks. It’s a bit emotional. I rang my husband and woke him up in the middle of the night. I haven’t heard from my daughter yet but she’s going to be devastated.”View image in fullscreenKaty Moss had planned to fly to the Bahamas to visit family.Photograph: George Cracknell Wright/The GuardianFive minutes after arriving in her hotel room on Thursday night, the lights in her room went out. “I thought I was being silly and didn’t put my keycard in the reader properly,” said Moss. “Then I realised there was no power and looked out the window. There was a huge fire.”Like the Lloyds, Moss may have to cancel her trip. “They’ve just messaged me to say they can put me on a flight on Sunday but I’m flying out of the Bahamas on Monday. It would only be 12 hours with my family. I’m thinking what’s the point.”Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportAir transportTransportLondonBerkshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Drones, planes, artillery, tanks … all the time. It’s as bad as it’s ever been,” said one aid worker now based in Gaza City.After retaking part of the strategic Netzarim corridor that divides Gaza’s north from south, Israeli troops have advanced towards the northern town of Beit Lahiya and into the southern border city of Rafah.Israeli strikes on Gaza add to soaring child death tollRead moreIsraeli officials have escalated their threats in recent days, calling on Palestinians in Gaza to overthrowHamasor face the consequences.“I ordered [the army] to seize more territory in Gaza,” Katz said in a statement. “The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel.”Katz also threatened “to expand buffer zones around Gaza to protect Israeli civilian population areas and soldiers by implementing a permanent Israeli occupation of the area”, should Hamas not comply.The permanent establishment of wide buffer zones in Gaza, particularly along its northern perimeter, has long been thought by observers to be an objective of many in the Israeli security establishment and government.The Trump administration reiterated this week its support for Israel, with the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, saying: “Thepresident made it very clear to Hamasthat if they did not release all of the hostages there would be all hell to pay.”Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Thursday that 504 people had been killed since the bombardment resumed, one of the highest tolls since the war began more than 17 months ago with Hamas’s attack on Israel. More than 100 have been killed since then and many more injured, Palestinian medical officials said.Amjad Shawaa, the head of the Palestinian NGO Network in Gaza, said: “This time it is very, very bad. It is very intensive and very scary. We don’t know when we could be hit. We worry always about our loved ones. Everything is very uncertain and then there are these threats that Israel will expand its operations. This is a suffocation, a psychological condition that is very hard.”View image in fullscreenTroops on the border in southern Israel looking across to the Gaza Strip.Photograph: Amir Levy/Getty ImagesThe IDF said the new strikes were against “terrorist” targets, including a “Hamas military site in northern Gaza where preparations were being made to fire projectiles” and “several vessels in the coastal area of the Gaza Strip … intended for use in terrorist operations by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad [armed group]”.It gave new evacuation orders for northern coastal areas, displacing thousands more people. The UN estimates that 124,000 people have been displaced in Gaza since Tuesday, about one in 20 of the population.Preliminary investigations have found that an explosion that killed a UN staffer in Gaza and seriously injured four others earlier this week was caused by a tank shell, aid officials told the Guardian. The IDF has denied all responsibility for the explosion at a UN guesthouse in the central town of Deir al-Balah.A three-phase ceasefire was agreed in January but Israel refused to begin talks on the implementation of a second phase, which was supposed to lead to a return of all hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a permanent end to hostilities.Instead, Israel proposed a new plan, reportedly put forward by the US envoy Steve Witkoff, involving a 30- to 60-day truce and the release of all remaining hostages. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners – a key component of the first phase.Netanyahu disputes court order freezing decision to fire Shin Bet chiefRead moreHamassaid on Friday it was still debating Witkoff’s proposal and other proposals made by intermediaries, including Egypt. On Thursday, the group fired rockets at Tel Aviv, the coastal Israeli city and commercial hub, in its first military response to Israel’s offensive. One was intercepted by air defence systems, while two hit an uninhabited area, Israel’s military said.The new violence in Gaza comes against a backdrop of internal turmoil in Israel, where thousands of protesters have rallied in recent days, accusing the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, of seeking to undermine Israel’s democratic system and resuming military operations without regard for the safety of the hostages in order to bolster his political position.On Friday,Israel’s supreme court ordered a temporary haltto the government’s dismissal of Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security service, until an appeal could be heard before 8 April. Netanyahu previously cited “mistrust” to justify his sacking of Bar but Israel’s attorney general has ruled that a dismissal by the cabinet has no legal basis.A recent Shin Bet report on the 7 October Hamas attack acknowledged the service’s failures but also accused Netanyahu’s government of pursuing policies that established some of the conditions for the attack.Before the IDF’s offensive, Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, one of the largest providers of food aid in the strip, said on Friday it had only enough flour to distribute for the next six days.About 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, died in the surprise attack by Hamas in October 2023. The ensuing Israeli offensive into Gaza has killed more than 49,000 people, mostly civilians.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuHamasPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The new head coach had talked about the need for cut and thrust, for excitement. He was eager to ignite something at the beginning of the road to the 2026 World Cup. Instead, it was one for the more prosaic values – professionalism and control; hard work, especially without the ball.There was the basic ingredient of a victory on what was a showpiece occasion for Tuchel, however flat it might have felt for long spells. Together with one glorious individual story and a much more familiar one.England 2-0 Albania: World Cup 2026 qualifier – live reactionRead moreMyles Lewis-Skelly was excellent on his first England cap, showing the swashbuckling runs from left-back that have lit up his breakthrough season at Arsenal and scoring after just 20 minutes. You could barely have scripted it. Except this is Lewis-Skelly, the 18-year-oldwho writes them himself.Then there was Harry Kane. The captain had suggested beforehand that his scoring exploits have started to be taken for granted. Perhaps people were getting bored of him. Surely no one can tire of him finding the net for England. Kane brought up goal No 70 in his 104th appearance towards the end of a pretty forgettable second half and that was that.It was onlyAlbania, the team ranked 65th in the world, who showed why with their defending for both the goals. But Tuchel has made his first step and it was assured enough, the positives taking in a commanding performance in central defence from Ezri Konsa and some good bits by Jude Bellingham.All eyes were on Tuchel from the moment he emerged into the Wembley spotlight and the scrutiny burned on his selection. There were many headlines. Dan Burn and Lewis-Skelly in for their debuts; Marc Guéhi left on the substitutes’ bench. The use of Curtis Jones alongside Declan Rice in midfield, allowing Bellingham to push high as a No 10.The blockbuster was Marcus Rashford on the left, back for the first time in a year.“Welcome to the Home of Football, Thomas,” read the giant banner behind one of the goals before kick-off. There was a fireworks display. The house DJ even had a track with “Thomas Tuchel’s army” in the lyrics. He could see a snap about his players when they hassled Albania to regain possession. They set the tempo without the ball at the outset. This was good. It was a little more measured in possession; the focus on wearing Albania down.It had the feel of one of those games when the low block would be difficult to dismantle, Albania sitting deep in their 4-5-1 system. Enter Lewis-Skelly. He had taken one confident touch in the opening exchanges, stepping up and away from his man. The kid has no nerves, merely the desire to seize any opportunity and his goal was the latest chapter of the fairytale. He looked a little disbelieving as he celebrated – and not only because of the ease with which he was able to run in behind Jasir Asani. The Albania winger had to be stronger.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane celebrates after scoring England’s second goal against Albania at Wembley.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was a pass from Bellingham after some imperious strutting from him and Lewis-Skelly finished first-time with his left foot, guiding the ball through the legs of the goalkeeper, Thomas Strakosha. If you could bottle the feeling.Albania struggled to get out of their half before the interval, although when they did for the first time in the 27th minute, they had the scent of a freakish equaliser.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rashford played a nice return pass to Bellingham, who was denied at close quarters by Strakosha. Bellingham also watched aghast as Strakosha saved superbly with his foot to keep out a header from him while Kane’s rebound effort was blocked just as miraculously by Berat Djimsiti. Burn trampled into space to meet a Rice corner which he thudded into the crossbar.It was Burn’s second Wembley appearance in a week after his goalscoring, man-of-the-match performance inNewcastle’s Carabao Cup final winagainst Liverpool. The magic evaporated for him in the second half. He got away with a high boot that felled Myrto Uzuni but he almost did not get away with his lack of pace, the Albania substitute Armando Broja coming close to exposing it. There was also the moment when Broja beat Burn to a flick-on and Tuchel could be grateful for a saving Konsa challenge on Asani.Lewis-Skelly continued to step up with the ball, to get England moving, to ask questions while Rashford was desperate to make something happen. Perhaps too desperate. Ditto Phil Foden, who could get little going on the right.Bellingham crossed for Kane, who could not get the needed power in the header and Jones might have shot rather than look for another pass after a neat move.The second half became a slog for England but Kane lifted things when Rice crossed and Arlind Ajeti got himself into a muddle, trying to intercept and failing. Kane brought the ball down and caressed the shot into the far corner.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersEnglandAlbaniamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Two have been convicted – Norris and Gary Dobson – one is dead, and three are yet to be prosecuted for the racist murder.A senior police source said: “This could be a significant breakthrough. It is definitely of interest. There’s always the potential for individuals to change loyalty. We’re desperate not to miss this opportunity.”TheMetropolitan policewant to check the alleged admissions of involvement made by Norris. The source added: “We want to know more and are keen to do it sooner rather than later. We’d want to ask him who he went out with that night. After his arrest he ‘no commented’ [in the police interview].”The force’s investigation seeking to bring at least three remaining suspects to justice is no longer active. After checking whether the reportsof the admissions by Norris are correct, the Met is considering re-interviewing the convicted murderer in prison.During his Old Bailey murder trial, Norris, 48, denied all involvement and being at the scene of the attack. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years and three months for murder.Stephen, 18, was killed in south-eastLondonafter being set upon by a white gang as he waited for a bus home. They shouted racist abuse and then attacked the teenager, who suffered two stab wounds. Duwayne Brooks, the surviving victim of the attack, managed to escape.Forensic evidence tied Norris and Dobson to the scene of the attack, with the jury accepting the prosecution view that being present when Stephen was set upon meant all those there were guilty of murder by joint enterprise.Neville Lawrence said: “The fact there were so many people surrounding my son means everybody was guilty, no matter who wielded the knife.”Lawrence added of Norris: “I don’t know what he’s up to. He had so many chances, before the trial and after, he denied being involved. He’s trying to impress the Parole Board to let him out of prison.”The Met bungled the investigation into Stephen’s murder after suspects were named to them by the local community within hours.A long battle for justice by Stephen’s parents, Doreen and Neville Lawrence, resulted in the Met being shamed after a public inquiry, where it was found to be incompetent and institutionally racist.Norris’s father, Clifford, was at the centre of suspicions from the Lawrences and Brooks that corruption had blighted the investigation. In 2018, relatives of Clifford Norris told the Guardian he was well known for corrupt contacts with the police.Victoria and Naomi Smith, who are related to the Norris family by marriage,said Clifford Norris used a network of corrupt Metropolitan police officersto protect himself and his close relations from justice.At the trial that convicted David Norris, the prosecutor Mark Ellison KC said: “The way in which the attack was executed indicates that this group were a group of like-minded young white men who acted together and reacted together. They shared the same racial animosity and motivation.”In the Parole Board document where Norris’s admissions are reported, he is described as denying being a racist or wielding the knife.The document is written by Peter Rook KC, who said: “After the trial, Mr Norris continued to deny the offence. Recent reports now suggest he has accepted he was present at the scene and punched the victim but claims that he did not wield the knife. He does not accept he holds racist views.”Covert video recorded in 1994 and shown at the murder trial showed Norristalking about “skinning” black people and setting them alight, using racist terms and fantasising about violent acts against Asian and black people.Dobson was recorded also uttering racist remarks and the court heard that he had carried a knife and threatened to use it against a black man.Explore more on these topicsStephen LawrenceMetropolitan policePoliceRaceUK criminal justiceLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

He was recalled to Moscow in 1985 and placed under surveillance, despite being offered the opportunity by London to defect.Realising his peril in Moscow, he triggered a long-planned extraction byMI6, evading his KGB watchers during a jog to flee to the Finnish border where he was smuggled to safety.Explaining his motivation, Gordievsky said: “I hated the communist system, I wanted to fight against it,” in an archive recording, which featured in a BBC documentary Secrets and Spies: A Nuclear Game.“Gordievsky was once described to me by an MI6 guy as the only truly ideological Soviet spy he could think of,” wrote journalist Mark Urban on X after the news of his death.“He despised the USSR and sought to undermine it by passing secret intelligence to the west.”After his defection to the UK, Gordievsky lived near Godalming in Surrey, where his identity was protected.However as Richard Norton-Taylornotes in his Guardian obituaryhe was lonely without his family “and suffered the withdrawal symptoms that spies so often experience once the excitement of their secret life and defection has died down”.Later, at the encouragement of MI6, he wrote several books including the one that would prompt the libel action from Foot.In 2007, Gordievsky was honoured by Queen Elizabeth II with the Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George.His first marriage, to Yelena Akopian, a KGB officer, ended in divorce. In 1979 he married Leila Aliyeva, whom he met in Copenhagen, where she worked for the World Health Organization. They had two daughters, Maria and Anna, who are believed to still live in the UK.Explore more on these topicsMI6RussiaCommunismMI5newsShareReuse this content"

Shortly afterwards he showed me a photo and sent it to me by email,” said Fairbanks, who was appearing as a witness in Guardian News and Media’s defence to Clarke’s libel claim against the publisher.“The photo showed her standing up, with full frontal nudity, looking at the camera. He asked me to save the photo and to put it into a new email to send back to him straight away, and to then delete the original email. This was so he could keep the photo but it would look as though I had sent it.”Clarke, 49, who is suing the Guardian over publications from 2021-22 accusing him of sexual misconduct, has denied taking nude images without the consent of Ivy, with whom he had a two-month relationship, adding that “any photographs taken in an intimate setting were taken with consent and kept privately”.Also appearing as a witness in GNM’s defence, Ivy said he had encouraged her to send him nude photographs but that she had “expressly told him that he should not show them to anyone – I recall including messages to say that he should keep them private when I sent them. I believed that he would respect that.”Ivy told the court she had later been “horrified” to hear in around 2016 or 2017 that Clarke had shown these “selfies” to a mutual friend as proof that he had slept with her.Clarke’s barrister, Philip Williams, said there was no evidence that any photographs had been shared or shown by the actor. But on the eve of Fairbanks giving evidence at the high court, the court heard he had found a cache of 15 pictures on his hard drive.Ivy was asked by Gavin Millar KC, acting for the Guardian, whether she had ever seen these photographs before being provided with them the previous night by solicitors acting for the newspaper. She told the court she had not. She added that they were also not the pictures she had taken on her phone for Clarke.Asked by Clarke’s barrister why she had stayed in contact with Clarke, sending messages with “kisses and lovehearts”, after hearing that he had shown a friend a naked photograph of her, Ivy said she was concerned that he had “leverage” over her.She said: “Just because I didn’t vocally fall out with him, it doesn’t mean I didn’t lose respect for him a long time ago.“I trusted him in a relationship, I trusted him with my personal life, and he disrespected that trust by showing pictures of me to other people without my consent.”Clarke is expected to return to the witness box to explain the presence of the photographs in Fairbanks’ possession.Addressing the judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, Clarke’s barrister questioned why the photographs had emerged on the eve of Fairbanks’ evidence, describing it as an “ambush” and accusing the witness of seeking to pervert the course of justice.Fairbanks claimed in his witness statement that Clarke had secretly filmed female actors who had been asked to strip while auditioning for a film called Legacy.“He did it in a way that the actors wouldn’t have noticed,” Fairbanks claimed. “There was plenty of time in between auditions to do this … While in the room, I told Noel he shouldn’t do what he was doing. He batted away my comment and just told me to shut up.”Clarke’s barrister accused Fairbanks of lying. The court has previously heard from a female actor who Fairbanks claimed had been groped by Clarke that the incident did not happen.Earlier in the proceedings on Friday, evidence was heard from Leanne Coldwell, also a witness for GNM. She claimed Clarke had told students that he wanted to challenge them during an acting course for novices and amateurs at the London School of Dramatic Art (LSDA) and that he had “suggested undressing or being naked” during a scene.“Sometime after the August 2012 session, maybe a week or a few weeks later, one of the LSDA tutors, Richard, told the class that Noel’s request in that class was wrong and would not happen again,” she said in her witness statement. “Richard said that auditions in the industry would not be run in the way Noel had purported. He was furious.”Clarke’s barrister said this was not true and that Coldwell’s own evidence suggested the students could make their own decisions about what to do. Coldwell said she stood by her statement.In Clarke’s defence, he has said he “never received any other complaints from LSDA” which “continued to encourage me to run workshops and classes for the school for many years after the purported allegations”.The trial will continue on Monday.Explore more on these topicsUK newsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianNewspapersNational newspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Noem’s notice said they will lose their legal status on 24 April.The new policy affects people who are already in the US and who came under the humanitarian parole program. It follows an earlierTrump administrationdecision to end what it called the “broad abuse” of the humanitarian parole, a long-standing legal tool presidents have used to allow people from countries where there is war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the US.During his campaign,Donald Trumppromised to deport millions of people who are in the US illegally, and as president he has also been ending legal pathways for immigrants to come to the US and to stay.US deportees face brutal conditions in El Salvador mega-prison: ‘Severe overcrowding, inadequate food’Read moreUnder the new policy, parolees must depart before their parole termination date if they have no lawful basis to stay in the US.“Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status,” DHS said.Trump said on 6 March that he would decide “very soon” whether to strip the parole status from some 240,000 Ukrainians who have fled to the US during the conflict with Russia. Trump’s remarks came in response to a Reuters report that said his administration planned to revoke the status for Ukrainians as soon as April.Biden launched a parole entry program for Venezuelans in 2022 and expanded it to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those nationalities. Diplomatic and political relations between the four countries and the United States have been strained.The new legal pathways came as Biden tried to clamp down on illegal crossings at theUS-Mexico border.The Trump administration’s decision to strip the legal status from half a million migrants could make many vulnerable to deportation if they choose to remain in the US. It remains unclear how many who entered the US on parole now have another form of protection or legal status.The order has already beenchallengedin federal courts. A group of American citizens and immigrants sued the Trump administration for ending humanitarian parole and are seeking to reinstate the programs for people of the four nationalities.Lawyers and activists raised their voices to denounce the government’s decision.Friday’s action is “going to cause needless chaos and heartbreak for families and communities across the country”, said Karen Tumlin, founder and director of Justice Action Center, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit at the end of February.

She allegedly exited the bathroom without the schnauzer less than 20 minutes later.Lawrence soon re-entered the terminal and traveled to Colombia, according to reports. A janitor had allegedly spotted the woman in the bathroom cleaning up water and dog food from the stall’s floor.The employee subsequently found the dog’s carcass in a trash container and reported the grim discovery to a supervisor.The dog had a companion vest, collar, rabies tag, a dog travel bag and a bone-shaped dog tag with Lawrence’s name and contact information.An implanted microchip provided Tywinn’s identity to investigators. A necropsy determined that the schnauzer had been drowned.US Customs and Border Protection confirmed that Tywinn’s owner had boarded a flight to Bogota, Colombia, before then flying to Ecuador, according to theAssociated Press.Police ultimately concluded that Lawrence had “taken extreme and tragic action by killing the dog”, according toABC7. They arrested her in Lake county, Florida, on Wednesday on a count of aggravated animal abuse, a third-degree felony. She was reportedly released from custody pending the outcome of the case on $5,000 bail.Dogs traveling from the US to Colombia must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by a veterinarian and a rabies vaccination certificate, according toguidelinesfrom the US Department of Agriculture.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS crimeFloridaAnimalsDogsPetsLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

It clawed a jogger’s scalp and left him reeling. It is said to swoop in from behind without making a sound, has a penchant for tall men’s heads and – so far – has evaded capture.But the violent reign of the Flamstead hawk, which has made men in the Hertfordshire village of Flamsteadafraid to go outwithout covering their heads, may soon be at an end.The Harris hawk is said to have attacked 40 to 50 people in the village in recent weeks, but Flamstead parish council has now told residents that a falconer brought in to try to catch the bird of prey is “extremely close” to catching it, according toThe Herts Advertiser.The fate of the hawk, if it is captured by the council, looks dire.“We are, sadly, getting close to the stage where we may have to euthanise the hawk,” the parish council is reported to have said.“The falconer has been extremely close to catching the hawk on a number of occasions; it has fed on the edge of the trap, for example.“However, we are acutely aware that the hawk’s attacking is becoming more regular and the area in which it is attacking has widened.”When the Guardian called the parish council for an update on the situation, chair Tim Parsons said: “The hawk hasn’t been caught. We’re all getting a bit bored of it actually.”He later added that media reports were picking up on “what’s being said to residents”.The council is understood to have expressed “huge frustration”, due to the closeness of capture.The Herts Advertiser reported that parish councillors believe the bird of prey is being fed “somewhere else” in the village, which is interfering with attempts to capture it.“The hawk is not as hungry as it has been and would not feed at all from the falconer last night, despite having done so over the past few evenings,” the parish council is reported to have said.“This was always going to be a long process, and by feeding the hawk, that process is now taking much longer than anticipated.”According to the newspaper, the council expressed its gratitude to the “majority” of Flamstead who had adhered to its advice not to feed the bird.Despite these challenging circumstances, the falconer is understood to be “very confident” he can catch the offending bird.Its attacks on villagers have attracted international attention, with TV crews descending on the small village – wearing bicycle helmets.When the Guardianvisited last week, few men were spotted walking outside alone. “I’ve been getting my wife to come out for a walk with me because I don’t want to go for a walk by myself,” said resident Michael Hart, who was attacked while out jogging and has now resorted to driving 20 minutes out of the village to continue his daily run.Another resident Glyn Parry, 91,told the BBCthe bird had taken two woolly hats off his head. Initially, he believed “it was just a youngster pulling a prank” after “tapping him on the shoulder”. But the next day, the hawk struck again and this time Parry was able to identify the culprit.“It was such an unusual thing, so I thought it won’t happen again, but it did.”To avoid losing a third hat – or going out hatless while the hawk remains at large – he has fashioned a chinstrap for a fedora out of an old shoelace.Hertfordshire police have urged people not to feed the bird while the situation is dealt with.Explore more on these topicsHertfordshireBirdsAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

In Keir Starmer’s first test as prime minister, she chose to vote with the government’s plan to keep the two-child benefit cap in place. She had actively campaigned for it to be scrapped, but ultimately didn’t believeLabourwere in government to do anything but alleviate child poverty.But as Starmer’s policy proposals became harder for Labour MPs to digest, so Maskell’s interventions became stronger. She has since been a key voice against the cut to winter fuel payments, the cut to UK overseas aid to fund defence spending, the abolition of NHSEnglandand the dropping of proposals to compensate Waspi women – all decisions Maskell did not feel were supported by evidence. She even raised eyebrows when she spoke out against the introduction of a VAT on private school fees.Maskell was one of the first MPs to speak up about plans – formally announced this week – to cut spending on disability benefits. She called for ministers to implement a “compassionate system … not just taking draconian cuts” and said MPs were “feeling really nervous and concerned”. “It should be a Labour government alleviating poverty, not adding to it,” she said.“I’m not here to cause trouble, because that’s not my nature,” she says. “I want us to win. I want us to get it right. What frustrates me is when the evidence doesn’t back up what is being presented.”Elected in 2015, Maskell served in two posts in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, but she was never considered a Corbynite.“I’m not into what I see is the kind of cultism of politics,” she says. “The adulation of the leader and the kind of worship of policy and the line. That isn’t where I come from at all.”Maskell’s political outlook is shaped by her faith. A Christian, she kickstarts her week by having a “bit of a me catch-up” at one of the NewFrontiers network’s evangelical churches.She’s often incorrectly described as being a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, a caucus of leftwing Labour MPs which has included Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell.“I’ve never been in the Socialist Campaign Group. I’ve always been kind of on the edge. I guess because I can’t see where that’s taking us,” she says. “I’ve got progressive politics. I pursue the route of evidence. Of course I work with a lot of my colleagues in the SCG, regularly. But I’ve never signed up and got the badge.”“The Labour party was set up with a specific purpose: to ensure that we did advocate and support for working people who have had a really tough time under the former systems, and to have that unique voice,” she says.“We have got such a heavy responsibility that other parties don’t carry, especially the responsibility that we have for those people who are living in poverty: to make sure that we make a way for them. It should never be about us climbing up and pulling up the ladder. It should always be about us reaching down and helping people up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a written submission Oxford University Boat Club (OUBC) argued that the teacher training qualification “is a diploma and that is not a degree”, a view upheld by the panel.Cambridge’s Boat Race win a reward for ditching ruthless winning culture | Cath BishopRead moreIn a separate development, Paris 2024 gold medallist Tom Ford has also been prevented from rowing for Cambridge on 13 April due to the so-called 12-year rule, which stops anyone competing if it was more than 12 years since they started an undergraduate degree course. The 12-year rule was added to the joint agreement between the two boat clubs that governs the race four years ago after the double Olympic champion James Cracknell rowed for Cambridge in 2019 at the age of 46.The bad blood between the two camps is such that the former Olympic and world champion Annamarie Phelps, who is chair of Cambridge University Boat Club (CUBC), has seen her calls to OUBC go unanswered. Phelps described the situation as “deeply disappointing this week” and Imogen Grant, the reigning Olympic lightweight double sculls champion and a three-time Boat Race winner with Cambridge, accused Oxford of “slimy tactics”. Oxford could certainly do with a new strategy, as they have lost seven women’s races in succession, and five of the last six in the men’s race. No one associated with OUBC has yet commented officially on the matter.View image in fullscreenKate Crowley and Molly Foxell, who have been banned from competing in the 2025 Boat Race, celebrating victory in the 2023 event.Photograph: Avpics/AlamyThe dispute is being taken so seriously that the vice-chancellors of both universities are now said to be considering intervening. There are also concerns at the Boat Race Company, who run the 196-year-old race, that the controversy could impact on their title sponsorship deal with Chanel.The announcement that Chanel had agreed a headline commercial deal with the Boat Race last autumn was a genuinely historic move, as it is the French fashion house’s first sponsorship in sport. Next month’s race will be called the Chanel J12 Boat Race – a reference to the brand’s J12 unisex watch – in the start of a five-year deal which the company have the option to extend. Given that Chanel are a female-focused brand, the controversy is far from ideal.“It looks like Oxford saw an opportunity and went for it, as they took the view that Matt Heywood was a strong rower, and they wanted to stop him competing,” said Cath Bishop, an Olympic rowing silver medallist and Cambridge graduate. “The impact on Cambridge’s women’s squad losing two members is collateral damage. If the PGCE ban stands it will affect women disproportionately, as more women are teachers.“It is also an insult to all the alumni on both sides who have rowed while on PGCE courses, and a poor look for Oxford to be undermining an important degree-level qualification for the teaching profession that is so crucial to society.”While the composition of both crews has often been contested, with mutual distrust on both sides and claims the other university was gaming the system by recruiting elite athletes to study easy degrees, there is a strong feeling in Cambridge that Oxford’s submission to the panel sprang from a determination to stop Heywood rowing. The 26-year-old, a member of the Great Britain crew that won silver in the quadruple sculls at the 2022 WorldRowingChampionships, was also offered a place at Oxford before opting to go to Cambridge, although dual applications are not unusual.Heywood said this week that the decision to exclude him “doesn’t align with any values of sportsmanship or race spirit that I have known in rowing”.Whatever Oxford’s motives this stormy week off the water will not be the end of the matter, with CUBC keeping all options open. The role of the independent panel in particular is being scrutinised, with sources at Cambridge claiming they appear to have change their minds about the issue on two occasions.View image in fullscreenTom Ford, who is is an Olympic and two-time world champion for Great Britain, has also been barred from competing in this year’s Boat Race.Photograph: John Walton/PAAfter Oxford’s objections were upheld in December, Prof Mark Winterbottom, deputy head of Cambridge’s faculty of education, wrote to them the following month confirming the validity of the PGCE qualification. His submission is understood to have included guidance from the website of the University of Oxford’s education faculty, which states that its PGCE is an “M level” or “level 7” qualification, a category that includes master’s degrees on thegov.ukwebsite.After receiving that evidence, the panel reversed their original decision and the three rowers were told they could race, but were informed last week that the decision had changed again. A source with knowledge of the case told the Guardian that the second U-turn resulted from Oxford successfully challenging the panel’s constitution, which they discovered does not include a right of appeal, meaning the original decision had to stand.Cambridge are also understood to have received legal opinion from a king’s counsel that the 12-year rule is discriminatory. While they have opted not to challenge the joint agreement at this stage given the proximity of the race, that could change in the coming months.Explore more on these topicsThe Boat RaceRowingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, the overall absence rate decreased from 7.4% the previous year to 7.1%.Among the scores of parents who responded to a Guardian callout, the majority said their children were absent because of mainstream schools being unable to meet the needs of those who were neurodivergent. Whether they were pupils with Send, autism or other conditions, most respondents said their children felt “anxious” and “overwhelmed” by their school environment.According to the government data, children with caring responsibilities, with special needs or on free school meals continue to be absent at far higher rates than others.Jo, 53, has a 15-year-old daughter who is waiting for a diagnosis of autism and ADHD. She said she felt that not having the diagnosis was an “obstacle” to getting the support her daughter needed. “This week she’s been in school for about an hour for two days,” Jo said.Jo, who lives in Rotherham and is a single parent to two children and carer for her youngest daughter, said her 15-year-old had been absent from school for most of the past six months because of finding it “overwhelming” and “rigid”.Without a diagnosis Jo is unable to apply for an education, health and care plan (EHCP). By receiving universal credit, her daughter is eligible for free school meals though is unable to claim this because of school absences. “It’s a real struggle, but as a parent you just get on with it,” Jo added.In 2024, Jo said she received a letter from the school threatening to fine her and take her to court if her daughter did not return. “The head said it was a generic letter that is sent out after a period of absence, but my 21-year-old daughter, who is also autistic, saw it and was frightened I was going to prison.“Last week, I was told by the school that the local authority said they will consider prosecuting me. My daughter only has eight weeks left [before study leave] so we’ll be gone before we get a court date. It’s such a waste of money.”Many of the parents who got in touch said they felt school absence was partly due to the Covid pandemic and the lack of contact children had during lockdowns. This meant the transition from smaller primary schools to secondary schools with nearly 1,000 pupils left children feeling “scared” and unable to cope with the change.View image in fullscreenVicky McMunn said her daughter’s primary school was a ‘nurturing environment’ but that the move to a larger school was difficult.Photograph: Idorenyin Essien/Guardian CommunityVictoria McMunn’s 11-year-old daughter, who is autistic and has selective mutism, is one of those pupils. “She was masking to fit in but last Christmas she had a burnout and started to have panic attacks,” said the 44-year-old from North Yorkshire.She said her daughter’s primary school was a “nurturing environment” but that the move to a larger school was difficult and her daughter had been absent since February. “Having different teachers and hundreds of pupils moving around several times a day was too much – she wouldn’t cross the school’s threshold. If she was an adult I think she would be signed off work,” said McMunn, a worship leader in an Anglican church.To accommodate her daughter, McMunn has reduced her working week from four days to half a day but said she was lucky to be financially supported by her husband, who is a church minister. After a two-year wait, her daughter now has an EHCP. “It’s all come a bit too late to make a difference,” said McMunn.Other parents said chronic health conditions, including long Covid, had made it nearly impossible for their child to attend school regularly. Some parents have deregistered their children or are providing them with an education otherwise than at school (EOTAS).For Liz in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, long-term illness has meant her 13-year-old daughter has found it difficult to attend school regularly for the past five years. “She’s missed out on so many things,” Liz said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The teenager has since been diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS).With an EHCP, her daughter has funding for EOTAS and does online school at home. “As a former senco [special education needs coordinator] it makes me furious to hear about long-term absence and not recognising the reasons for it,” said Liz, 46, who now co-owns a children’s bookshop.“To say it’s just holidays during term-time or other unauthorised absence is really belittling. There’s a lot of children who are actually just sick and not getting better.View image in fullscreenSonoko Obuchi felt that moving out of a large city could help some children.Photograph: Sonoko Obuchi/Guardian Community“Schools just aren’t set up to get the best out of these children and sometimes make it worse. Parents need to know there are alternative pathways that can do just as much good, it doesn’t have to be just mainstream school.”Some parents felt their schools were supportive and understanding about their situation, whereas others felt “ignored”. However, nearly all agreed that a lack of resources and funding were the main reasons children were missing out on an education. Others, such as Sonoko Obuchi, felt that moving out of a large city could help.Obuchi moved with her husband and two children from London to Derbyshire four years ago after her son refused to go to school at the beginning of 2021. “He came out as transgender at the same time he didn’t want to go to school,” said Obuchi, 42, who is a freelance designer.For three and a half years, her son, who is autistic, stayed at home and had one-to-one tutoring. In September 2024, he returned to school and Obuchi said they feel really supported. “We’ve been really lucky. Schools are already stretched but ours were patient and didn’t fine us for his absence.“It can be really isolating for children who are away from school, but the help we received helped bridge the gap between the worst days and trying to get my son back into an education setting.”Explore more on these topicsSchool attendance and absenceSchoolsEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Shimmering sequins, delicate tulle and frothy chiffon were not what one expected to find on a sheep and cattle farm.“I’ve always been a bit different. A bachelor with all these dresses,” said the late Hore, who ran a sheep and cattle farm in Central Otago in New Zealand’s South Island before his death in 1997.It was a time when not even museums or art galleries in New Zealand were building these kinds of collections. And yet, in 1975a converted tractor shed on the rolling tussocked hills of Central Otago’s remote Māniatoto region became a makeshift fashion museum housing what is now recognised as one of the most significant collections of its kind in Australasia. A new book and exhibition celebrate Hore’s life and fashion collection, and also provides a snapshot of New Zealand in the 1970s and 80s.View image in fullscreenVinka Lucas evening dress, early 1970s, part of Eden Hore’s collection.Photograph: Derek HendersonHore’s niece Jo Dowling, who helped out on the farm during the school holidays in the 1990s, says he was a pioneer in many ways.“He was the first to do a lot of things in farming, like top dressing with a plane, catching wild deer for his farm, running his farm tours and then his garment collection,” Dowling says.“He was his own unique person and some of his family couldn’t believe he was collecting gowns. It’s not the thing a man usually does.”View image in fullscreenEden Hore in the early 1970s, wearing his famous leopard print shirt.Photograph: SuppliedAn enigmatic man of contradictions, equally comfortable wearing the customary farming attire of homespun woollen jerseys, moleskins and gumboots, Hore also loved to rock a bold leopard print shirt or batik fabrics down at the local pub.In 1963 he was invited by his friend, the country singer John Grenell, to accompany him for moral support to the Miss New Zealand Pageant where the shy Grenell was to perform. Hore found himself backstage assisting with the show and was bewitched by the frocks and razzle.Dress historian and honorary curator for the dress collection at Tūhura Otago Museum, Jane Malthus, is the co-author of Central Otago Couture: The Eden Hore Collection, which tells Hore’s remarkable story. Malthus, who has worked with the collection since the 1980s, remembers Hore as a quiet man who was driven by his own vision.“He didn’t care what other people thought of him. He was willing to stand out in the crowd,” she says.Claire Regnault, the senior curator at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and co-author of the book, agrees. “He was confident enough to step outside the box and be himself in an era when that wasn’t really done.”Hore’s stock agent, Ren Lothian once said, “This frock thing … wasn’t the normal for a cocky in those days, not in the Mānaiatoto.”Born in Naseby in Central Otago in 1919, Hore left school at 13 and worked mustering on farms until he was called up in the second world war.‘Our people were so innovative’: Māori art celebrated in landmark bookRead moreIn 1947, he bought Glenshee – an 8,100-hectare farm and its 4,000 sheep and homestead 8km from Naseby. Describing himself as an introvert, the chain-smoking Hore was known for his hard drinking, which probably stemmed from postwar trauma and the tragic death of his 13-year-old adopted daughter. He was also a hard worker, once boasting that he drove a tractor for 22 hours.An innovative farmer and stockman, Hore was the first to bring cattle in the 1970s to the mostly sheep country. Malthus says Hore’s interest in textiles and fashion stemmed from his desire to know more about what could become of farm products such as wool, cattle skin and sheepskin.A mid-1970s sheep leather pantsuit in pine green is a striking example of farm materials going on to have an inventive life.View image in fullscreenHore’s tractor shed ‘museum’ seen in about 2000, filled with gowns and collectibles.Photograph: Jo DowlingWhen Hore died aged 78, he left his vast couture collection to his nephew. In 2013, the Central Otago District Council bought the collection of 226 garments plus accessories such as hats, shoes and costume jewellery for $40,000.Regnault says Hore was attracted to sheers, sequins and Lurex, so the collection is distinctive of his own taste. But what unifies the garments is an emphasis on striking fabrics, textures, bold colours and exquisite detailing.“They’re very characterful clothes. As soon as you see them you can imagine a story, a fantasy around them,” she says.View image in fullscreenVinka Lucas (After Five) evening dress and cape, early 1970s, made of wool crepe, wool and net lace.Photograph: Derek HendersonView image in fullscreenJo Dunlap jacket, gauchos, camisole and cap, 1979.Photograph: Derek HendersonHore had a keen eye for a good frock and a desire to inject a splash of exuberant colour in an otherwise austere, vast dry landscape.“When you think of drab New Zealand at that time, he was creating this strange little oasis in the middle of nowhere. A magical world you stepped into,” says Regnault.View image in fullscreenHore on his farm in the early 1970s.Photograph: Derek HendersonWith his philanthropic community-focused spirit, Hore was a pioneer of rural tourism. When a railway line created a bypass, making the area a forgotten backwater, Eden wanted to attract tourism to the region. He also hosted garden parties and fashion shows to fundraise for the charity Plunket, churches and community groups. And he had other collections he would showcase, of taxidermised animals, imported exotic animals and collectible ceramic Jim Beam decanters.View image in fullscreenVinka Lucas’s bride of the year 2000 ensemble.Photograph: Courtesy of Auckland City Libraries“He really was a man before his time.

There are 200,000 books published annually in the UK alone, “more books than you could possibly read,” the writer of Notes from a Small Islandtold the Times. He is not sure that the growth in self-publishing, in particular, is “a healthy development”. He said he gets sent “a lot of self-published books, and most of the time it is just some anonymous person’s life, and it is of no interest.”Bryson is not wrong that self-publishing has contributed significantly to book slop mountain.More than 2.6 million bookswere self-published in 2023 – many of which are uploaded to the dominant platform, Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing – and they can’t all be masterpieces. Nevertheless, the idea that self-publishing is the preserve of hopeless hobbyists producing books no one wants to read is at least a decade out of date. The romance author Colleen Hoover built her audience through self-publishing and has now sold around 20m books. Sarah J Maas, the world’s bestselling author in 2024, started publishing her “romantasy” fiction on FictionPress.com when she was 16. Freida McFadden, the hugely successful psychological thriller writer, claims to make 60% of her income via KDP and has continued to self-publish even as mainstream publishers seek her out.“There has been this suspicion of self-published authors from the beginning,” says Kathryn Taussig of Storm, one of a new breed of digital-first publishers that are capitalising on what she describes as a “revolution” in self-publishing. “There is a perception that the quality is lacking. But you only have to look at the bestseller charts.”View image in fullscreen‘You only have to look at the bestseller charts’ … Sarah J Maas.Photograph: Beowulf Sheehan/BloomsburyIndeed, self-publishing has allowed authors to provide preciselythe sort of books that people want to read, argues Natalie Butlin, creative insights director at Bookouture, the UK’s leading digital publisher (which is now a part of Hachette). “There are self-published authors who are making millions but you wouldn’t have heard of them,” she says. The model has been particularly successful in catering to fans of genres that have been overlooked by mainstream publishers (for example, LGBTQ+ romances and romantasy) or trends that are deemed to have passed (such as psychological thrillers, or dystopian young adult fiction).Multimillion-sellers are outliers, of course – but then again, so is Bryson within the world of traditional publishing. Butlin thinks the real benefit of self-publishing is that it allows writers to make comfortable incomes at the middle of the market. A 2023 survey of 2,000 self-published authors by the Alliance of Independent Authors found that almost half exceeded $20,000 in revenue and 28% earned more than $50,000 – far more than the vast majority of traditionally published authors. “If you can write a book that people want to read and you package it well, you can make £25-30,000 per book,” says Butlin. “It’s really not an unreasonable expectation.” Meanwhile, traditionally published authors will receive an advance payment, usually paid in instalments: on signing the contract, after submitting the final manuscript, and on publication. Advance amounts vary a lot depending on the author, but typically a debut author can expect to receive between £5,000 and £10,000 in total. After that, many authors never see any money again – royalties are only paid after the advance amount has been made back through book sales.The self-publishing model is of course only possible thanks to digital technology. Most self-publishing concerns ebooks (print-on-demand services are relatively niche) and the real engine is Kindle Unlimited, Amazon’s subscription service, which allows readers to download 20 titles at a time for £9.49 per month, paying authors based on the number of pages read – a model that shares features with YouTube’s minutes-watched revenue system.The most successful self-published authors have become highly savvy in their pursuit of pages-read, says Taussig – in many cases employing precisely the same freelance editors, cover artists, and formatting tools as traditional publishers. But their real advantage, she says, is the “feedback loop” they can enter into with their readers. “These writers are really listening to what their readers are saying almost in real time. They think about which characters their readers respond to and how to include them more. It’s a two-way street in a way that traditional publishing isn’t. It’s why they’ve been so successful. And they get to keep so much more of the money they’ve made.”The other side of that coin is plummeting author revenues in the traditional industry. The Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society reported in 2022 that the median income of full-time authors had fallen by around 60% since 2006, to just £7,000 a year. Ross Raisin, an acclaimed British novelist, recently described the deflating experience of publishing his fourth novel, A Hunger, to positive reviews – only to be told by a major high street book chain that they “didn’t have space” for it on their shelves.View image in fullscreenThe romance author Colleen Hoover built her audience through self-publishing and has now sold around 20m books.Photograph: Patti McConville/AlamyIndeed, it could be argued that it’s the “big five” mainstream publishers – Penguin Random House, Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan – who are more guilty of overproduction. Butlin began her career as a literary agent but became disillusioned that publishing wasn’t learning the lessons from the music industry, which had been completely disrupted by digital technology. She felt that self-publishing offered more opportunities. “Traditional publishers spend most of their marketing budget on the books that have received the largest advances and almost nothing on the books that don’t – so most books don’t really get a chance,” she says. “You can make a relatively sensible guess on what will sell but it’s still essentially gambling.” Publishers will end up with a few enormous hits that cover the losses, but what it means is that many authors end up feeling like it’s their fault when their books don’t sell.There are more diverse voices, more working-class writers, more people who wouldn’t pass the publishing gatesIsobel Akenhead, Boldwood BooksJames McConnachie, editor of the Author, the journal run by the Society of Authors, the UK’s largest writer’s body, paints a similar picture. “Far more books are published than could ever succeed,” he says. “This is chiefly a natural result of readers being unpredictable. No one can publish only bestsellers, so the publishing industry is inevitably wedded to a model of overproduction. Too many publishers buy lots of books and publish them relatively cheaply, underinvesting in editing or marketing while outsourcing much of the risk to authors.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

That’s one reason for the growth in self-publishing. It can feel like you get a fairer share, especially when advances and royalty rates are so low, and traditional authors are doing much of the marketing anyway.”Still, self-publishing is far from a cure-all. It thrives in commercial fiction but literary fiction and children’s fiction – which rely more on physical books and critical acclaim – have yet to find a niche. It’s good at providing what readers want but not what might challenge them – there are also plenty of poorly edited, algorithm-chasing titles designed to exploit fleeting trends on KDP. Though it’s not as if traditional publishers aren’t guilty of churning out seasonal, trend-driven books either: we have HarperCollins to thank for The Pumpkin Spice Café series.‘It was a deflating experience’: the novelists who nearly gave upRead moreMore seriously, no one I speak to has a convincing answer about what happens when Amazon does what tech platforms invariably do, which is squeeze its customers for more money. McConnachie feels that the industry is already rife with unfairness. “It’s a bit like being a YouTuber. Everyone thinks they are going to be one of the few who makes a lot of money. In truth, the vast majority just feed the machine while the channel – Amazon, in this case – makes a fortune out of exploiting the long tail.”For now, though, it hardly seems like a terrible thing that there are different ways for authors to make money. “It’s making traditional publishing work harder,” says Isobel Akenhead, publishing director at independent press Boldwood Books. “They can’t be complacent because they’re no longer the gatekeepers. They’re not just competing with other publishers. They’re competing with authors who don’t necessarily need them any more. I think it’s a brilliant thing. There are more diverse voices, more working-class writers, more people who wouldn’t pass the publishing gates, finding readers.”There are always going to be people who think there are too many books – but it’s not as if anyone is forcing anyone to read them.Explore more on these topicsBooksPublishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was the highest ranking KGB officer to defect to Britain, and his most important contribution as a spy was to warnMargaret ThatcherandRonald Reaganof the Soviet leadership’s paranoia at a time when the world was moving dangerously close to nuclear war.Gordievsky first came to the notice ofMI6after a tip-off from a Czechoslovakian spy, Standa Kaplan, who had defected to Canada. Kaplan mentioned Gordievsky as an old friend from the KGB academy, where they would together question the direction the Kremlin was taking. By then Gordievsky was a KGB officer attached to the Soviet embassy in Copenhagen; in 1972 he responded favourably to delicate approaches made by MI6 officers in the Danish capital, after phone taps revealed that in calls to his wife in Moscow he had expressed growing concern about the Kremlin’s actions, specifically mentioning the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. He began spying for Britain when he returned to Moscow in 1974.He continued to do so when – to the delight of British intelligence – he was moved in 1982 to London, where he was eventually appointed the KGBrezident, its head of station. However, in 1985 Soviet suspicions about him surfaced following a tip-off from Aldrich Ames, a seniorCIAofficer who was spying for the KGB. Gordievsky was summoned back to Moscow for questioning and, after four months of being closely watched, escaped in an episode that might have come straight out of the pages of spy fiction.Over his many years of spying, Gordievsky’s most valuable achievement was reassuring the Kremlin that a major annual Nato exercise in Germany, code-named Able Archer 83, was not the precursor to a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. It was a period of heightened cold war tension between the two superpowers, which was made worse by Reagan’s rhetoric and the paranoia of the Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, who came to power in 1982. In 1981, when he was head of the KGB, Andropov had launched Operation Ryan, which dispatched KGB officers around the world to gather evidence of US plans for a first strike. Gordievsky later described how KGB officers in London were ordered to find out whether NHS hospitals were stocking up supplies of blood and to watch the windows of the Ministry of Defence and other Whitehall departments to see if their lights were burning through the night.Through his MI6 handlers, Gordievsky warned Thatcher, who in turn warned Reagan, that the Kremlin’s concern about what the US and Nato were up to was genuine. With the KGB hierarchy in Moscow reluctant to dismiss Andropov’s paranoia, it was left to Gordievsky to reassure the Kremlin that Nato had no intention of launching nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union. Later, Gordievsky’s other valuable role was assuring western leaders, notably Thatcher, that the new Soviet president,Mikhail Gorbachev, was a genuine reformer who should be taken seriously.Gordievsky was born in Moscow. His father, Anton, was a highly committed officer of the NKVD, the KGB’s precursor, and an enthusiastic supporter of Stalin’s purges, but his mother, Olga, a statistician, hinted privately to Oleg that she held Soviet communism in contempt. While his elder brother, Vasily, was establishing a career in the KGB, Oleg studied at the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations.He subsequently joined the Russian foreign service and was posted to East Berlin in 1961 just as the wall was being constructed. He accepted an invitation to join the KGB in 1963 and was posted to Copenhagen. After his second tour there, when he was recruited by MI6, he returned in 1978 to Moscow, where he threw himself into brushing up his English and learning about British politics. Helped by a shortage of KGB British experts, he was rewarded in 1982 with a posting to London.In London Gordievsky regularly met his MI6 handlers at a safe house in Bayswater. Thatcher was told about him, but she knew his identity only as “Mr Collins”. MI6 officers passed him chickenfeed – snippets of low-grade intelligence – to keep Moscow Centre happy with his work. Among information he fed MI6 was material about Britain he saw in the KGB’s vast archives.It included, he said, reports that the KGB regardedMichael Footas an “actual agent” and made regular payments to the future Labour leader, whom they codenamed “Agent Boot”. However, Gordievsky’s claims about Foot, which he said MI6 believed, were inconsistent, and sit oddly with Foot’s longstanding record of opposing the Soviet Union and its policies. After the Sunday Times published allegations in 1995 that he was a Soviet “agent of influence”, Foot successfully sued for libel and was awarded substantial damages.View image in fullscreenGordievsky receiving his CMG from Queen Elizabeth, 2007.Photograph: Martin Keene/PAGordievsky did, however, identify one individual with the potential to inflict real damage to British interests. He wasMichael Bettaney, an unstable MI5 officer who had been sent to trouble-torn Northern Ireland, where various traumatic incidents led him into heavy drinking and a nervous breakdown. Confused and embittered, in June 1983 Bettaney had stuffed a batch of highly sensitive internal MI5 documents, including the names of senior MI5 staff, into the letter box of the London house of the KGB rezident, Arkady Guk.Suspecting a trap, Guk consulted Gordievsky, who at the time was his deputy. Gordievsky told Guk he was clearly the victim of a set-up, before informing, as quickly as he could, his MI6 controllers. Bettaney became the first MI5 officer to face trial under the Official Secrets Act and was sentenced to 23 years in jail, while the exposure of Guk during the trial enabled the UK government to expel him, conveniently paving the way for Gordievsky to take over as the KGB’s head of station in London.Shortly afterwards the KGB got wind, through Ames, that one of their senior officers was a mole working for British intelligence. Various checks, allied to the way the Bettaney affair had panned out, soon pointed to Gordievsky as being that mole.In May 1985 he was summoned back to Moscow and taken to a KGB safe house, where he was drugged and interrogated. Although he was released, he knew it would only be a matter of time before he would be interrogated again. Under a plan worked out in advance by MI6, at 7.30pm every Tuesday its officers would keep a watch on a certain bread shop in Moscow. In case of emergency, Gordievsky was told to turn up there wearing a grey cap and holding a plastic bag with the bright logo of Safeway supermarket.An MI6 officer would then walk past him munching a Mars bar or a KitKat – a signal that would confirm the triggering of an operation, codenamed Pimlico, to smuggle him out of Russia. In July 1985 he activated the plan by visiting the bakers with his Safeway bag, and the next day caught a train to Leningrad (now St Petersburg), where he took another train to a Russian town close to the Finnish border.In the course of an extraordinary day in which KGB teams tried to track down two cars driven by MI6 officers and their families, he was eventually shoved into the boot of one of them. After the tensest of moments, Soviet border guards, whose dogs were distracted by the smell of soiled nappies in Gordievsky’s car, let through the two vehicles, which had diplomatic plates. Gordievsky emerged in Finland and was flown to Britain via Norway. In Moscow he was sentenced to death, in absentia, for treason.MI6 quickly found him a house near Godalming in Surrey, where his identity was protected. But he was without his family and lonely, and suffered the withdrawal symptoms that spies so often experience once the excitement of their secret life and defection has died down. Aware of the dangers, MI6 encouraged Gordievsky to write a history of the KGB with the Cambridge historian Christopher Andrew. The KGB: The Inside Story was published in 1990, and the following year Gordievsky produced Instructions From the Centre, a book that described how he and fellow KGB officers conned Moscow headquarters into believing their intelligence reports were the result of expensive lunches with valuable British contacts.His autobiography, Next Stop Execution, was published in 1995, accompanied by the claims about Foot.In 2007, Gordievsky was appointed CMG, for “services to the security of the UK”.Later that year he was rushed to hospital where he spent 34 hours unconscious. He claimed he was poisoned with thallium by “rogue elements in Moscow”, a contention that was never proved but led him to criticise MI6 for not looking after him properly.His first marriage, to Yelena Akopian, a KGB officer, ended in divorce. In 1979 he married Leila Aliyeva, whom he met in Copenhagen, where she worked for the World Health Organization. They had two daughters, Maria and Anna.Gordiesvky told neither of his wives that he was a double agent, to protect them if they were subjected to interrogation if he was caught or fled. Leila and his daughters were on holiday in Azerbaijan at the time of his escape. Under pressure from the KGB, Leila divorced him. In 1991, she and their daughters were allowed to join him in Britain. But forced separation and the knowledge that Gordievsky had led a double life meant their relationship could not be restored. She soon returned to Russia. Their daughters, who do not use their father’s name, are believed to still live in Britain.Oleg Antonovich Gordievsky, intelligence officer, born 10 October 1938; death announced 21 March 2025Explore more on these topicsEspionageRussiaMI6CIAobituariesShareReuse this content"

It serves modern European food and caters to the kind of audience who follow restaurant news in much the same way as others follow opera gossip or Formula One, and they’ll book out of sheer curiosity to experience this all-new, deeply chilled affair fromIsaac McHale, chef/owner of the two Michelin-starredClove Clubnearby.We were led to believe that Bar Valette would not be at all like that well-known destination-dining spot. Not as formal. More come as you are. Clapshot croquettes (that’s mashed swede and potato, by the way), chicken in a basket, fancy fish with spuds, flan for pudding. The prices, however, aren’t informal at all and are very much still wearing tuxes, cummerbunds and spats. Small plates from £16 and snacks at £11. Want spuds with that? That’ll be £9, please.View image in fullscreenBar Valette’s clapshot croquettes: ‘That’s mashed swede and potato, by the way.’Watching the old guard ofenfants terriblesnoughties Michelin chefs do “informal” is all rather fascinating. These people flew in the face of formality over a decade ago, chipping away at all the stuffiness and forlock-tugging, and making dinner at the Ritz seem like a prison sentence. Now those same chefs are opening places like Bar Valette to show us how to be truly relaxed while paying £11 for a bowl of kale.But, guys, how much more chilled can we get? While the Clove Club is in the rather grand Shoreditch town hall, Bar Valette is just a room overlooking a busy east London bus route. A glass-fronted room with brick walls painted white, a blackboard for wines and specials, and jars of chickpeas and white asparagus used as decor. We began with Vichy Catalan, at £6.50 per bottle, but, spotting that I was a non-drinker, they kindly offered to make me a non-alcoholic spritz with a shot ofSylva Padauktopped with soda. I notice only later that they charged me £18.50 plus service for the privilege.View image in fullscreenBar Valette’s buttermilk fried chicken on a bed of pine is ‘a nod to the chef’s rabble-rousing era’ at the Clove Club in the early 2010s.Two apparently complimentary devilled crab tarts appear – pretty unmemorable, but, hey, a gift … and added to the bill at £12. Fried boned chicken – reportedly bathed in buttermilk, though that might just be conjecture – is £14 and, in a nod to the Clove Club’s rabble-rousing era, comes in a basket and on a bed of pine branches. Fried Torbay prawns turn up, shell on and inviting us to crunch our way through their sweet tails and heads. For £27. A basket of perfectly nice swiss chard and ricotta barbajuans keep us happy while we chat, even though they’re £11. Gosh, we’ve spent some money so far at this draughty table near the door.For mains,fabada Asturianaarrives – a sticky pork and bean stew featuring blood sausage and belly pork – and then something curious happens: there is a lump of hard plastic in it, which my guest, mistaking it for some pork offcut or other, initially tries to eat before retrieving it from his mouth. “Oh God!” I mutter. “This will cause chaos.” That’s because this is an expensive restaurant, and while they may not be serious about, say, wallpaper, errors of this kind generally lead to kitchen staff offering to fall on their swords. So I brace for the rumpus. “Oh, I am sorry,” our server says, and whisks the offending item off to the kitchen. We wait. But no further word or explanation is forthcoming, and the stew stays on the bill.View image in fullscreenBar Valette’s lamb chops with spicy mayo come in at £11 each.Alert, alert: in the smart, cool dining stakes, I think we may have hit Peak Relaxed Mode. No sane diner pines for the days of the special-occasion restaurant, where servers scowled while you fumbled over the 10 terrifying cutlery options. But the etiquette used to be that if a stew cost £26, someone would care if it contained miscellaneous plastic packaging. Two plump lamb chops “with spicy mayo” are up next, and at £11 a pop. Then some red mullet fillets with a green olive emulsion for – reach for your smelling salts here – £44. One large potato, sliced up and sauteed in duck fat, was £9. A lump of Stichelton with two figs was another £14. By this stage, we are £249 poorer for this experience.View image in fullscreenBar Valette’s potato side, featuring ‘one large potato, sliced up and sauteed in duck fat’, costs all of £9.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The GuardianWe exit, feeling a bit befuddled and glancing around for anyone who might care to say good bye, but Bar Valette is not the sort of place where people stand on ceremony. “Is the white asparagus in those decorative jars the same white asparagus that they have on the menu for £16?” my guest wondered. “If so, that’s fairly brass-necked.” It’s hard to say, but I do know that everything is informal here except the price.Bar Valette28–30 Kingsland Road, London E2, 020-3976 0076.

They discuss being an odd fit in ‘lad’ culture and why getting back together took so longRich PelleyFri 21 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTShareMartin Clunes andNeil Morrisseyhaven’t appeared together on TV since Men Behaving Badly, the much-loved (perhaps very much-of-its time) sitcom in which they played Gary and Tony, two emotionally immature, beer-guzzling, lady-loving flatmates besotted with their upstairs neighbour Deborah (Leslie Ash). Their characters came at a time that the caring, sharing new man of the early 90s was being swiftly replaced by the “lad”, with the rise of Loaded magazine, Oasis and similarly minded TV shows such as Game On.Since Men Behaving Badly ended in 1998, Clunes has gone on to star in 10 series of ITV’s cosy detective drama Doc Martin, and his own travel series, Islands of Britain. Morrissey, meanwhile, has been in everything from Skins to Neighbours and, of course, voiced kids’ favourite Bob the Builder. Now they’re finally back together on screen with their new travel show, Neil & Martin’s Bon Voyage.

They do live together.”If you did another travel show but with a different Martin (or Clunes), and a different Neil (or Morrissey) … who would you choose?NMThere are no other Clunes.

Then the double doors burst open and in came a film crew, camera over shoulder, lights on, with Peter Andre, having his hair brushed and makeup applied, doing his reality TV show. Neil Finn and Robert Plant looked at me and went: “Who’s that?” I said, “He’s a pop star.” They went, “Never heard of him.” I was glad to be there for that surreal moment.What would happen if it was Bon Voyage with Neil Morrissey, Martin Clunes and Peter Andre?NMHe’s a very sweet, lovely man.

We parent the children (almost grownups) as a well-functioning team. All in all, life with him is perfect.My problemis that I’m insanely jealous of an ex-colleague of his. A few years ago, he started to spend more time with a group of colleagues in their 30s– let’s call them Jack, Jules and Ann. What started during office hourssoon spilt overto lunch, regular drinks, dinner, etc.I heard more and more often about Ann:“Ann is so good at this, why don’t you cook vegetables like Ann”and so on.She is a woman I can’t compete with:she is young, beautiful, funny, extrovert.These were uneasy times. Ifelt really anxious, andscared that he’d leave me for her. This led to a number of arguments. Eventually, he changed job and heno longer sees her on a daily basis. He also realisedIfelt anxious and agreed to stop seeing her.However, he’s still friends with hisformer colleagues and if he’s having a drink with, say, Jack, I’ll hear afterwards that Ann popped in. I want to stress that he’s considerate of my anxiety, he’s very honest and he’ll always tell me when he’s met her, even if it was by accident. He doesn’ttry tofind ways to meet her.But I’m insanely jealous of this woman. Any time he mentions her name, feelings of jealousy, rage and hate for her swell upthat I can’t control.I knowI should get over it, but I don’t manage to. I only overreact, terrified hemay fall in love with her (again?) and leave me.How can I put this behind me and move on?You’re asking some really good questions, which is key to taking the heat out of this situation, and for you to really dig down into why you’re having such an extreme reaction to this woman. I’m interested to know if you feel like this about anyone else? When we have a reaction to a situation or person that’s disproportionate, it’s usually because it’s not just about what’s in front of us.I also noted that you and your husband got together very young. My experience of people who get together very young is that they can get “stuck” in young and extreme feelings towards one another and there’s often not a lot of life experience to put things into context, ie that men and women can be friends (they really can!) and nothing more.Is something being re-enacted here, of feeling insecure, afraid? Maybe even feeling left out and abandoned?I went to UKCP-registered psychotherapist Kate Merrick. “I’m struck by how present and vocal your inner critic is,” she said. “It sounds as though under the surface your self-esteem may be quite fragile.”I also thought your thinking was quite black and white: your husband is “the best”, your life is “perfect” (as, according to you, is Ann: she isn’t; she’s human).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She asked if “you’ve been ‘insanely jealous’ and enraged before? Maybe even hateful towards someone when you were young? A sibling perhaps, or a parent who remarried? Is something being re-enacted here, of feeling insecure, afraid? Maybe even feeling left out and abandoned?”In short, what does this situation remind you of? Because from what you’ve said you have nothing to worry about with Ann, so what is being evoked? You may have to sift through some uncomfortable feelings that you’ve buried, but this may help to defuse the “hate bomb” you have towards her.I’m pleased your husband seems to understand, although asking why you don’t cook vegetables like Ann isn’t helpful (what does she do to them?). Merrick wondered if there was “an invitation here from life to do some deeper, inner healing work and cultivate more self-awareness, compassion and love for yourself. And in moments when you feel hijacked by those powerful, intense emotions, to try to remind yourself that your husband is very supportive, kind and loving.”This will take a bit of time, but facing up to difficult feelings is the way to process them and put them where they belong.

A full third of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra’s first-time audience members are coming to the concert hall via their favourite series and movies – and video games. It is a huge cultural growth area, and one that may have gone unrecognised by the general public.“It is impossible to ignore video game music now,” says Tommy Pearson, founder and artistic director of the inaugural London Soundtrack festival. “The sheer creativity and artistry in games is incredible, and it’s been fascinating to see so many composers blossom in the genre.”As one of the lead architects behind the festival, Pearson was eager to make space for video games as part of the celebration – not just as an “add-on” to TV and film soundtracks, but as an equal in the art form. “When I was first thinking about what we would do at the festival, including games music was a no-brainer. It absolutely has to be there alongside film and TV music. It has a very dedicated audience of fans and the music is as good as anything being written in any genre.”View image in fullscreenTommy Pearson, artistic director of London Soundtrack festival.Photograph: London Soundtrack FestivalRunning from 19 to 26 March, the festival will consist of live performances, panel discussions, screenings, Q&As and masterclasses. One of the key events,State of the Art, will include performances of video game music by the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, masterclasses from Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab – composers who recently collected Grammy and Ivor Novello awards for their work on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.Why is 2025 the perfect time for the first Soundtrack festival in London? “We’re seeing millions of streams of game soundtracks, daily,” says Barton. “There’s a huge amount of social media content on Instagram and TikTok that ties into it, not to mention the world of Twitch where a streamer’s playlist is a huge part of their identity. The record industry is just about catching on to this.”“I see the streaming numbers climbing in real time, but beyond the data, you can sense it everywhere,” adds Haab. “Game music isn’t confined to consoles any more – it’s woven into people’s every day lives. My nieces and nephews, for example, have game soundtracks on rotation purely for enjoyment. At gaming events, fans know these themes note-for-note, singing them back with the same devotion you’d see at a concert. Even in broader entertainment circles – award shows, industry mixers – video game scores are part of the conversation now. They’re treated with the same respect as film music, standing on their own as a legitimate art form. And if the surging demand for soundtrack releases tells us anything, it’s that people aren’t just listening: they’re seeking it out.”View image in fullscreen‘Fans know these themes note-for-note’ … Death Stranding.Photograph: Kojima ProductionsComposers Ludvig Forssell (Death Stranding), Harry Gregson-Williams (Metal Gear Solid), Stephanie Economou (Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök), andBorislav Slavov(Baldur’s Gate 3) will all be part of a panel discussing games music in the day, before joining the performances in the evening.From IT worker to god of music: the unlikely story of Baldur’s Gate 3 composer Borislav SlavovRead more“You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who can’t sing a tune from Super Mario Bros or Final Fantasy or Halo or The Legend of Zelda,” says Economou. “Video game music is prevalent because video games are prevalent. The industry itself is more profitable than the film, television and music industry combined. So when people think that it’s suddenly surging in popularity, all I can think is: no, it’s just finally getting more recognition and celebration in more public spheres. I applaud the London Soundtrack festival for highlighting the art form and I’m thrilled to be part of the festival in its inaugural year.”“The London Soundtrack festival is a great opportunity to celebrate the differences and diversities in music for media,” adds Forssell. “Video games may still be the new kid on the block, in some senses, but they are definitely here to stay; and I hope that we as composers will always be able to have our own different approaches to music in general, be it pop, rock or music for film, TV, video games and beyond.”Pearson and the team of composers he has assembled see the event as a celebration of the state of video game music. “These are all brilliant, hugely respected composers producing terrific and exciting scores that live in the game and in the concert hall very successfully,” Pearson says.Will non-gaming audiences ever accept video game music as much as TV or film?“There will always be a bit of snobbery about media music,” Pearson says, “But it’s nowhere near as much as it used to be. And who cares what people think anyway?”London Soundtrack festivalis at various venues until 26 March.Explore more on these topicsGamesFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Foden and Rashford were substituted after failing to seize a chance to impress from the start.Lewis-Skelly’s England debut goal sets up Tuchel’s winning start over AlbaniaRead more“We hope for more impact in these positions,” Tuchel said. “More dribbling and more aggressive runs towards the box. In general that was missing. The chances come from the little runs behind the line. They were not as decisive as they can be.”Tuchel considered whether Foden lacks belief in anEnglandshirt. “We will encourage him to do what he does best, to go at defenders, to go into dribbles,” the German said. “Both our wingers who started were not as impactful as they can be in club football. I’m not so sure why we struggled to bring the ball quickly to them.“We lacked runs off the ball. It was a little bit too much passing, not enough dribbling, not aggressive enough towards goal. They trained very well, they were decisive in training. That’s why I also think they deserved [to start], they were very good in the last weeks with their clubs. We will keep on encouraging them.”England’s start to their qualifying campaign for the 2026 World Cup was sparked by a debut goal from Myles Lewis-Skelly and a late strike from Harry Kane. The performance of Lewis-Skelly, the 18-year-old left-back, was a positive. “Amazing player, amazing personality,” Tuchel said. “He came into camp and showed straight away that it’s normal to fall in love with him. It is well deserved. He’s full of courage, full of quality.”Tuchel’s target is to win the World Cup and he was adamant that England “have to do better”. He felt that his side lost confidence in their structure after half-time and were more open to counterattacks. “I need to watch the game and look for solutions,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the games piled up against her and she visibly struggled physically, Raducanu limped slowly between rallies and she was barely any more agile once they began. It seemed like she had nothing more to give.Even when she appeared to be rounding on certain defeat, however, Raducanu refused to stop searching for a way through. The 22 year-old was rewarded for her faith and fortitude with one of the best wins of her career as she recovered from numerous deficits in the final set of an utterly chaotic tussle to defeat Emma Navarro, the eighth seed, 7-6 (6), 2-6, 7-6 (3) and reach the third round of the Miami Open.Miami Open: Gauff condemns Kenin to double bagel as Fearnley progressesRead moreIt is difficult to overstate the importance of this win for Raducanu, who had arrived in Miami struggling badly for confidence after losing five of her previous six matches. Even though she won the US Open on the same surface, this is Raducanu’s first ever top 10 win on hard courts and her third overall.Asked where this moment ranks in her season so far, Raducanu said: “This is No 1. Emma is a top 10 opponent, I haven’t beaten a top 10 opponent this year so that’s my first one. She made me work hard for every single point. I don’t think the whole match was pretty but just taking into account: I had to fight. I had to scrap. I had to be aggressive because there was no way I was going to beat her trying to out-rally her.”It was clear from the beginning that Raducanu was feeling good on the court. She opened the match attacking her forehand with clarity and confidence. Her serve, which has also been a significant liability this year, was potent. In the final stages of a high quality set, it was Navarro who felt the pressure and squandered two set points.While the durable and consistent Navarro comfortably maintained her steady level at the beginning of the set and continued to drag Raducanu into arduous, lengthy rallies as frequently as possible, Raducanu’s intensity rapidly dropped in set two. Her footwork practically slowed to a halt. As the second set fell away from Raducanu, she was badly struggling.View image in fullscreenEmma Navarro struggled to maintain her level against Emma Raducanu in the third set.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APBefore the final set, Raducanu received treatment from the trainer for what appeared to be blisters on her left foot. The medical timeout appeared to make little difference early in the final set as she hobbled around the court and immediately lost her serve.But Raducanu desperately searched for a way back into the match and her determination left its mark on an increasingly tentative Navarro, whose composure, and forehand, crumbled.From 1-3 down, Raducanu reeled off five games in a row to lead 5-3. The momentum shifts, however, did not stop. Navarro soon served for the match at 6-5. Then the pair found themselves in a final set tie-break. As the lead moved from one player to another and back again, the one constant was Raducanu’s determination to take the ball early and control her destiny. She dictated the vast majority of the final set and she struck the ball cleanly in the decisive moments. Her courage earned her an unforgettable win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just keep fighting. I literally played every point like it was going to be my last.”This breakthrough result for Raducanu had been preceded by her opting to end her trial partnership with the Slovak coach Vladimir Platenik on the eve of the tournament. Still, Raducanu noted that her work over the past few weeks contributed to this result. After a brutal month on and off the court, she has found her way again: “I’ve gone through a lot and I told myself that you’ve gone through too much to leave it to her,” said Raducanu. “I was just fighting every single point.”In the men’s draw Novak Djokovic, the No 4 seed, beat Australia’s Rinky Hijikata 6-0, 7-6(1) to reach the third round where he will face the world No 69, Camilo Ugo Carabelli.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

But as the various royals, sporting dignitaries, politicians and billionaires left the Costa Navarino resort on Friday, some really believed the resultcould have turned out very differently.Yes, the 41-year-old Zimbabwean ex-swimmer had won in the first round with 49 votes to become the first woman to lead the IOC. And yes, Juan Antonio Samaranch and Sebastian Coe, the other members of the “Big Three”, had come away with just 28 and eight votes respectively. But in the postmortem there were several stories about how the IOC machine had powered Thomas Bach’s chosen successor over the line.So who is Kirsty Coventry, who now has global sport’s most powerful job? | Sean IngleRead more“We were hearing about phone calls telling members: ‘Don’t waste your vote, do the right thing’”, said one well-placed source. Another admitted: “The lobbying and strong-arming was intense.” There were even reports of at least one IOC member going up to Bach to voice their displeasure.Some camps believe it changed the entire race. For months most candidates had their own internal trackers, which predicted who each IOC member would vote for round by round, as the lowest scoring candidate dropped out. And at the start of the week, several camps had similar numbers for the crucial first round of voting.Samaranch, depending on who you spoke to, had either 24, 28 or 30 votes in the bag. Lord Coe’s ranged from as low as 20 and as high as 26. And while two camps had Coventry in the low or mid-20s, and another a fair bit higher, the consensus was that there was everything still to play for.At this point Coe was still hopeful that his message of being the change candidate was working. And he saw a path to victory in the later rounds, with some promising to switch to him after lending Coventry their first-round vote.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe possibly over-estimated the appetite for change among IOC voters.Photograph: Nikolas Kominis/APSamaranch, meanwhile, hoped that his charm, his small-c change manifesto and his 24 years at the IOC might turn the vote his way late on. Until the final 48 hours, most reckoned he was the slight favourite.But the danger zone for both men was always going to be the first round. They knew Coventry had to knock them out early, as she wouldn’t pick up many more votes in the later rounds. Their mistake was not believing that she could do it.But 24 hours before the election there were growing signs Coventry was gaining serious momentum. The first came when Bach was made honorary IOC president. As the 71-year-old received the award he feigned surprise, even though he surely knew it was coming. But then came an hour-long eulogy from IOC members, some of whom shed tears while others compared him to Nelson Mandela.“May the Olympic gods continue to guide you, dear president,” said his deputy, Nicole Hoevertsz. No wonder that one critic described it as “a level of unctuousness that would not have looked out of place on the politburo in Pyongyang”.But those in the room were divided about what this choreography really meant. Was it the IOC membership giving Bach a send-off so he didn’t feel too angered when Coventry lost? Or did it mean the 71-year-old German was giving a final reminder to members of his power and how he wanted them to vote?One candidate’s team admitted they misjudged it. “It was a classic example where you see the signs but you tell yourself it is something else,” they said.By Thursday morning it was clear that Coventry was picking up steam. Observers reckoned her vote had risen into the 40s. Meanwhile Bach was looking noticeably more cheery as he cracked jokes about being a lame duck.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a minor delay when IOC member Samira Asghari struggled to vote, causing the IOC director general Christophe De Kepper to tell her: “You are testing my nerves and those of the candidates,” the contest was over after two minutes.While Coventry celebrated, others were conducting a postmortem. Most agreed that Coe took by far the biggest haircut in the final stages and queried if the IOC election rulebook, which states that “the IOC administration shall maintain strict neutrality at all times”, might not be worth the paper it was written on.But when Coe was asked whether it was a clean fight, he was sanguine. “Oh, it’s an election.” While another influential voice made a similar point: “Elections – what’s new?”However this was a contest where the rules were so strict that, when the entire IOC membership had dinner in Lausanne in January, the seven candidates were put together on a table with Bach, where they had a lobster and couscous starter followed by cod, to prevent them lobbying potential voters.Yet while there is still some disquiet in some quarters, the sense is that the membership will move on and close ranks behind Coventry. That is what the IOC tends to do, after all. No wonder IOC honorary member Dick Pound said the voting process “makes the Vatican conclave look like it’s open house”.For Coe, his requiem for a lost dream will perhaps return to whether he misjudged the appetite for change among members and the extent of Bach’s power. Perhaps the die was cast in 2016 when Coe and World Athletics banned Russian track and field athletes from the 2016 Olympics for state-sponsored doping.But Coe can at least reflect on this. His candidacy at least got Coventry talking about the need to do more to help athletes, cut costs at the IOC, and to protect women’s sport, none of which were in her manifesto. Perhaps one day he will see that as a positive. But for now this defeat will sting.Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeOlympic GamesSport politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

England’s domination in the tournament stems from the introduction of professional contracts in 2019, since then they have not lost a game in the Six Nations and victory over Italy in their tournament opener on Sunday would bring a 30th consecutive win in the competition.England are favourites for another clean sweep, but would a loss actually benefit the Red Roses in the long run, particularly with a home Rugby World Cup happening later this year? In their past 51 games, their only defeat came in theWorld Cup final against New Zealandin 2022. Some believe losing could offer invaluable lessons should they come under pressure again.Women’s Six Nations 2025: team-by-team guide to the tournamentRead moreBefore England last won theRugby World Cup in 2014, the team lost a2013 Test series against New Zealandand then were beaten byFrance during the 2014 Six Nations. “Those were huge moments,” Katy Daley-Mclean, who captained England to World Cup glory, said on The Good, The Scaz & The Rugby podcast. “When we lost to France, everyone knew it was happening but it was like you were under water. No one had any language to solve the problems. It was helpful for when we got squeezed a little by Canada in that 2014 final, we had language. We built communication streams, we built a leadership group that was resilient and knew what to do.”Nonetheless, there are no guarantees – England lost to New Zealand less than a year before the 2017 World Cup finalwhen they were beaten by the Black Fernsagain.England’s versatile back Claudia MacDonald, who returns to the squad after a neck injury, is not convinced they need to lose in this Six Nations to progress. “I have heard the desire for England to lose,” she says. “I think it is all about challenges, losing is a potential challenge but I think there are also so many other challenges that we can be and are continually faced with. Whether that is being under pressure under your sticks, conceding the first try, going a player down.“There are so many ways we can be challenged with what happens on the pitch that I don’t think it necessarily means we have to lose a game. It is about trying to learn and how we respond and how we tweak that response to be even better the next time.View image in fullscreenEngland will hope to win a seventh consecutive Six Nations title but players will also get a chance to fight for a squad spot at the home Rugby World Cup later this year.Photograph: Matt Impey/Shutterstock“Someone also has to lose training every week, so it’s not like we aren’t losing. We are certainly losing to each other each week in training. I don’t think there is a lack of opportunities to learn and develop without losing a game.”If England are to lose a fixture during the upcoming tournament, it will probably come at the hands of either Ireland or France. England v France is typically the grand slam decider but France’s form has been shaky while Ireland have proved they can cause an upset.Ireland may have capitulated to the Red Roses last year in an88-10 defeatbut since then they have been in great form and they take on France at home on Saturday in the opening match of the 2025 women’s Six Nations. They finished third in the 2024 tournament and then caused a huge shock by beating world champions New Zealand at WXV 1.The Ireland head coach, Scott Bemand, says: “You can get a little bit carried away sometimes but we are going to stay grounded. We know exactly where we are, we know exactly where we want to go.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People are now taking us a little bit more seriously. You lose the anonymity and now we have to do it with people seeing us as a bit of a threat. That is a class opportunity, especially with the Rugby World Cup on the horizon. To become a contender, we need to perform in big games.”Honest conversations mean Wales will get better on the pitch in this Six Nations | Jaz Joyce-ButchersRead moreThe team being slightly overlooked is Scotland because of slow progression but they do have the benefit of having the longest serving current coach in the Women’s Six Nations in Bryan Easson, who took charge in 2020. Italy and Wales are in the opposite position and will be hoping for a new head coach bounce. The Azzurri have brought in Fabio Roselli, while former Gloucester-Hartpury coach Sean Lynn is now in charge of Wales, who travel to Scotland on Saturday in their first match of the tournament.The teams will have to contend with new laws in the tournament, which follows the men’s competition. These include 20-minute red cards and players having 60 seconds to kick conversions and 30 seconds to form scrums and lineouts. Attendance records are also set to be broken with the world record crowd on the cards at Twickenham when England play France in the final game.It feels as though this could be a gamechanging year for the sport, ending with a groundbreaking Rugby World Cup.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Six NationsWomen's rugby unionRugby unionEngland women's rugby union teamFrance women's rugby union teamWales women's rugby union teamScotland women's rugby union teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lee Carsley’s second coming as England’s Under-21 head coach ended in a chastening defeat against a talented France side that could prove to be a major stumbling block to his hopes of retaining the European title.A hat-trick from the Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike and an inspirational performance from Lyon’s Rayan Cherki were too much for an experimental England side that responded with goals from James McAtee, Harvey Elliott and Liam Delap before Elliott wasted a chance to equalise when he blasted his penalty into orbit.Lewis-Skelly’s England debut goal sets up Tuchel’s winning start over AlbaniaRead moreA harsh late red card for the substitute Omari Hutchinson was not exactly what Carsley would have planned from this trip to Brittany as Gérald Baticle’s side laid down a marker ahead of this summer’s tournament in Slovakia.“It’s something that we need to look at, obviously – to concede five goals and not great goals either,” said Carsley, who defended his decision to play with three at the back. “I don’t think it would have had any benefit coming over here and just playing the way that we always do. We always want to play with a punch. We want to score goals.”The array of rising stars on show meant this game had been billed as the most valuable Under-21 international ever held with the combined value of both squads estimated at almost €1bn by thetransfermarkt website.Carsley said this week that he feels “very lucky” to be back in charge of such a talented squad after his spell as interim senior coach and had hinted that he would use this and Monday’s friendly against Portugal to try out different combinations with a largely different group to the squad that triumphed in Georgia two years ago.Bournemouth’s Alex Scott was a surprise choice at right-wing back as Adam Wharton – who along with Taylor Harwood-Bellis and Delap trained with Thomas Tuchel’s senior squad this week – and Elliot Anderson showed glimpses of their ability in central midfield in an area of the squad where Carsley is spoilt for choice.He must have thought it was going to be a comfortable evening when McAtee – who may not be eligible for this summer’s finals in Slovakia given Manchester City’s involvement at the club World Cup – slammed home from close range from a corner after Delap’s header deflected off his Ipswich teammate Jaden Philogene in the second minute.View image in fullscreenHarvey Elliott misses a chance to level the match after blasting his penalty over the bar.Photograph: Dave Winter/ShutterstockBut France also have impressive depth in this age group and were level within two minutes when a brilliant through ball from Cherki set up Quentin Merlin inside the area. Harwood-Bellis and the goalkeeper James Beadle were then at fault as a long ball from Cherki allowed Ekitike – who will face Tottenham in next month’s Europa League quarter-final – to race through and score.While they struggled to get to grips with France’s skilful front three, England looked bright whenever they went forward and it needed solid saves from the goalkeeper Obed Nkambadio to keep out efforts from Delap, Philogene and Anderson, before Philogene’s deflected shot struck the post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Elliott gave England renewed hope when he pulled one back from McAtee’s clever header across goal, with Anderson then going within inches of equalising just before half-time.With so many options on the bench, including Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri who was celebrating his 18th birthday, it was a surprise that Carsley didn’t make any changes until later in the second half when the game was already lost.Ekitike soon completed his hat-trick with a simple tap in after Odobert once again left CJ Egan-Riley in his dust, although England refused to throw in the towel and were given a lifeline when Delap headed in after McAtee’s chip struck the crossbar.Elliott was handed a golden opportunity to equalise from the spot when Rico Lewis was taken out but the Liverpool forward’s penalty was reminiscent of Harry Kane’s against France at the 2022 World Cup as it sailed into the stands.It was left for Cherki to apply the coup de grâce when his shot squirmed under the unfortunate Beadle to send Carsley back to the drawing board.Explore more on these topicsEngland Under-21smatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A quick car is a surprise to no one but what fascinated about Lando Norris’s and Oscar Piastri’s ride is that their single greatest advantage apparently lay not in the science of aerodynamics but rather in the tyres and the dark art of mechanical grip. In which algorithms and alchemy, McLaren appear to have struck gold.Norris’s win at the season opener in Australiacaught the eye, not only with how much pace they showed but in how they achieved it, and it has the other teams worried.Eddie Jordan was one of F1’s biggest characters, we’re all going to miss him | Johnny HerbertRead moreIn qualifying they were comfortably ahead, four-tenths up on nearest rival Max Verstappen. On fragile, soft rubber,McLarenwere notably able to keep leaning on their tyres in the last sector of the lap, the point when the rest were losing grip with overheating, worn rubber.During the stable part of the race, when the rain eased and conditions were equal, Verstappen was able to stay with the McLarens for 16 laps but as his intermediate rubber gave out, he was left flailing, dropping back from five seconds to 15 in just eight laps. But for the rain and the intervention of safety cars, McLaren might have had more than 30 seconds on the field.This then was clear, while the McLaren is undoubtedly a fast car aerodynamically, with strong downforce – the usual indicator of a dominant ride – it also enjoys an extra edge in being easier on its tyres than the opposition. A crucial factor that allows the drivers to push harder for longer to exploit their strong aero.View image in fullscreenThe innovative design of the front brake ducts on the McLarens could be what is giving them such an advantage.Photograph: Xinhua/REX/ShutterstockThat key factor was acknowledged by McLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella. “We saw that the car interacts with the tyres very well,” he said. “We were able to open a gap which I don’t think is the car itself only, it is also how gentle our car is on the tyres.”That tyres play such a pivotal role is not new, indeed it has been a feature of the last two decades in F1. When they were brought in as F1’s sole supplier, Pirelli were given the task of manufacturing tyres that would degrade with use to impose a strategic element into the racing, by employing different compounds and ensuring pit stops had to be taken. Degradation, often depending on car and driving style, leading to tyre management phases – which drivers intensely dislike – meant an integral part of the game became how the cars work their tyres.How quickly they can be brought up to operating temperature, how hard they have to be worked to do so, how easily they stay in that window, all play into the rate and attrition of said degradation and therefore the mechanical grip they enjoy can become a key differentiator. Simply put, cars that are easier on their tyres can push harder for longer before the performance falls away.Melbourne was a case in point for McLaren, who may have made a significant break from the rest of the paddock in this field. Most notably, they appear to have achieved this feat with almost no compromise, an almost unheard of sweet spot. Usually cars that enjoy longevity in their tyres struggle to warm them up, leaving them vulnerable over a single lap in qualifying, in the cold and at starts and restarts. The McLaren does not appear to suffer from this and it has not gone unnoticed.“What’s quite strange is that they enjoy great warmup, but also very low degradation,” the Red Bull team principal Christian Horner observed in Australia. “Usually one comes at the expense of the other.”“Strange” may imply that he believes they may somehow be pulling a fast one but equally McLaren might just be ahead of the game. The sophisticated design of the car’s front brake ducts has been noted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It appears the McLaren may be cleverly channelling the brake ducts to aid this process, putting them into a commanding position.While Norris failed to take pole for sprint qualifying in China on Friday he did make an error on his final lap. NonethelessLewis Hamilton for Ferrari was very quick for pole, suggesting McLaren’s advantage is not yet quite written in stone.Pirelli have indicated teams are still coming to terms with how this year’s new rubber compounds perform, that the gaps between opposing outfits are very small and that minor adjustments in setup and balance will allow McLaren’s rivals to enjoy a strong tyre performance window. Certainly Ferrari consider the gap in Melbourne was far from representative.For now then, they believe McLaren do not yet hold all the cards. A dry race on Sunday in Shanghai will certainly paint a clearer picture but if Norris and Piastri do have a significant advantage again in race pace then expect everyone to be taking a long old look at how they can find more from their “boots” before the season is entirely beyond them.Explore more on these topicsMcLarenFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Away from the track he has celebrated the birth of his son, Azaire. On it, the ­swashbuckling 23-year-old has added a global title to hisEuropean indoor crown over 60mafter claiming gold in Nanjing in a thrilling finale on the ­opening day of the World Athletics indoor championships.So who is Kirsty Coventry, who now has global sport’s most powerful job? | Sean IngleRead moreHe joins Richard Kilty, Dwain Chambers and Jason Gardener as British winners over the distance. In a final where there appeared to be no clear favourite, Azu delivered when it mattered most with an imperious run, holding his form to equal his ­personal best of 6.49 sec and ­narrowly edge out Australia’s Lachlan Kennedy, who ran 6.50. South Africa’s Akani Simbine was third.In just a handful of seconds, Azu’s career – and perhaps his life – changed for ever. He got quicker through the heats, culminating in a magnificent run in the final. He spent much longer circling the track soaking up the ­adulation of the crowd and then the emotion began to pour out.“I was emotional before the final with my coach … the last two years have been very difficult for me,” Azu said, ­referencing his decision to relocate back to the UK from Italy and reunite with his old coach, Helen James. “I’ve been reflecting and it’s important to surround yourself with people who believe in you and who care about you.”Azu will now turn his attention to the outdoor world championships in Tokyo this summer over 100m. The eyes of the world will be watching one of athletics’ fastest-rising stars. “I said at the Europeans I wanted to take over the world. This is just the start. The plan is to keep on winning. The sky is the limit.”Britain look handily placed to ­challenge for medals elsewhere across the weekend after the ­opening day of the championship with two fantastic redemption tales. Away from Azu, Georgia Hunter Bell ensured her spot in Sunday’s 1500m final with a straightforward qualification through her heat.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Jeremiah Azu crosses the line to win the 60m final in Nanjing.Photograph: Tingshu Wang/ReutersThe Olympic bronze medallist was the overwhelming favourite at the European championships in ­Apeldoorn butan ear infection led to her missing out on the medalsaltogether. But Hunter Bell cruised through her heat here with the fastest time of ­anyone on the day, 4:09:21, to set up a medal opportunity later this weekend.“I had all the emotions last week, but the best thing I could do is come back and be as strong as possible,” she said. “Heats can be nervy: there’s no room for error, so it’s good to get out and get the job done.” Britain’s Revée Walcott-Nolan, who came third in Apeldoorn, finished fifth in her heat and failed to qualify.Amber Anning shrugged off the ­disappointment of her ­disqualification in Apeldoorn by delivering a statement run to book her place in the final of Saturday’s ­women’s 400m. Anning had ­qualified for the final of the Europeans in an ­impressive 51.01 before a lane infringement ended her medal hopes. However, she delivered an even more impressive display on the opening day in Nanjing, running 50.79sec – the only woman to break 51 sec in the heats. She undoubtedly enters the final as favourite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was just about getting a clean race today but I’m excited to have another opportunity to get on the podium.”The star attraction of the ­championship is Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen, and his quest to become only the second man to win 1500m and 3,000m gold at the same world indoors began with minimal fuss as he coasted through his 1500m heat to advance to Sunday’s final.Ingebrigtsen, who won gold in the 1500m in Apeldoorn, will now attempt to emulate Haile ­Gebrselassie by winning double gold. He will line up in the 3,000m final in Saturday’s evening session in Nanjing, while Britain’s Neil Gourley will join the Norwegian in the 1500m final after running 3:36.60 to win his heat on Friday.“I’m glad I stuck to the plan and it worked well,” Gourley said. Britain’s Adam Fogg came last in his heat. The other gold medals on day one went to South Korea’s Woo Sang-hyeok in the men’s high jump, Canada’s Sarah Mitton in the shot put and Finland’s Saga Vanninen in the pentathlon, with Ireland’s Kate O’Connor taking silver.Explore more on these topicsSportAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Who says cards with a rigged deck isn’t an Olympic sport?Marina HydeThe Zimbabwean has global sport’s top job but Britain’s Sebastian Coe was snubbed, and with good reason: he might have changed thingsFri 21 Mar 2025 10.36 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 11.47 EDTShareCongratulations to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on thesurprise election of its new president, Kirsty Coventry, confirming its status as one of the few electorates on Earth never to have had a change election. Another one is Fifa, with those two organisations’ eternal contest to be the worst-run governing body remaining easily the hardest-fought rivalry in world sport.Yes, the IOC has been in its 144th special session to elect a new leader. Don’t worry – it hasn’t been all hard beds, spartan canteens and bad lighting, as is inflicted on the poor old cardinals in Conclave. The three-day event inevitably took place at a five-star luxury Greek resort.Much can and is being made of Coventry being the first woman and the first African to win the role with 49 votes, while much less, as usual, will be made of the opaque backroom politics that saw her blow rival candidates including the World Athletics president, Seb Coe, out of the water, with voting unexpectedly not even having had to proceed to multiple rounds. Coe finished third with only eight votes, a full 20 behind the second-placed Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. Quick primer: Juan’s the son of Juan Antonio Samaranch, himself a former IOC president, whose final act in the top job was to elevate his son to the committee. Very sporting. Juan Sr came via an impeccable IOC pedigree, of course, having previously served as a sports administrator under an actual fascist regime – in his case, that of General Franco in Spain. His tenure is notable for probably the worst corruption scandal in Olympic history. Or rather, let’s face it, the worst that we know about.So close, Juan Jr! Alas, the IOC presidency going semi-hereditary might have been a bad look too far for the outgoing president, Thomas Bach. Either way, for whatever reason, Coventry’s candidacy wasreportedly pushed hardin the very final stages by Bach and various other top IOC bigwigs. Bach has personally appointed more than two-thirds of the electorate, and was voted in as the still-powerful honorary president on the same day as Coventry’s victory. As the Olympic motto famously runs: citius, altius, status quo.Needless to say, Bach wasn’t a fan of Coe’s criticism of the secretive election process. “There is a good democratic rule, when you don’t win,”he said. “Don’t blame the voters and don’t blame the procedure.” Hmm. Not sure quite how pristine a democracy a meticulously assembled band of royals, international businesspeople, politicians and select former athletes is, particularly the ones flown in from autocracies. But look, I hope they enjoyed this election, and at some point might even consider the idea of having free and fair ones in their own countries.Zimbabwe, where Coventry is a sports minister, might be a case in point, with President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s 2023 election victory characterised by brutal suppression of civil and political rights. Asked during her campaign how she could square her close ties with him, with evenFifa having banned Zimbabwe from international fixturesover government interference in the national game, Coventry explained: “It gets criticised, and that’s OK, because at the end of the day, I don’t think you can stand on the sidelines and scream for change. I believe you have to be seated at the table.”In fact, that might have been the most opinion-adjacent opinion she voiced during the entire election, where her answers tended toward the radioactively inoffensive. Asked, for instance, how she’d bring something new, she replied: “Just the fact that I am running is a huge achievement. Now, we’ll see how the next few days unfold, but I’m looking forward to what comes next.”So who is Kirsty Coventry, who now has global sport’s most powerful job? | Sean IngleRead morePlenty more of that, which makes her pledge to protect the female category in sport with “a bit more of a leading role” one to watch. Pushed on this headline issue in the wake of her victory, Coventry explained: “We’re going to create a taskforce that’s going to look at the transgender issue and the protection of the female category.” What do we want? Taskforces to be created! When do want them? In due course!Part of the IOC’s trouble with Coe, who ran on a platform stating that theIOC should ban transgender athletesin the female category in the interests of sporting fairness, is that he does things. His time at the helm of World Athletics saw him found a fully independent anti-doping and sporting integrity unit, rule decisively on the protection of the female category, and ban Russian athletes – the latter being something that seems to have earned him the permanent enmity of Bach. What’s a little light land invasion between friends – especially rich despotic friends? Remember: the IOC and Fifa need autocracies, with the massive financial outlay that any modern sporting mega event requires really only making sense politically for corrupt and autocratic regimes that wish to make a certain statement to the wider world. It’s why they’re having the next summer Olympics in the US. I’m joking, I’m joking.Still, Coe’s decisive loss yet again confirms of the IOC that you can’t win as an outsider in an insider’s race. It’s not that he’s an unknown quantity, more that he’s a known quantity. They certainly can’t be risking a new broom, after all, just as they couldn’t risk looking too hard into a quite staggering array of vote-buying/bribery/corruption/doping/political/sportwashing scandals down the decades. Once you realise that the one thing sport’s biggest wigs really hate is a sporting chance, it all becomes so much easier to understand.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For decades, if not centuries, and always imperfectly, the US offered itself to the world as the guarantor of democracy and the land of the free. Now that it’s pivoting away from that job description, there’s an opportunity for someone else to step in.The evidence that the US is moving, even galloping, away from basic notions of democracy and freedom is piling up. Just because the changes have happened so fast doesn’t make them any less fundamental. We now have a US administration that blithelyignores court rulings, whose officials say out loud“I don’t care what the judges think”. In a matter of weeks, it has become an open question whether the US remains a society governed by the rule of law.In the name of defeating “woke” and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, even historic efforts to advance civil rights are disdained or banished into the memory hole: this week itemergedthat an army webpage celebrating Harry Truman’s 1948 order to integrate the military had disappeared, along with several others honouring distinguished Black soldiers. When asked about it, the press secretary at the Pentagon said: “DEI is dead at the defense department.” As for the Department of Education, this week Trumpmoved to abolish it altogether.But if the US is being upended by the Trump hurricane, so is everywhere else in its path, including those places that once looked to the US with admiration. We can all see the coercion of Ukraine into accepting a supposed peace that will require it to surrender its territory to Vladimir Putin and itsminerals to Trump. Less visible is the way in which the scything of the US federal government by Trump and Elon Musk is aiding Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s most vulnerable people – its children.Among the US projects cut is a state department initiative to collect evidence of Russian war crimes, includingthe abduction of more than 20,000 Ukrainian children, many of them sent to Russia for forced adoption. Now there are fears that that information, which might have helped find the children and eventually reunite them with their parents, has been lost, destroyed by the Musk chainsaw. Captain America thought he was a superhero; turns out he’s the villain’s accomplice.Europe doesn’t need Trump to form a western alliance – and one is already taking shape | Martin KettleRead moreNow it is those contemptuous of democracy who look to the US for inspiration. This week,Benjamin Netanyahu broke a ceasefirehe had agreed with Hamas, resuming devastating airstrikes on Gaza, killing hundreds of Palestinians, in part because he doubtless presumed Trump would give him no grief. But he alsosacked the independent-minded head of Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, the Shin Bet, the latest move in his ongoing attempt to remove every legal or constitutional constraint on his power. If that reminds you of someone, there’s good reason. “In America and in Israel, when a strong rightwing leader wins an election, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people’s will,”Netanyahu tweetedon Wednesday. “They won’t win in either place! We stand strong together.” Trump’s authoritarian power grab is providing cover for others to do the same.This new role for the US, as a beacon of anti-democracy, is having some unintended consequences. Canada was on course to elect a Conservative government; now, by way of a backlash, the Liberals under Mark Carney lookset to ride an anti-Trump wave to victory. However it operates, Trumpism is becoming a key determinant of politics the world over.Perhaps especially in Britain. For most of the last century, the US has been Britain’s foremost ally. Put more baldly, London has all but relied on Washington for its own defence. Britain’s military and intelligence systems are intricately integrated with those of the US; its nuclear capability is not operationally independent. These last two months, it has become obvious that that is no longer sustainable: Britain cannot rely on a US that behaves more like an enemy than a friend.That, in turn, creates a new political fact – we are in an age of rearmament – that will be the organising principle of Rachel Reeves’s spring statement next week. It will require either deep cuts or new taxes. Trump has scrambled Britain’s finances.By itself, that represents a monumental change. But it won’t end there. Almost everything we do will need to be rethought. Much of that is cause for alarm – how can Nato function when its mightiest member has become an adversary? – but it also creates opportunities for Britain, if we are only willing to seize them.Take, as just one example, Trump’s war on science. The US has long been the world leader in almost every field of research. But Trump and Musk are slashing or closing one research hub after another, whether at the National Institutes of Health or theEnvironmental Protection Agency, which could lay off thousands of talented scientists. The administration is threatening academic freedom, forcing US universities tobendto Trumpism or lose funding. This week, a French scientist travelling to the US for a conference wasdenied entrybecause, according to the French government, his “phone contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration’s research policy”. You read that right: the man was subjected to a random check at the airport, US officials went through his laptop and phone, found private messages speaking ill of the president and sent him back home.This is an opening for Britain, which should be promoting itself as a haven for free, unhindered scientific inquiry. The EU has already spotted the chance, and is devising aplan to lure US scholars. But the UK has the advantage of the English language; it should be first in line. Some see the opportunity, but sadly the UK government is not among them: petitioned to reduce upfront visa costs for overseas scientists, which is an average of 17 times higher than for comparable countries,ministers this week said no.But science is only one area where Britain could be taking up the slack. Trump issilencing the Voice of Americaand Radio Free Europe: the BBC should be given the relatively modest funds required to step in and do the job instead, thereby boosting British soft power at a stroke.The first step is understanding that the world has changed and that the old shibboleths no longer apply. It’s absurd that Britain, home toEurope’s biggest arms industry, is, thanks to Brexit, shut out of thenew €150bn (£125bn) EU defence procurement fund, the latest example of how standing apart from its neighbours amounts to reckless folly in the Trump era.What the moment calls for is great boldness. It means Keir Starmer having the courage to tell the country that everything has changed and that we will have to change, too. Yes, that will involve painful sacrifices to pay for rearmament, and the breaking of political taboos, including listening to themajority of Britonswho tell pollsters it’s time we rejoined the EU.It adds up to a vision of aEuropethat includes Britain, stepping into the space the US is vacating, guaranteeing and promoting free speech and democratic accountability at the very moment the US is abandoning those ideals. Trump has blasted the door open. All we have to do is walk through it.On 30 April, join Jonathan Freedland, Kim Darroch, Devika Bhat and Leslie Vinjamuri as theydiscuss Trump’s presidency on his 100th day in office, live at Conway Hall London, and live streamed globally.

The UK must not be an ally to further atrocitiesShaima Al-Obaidi is a senior media manager at Save the Children UKFri 21 Mar 2025 12.15 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 12.18 EDTShareWhen I was woken up in the middle of the night on Tuesday by the roar of airstrikes and blaring ambulance sirens, I quickly realised that, once again, Israeli forces wereunleashing hell on Gaza. It was a night of terror, but one that is all too familiar for Gaza’s children and families after 16 months of war. A reported174 childrenwere killed – one of the largest child death tolls in a single day.Events have escalated rapidly since then. The attacks persist, and Gaza is once again divided. The Israeli military has imposed restrictions,blocking accessto northern Gaza from the south. More than 50 of my colleagues in the north now confront the choice of staying to face tanks and bullets or leaving their homes with barely a moment to process their losses.This resurgence of violence is a devastating setback for families who had just begun to find hope after an eight-week pause in the bombardment. Many hadreturned to the northto see what was left of their homes. Parents were starting to get treatment for their malnourished children and focus on their own health. For the first time in a long while, people could grieve their lost loved ones – moments they had missed while simply trying to survive.I arrived in Gaza shortly after the pause in hostilities took effect on 19 January. I felt a whirlwind of emotions: gratitude for the chance to make a difference, but also a deep fear that the pause could collapse at any moment. I had prepared myself for the worst. The images from Gaza flooding social media had been horrific, but the reality on the ground was even worse. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. As I arrived, the bus we were on drove through asea of rubble– nothing was left standing. No buildings. Just endless destruction.How can the world allow this to happen? Entire families wiped out. Parents burying their children; others unable to even do that because their children are buried under rubble.Aid workers killed. Hospitals and schools destroyed. Health professionals forced to treat the injured without basic supplies. The headlines of the past 16 months showed that my government – the UK government – along with other western leaders, stood by,complicit in the suffering. I never knew politics could be so cold, so indifferent to human life.What struck me the most were the children. These children had no shoes, no coats, no protection from the bitter weather. Despite everything, there was a strange kind of resilience. They laughed, they played and they ran barefoot through the rubble. I tried to convince myself that maybe they had found a way to live amid the nightmare.For the past six weeks, I have spent time speaking to families supported by Save theChildren. I have heard heartbreaking stories. Every family I have met has been displaced, some up to 20 times. They have all faced food shortages. Some children have lost up to 15kg in weight due to relentless hunger. Some have been forced to eat animal feed just to survive. Some are so traumatised from the sight of death and losing loved ones that they suffer involuntary urination or scream out during nightmares. Families have lost everything they once owned.Some felt hopeless, believing thatGazawould never be the same again. One mother said, “Look at the destruction. How can it ever be rebuilt?” Yet there were those who remained strong, with optimism that was contagious. One man said to me, “What is life if we don’t have hope?” Another mother told me, “We will rebuild Gaza. Our children will make it better than ever.”Netanyahu is waging war on Gaza and on us – his ‘enemies within’. It’s the path to autocracy | Aluf BennRead moreI believed her when I met two sisters supported through Save the Children’s education programme. With everything collapsing around them, they still dared to dream. Their smiles radiated hope, and their eyes lit up with excitement as they spoke of their aspirations. A few days later, I met a nine-year-old girl in the same programme. A shrapnel wound had destroyed part of her skull, leaving only a dressing and a bandage around her exposed brain. Her parents were desperate to have her evacuated for medical care that doesn’t exist in Gaza. Initially, doctors told them her chances of survival were slim, and if she did survive she would probably be paralysed and unable to speak. It’s almost unbelievable, then, that she walks, demonstrates incredible intelligence and speaks with confidence. She wants to be a teacher, so she can teach others how to rebuild Gaza.These girls, along with thousands of other children and their families, live in ill-equipped tents, with only the bare minimum for survival. Humanitarian aidstopped enteringGaza at the start of this month, and families are again being pushed to the brink. Now, it is theholy month of Ramadan, a time when Muslims gather with family and loved ones. For a second year, people in Gaza have set up empty seats around makeshift tables.As war resumes, so does the death sentence for Gaza’s children. A ceasefire is the only way to shield them from further physical and mental devastation. No child should ever have to look into their parents’ eyes and beg: “Promise me I won’t die.” No child should ever have to sift through ruins, desperately searching for the lifeless bodies of the ones they loved. No child should ever feel so abandoned, so unseen, that they believe their life holds no value at all.The UK government has to do better than this. It must not be an ally to further atrocities. Every moment of inaction is another moment where hope slips further away. I have asked countless families what message they would send to the world if they could. The answer has simply been that they want to live. This is not only a call for help. It is a plea for the most basic of human rights: the right to live without fear.Shaima Al-Obaidi is a senior media manager at Save the Children UK, specialising in reporting on children impacted by conflict.

She went to bed as usual last Tuesday, the care home staff got her up to help her to the bathroom in the night and then early in the morning heard she was having breathing difficulties. She died not long after. There can’t be many 101-year-olds whose deaths are described as unexpected by the doctors.To the last, she took us all by surprise. Rosemary was one of the last of her generation. She served as a Wren in the war and was strafed by a German fighter plane in Portsmouth during an air raid while walking home. She could vividly describe the sound of the bullets hitting the tarmac and the houses as she tried to dive for cover. After the war, against her parents’ wishes, she took herself off to music college in London to study piano before marrying my dad, a naval officer who had also fought in the war. They had three children, Veronica and Sue, my two elder sisters, and me. They were ridiculously proud of us all and stood by me even when nearly everyone else had given up. In the early 60s, Rosemary wasn’t wholly delighted to find herself in the role of vicar’s wife after my dad switched career and went on to become a marriage guidance counsellor and supervisor. She also, along with my dad, became a founder member of the Social Democratic party.Her last eight years were painful as she suffered from Alzheimer’s. It was hard to know which was worse, the brief moments of lucidity when she was clearly terrified of the person she had become, or the longer moments of confusion when her memory failed her. It felt as if what made Rosemary Rosemary had already died and I feel bad that I couldn’t have been a better son to her in her final years. The staff at the home and my sisters were nothing short of heroic. My mum couldn’t have got better care and she insisted on carrying her Guardian around in her bag even though she no longer looked at the paper. It was her routine. She once mistook me for an MP; something that horrified me as much as it would them. Now we’ve lost her again. Her body has caught up with her mind. I thought I was ready for her death but I’ve been blindsided. I’m glad her suffering is over but I feel guilty about the conversations we never had. The conversations we couldn’t have. I love you, Mum.TuesdayWhisper it softly, but there may just have been a mutual falling out between Donald Trump and Nigel Farage. Assuming they were close in the first place. It seems to be The Donald who began the conscious uncoupling. In the past, Nige had always been keen to talk up his proximity to the US president – at one time he was even suggesting himself as the next ambassador to the US – but of late he’s gone quiet. Not even posting a photograph of the two of them together. Presumably because no such photos exist. Nige didn’t even get an invitation to the inauguration. Now Trump is in the White House, he’s got more important people to hang out with. Poor Nigel. All he gets to do is bea useful idiot on the fundraiser circuit. Or maybe not. Farage may be counting his blessings that he isn’t on such good terms. Trump’s fondness for Vladimir Putin isn’t exactly a vote winner.Still, being dumped clearly still rankles. You could tell by his reaction to questions at a Reform press conference in central London this week. Farage got visibly tetchy when asked about Elon Musk’s suggestion that he was past it and that Rupert Lowe would make a better party leader. “Boring”, “Good”, he snapped, talking over the female journalist. There is only room for one prima donna in Reform and that’s Nigel. Which is why Lowe has had the whip suspended for alleged bullying behaviour. The press conference was also notable for Farage complaining that the media had not done more to investigate the behaviour of Reform supporters who he said had made Islamophobic and racist remarks about the party chair, Zia Yusuf. This must be the first time Nigel has admitted his party has a problem with racism. Perhaps he has forgotten that the Reform MP Lee Anderson was suspended from the Tory party for refusing to apologise for remarks about Sadiq Khan which the London mayor described as “Islamophobic, anti-Muslim and racist”.WednesdayThings get worse. We also found out this week that our much loved dog, Herbert Hound, has prostate cancer. We first noticed something was wrong at Christmas when he started peeing blood. But he responded well to antibiotics so we hoped it was just a urinary infection. Then, a couple of weeks ago, we saw that he appeared to be in pain and had trouble walking. This time, we hoped it might either be a recurrence of his cruciate ligament problems that healed themselves or that he had twisted his spine when jumping down from the sofa. But an ultrasound scan on Monday revealed the cancer. The treatment is now palliative. We believe his life to be measured in months, not years.But we live in hope. He has responded so well to the antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and painkillers that sometimes he seems almost like his old self. Nagging to be taken out for walks, thrilled to see us and wolfing down his food. Today he even managed to jump up on the bed for the first time in ages. So perhaps we are being too pessimistic.Herbie is 13 and a half years old and I like to think he chose us every bit as much as we chose him. When we went to visit the litter of cockapoo puppies in Essex all those years ago, he raced up to me, rolled over on to his back and demanded to have his tummy rubbed. He was irresistible then and he still is now. He has also led a full life. There aren’t many dogs that have had a book written about them –Taking the Lead– and he has just about forgiven me for trivialising his vital work in government over the past 10 years. But far more important than advising various prime ministers has been Herbie’s ability to give and receive love. The world is a far better place for him having been in it. We will continue to do whatever it takes to keep him comfortable and happy for as long as possible. May he die as well as he has lived.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forgive me for not feeling the joy. On top of everything going on at home we have a war going on in Ukraine, and Israel hasresumed its bombardment of Gaza. Trump has discovered that ending hostilities isn’t quite as simple as concluding a business deal. Global diplomacy seemingly has its limits. Nor is there much happiness to be found in football. A Newcastle supporting friend who was on her way down to London for the Carabao Cup final last Sunday found herself behind the Spurs team bus on the M1. That explains a lot.Spurs were nowhere to be seen at Craven Cottagewhere they were supposed to be playing Fulham on the same day. We’ve given up trying in the Premier league and I’m committed to at least four more home games on my season ticket. Nor can I even get much pleasure from schadenfreude these days. It’s tempting to try to enjoy Elon Musk losing $100bn off the Tesla share price, except it’s clear he doesn’t care. He’s still got far more than he can possibly spend in a dozen life times and all he wants is attention. Which he gets in abundance.Talking of having it all, the former Vanity Fair business feature writer Bryan Burrough has written a review of Graydon Carter’s memoir of his time editing the magazine in the Yale Review. In it, he describes just what it was like working for Vanity Fair. Burrough got paid $498,000 for six months’ work a year, writing just three 10,000-word articles. If his pieces got optioned for the movies, he collected the advance. Better still, he could put any catered dinner parties on expenses, as well as being given a present on his birthday. When travelling to London he was put up in a suite at Claridge’s. In Sydney, he had a view of the Opera House from his room in the Four Seasons. Understandably, Burrough says it is hard to be motivated to write for other magazines now he – and Carter – have left Vanity Fair. Now that’s a lifestyle I might be able to get behind.FridayDuring my recent holiday, I was invited to Adelaide in Australia to talk at their annual writers’ week. As you might have expected, it was a wonderful experience. Apart from the flights, which were brutal. But the chance to meet so many great writers, public intellectuals and politicians was unforgettable and the hospitality was out of this world. Great food and kindness everywhere. My only regret was that I never left the central business district as I had events every day. If I ever get the opportunity to return I will make sure I stay on for another few days – or longer – to explore beyond the city.What made the festival more special was that almost every event was free. All the audience had to do was stroll down to the botanical gardens and show up. Because the weather is so nice, all events take place outside and there are no real constraints on numbers. Even though I’m hardly well known in Australia, I still got large crowds. Also, as well as having private commercial sponsors, the Adelaide festival gets substantial financial support from the state government. South Australia recognises there is huge value in its citizens taking part in an exchange of ideas and cultures. It wants people to go along regardless of their ability to pay. As far as I am aware, there is nothing like this on the UK circuit. Book festivals try to keep ticket prices as low as possible to encourage as many people as possible to come, but almost nothing is free. Talking of which, I am doing a sold-out show in Henley tonight. But there are still tickets for my events in Hedge End and Stowmarket next weekend, and at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London next month. Please do come.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekNigel FarageDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

It is a stain Labour may never be rid ofFri 21 Mar 2025 07.23 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 12.07 EDTShareWrong, badly wrong, and it won’t easily, if ever, be forgotten or forgiven.To take £5bn from those with the least, disability claimants already well below the median income who are clustered in the poorest towns, will leave a lasting scar on Labour’s reputation.Sending Labour ministers out on the airwaves to defend the indefensible has been like sending lambs to the slaughter. The welfare secretary, Liz Kendall, and the employment minister, Alison McGovern, used to speak with passion about their optimistic plans for the future of work – but they never meant £5bn cuts. Torsten Bell, the treasury minister, is fresh from heading the Resolution Foundation with its myriad reports on reducing poverty and inequality, but he had to back£5bn cuts on Newsnight. Stephen Timms, social security and disability minister at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), is one of the most thoughtful and knowledgable ministers about social security. He surely never intended this, yet he too was sent out on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Rachel Reeves was a Keynesian, not originally a cutter, but the Treasury is good at frightening the life out of chancellors, and was likely induced to stick to her iron fiscal laws with threats of a Truss crash. Withdeeper cuts expected, and some departments losing up to 7% of their budget, you can expect no spring in the step of Labour ministers after next week’s spring statement.A woman called Emma recently contacted me. Do I remember her? How could I forget, although it’s 13 years since I visited her in Horsham, West Sussex,back when the then Tory work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, was inflicting savage disability cuts. Hers is one of those stories of misfortune and fortitude that stays in your memory with “there but for the grace of God” admiration.Here’s what I wrote thenabout her life with three hyperactive disabled children living in a two-bedroom home: “Rhys, six, is in special school, a child with no sense of danger, on impulse throwing himself down stairs, pulling furniture down on top of himself or hurtling into the road regardless of traffic. Outside he needs a wheelchair. Barely speaking, he eats with his hands, smearing food everywhere and he needs Ritalin to manage at school. He wakes at 4am every morning and has to be watched every waking minute from then on … Martyn, seven, manages in mainstream school with a teaching assistant to help: he bounces about the sitting room with the youngest, Caitlin. She has just had a heart operation, wears a hearing aid and, aged three, hardly talks, so she starts in special school soon.”Emma told me then that if she had understood what the autism diagnosis meant for her first two, she never would have risked having a third. As often in families under stress of disabilities, her marriage has broken up since we met.Now Emma herself uses a wheelchair, as she has severe rheumatoid arthritis, so she relies on her personal independent payment (Pip). Without it to pay for her car and her wheelchair she couldn’t have travelled to her beloved but low-paid job as an NHS administrator for the past four years. All three of her children are now on Pip: Martyn, 21, is holding down a job in WH Smith but needs support; Caitlin uses a wheelchair, and is still at school. Rhys needs the most help – after leaving his special school at 19, he’s now at college on an independent life skills course. “He has just learned to cross the road safely. The jobcentre took one look at him and said he couldn’t be there unaccompanied, so I don’t think an employer would look at him. I hope one day he might volunteer somewhere,” Emma said. The prospect of what will happen if her family lose their benefits has given her panic attacks. Rhys gets £800 a month: “He really needs that to get him to college, for his lunches, his phone, his basic needs. Buthe’s not 22so he’ll lose that. He’ll be on about £300 a month universal credit, and we won’t manage.” Together, the family stands to lose thousands.Although Emma is assessed with “ongoing” needs, she fears she faces another test. To keep her Pip, she needs to score four points for any one incapacity. “I have 13 points, but only twos or threes for any one activity,” she told me. Here’s how it works: anyone needing help to dress or wash their lower body (two points), help to manage incontinence (two points), help to bath or shower (three points), help to cut up their food (two points). Emma doesn’t have four points for any single one of her needs. And some imagine that the benefits system is too lax.“Keir Starmer came to our hospital once and said hello when I was at work. He seemed a nice bloke,” she said. “I wouldn’t expect him to do something like this.” Yet here we are, back in Duncan Smith territory. When Labour said “no return to austerity”, it only meant no return to austerity as severe as the George Osborne era at its worst.The original plans Kendall and McGovern used to talk about were all to do with support, encouragement and training for good jobs with good prospects – not any old job – with highly skilled work coaches offering face-to-face personal help. Kendall will still have £1bn to do some of that New Deal programme that worked for the last Labour government. The focus will be on thosealmost 1 million Neets, the young not in jobs or education, need a big support programme. But there’s an irony in that £5bn cut: that number is almost exactly the sum in 1997 that Gordon Brown seized in awindfall on privatised utilitiesto spend on Labour’s new deals for young people, disabled people,lone parentsand the over-50s: it was spent with singular success in getting people into jobs. This time, analysts say that £5bn cut will get relatively few off benefits while mostly inflicting a brutal hit on families such as Emma’s. And no, benefits tests have not got easier: the Joseph Rowntree Foundation points to a higher rate of refusals over the past five years.Why do this? Spending on working-age adult benefits, at about 5% of GDP, has changed little intwo decades. A third of the growth over the past five years is due to the rise in pension age, with disabled older people claiming while they wait. The government could instead redistribute triple-locked pensions – one of the most generous welfare benefits, but the winter fuel payment row doubt deters them.Though they’re yet to see the final details of Reeves’s plan, children’s charities estimate about 100,000 more children will fall into poverty because of disability cuts in their family. Labour, so scrupulous about sticking to its fiscal responsibility straitjacket, seems less concerned about its manifesto pledge to “develop an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty” which “not only harms children’s lives now, it damages their future prospects, and holds back our economic potential as a country.”Maybe Labour’s child poverty review, due out in the summer, will reverse this backwards direction of travel. But if so, that’s no help to the million, like Emma, about to be knocked down by these cuts. Just in from work, Emma said to me: “Today I have been shaking. I have palpitations. I am tearful. I don’t know what I am going to do. I won’t be able to afford to work – we could lose everything.”Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBenefitsOpinionWelfareDisabilityLiz KendallInequalityPovertySocial exclusioncommentShareReuse this content"

When it is recklessly used as fertiliser, we are all at riskFri 21 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 12.46 EDTShareIf humanity has an epitaph, it might read something like this: “Knackered by the things we missed.” It is true that several existential threats are widely known and widely discussed. But some of the greatest dangers we face appear on almost no one’s radar.How often have you thought about this one: spreading sewage sludge on farmland? I would guess very few would include it in their top civilisational hazards. Despite the best efforts of a handful of us, it trundles on, unknown to most. Surprising as it may seem,new research suggeststhat it could help call time on us.In principle, we should return human waste to farmland, as it is rich in nutrients. But thanks to years of regulatory failure, this waste in many countries isnow contaminatedwith a vast range of toxins. Some come from runoff into the sewers: from roads, building sites, homes and commercial premises. But what we are now discovering is that a great volume of contaminants is introduced deliberately.At some sewage farms, you can witness tanker lorries queueing to offload liquid waste. In return for a fee to the water company, they can pour this effluent into the “head of the works” (the top of the sewage processing chain). Whistleblowers from the Environment Agency report that these loads arescarcely tested. The testing that does occur is often for chemicals that may damage the sewage equipment, rather than those that may poison people and ecosystems. The fees appear to create an incentive for water companies to turn a blind eye.Many of these tankers are delivering leachate from landfill sites, containing a dense cocktail of pollutants, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (Pfas, or “forever chemicals”), other persistent organic compounds, pharmaceuticals and a thick sludge of microplastics. Some tankers come from, well, who knows where? The lack of adequate testing looks like an open invitation to organised crime, which, thanks to a totalfailure of enforcement, hasnow corneredmuch of the UK’s hazardous waste disposal market. Altogether, whistleblowers estimate, in England about 1m tonnes a year of liquid effluent is dumped under this system into sewage works.Where do these toxins go? Some of them, especially the soluble compounds, will wash through the sewage plant and into our rivers and the sea. Some will be trapped in the sludge. Where does the sludge go? About 87% of it issold or given to farmersand spreadon their landas fertiliser.What does this fertiliser contain? Good question. It is tested (if at all) only forfluoride, heavy metals and bacteria. No tests are conducted for the vast majority of potential contaminants. From the government’s own,suppressed research, we know that it is likely to contain such toxins as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins, furans, benzo(a)pyrene, polychlorinated biphenyls and phthalates, many of whichbio-accumulate in the soil. A study published this month by the James Hutton Institute found that after four years of sewage sludge spreading, microplastic levels in the fields it testedrose by up to 1,450%. It also discovered that there was little reduction in the soil of microplastics dumped 22 years ago: once they arrive, they don’t leave.An investigation by the Ends Report last year found forever chemicals in the sewage sludge being sold to farmers at levels up to135 times higherthan those considered safe by scientists. Almost all the sludge samples it took had concentrations above the risk threshold. For such reasons, Switzerland and the Netherlands have banned sludge spreading.Thenew researchI mentioned at the beginning shows how microplastics absorbed by plants could severely inhibit photosynthesis, and therefore crop production. All the major sources of microplastics in farmland soils arise from breathtaking negligence. In some places, trailer loads of microplastic have beenspread deliberatelyby farmers to make the soil more friable. Some havebeen introducedto the soil in the form of pelleted fertilisers, coated with polyurethane, polystyrene, PVC, polyacrylonitrile or other synthetic polymers. Some may now come fromoxo-degradable plastic sheeting. Oxo-degradable polymers are ordinary plastics mixed with compounds which ensure they shatter into microplastics after a while, allowing farmers to plough them in when they have done their job. Such plasticsare bannedin the EU, butremain legalin the UK. Good old Brexit, eh?But the major source of microplastics in fields is likely to be sewage sludge spreading. What are the combined impacts on crops of microplastics and the many other toxic compounds in contaminated sewage sludge? Again, no one knows.At no point in the chain is adequate routine testing conducted: not of the contents of the tankers before they discharge into the sewers; not of the sludge dispatched to farms; not of the fields receiving repeated applications;not of the crops,meatandmilkcoming from those fields. But of one thing we can be sure: like the chemicals themselves, the impacts will accumulate over time.We’re facing a ‘forever chemicals’ crisis. We must stop Pfas at the sourceRead moreIf comprehensive testing of farmland is ever conducted, we could discover that large areas are now too toxic for safe food production. Even the government’sown researchwarns that the cumulative effects of these pollutants could render the soil “no longer … suitable for supporting crop growth”. We have to face this issue just as the global food system looksdangerously fragile.The legal campaignFighting Dirty, which three of us set up, sought tooblige the Environment Agencyto set a date for the proper regulation of the sewage sludge being spread on farmland. Welost our case, partly on the grounds that the Environment Agency had no duty to act without government direction, yetno such directionhad been issued. The judge also decided that contaminated sludge spreading could not be regarded as “a matter of imperative urgency”, because the Environment Agency was not treating it as such. Perhaps they make sense in law, but these grounds look to me like circular reasoning.We discovered from the court papers that the agency had pressed repeatedly for a “ministerial steer”, but was not receiving one, and that better regulation is being impeded by resistance from the water companies and the waste industry. Life is just full of surprises.The case revealed a massive loophole in the law, which the government still has failed to close. I’ve been told that officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs were crowing over the result: three cheers for mass contamination!Perhaps another epitaph would read, “Some of us tried, but no one in power would listen.” A more concise version would be, “RIP FFS.”George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFarmingOpinionPollutionEnvironment AgencyPlasticscommentShareReuse this content"

Will we take them?Sanmi KoyejoFri 21 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 10.09 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jordan Moss/The GuardianThe notion that artificial intelligence could help reduce racism might seem counterintuitive. After all, we’ve seen numerous headlines about AI systems perpetuating or even amplifying racial biases. Yet as we enter 2025, amid both a backlash against social justice initiatives and the rapid proliferation of AI technologies, an unexpected opportunity is emerging.Here’s the paradox: while few people want to be labeled racist, study after study reveal persistent racial disparities in everything from healthcare outcomes to economic opportunities. The fascinating twist? Society appears far more willing to critically examine and address bias in AI systems than confront human bias directly.Consider healthcare: many clinicians acknowledge that systemic biases disproportionately affect racial minorities, but very few will admit their own decisions might be biased. Yet systematic audits routinely uncover significant race-based disparities in treatment decisions. This points to a crucial advantage of AI systems – they’re inherently more auditable than human decision-making.This auditability creates three key opportunities. First, AI systems provide a mirror to society’s biases. When an AI makes biased decisions, it’s often amplifying patterns present in historical data – patterns created by human choices. This makes invisible biases visible and quantifiable, forcing us to confront uncomfortable truths about our institutions.Second, unlike human decision-makers who might become defensive when accused of bias, AI systems can be systematically tested, evaluated and improved. We can develop technical tools, like metric elicitation, that help stakeholders define and measure fairness in context-specific ways. This allows us to move beyond superficial “colorblind” approaches to fairness and toward more nuanced solutions that acknowledge historical inequities.Third, AI systems can help reduce the role of implicit bias in decision-making. While humans might unconsciously treat people differently based on race, properly designed AI systems can be explicitly programmed to focus only on relevant factors. This isn’t about making AI “colorblind” – rather, it’s about being intentional about when and how racial differences should inform decisions.However, realizing this potential requires careful attention to both technical and social considerations. On the technical side, we need sophisticated approaches that go beyond simple notions of fairness. For instance, in low-stakes decisions like movie recommendations, representation gaps might be the primary concern. But in high-stakes domains like healthcare or criminal justice, where systematic biases have deep historical roots, we need more nuanced approaches that actively work to correct historical disparities.On the social side, we need diverse voices involved in developing and deploying these systems. Organizations such as Black in AI are already working with institutions like the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop standards for safe and equitable AI systems. These efforts recognize that technical solutions alone aren’t enough – we need inclusive processes that engage affected communities in determining how AI systems should operate.The path forward isn’t about replacing human judgment with AI, but about using AI as a tool for creating more equitable systems. By making biases more visible and measurable, providing frameworks for testing and improvement, and enabling more intentional approaches to fairness, AI could help us build the more racially just society that has proven so elusive to achieve through human efforts alone.This potential exists precisely because AI forces us to be explicit about our values and decisions in ways that human systems often avoid. As we continue to integrate AI into crucial societal decisions, we have an opportunity to build systems that don’t just replicate our current inequities, but actively work to address them. The question isn’t whether AI will impact racial equity – it’s whether we’ll seize this moment to ensure it does so in ways that promote justice rather than perpetuate harm.Sanmi Koyejo is an assistant professor of computer science at Stanford University.

Anew reporton children’s lives since the Russian invasion was prefaced with a nursery director’s description of their response to shelling: “Some children fall to their knees – their legs do not move because they are afraid. There are no tears, no crying or screaming, the child just freezes. One child stood there holding a toy and did not let go of it all day.”These are the survivors. Hundreds of children have been killed since February 2022. Hundreds of thousands are internally displaced, and 1.7 million are refugees, many of them separated from a parent. At least 200 have been forcibly taken to Russia.Ukrainematters – not just strategically, but humanely.The US decision toterminate a programmetracking these abducted children is a telling indication of supreme carelessness or callousness about the fate of Ukraine and its people.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had previouslyobservedthat Ukraine’s agreement to a ceasefire put the onus on Russia: “If they say no, we’ll know what the impediment is to peace here.”Mr Putin offered a halt on attacks on energy infrastructure if Kyiv did the same (a gesture rather than a concession, with the winter drawing to an end) while declaring that peace would require the complete cessation of foreign military aid and intelligence provision to Ukraine. The impediment is obvious. But Mr Trump haslittle grasp of detail, his “deal-making” prowess is self-declared, and he has long been drawn to Mr Putin.Ukraine will at least be in Saudi Arabia forparallel talkswhen the US speaks to Russia next week. It has won a place at the table, or a table. But it is still on the menu. Even as Kyiv attempts to attract the US president with minerals, and avoid alienating him over issues such as his new desire totake over nuclear plants, Russia appears to be outflanking US negotiators. Moscow offers improved economic relations as if that was its gift and not its goal, and is aided by the US right’s fantasies that Mr Putin will turn his back on China. Bilateral relationsare alreadythawing.The security guarantee that Europe wanted has not materialised. If the US cuts off military aid and intelligence to Ukraine again, the consequences would be immense. But Washington can’t force Kyiv to accept a ceasefire – or force Europe to abandon Ukraine. European leaders have recognised that they may shape, but cannot determine, the actions of Mr Trump – but can decide how they respond. That is clear not only through this week’s discussions on a possible “reassurance force” in the event of a ceasefire, but more generally as Europe contemplates a future without US security assurances. Germany’sditching of the debt braketo turbocharge military spending was only the headline.Russia’s threat looms far larger for some than others. Domestic opinion and priorities vary widely. Strategically, leaders differ on whether to prioritise the building up of regional strength or shoring up transatlantic ties. They will differ too on where else to build partnerships. These questions are becoming more acute. The answers will shape the lives of coming generations well beyond Ukraine.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

All the shortlisted authors are women.Climate fiction is not new. Margaret Atwood’s MaddAddam dystopian trilogy, Cormac McCarthy’s post-apocalyptic The Road, Barbara Kingsolver’s Flight Behaviour and Richard Power’s Pulitzer-prize-winning The Overstory are just some of the landmark literary novels to have taken on the crisis. Science fiction, inevitably, has become the genre of ecological catastrophe, with hits like Kim Stanley Robinson’sThe Ministry for the Future(Barack Obama was a fan), which opens in 2025 with all the inhabitants of a small Indian town dying in a heatwave.The late Ursula K Le Guinwrotethat the job of sci-fi was “to extrapolate imaginatively from current trends and events to a near-future that’s half prediction, half satire”. The job of the realist novel is to reflect the world in which we live. For a long time, the possibilities of environmental breakdown were largely considered too wild for the realism. As a result, climate fiction hasn’t been taken seriously enough. InThe Great Derangementin 2016, Amitav Gosh argued that the failure of so many novelists, including himself, to address the most urgent issue of the age was part of a broader cultural failure at the heart of the climate crisis itself.Freakish weather events are no longer the stuff of speculative fiction –“global weirding”is upon us. What was once dubbed “cli-fi” is simply contemporary fiction. Ecological anxiety is as much a part of the fictional worlds of a young generation of novelists likeSally Rooneyas the internet and mobile phones.The novels on the ClimateFictionprize shortlist do not conform to dystopian stereotypes. Some aren’t explicitly about the crisis. Some are even hopeful. Far from being a portrait of a world ravaged by disasters, Orbital, for example, is a hymn to the awe-inspiring beauty of our planet.It could be argued that having a Booker prize winner on the shortlist suggests there is no need for a specific award, which might marginalise climate fiction as a niche genre. There is no shortage of literary gongs.The Wainwright prize, set up in 2014 to celebrate the best nature books, now includes an award for writing on global conservation.Yet awards amplify the message and reach of books that might otherwise be overlooked. Scientists have been warning about global heating’s dire consequences for decades. Governments and industry haven’t listened. Now novelists are taking up the challenge. Stories can create an impact far greater than data alone. They can inspire change. In a world where reality has become stranger than fiction, this new prize is necessary and important. There is no bigger story.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is Labour’s poll tax momentReaders share their sadness and frustration at the government’s plan to cut benefits including personal independence paymentFri 21 Mar 2025 14.02 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 14.05 EDTShareThere is no doubt that the disability benefits system is broken – but not in the ways the government suggests (Editorial, 18 March). The current system is hostile, inefficient and difficult to navigate – often worsening the physical and mental health of claimants, through energy-depleting assessment and appeal processes, gaslighting and having to fight to be seen.The government suggests that the way to get disabled people into work is to invest more in job coaches – as though the disabled community simply lack confidence to hunt for jobs. In reality, it is employers who lack confidence to take us on. To find one that can offer minimal hours (for someone with long Covid) or provide multiple sick days a month (for regular hospital visits) is almost impossible.If the government is serious about improving access to work for the disabled community,thisis where investment needs to happen. We need something like the apprenticeship scheme, whereby employers would receive financial support to employ people with limited capacity for work – providing us with a fair living wage on reduced hours. This could unlock the talents of the educated and brilliant disabled community.Name and address suppliedThese proposed changes to personal independence payment (Pip) must be opposed. I feel overwhelming anxiety whenever I get a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions. Living with epilepsy, an unpredictable, life-limiting condition, impacts every aspect of my life. My DWP daily living score reflects this; I receive 13 points and qualify for the enhanced rate of Pip. Under the proposed “four points in one category” system, I would lose my Pip entirely.About 90% of the time, I function well, but for the other 10%, I don’t know who or where I am, and am profoundly vulnerable. This reform ignores disabilities like mine where, to stay safe, I need help across the board, all the time. I support welfare reform, but not at the expense of disabled people. These proposals will have devastating effects on their lives.Jo MackenzieVentnor, Isle of WightWhy is the government waging a vindictive vendetta against disabled people? I claim universal credit and Pip. Without Pip I would become homeless. Is this appropriate for a 62-year-old who has paid taxes for over 40 years and has a body now disfigured by working on building sites? I had to wait over 18 months to receive Pip and go through hell with the DWP, which refused countless times to accept I had a long-term disability. I am now expected to find appropriate employment when I’m unable to, and will end up having to accept a low-paid, unskilled job. If I don’t, all my benefits will be stopped.Rachel Reeves, the Treasury and Liz Kendall should ask themselves why thisLabourgovernment can find £200bn for nuclear weapons, plus over £14bn extra on defence spending, but is more worried about disabled people having half a decent life with Pip payments.Mark SayersKeighley, West YorkshireThe government’s proposal torestrict the health element of universal creditfor those aged under 22 will have a devastating impact on young care leavers. These are more likely than other young people to have health conditions or disabilities due to early trauma and a care system that fails to provide the support they need. Many have no family to turn to for financial or emotional assistance.This cut will reduce their already limited incomes by nearly £5,000 a year. Without this lifeline, more young care leavers will struggle to afford essentials like food, rent and transport, increasing their risk of homelessness, mental health crises and long-term unemployment. Instead of helping them build a future, this policy will push them further to the margins of society.We urge ministers to reconsider before it causes lasting damage to some of the most disadvantaged young people in our communities.Katharine Sacks-JonesChief executive, Become charityI’m writing this as a disabled guy in his late 30s. I have now been job-hunting for 13 months since I moved closer to family, previously having worked in a part-time office job. The last few years have been challenging due to my conditions deteriorating. This means I now use a wheelchair, when I used to walk.Pip is not a means to not work. Being disabled is exhausting and it is about constantly juggling our finite energy resources with wanting to be part of society. Often this means only being able to work part-time, which doesn’t provide enough income on its own.Pip is a benefit to support the extra costs of being disabled, so we may have some quality of life. My wheelchair-accessible vehicle is expensive to run as it is a van with specialised heavy adaptations. Accessible sports are often miles away and not easily accessible by public transport. I need help cutting my nails – this costs at least £30 per session. I need a care worker to support me daily – this costs a minimum of £80 a week.This is just a small snapshot of the extra costs of being disabled. Freezing and cutting Pip means we will be going back in time and ignoring all the hard work of disability rights legislation over the years. This year is the 30th anniversary of theDisabilityDiscrimination Act – yet who has cause to celebrate?David SlaterSaffron Walden, CambridgeshireThis is going to be remembered in the same way as the poll tax for Margaret Thatcher and tuition fees for Nick Clegg.

There’s a reason that the prescribing of antidepressants is so much higher in areas where poverty is prevalent.I’m a mental health nurse in a strugglingNHS. I also struggle to make ends meet in an age where my outgoings leave me almost nothing. I pay high rent to a multimillionaire and am unable to save a penny. Nor do I really enjoy the fruits of my labour with my dependants.This means that when payday arrives each month, it is a time of anxiety, low mood and stress, because I know that I will have to juggle my budget once again and figure out ways to give my kids a good quality of life.Mental healthnurses are tasked with being “guardians of hope”, but when we see the ongoing assault on the most vulnerable, and billionaires ruling the world, it can be difficult to hold on to hope of our own.Keir Starmer is proving once again to be another strongman leader with no political will to accept the evidence and truly address the inequalities that persist and worsen.Name and address suppliedComments by the health secretary about overdiagnosis of mental health conditions may or may not be correct, but the debate about overdiagnosing people misses the point when it comes to deciding whether people are fit to work or not. I worked extensively as a mental health vocational adviser 20 years ago and was at the sharp end of assisting people with chronic mental health conditions to get back into work. It is not a matter of getting people to a position of 100% remission for them to be able to use their skills in the workplace. I helped employers identify “reasonable adjustments” that would assist employees who still had daily symptoms, but not serious enough to prevent them performing.As for treatment, I witnessed the emergence of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme, now called NHS Talking Therapies. Established on the back of theLayard reportcommissioned by the Blair government, its purpose was to get people with common mental health conditions back into the workplace. I’d like to see the data available on the efficacy of this programme, which was trumpeted as a solution to the problem that the country faced then, and is still facing today.Michael StockwellBasingstoke, HampshireDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

It won’t inhibit litigation against fossil fuel projects; we will surely see more of those as theTrump administrationadvances its ‘drill, baby, drill’ agenda.”Greenpeace must pay at least $660m over Dakota pipeline protests, says juryRead moreKevin Cramer, the US senator from North Dakota, cheered Wednesday’s huge judgment againstGreenpeaceover the pipeline protests in his state, congratulating the energy company who sued the environmental group for its big win.Justice was served, he said. “They can think twice now about doing it again,” he said of Greenpeace and other environmental groups who protested against theDakota Access pipeline.Brian Hauss, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said that the lawsuit served as a “tax on speech”, one that makes it too expensive to go against “litigious, deep-pocketed corporations”.“If companies can sue critics, advocates and protesters into oblivion for their speech and the unlawful acts of third parties, then no one will feel safe protesting corporate malfeasance,” Hauss said.In the days since the ruling was issued, environmental groups and protest movementshave reacted with shock and dismay, warning that its impact stretches far beyond any individual organization.It will chill those kinds of protests; whether the chilling goes beyond that remains to be seenMichael Gerrard, Sabin Center for Climate Change LawAmnesty Internationalsaidthe “devastating verdict sets an array of deeply damaging precedents on the rights to freedom of speech, association and peaceful protest and puts the very future of Greenpeace at risk”.Some legal expertswere surprisedthe case even made it before a jury. Similar claims often get tossed out over first amendment concerns or because many states prevent so-called Slapp suits (strategic lawsuits against public participation). North Dakota doesn’t have an anti-Slapp law.Greenpeace’s goals – such as protecting the climate and preserving oceans – won’t change, said Sushma Raman, the interim executive director of Greenpeace USA. But “it’s really going to be a question of capacity and prioritization, which happens in any organization that is facing an existential threat of this kind,” Raman said.“Ultimately, this isn’t about the money for them,” Raman said of Energy Transfer. “It’s really about sending a message, and it’s trying to silence an organization that they feel is a thorn in their side.”Energy Transfer’s CEO, Kelcy Warren, has donated millions to pro-Trump groups and given directly to the president’s campaigns over the years. He has made a mission of going after pipeline opponents, including Greenpeace, filing several lawsuits to that end.Some conservatives have celebrated his approach. Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, said it was “great news!” that the verdict could bankrupt Greenpeace. Erick Erickson, a conservative talkshow host, said Warren was his hero. “I’m a longtime shareholder of Energy Transfer and his campaign to destroy Greenpeace has been awesome to behold. God bless him,” Erickson wrote on X.Shayana “Shane” Kadidal, a senior managing attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, called to mind economic boycotts during the US civil rights movement that inflicted damage on white-owned businesses, and how those businesses retaliated with civil lawsuits against groups such as the NAACP, trying to frame their activism as a conspiracy.“Billionaire oligarchs likeElon Muskand Energy Transfer’s Kelcy Warren now pose one of the most significant risks to free speech globally,” Kadidal said.Non-profits, religious groups and others will be much more reluctant to support or organize protected protests if they face possible penaltiesInternational Center for Not-for-Profit Law analysisGreenpeace began in the 1970s with a campaign led by Canadian activists to block nuclear weapons testing on an Alaskan island, its roots based in direct action. US offshoots grew throughout that decade. It is headquartered in the Netherlands, where it has filed an anti-Slapp lawsuit against Energy Transfer.It has said it got involved in the Dakota Access protests because the tribe, the Standing Rock Sioux, asked for its help. The organization has a policy of only getting involved in Indigenous-led movements if specifically asked,the New York Times reported.Waniya Locke, of Standing Rock Grassroots, said the verdict “attempts to erase Indigenous leadership from Standing Rock’s history” and part of a “coordinated attack on communities organizing to protect their water and futures from big oil”.The Greenpeace case isn’t the only recent example of a heightened legal attack on free speech.Protesters on US college campuseshave been met withdisciplinary actionsfor supporting Palestinian human rights, the most extreme example involving the push to deport a former Columbia student,Mahmoud Khalil.

These proposals include “extreme” penalties for protest-related offenses like trespassing near a pipeline, the center notes in itsanalysis. They also call for expanded liability for organizations or individuals that aren’t directly involved in protests. “Non-profits, religious groups, and others will be much more reluctant to support or organize protected protests if they face possible penalties for the unlawful actions of others,” the center said in its analysis.The verdict is not the end for this case – Greenpeace has said it will appeal to the North Dakota supreme court. Legal experts believe the organization has a better shot on appeal, citing the jury’sties to the oil and gas industryand the broad disapproval of the protest among local residents.In the defeat, there has also been resolve.“You can’t sue or bankrupt a movement,” Raman said.Explore more on these topicsGreenpeaceDemocracy and justiceEnvironmental activismActivismProtestDonald TrumpTrump administrationOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

I feel passionately about it because I’ve had personal experience.”Maxwell Martin, whose estranged husband, the director Roger Michell – father to her daughters – died suddenly in 2021, was speaking in support ofa report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR)and the Difference education charity, published earlier this week.The award-winning actor was one of dozens of parents, teachers, school leaders, students and charities to give evidence to the report, which explores the problem of “lost learning” and outlines a plan to curb the rise in absence and exclusions and address the crisis in special needs provision.It says exclusions went up by more than a third in a single year, home education increased by 20% between 2022-23 and 2023-24, and there had been a 140% increase in the highest level of special educational needs support since 2015.Persistent absence – where a child misses 10% or more of school sessions – remains a huge concern for the education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, who has backed the continuing use of fines, which recently went up from £60 to £80.Official statisticspublished on Thursday showed one in five pupils in England were persistently absent in 2023-24, marginally down on the previous year but almost double the rates before the pandemic.“I think we need to look hard at how we make things better for children in schools. I think it needs to be a holistic approach, and certainly an inclusive approach,” said Maxwell Martin, who stressed she did not blame teachers or school leaders, but the system they worked within.“We know that excluding kids gets us nowhere as a society. It certainly doesn’t help kids, especially vulnerable kids. They need to be included in school and kept in school. Because the stats around those kids once they’re excluded are really dire, and it’s shameful for us as a society that we support that.”On non-attendance fines and threats of prosecution, Maxwell Martin said: “Those hundreds of thousands of kids who struggle to attend are dealing with a real jigsaw of difficulty, as is that family trying to support that child.“And threatening that family – especially if you think it’s a single mum or a single dad really struggling financially – and you threaten them with a fine, it’s catastrophic and it won’t bring about change.”Children’s absence was less about families going off on skiing holidays, and more to do with issues such as poverty, neurodiversity and anxiety. “I’m telling you right now they’re not skiing,” said Maxwell Martin.“We know we have all these issues. There’s no point now banging on about behaviour and behaviour tsars. You can’t teach children to behave better by making them feel shit. It doesn’t work. We need to meet their needs. We need to make them feel they have worth.”The actor said compassion was “leaching” out of schools. “When I think about kids in crisis it really upsets me. And when I think about some of the meetings I’ve been in schools, and I come out and how broken I am and how broken my child then is because it’s harder to support her.“I’m not here for my story,” she added. “I have a massive amount of privilege. I’m here because it bothers me when people have many fewer choices than I have. I want those people to feel supported and I want those children to feel valued in school.”Maxwell Martin said she would have expected a Labour government “to understand that fining vulnerable parents is cruel and idiotic, and they don’t. How’s that going to help that mum? She walks out of that meeting and she’s told there’s going to be court action from Monday if her kid’s not in.”“How’s she supposed to get them into school? Shall we think of a different way around that problem? Because that’s not the way to solve it. To me, that’s dumb.”Kiran Gill, an associate fellow at IPPR and the founder and CEO of the Difference, said: “Our education system is failing the children who need it most. Despite school leaders’ efforts, the system works against them. The consequences – rising mental health issues, youth violence, and risks to national growth – should concern us all.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “This government inherited a school system with a wide range of baked-in inequalities, and it’s clear absence is having a detrimental impact on children’s learning and their future success.“Our plan for change sets out our relentless focus on making sure every child gets the best life chances, including children with Send, which is why we are determined to improve inclusivity and expertise in mainstream schools and restore parents’ trust that their child will get the right support.”Explore more on these topicsSchool attendance and absenceAnna Maxwell MartinSchoolsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Not all the countries in the coalition will have capabilities for Ukraine but might have the capability for other deployments which would free up other nations to deploy to Ukraine.”The intensive UK planning across three days next week is likely to consider whether British troops could be moved from current deployments to support Ukraine, with troops from other nations backfilling the existing UK deployments.The plans will be discussed before a further meeting of the “coalition of the willing” – the group of countries preparing to back Ukraine – in Paris on Thursday.Starmer on Thursday met military officials from 31 countries involved in planning how the coalition of countries might work in practice to support Ukraine. Countries represented included France, Poland, the Netherlands, Romania, Canada and Australia.After the meeting, the prime minister warned Vladimir Putin hewould face “severe consequences”if he breached any peace deal.Asked whether the focus of discussions had shifted away from the prospect of ground troops for Ukraine, a No 10 spokesperson said: “No, nothing is off the table on any of these fronts, so I wouldn’t start ruling anything out.“Clearly, thousands of troops will be required to support any deployment, whether that is at sea, on land or in the air.”The Financial Times had reported on Thursday that Starmer’s focus hadshifted to air and sea support, stressing that Ukraine itself had the capability, the numbers and the frontline experience on the ground.The spokesperson said deployment would require significant support and the firming up of “basic logistics of … moving people and ensuring deployment rotations, so, as the PM said, we need to be prepared for all eventualities”.Delegations from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia on Monday for further peace talks.At the same time, European and Commonwealth allies are seeking to pressure the Russian president as he resists accepting in full a US- and Ukraine-backed deal, as well as ensuring a peacekeeping plan is in place if an agreement is reached.Moscow has agreed to pause attacks on Ukrainian power plants after a phone call between Putin and the US president, Donald Trump, but Kyiv has said civilian targets including hospitals have since been struck.Starmer was expected to have a call with non-EU countries and the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, on Friday about updates that have been discussed at EU level.Ukraine’s president, Volodymr Zelenskyy, has said he is hopeful a “lasting peace can be achieved this year” after he spoke on the phone with Trump on Tuesday, though he rebuffed a suggestion that Washington could take ownership of Ukrainian power plants to ensure their security.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryKeir StarmerUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyUrsula von der LeyenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We are continuing to gather and review evidence setting out the contact the force had and the actions and decision-making by police officers involved.“After assessment of the evidence to date, we have served disciplinary notices on four Northamptonshire police officers, two at the level of gross misconduct and two for potential misconduct. The gross misconduct notices on two detective constables cover alleged failings to progress inquiries and communicate with Ms Brella after her report of domestic abuse at the end of August 2024.“The misconduct notices on two more senior officers relate to their supervision of the case and relevant risk assessments.”Campbell said such notices advised officers they were subject to investigation and did not necessarily mean any disciplinary proceedings would follow. “At the end of the investigation, decisions will be taken as to whether any officer has a disciplinary case to answer,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He claimed it was politically motivated and affecting his mental health.The risk from other prisoners was cited in written submissions by lawyers for the justice secretary to back up the decision to locate him in a segregation unit at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes.A “lifer” in the prison planned to kill Robinson and two other prisoners plotted to attack him to gain “kudos and notoriety”, the high court was told on Thursday.Robinson is serving an 18-month sentence for contempt of court for repeating false allegations against a Syrian refugee, in breach of an injunction. He is due to be released on 25 July.In a written judgment on Friday, Mr Justice Chamberlain refused Robinson’s application, saying there was nothing to suggest that the decision to segregate him was taken for the purpose of breaking his resistance or humiliating or debasing him.He added: “On the contrary, all the evidence shows that it was taken for his own protection and in the interests of preserving the safety of other prisoners and staff. It was not mere speculation that he would be at risk from Muslim prisoners. He himself had said, when first detained at HMP Belmarsh, that he had a ‘conflict’ with the followers of Islam.”The judge referred to the specific intelligence of the threats against Robinson, including one to his life, and said a range of steps had been taken to ameliorate the impact of the prisoner’s segregation.Robinson’s mental health is being monitored by professionals from the prison’s psychology service and the NHS, and he is visited daily by an NHS doctor or nurse.His application to challenge his prison conditions has meant a separate prosecution – for allegedly refusing to comply with a search of his phone by police using counter-terrorism powers – has been delayed for months.Robinson was transferred to HMP Woodhill from HMP Belmarsh in November. The high court was told in written submissions that the transfer took place after death threats and racist abuse were directed at the Belmarsh governor, Jenny Louis, on social media and in correspondence.Explore more on these topicsTommy RobinsonPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceEnglandFar rightnewsShareReuse this content"

And tax receipts always bounce around at the start of the year because of the timing of self-assessment returns.However, theOffice for National Statisticssaid this was the fourth highest borrowing for a February since records began in 1993 – the three others occurring after the global financial crisis and during the Covid pandemic.UK borrowing graphicAfter Reeves set out her tax and spending plans in October, the OBR was expecting borrowing for the full fiscal year to be £127.5bn. But Friday’s data shows the government has already borrowed £132.2bn, with March still to go.Total public sector net debt, which ballooned during the pandemic, having already been driven up by the banking bailouts and a decade of sluggish growth, stood at 95.5% of GDP in February. As the ONS said, that was 0.1 percentage points higher than a year ago and “remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s”.Treasury insiders are fond of pointing out that this is a crucial difference between the UK and Germany – whose recent decision to ramp up borrowing to pay for defence some inLabourwould like Reeves to follow. Germany’s debt-to-GDP ratio is about 63%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves and her team are concerned that if they try to rewrite the rules for the UK, bond markets could punish the government by dumping government bonds, known as gilts, pushing up interest rates.However, while the chancellor is likely to read Friday’s figures as fresh vindication for her decision to make spending cuts next week, some analysts argue that more radical action will eventually have to be taken, given the pressing demand for defence spending and this unhappy fiscal backdrop.James Smith, an economist at the bank ING, said the February data underlined the fact that “cost-cutting can only go so far, and barring a surprise boost to UK growth this summer, we think further tax hikes look inevitable in the autumn”.Explore more on these topicsGovernment borrowingRachel ReevesEconomicsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityOffice for National StatisticsSpring statement 2025Economic policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

His evidence had been “among the most remarkable this court has ever heard”, she said.The judge told Farooq: “This was deliberately to cause maximum damage to life. But at the end, your courage failed you and the kind thoughtfulness of a passing stranger saved you and those you targeted.View image in fullscreenMohammad Farooq had been a clinical support worker at Leeds St James’s hospital.Photograph: Counter Terrorism Policing North East/PA“You were prepared to do the unthinkable. To explode a bomb in a hospital.“Your responsibility is not reduced by the fact that you lost your bottle and were persuaded, while in emotional turmoil, to stand down and let Mr Newby call the police.”Farooq’s homemade bomb was modelled on those detonated at the 2013 Boston Marathon but with twice the amount of explosives. The court heard that nearly 10kg of explosives had been put inside the pressure cooker.After the sentencing, Phil Wood, the chief executive of Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust, also praised Newby for his “courage and initiative” that day.Wood said: “Today’s sentencing helps us continue to move on from the events of that morning.“It was an extremely difficult time for staff and patients, and I remain immensely proud of the calm and professional way in which they responded on the day to keep everyone safe.”During a three-week trial at Sheffield crown court, a jury heard how Farooq was motivated by an interest in radical Islam and jihad.The prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford KC said Farooq told Newby, who was outside having a cigarette, about his grievances towards his colleagues and his plan to take the bomb into the hospital and “kill as many nurses as possible”.Although Farooq did not give evidence in his trial, his lawyers claimed he was not motivated by ideology, arguing instead that he worked at the hospital and had a long-running grievance with nurses on his ward.Bethan David, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service counter-terrorism division, said: “Examination of his electronic devices revealed a hatred towards his colleagues at work and those he considered non-believers.“The extremist views Farooq holds are a threat to our society, and I am pleased the jury found him guilty of his crimes.”Farooq admitted firearms offences, possessing an explosive substance with intent and having a document likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.He denied charges of preparing acts of terrorism but was found guilty after a trial last year.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the mole kept changing, and I know a lot about melanoma. I just felt like this mole wasn’t right.”Ryan asked the doctor to remove the mole, but he recommended sending a sample off for histology first. He then phoned her to confirm it had come back showing early melanoma.She said: “He was shocked. He’s like: ‘It doesn’t look like melanoma, but it is melanoma.’”The Big Fat Quiz of the Year star said the doctor made an appointment to remove the mole completely. She later confirmed the mole’s removal in a post on TikTok, in which she shared pictures of it and urged others to get their moles checked.Melanoma is a type of skin cancer, which can spread to other areas of the body. A new mole or a change in an existing mole can be a symptom of the condition. They are often an uneven shape with a mix of two or more colours, and moles that are sore, bleeding, itchy or crusty could be cancerous.The main cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light, which comes from the sun and is used in sunbeds.Explore more on these topicsKatherine RyanCancerComedyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The bin lorry had to leave because it was getting out of hand,” said one resident. “Then the police had to come. People are getting very frustrated.”View image in fullscreenPolice monitor union members as they delay refuse lorries attempting to leave the depot.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAnother resident posted on social media: “I’m traumatised by the behaviours I witnessed there today – it was awful and dangerous.”These pop-up household waste centres have become increasingly fraught, in the less than two weeks sinceBirmingham bin workers launched their all-out indefinite strikeover pay and restructuring plans, having been on strike sporadically since January. The bin bags have quickly piled up, and the city is already at breaking point.Preet Gill, the Birmingham Edgbaston MP, said it was becoming a “public health emergency” with residents reporting “a plague of rats and cockroaches”.Shabeena Khan, standing outside her flat near Sparkhill, contemplated the huge mound of bin bags that had built up. The pile was so big it had almost completely blocked a ground floor window of the block of six flats, and Khan estimated it had been seven weeks since it was last collected.View image in fullscreenShabeena Khan next to a pile of bin bags blocking the windows to her property.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I’ve called the council twice and they said somebody should be coming, but every day I’m waiting, crossing my fingers, and nobody has been. The bags are ripped so I’m very scared about rats,” she said. “It’s so disgusting. It’s Ramadan and we’re embarrassed to bring family and friends here. It’s very stressful and depressing.”She said she was particularly worried about the impact on her son, who has a learning disability and mental health problems, and she was trying to rally the building to chip in to pay for a private contractor to collect the bags.“How long is this going to go on for?” she asked.View image in fullscreenMaluka Skripkiuc leaves her flat past rubbish that has not been collected for weeks.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHer neighbour, Maluka Skripkiuc, said the pile had completely blocked any sunlight from coming through her bedroom window, and the smell was so bad she had moved into her son’s room.“We just have to close the door and completely seal that room off, it really smells,” she said. “It’s horrible, I’m really worried.”View image in fullscreenPolice and picket lines at a council depot in Tyseley.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianOver at a refuse depot in Tyseley, tensions continued to run high. On Tuesday, about 70 striking bin workers had gathered outside the gates on the picket line, growing increasingly frustrated by the number of police officers on the scene.The officers were guarding the gates and the bin lorries – staffed by agency workers – which continued to leave the depot, held up by the occasional “go-slow” protest by the strikers who walked slowly in front of the lorries as they began their rounds.“The way the council has handled this is very, very poor. We know it’s frustrating for the public, we all live in Birmingham too, my bin hasn’t been collected in the past two weeks,” said Steeven Biset, a striking refuse collector.“We just want to be get out there and do the job that we love. But I feel like if we don’t fight for what we believe is right, then they’ll end up taking more and more, to the point where we’ll be working for less than minimum wage.”The strikers said the Labour council’s plans to scrap the role of grade 3 waste recycling and collection officer, the person responsible for safety at the back of a bin lorry, would put workers at risk. It would also mean some workers having to take a substantial pay cut.“That person is pivotal on the back of the wagon. They’re our health and safety. As a driver, they reverse me around corners. Nobody wants a 25-tonne truck reversing around a corner with nobody watching it,” said Stephen, a bin lorry driver. “And this would take away our natural progression – you’ll come in as a grade 2, then will stay as a grade 2 for your whole career, when everything is getting more expensive.”Negotiations between the council – currently being overseen by government commissioners after it declared itself effectively bankrupt – and strikers were due to resume at the end of this week but relations have soured.Unite claimed the council sacked three agency workers for talking to strikers – which the city council has denied – and said the restructuring was part of a plan to replace directly employed staff with an “insecure agency workforce”.“The arrogance and vindictiveness of Birmingham’s commissioner-led council towards low-paid hard-working refuse workers is astounding,” Unite boss Sharon Graham said.The city council has been urging residents to leave rubbish out as normal and insisted enough agency-staffed lorries have been leaving each day to ensure collections were still happening.View image in fullscreenGeorge Smith worries about rats being attracted to the piles of uncollected rubbish.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWhile this has been the case for some, many parts of the city said they felt completely forgotten. George Smith said it had been seven weeks since a waste lorry had visited Ashton Croft in Ladywood, and even longer since a recycling truck had been.The communal waste areas were overflowing with bin bags, piles of cardboard and empty food packets.“It’s seven weeks today since we last had a collection. We’ve got three big piles of rubbish piling up and the bin bags have been teared – we know in the city centre there’s a problem with rodents,” he said. “Something has started burrowing in my garden, and it’s not a mouse. That is what really concerns us more than anything else.”A spokesperson for Birmingham city council said a “fair and reasonable offer” had been made to Unite, and that the waste recycling and collection officer role did not exist in many councils.“To the small number of workers whose wages are impacted ongoing by the changes to the service (of whom there are now only 40) we have already offered alternatives, including highly valuable LGV driver training for career progression and pay, and other roles in the council equivalent to their former roles.

Only vocalist Charlie Harper had been allowed entry. Harper ended up playing the band’s scheduled show inLos Angeleswith a group of stand-in musicians.He recounted how after he landed at the LA airport with his partner, he was told he would be questioned after being flagged. He was informed the flagging was for two reasons: first, he was told he had an incorrect visa, but he was also told that there was another reason that the agents would not disclose to him.“I can’t help but wonder whether my frequent, and less than flattering, public comments regarding their president and his administration played a role – or perhaps I’m simply succumbing to paranoia,” he said.‘Deported because of his tattoos’: has the US targeted Venezuelans for their body art?Read moreThe band, considered pioneers in the genre of British punk rock, have been outspokenly critical of Trump and his policies in the past. They are known to often make political statements during live performances.“What followed was far from pleasant,” Gibbs said. “Two police officers escorted me to another section of LAX, where I found Stefan and Marc already detained in a cold holding pen, along with a group of Colombian, Chinese, and Mexican detainees. My luggage, phone, and passport were confiscated.”He explained how he was eventually called for a second interview at 4am, hours after he had initially landed at 7pm.Gibbs says his partner waited 25 hours for him to finally be released from the detention. “By the time we were escorted on to the flight at 8pm the next day, I had gone without sleep for well over a day, surviving only on a pot noodle and a couple of cups of tea.”Though he expressed relief that Harper had been able to enter the country and perform the scheduled show, Gibbs is not keen on trying to come back to the US again. “It seems my relationship with the country is over for the foreseeable future,” he said.The experiences of the UK Subs members are the latest in a long line of people who have experienced long hours of detainment and deportation upon entering the US, with the incidents frequently credited to vague or unspecified visa issues.In a similar situation to UK Subs, a French researcher wasdenied entry to the USearlier this month after immigration officers at an airport searched his phone and found messages in which he had expressed criticisms of the Trump administration.In response to the news Philippe Baptiste, France’s minister of higher education and research, said: “This measure was apparently taken by the American authorities because the researcher’s phone contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration’s research policy.”This article was amended on 21 March 2025 to correct the spelling of Alvin Gibbs’s name.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationLos AngelesPunkCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

To start to create a society that knows and understands the natural world is the biggest step forward we can take,” she said. “David Attenborough said we need to fall in love with the Earth again. This is one way of helping the next generation do that because it will show them the wonder of it.”The government will consult on the GCSE’s subject content later this year. According to Colwell, the criteria drafted under the previous government would need to be revised to ensure the GCSE provided young people in England, Wales andNorthern Irelandwith fieldwork opportunities to learn about the wildlife in their local neighbourhoods.Dr Doug Gurr, the director of the Natural History Museum, said: “We fully support embedding climate and nature in the curriculum, ensuring all young people have the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of the natural world around them. The natural history GCSE is a step toward achieving this, and Natural History Museum scientists have been providing scientific advice to the Department for Education on its subject content.”The former Green party MP Caroline Lucas, who also campaigned for the qualification, said she was “delighted”. She added: “What’s vital now is that the subject criteria are fit for purpose, and that young people are enabled to engage with their local wildlife and habitats, and to connect those to the wider environment.“I hope that the arts will also form an essential component of the qualification. We need to do everything possible to make sure the GCSE hits home and fulfils its true potential.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

And he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that.”The reference to Musk’s businesses – which includeTesla, an electric vehicle manufacturer trying to expand sales and production in China – is an unusual acknowledgment of concerns about Musk balancing his corporate and government responsibilities.Trump had previously brushed off questions about Musk’s potential conflicts of interest, simply saying that he would steer clear when necessary.The president said that Musk visited the Pentagon on Friday morning to discuss reducing costs, which he has been working on through the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).The defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, said Musk was there “to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations”.Musk said while leaving the Pentagon that he was ready to do “anything that could be helpful”. He also refused to answer questions as to whether he received a classified briefing on China as part of the visit.As a key adviser to Trump and the head of Doge, Musk has exercised broad powers in the two months since Trump returned to the White House, conducting mass layoffs and slashing budgets across the federal government. But while the Pentagon was also in line to be a target for job cuts, Musk has yet to play any role there, including in defense intelligence and military operations.A senior defense official told reporters on Tuesday that roughly 50,000 to 60,000 civilian jobs would be cut in the defense department.Musk’s involvement in any US plans or dealings with China would raise not only security concerns but questions over a significant conflict of interest, as he has considerable economic interests in China as the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, which also has contracts with the US air force.In the early hours of Friday morning, Muskdeniedthe reports that he would be briefed on war with China, calling it “pure propaganda” and threatening to find those who leaked the information.“I look forward to the prosecutions of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information,” he wrote. “They will be found.”Musk repeated his demand for such prosecutions upon arrival at the Department of Defense on the outskirts of Washington DC on Friday morning. He left the Pentagon about 90 minutes after arriving.A Pentagon spokesperson, asked by email to explain the true purpose of Musk’s briefing given administration denials that it would involve putative war plans with China, referred the Guardian to a statement posted on social media by Hegseth.In a Friday meeting at the White House to announce new air force fighter planes, Trump and Hegseth both firmly rejected reports that Musk was shown any Pentagon plans regarding a potential conflict with China during his visit earlier that day.“They made that up because it’s a good story to make up. They’re very dishonest people,” Trump said about the New York Times reporting. “I called up Pete [Hegseth] and I said: ‘Is there any truth to that?’ Absolutely not, he’s there for Doge, not there for China. And if you ever mentioned China, I think he’d walk out of the room.”Hegseth echoed Trump’s notion that the visit was focused on discussing government efficiency initiatives and innovation opportunities, adding that there were “no Chinese war plans”.“We welcomed him today to the Pentagon to talk about [the ‘department of government efficiency’], to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations. It was a great informal conversation,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionHegseth suggested the reporting was deliberately intended to “undermine whatever relationship the Pentagon has with” the Tesla CEO.However, some military experts have still expressed concern about Musk’s level of access to sensitive information.Wesley Clark, retired general and former Nato supreme commander, told CNN in an interview on Friday afternoon that the administration has been “cutting a lot of corners in a lot of areas”.“It’s no problem giving him a general impression, we do this for contractors, but the conflict of interest – I’m more interested in his interests abroad, he talks to Putin, he has business in China, he has other considerations and those can impact things,” Clark said.“I’m more worried aboutElon Muskcoming into the Pentagon and saying ‘I’m high tech and I have smart people in Silicon Valley and these generals do not know anything’. You have got to be really careful about jumping on the next shiny object.”According to a New York Times report, the meeting was set to take place not in Hegseth’s office, where informal meetings about innovation would normally take place, but in a secure conference room known as “the Tank”, which is typically used for higher-level meetings. Musk was to be briefed on a plan that contains 20 to 30 slides and details how theUS militarywould fight a conflict with China.Officials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal offered up potential reasons why Musk was receiving the briefing. The Times suggested that Musk, in his Doge capacity, might be looking into trimming the Pentagon’s budget and would need to know what military assets the US would use in a potential conflict with China.One source told the Journal that Musk was receiving the briefing because he asked for one.Though Musk has a “top-secret” clearance within the federal government,lawyersat SpaceX advised him in December not to seek higher levels of security clearances, which would probably be denied due to his foreign ties and personal drug use.The Associated Press contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS militaryChinaDonald TrumpPete HegsethTeslanewsShareReuse this content"

We look forward to learning more from [and] about the Trump administration’s plans for our agency and expanding exploration at the moon and Mars for the benefit of all.”Nasa’s action is in keeping with compliance by numerous other federal agencies that followed orders to remove mentions of DEI programs and initiatives following Trump’s second-term inauguration on 20 January.Agencies including theInternal Revenue ServiceandNational Institutes of Healthtook swift action to eliminate policies and funding associated with DEI, while the US military followed a presidential order to implement a ban on transgender people from service, a measuretemporarily blocked by a federal judgeon Wednesday.The move by Nasa is particularly notable because the creation of the Artemis program, and decision to land the first woman and person of color on the moon, were made in 2019 during the first Trump administration, according to the science journalArs Technica.The agency has made stridesin recent years to embrace diversityand move away from its reputation as being staffed by old, white men. All 12 people who walked on the moon during six Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972 were white men aged between 36 and 47.The first spaceflight by a US woman did not take place until 1983, when Sally Ride flew on the space shuttle Challenger. Nasa’s first Black astronaut in space was Guion Bluford, who flew a mission on Challenger later the same year.Artemis III is scheduled to land on the lunar surface in mid-2027, with its crew yet to be announced. A paragraph on the Artemis website that preceded the removed section about a woman and person of color continues to state that: “We are exploring the moon for scientific discovery, technology advancement, and to learn how to live and work on another world as we prepare for human missions to Mars.“We will collaborate with commercial and international partners and establish the first long-term presence on the Moon.”A first, un-crewed test mission, Artemis I, flew around the moonin November 2022.Artemis II, which will take humans to the moon and back without landing, is scheduled for April 2026. Itscrew of four, three of whom have flown into space before, includes one female astronaut, Christina Koch, and an African American, Victor Glover.The other crew members are US astronaut Reid Wiseman, the mission commander, and Canadian Jeremy Hansen on his first spaceflight.Explore more on these topicsUS newsNasaDonald TrumpSpaceRaceGendernewsShareReuse this content"

Days later, lawyers at the justice department emailed to request that the student “surrender” to immigration officials.Momodou Taal, a dual citizen of the UK and Gambia, is one of three Cornell students who are plaintiffs in a lawsuit seeking to block the enforcement of Trumpexecutive ordersaimed at deporting foreign university students and staff involved in pro-Palestinian protests.“Only in a dictatorship can the leader jail and banish political opponents for criticizing his administration,” Taal, 31, wrote in a statement accompanying the lawsuit, which was submitted by lawyers at theAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), a civil rights group, on 15 March.US universities face choice to surrender or fight back against Trump’s ‘takeover’Read moreTaal is pursuing a PhD at Cornell’s Africana Studies and Research Center, and was an outspoken activist on Cornell’s campus. He was suspended last year for his role in anti-Zionist protests at the university.On Wednesday, he wrote on X that he believed that, days after filing the lawsuit, “law enforcement from an unidentified agency” came to his home seeking to detain him. His lawyers then submitted amotionto stop the government from “attempting to detain, remove, or otherwise enforce the two executive orders against Mr Taal”. The court had ordered the government to respond to the request by 5pm on Saturday.In an email sent to Taal’s attorneys early Friday morning, a justice department lawyer wrote: “ICE invites Mr Taal and his counsel to appear in-person” at the homeland security investigations Office in Syracuse “at a mutually agreeable time” to be served a “notice to appear” – the first step in the formal process of deportation – and to surrender to immigration authorities.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment, and did not explain its reasoning in requesting surrender from Taal while he has a pending request for a restraining order.“Lawyers at the so-called Justice Department made this request to his attorneys within hours of us having asked the court to stop them from doing precisely that,” Lee told the Guardian. “It’s very difficult to explain how unprecedented this is.“This is something that should shock everybody. The most fundamental right in a democracy is the right to seek redress for grievances against the government,” Lee added. “God knows where they would send [Taal], simply because he decided to access the federal courts with American citizen colleagues to challenge whether what Trump is doing is legal or not.”In the lawsuit against the administration, Taal’s lawyers write that “he lives in constant fear that he may be arrested by immigration officials or police as a result of his speech”; he has had to cancel international speaking engagements; and he is fearful of traveling to London to visit family.His complaint comes just weeks after the high-profilearrestof Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian protest leaderMahmoud Khalil, and amid a series of escalating actions seeking to quell pro-Palestinian discourse at universities.The other two plaintiffs in the case are both US citizens – Mukoma Wa Ngũgĩ, a professor in the English department, and Sriram Parasuram, a PhD student in the School of Integrative Plant Science. Their complaint asserts that the administration’s crackdown on protestors “has unconstitutionally silenced plaintiffs and chilled protected expression, prohibiting them from speaking, hearing, or engaging with viewpoints critical of the US government or the government of Israel”.Taal was suspended twice by Cornell last year for allegeddisruptiveprotest and was told that his suspension could result in him losing his visa, but he was eventually allowed to resume attending classes remotely.Columbia University caves to demands to restore $400m from Trump administrationRead moreHe has faced criticism for online comments after the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. He posted soon after the attack: “Wherever you have oppression, you will find those who fighting against it. Glory to the resistance!”In an interview with CNN in 2023, he said it was racist and Islamophobic “that before I’m allowed to have a view on genocide, I have to condemn a terrorist organization … I can say clearly categorically I abhor the killing of all civilians no matter where they are and who does it.”Over the past week, judgeshaveblockedthe government from deporting Khalil and an Indian national at Georgetown University whose wife is of Palestinian heritage. Both academics, alongside Taal, were among the many pro-Palestinian voices targeted by a hardline pro-Israel social media account. The accounts have publicized the names and locations of numerous students and flagged US officials in posts, encouraging arrests and deportations.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS universitiesUS politicsNew YorkLaw (US)Donald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The University of Auckland research team was searching the ocean for feeding frenzies at the time.The marine scientist Rochelle Constantine was confused at first about what exactly she was seeing, thinking the orange patch on the shark’s head might be an injury.“At first, I was like: ‘Is it a buoy?’” Constantine told the New York Times. “‘Is it entangled in fishing gear or had a big bite?’”A technician set up a drone for a closer look. As they drew nearer, they saw tentacles – thereby discovering the world’s first “sharktopus”.The Maori octopus is the largest octopus in the southern hemisphere. “You can see it takes a fair amount of real estate on the shark’s head,” Constantine said.Octopuses are typically found on the seabed, which shortfin mako sharks rarely visit, making the incident even stranger.“We moved on after 10 minutes, so I can’t tell you what happened next,” Constantine toldOceanographic. “The octopus may have been in for quite the experience, though, since the world’s fastest shark species can reach 50km per hour.”She said the unusual encounter is another example of how much of the ocean and marine life is still unknown, including the crucial and diverse role sharks play in the marine ecosystem.“The ‘sharktopus’ encounter is a reminder of the wonders of the ocean,” Constantine said. “One of the best things about being a marine scientist is that you never know what you might see next in the sea. By supporting conservation initiatives, we can help to ensure that such extraordinary moments keep happening.”Explore more on these topicsWorld newsMarine lifeNew ZealandWildlifeOceansSharksFishnewsShareReuse this content"

Danish law, in contrast, allows citizens to identify their gender as X.“If your passport has the gender designation X or you have changed gender, it is recommended to contact the US embassy prior to travel for guidance on how to proceed,” the Danish travel advisory page now reads.Officials said that no Danish citizens had been refused entry to the US or detained at the border since Trump took office. Instead, the LGBT+ Danmark association said it had requested the advisory update.“We are worried that people could be stopped at the airport and refused entry, or that something inappropriate and uncomfortable could happen at the airport,” Susanne Branner Jespersen toldDanish broadcaster Radio IIII.Earlier this month, Germany alsoreportedlyflagged that transgender travellers or those travelling with the gender X marked on their passports should contact US diplomatic missions before their departure.Soon after, Finland updated its advice page. “If the applicant’s current sex on their passport is different from their sex confirmed at birth, the US authorities may refuse entry,” the page, updated in mid-March, reads.Other European countries have sought to sharpen their language around US entry requirements. In Germany, news that three German nationalshad been detainedat the border led the government to update its travel advisory to note that a visa or entry waiver does not guarantee entry into the US.“The final decision on whether a person can enter the US lies with the US border authorities,” a spokesperson for the foreign minister told Reuters.British officials also appeared to have revisited their US travel advisory, which now notes that anyone found breaking the country’s entry rules could face arrest or detention.Earlier this month it emerged that a British touristhad been detainedin the US for 10 days after she was told she should have applied for a working visa, instead of a tourist visa.When asked by Reuters, the Foreign Office declined to comment on why it had changed the advisory or confirm the date that it was done.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkFinlandEuropeTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

But uncertainty remains about how or when the part-ceasefire will take effect as Ukraine and Russia prepare to send delegations to Riyadh next week for parallel talks with the US.How Trump’s diplomacy resembles a game of broken telephoneRead moreIt was immediately clear that the three parties had different views about what the pact entailed, with the White House saying “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin saying the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure”, and Zelenskyy saying he would also like railways and ports protected.A senior Ukrainian official told AFP thatUkrainehoped to secure a part-ceasefire at the talks in Saudi Arabia on Monday. “We still want to agree on a ceasefire, at least on what we have proposed,” the source said, referring to calls for a halt to strikes on energy sites, civilian infrastructure and attacks in the Black Sea.The source added it was “unclear” when any ceasefire could be implemented. “There have been no reciprocal steps from the Russians,” they said. “We need to agree on the main thing: what objects and what control. The Americans have enormous intelligence capabilities, so they see a lot,” they added.On Friday, the Kremlin claimed Vladimir Putin’s order for Russian forces to temporarily halt their attacks on energy infrastructure remained in force, but stressed the agreement only covered “energy infrastructure” and not “energy and infrastructure”.Russia also accused Ukraine of violating the part-ceasefire, citing a strike that took place before Zelenskyy formally agreed to the truce.View image in fullscreenPeople inspect the site of a drone strike in Odesa.Photograph: Igor Tkachenko/EPAMoscow’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, told Russia’s Channel One on Thursday evening that Ukraine had breached a proposed 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure by striking a Russian oil depot on Tuesday night, though that strike came before Zelenskyy’s call with Trump the next day where he agreed in principle to the US-brokered proposal.The Ukrainian side has accused Russia of violating its pledges. Hours after Putin’s phone call with Trump on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said there had been “hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure”, including a hospital in Sumy.Moscow appeared to be exploiting the window before any ceasefire takes hold, launching drones at Odesa as well as shelling the southern region of Zaporizhzhia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moscow accused Ukraine of striking the facility, while Ukraine’s general staff denied responsibility, claiming instead that it had been “repeatedly shelled by the Russians themselves”.Russia’s investigative committee said the gas station “was significantly damaged in the blast”.While much of Europe has cut its reliance on Russian gas, countries sympathetic to Moscow – including Hungary and Slovakia – still buy it, with all supplies flowing through the town of Sudzha in Russia’s Kursk region.European leaders of the coalition backing Ukraine are expected to meet again next week, hoping to finalise plans to secure “credible security guarantees”.After a meeting with western military planners near London on Thursday, Keir Starmerappeared to step back from his pledgeto put boots on the ground in Ukraine, saying instead that allied forces would be deployed by sea and air in support of Kyiv’s own forces.The Trump administration has appeared lukewarm toward the idea of European troops in Ukraine and has been reluctant to commit to supporting them if they were deployed. Moscow has repeatedly ruled out the presence of western troops in Ukraine, calling it a red line it will not tolerate.In an interview on Thursday, Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, suggested the US might advocate for troops from Saudi Arabia or India – two countries with relatively warm ties to Moscow – to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential security arrangement.Zelenskyy, meanwhile, pushed back against a reported proposal by Macron, who was said to be exploring the idea of a UN-led peacekeeping mission to protect Ukraine.“With all due respect, the UN will not protect us from occupation or Putin’s desire to come again. We do not see the UN as an alternative to a contingent or security guarantees,” Zelenskyy said during a press conference with Pavel.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

He was the father of two young boys, aged seven and 10, who were tragically found dead in a pond near their home in Trondheim, Norway, in December 2020.”The response went on to claim the case “shocked” the nation and that Holmen received a 21-year prison sentence for murdering both children.Holmen said in a complaint to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority that the “completely false” story nonetheless contained elements similar to his own life such as his home town, the number of children he has and the age gap between his sons.“The complainant was deeply troubled by these outputs, which could have harmful effect in his private life, if they where reproduced or somehow leaked in his community or in his home town,”said the complaint, which has been filed by Holmen and Noyb, a digital rights campaign group.It added that Holmen has “never been accused nor convicted of any crime and is a conscientious citizen”.Holmen’s complaint alleged that ChatGPT’s “defamatory” response violated accuracy provisions within the GDPR European data law. It has asked the Norwegian watchdog to order ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI, to adjust its model to eliminate inaccurate results relating to Holmen and to impose a fine on the company. Noyb said that since Holmen’s interaction with ChatGPT took place, OpenAI had released a new model incorporating web searches – which has made a repeat of the Holmen error “less likely”.AI chatbots are prone to producing responsescontaining false informationbecause they are built on models that predict the next most likely word in a sentence. This can result in factual errors and wild assertions, but the plausible nature of the responses can trick users into thinking that what they are reading is 100% correct.AnOpenAIspokesperson said: “We continue to research new ways to improve the accuracy of our models and reduce hallucinations. While we’re still reviewing this complaint, it relates to a version of ChatGPT which has since been enhanced with online search capabilities that improves accuracy.”Explore more on these topicsChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAINorwayEuropeChatbotsnewsShareReuse this content"

He spent a total of six years in Soviet psychiatric wards that functioned as prisons.His sentence on Friday effectively amounts to life imprisonment, given his age and frail health. Skobov’s lawyer said her client had diabetes, hepatitis C, bronchial asthma and glaucoma.In a defiant final statement before sentencing, Skobov condemned the war in Ukraine, saying: “Today I will be asked whether I plead guilty. Well, I am the one making the accusation here! I accuse the stinking corpse of a regime and the ruling Putin clique of preparing, unleashing, and waging an aggressive war, of committing war crimes in Ukraine, of political terror in Russia, and of the moral corruption of my people.”“I ask the regime’s henchmen present here: do you admit your guilt in being complicit in Putin’s crimes?” Skobov added.As the judge read out the sentence, Skobov – seated inside a locked metal cage and guarded by security officers – washeard shouting: “Glory to Ukraine.”Skobov has been in detention since his arrest in April 2024. Even behind bars, he has remained politically active. Last June, he published an open letter addressed to younger Russian political prisoners. “I want the young people who took the hit to know: the last Soviet dissidents stood alongside them,” hewrote in the letter, which was published by the Novaya Gazeta outletThe sentence Skobov was given on Friday was extreme even by the already-repressive standards of today’s Russia. Observers said it highlighted how modern Russia had surpassed the scale of repression seen during the post-Stalin Soviet era.“The draconian sentence handed down to Alexander Skobov today is emblematic of the war against dissent wielded by Russian authorities insure the country, in parallel to their abuse war in Ukraine,” said Tanya Lokshina, an associate director for Human Rights Watch’sEuropeand Central Asia division.“It is particularly poignant that Skobov had spent years in a Soviet prison for having exercised his freedom of opinion all those years back – and over four decades later the history is repeating itself,” she added.Russia has launched an unprecedented crackdown on dissent since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a campaign that has reached into nearly every corner of society.The independent Russian outlet Proektestimated in 2024that the scale of repression under the Putin regime had surpassed that of the Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, persecuting at least 116,000 people over the past six years alone.The Skobov case also suggests that Moscow has no intention of easing repression at home against those who oppose the war – even as the Kremlin claims to be pursuing peace talks over the conflict in Ukraine.In recent weeks, Russian authorities have detained a string of citizens who have criticised the war, ranging from a film critic to a pensioner and several regional journalists. Each is facing long spells in prison for social media posts condemning Putin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineFreedom of speechEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It has spent almost $10bn on 12 acquisitions in the country, including the Shanghai-based Gracell Biotechnologies, which develops cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune disease, for $1.2bn last year.Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, said: “This $2.5bn investment reflects our belief in the world-class life sciences ecosystem in Beijing, the extensive opportunities that exist for collaboration and access to talent, and our continued commitment to China.”He added that the group’s “sixth strategic R&D centre will partner with the cutting-edge biology and AI science in Beijing and be a critical part of our global efforts to bring innovative medicines to patients worldwide”.AstraZeneca’sfive existing centresinclude two in the US, in Gaithersburg, near Washington DC, and Boston; as well a two further European centres, Cambridge in the UK and Gothenburg in Sweden. The Beijing site will be the second in China, after its existing facility in Shanghai.The new research centre includes a strategic partnership with the Beijing Cancer hospital in translational research, data science, and clinical development.The pharmaceutical company is also signing two collaboration and licensing agreements with Chinese companies; one with Harbour BioMed to discover multi-specific antibodies, and one with Syneron Bio to develop macrocyclic peptides, which are seen as a way ofdeveloping a next wave of drugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This will be AstraZeneca’s first and only vaccine manufacturing facility in China, which will be sited in the Beijing BioPark.The company added that the moves were part of its plan to almost double global revenues from about$45bn in 2023to$80bn in 2030, while launching 20 new medicines.AstraZeneca, which is the UK’s most valuable listed company, said the case concerning Wang involved suspected unpaid import taxes of $900,000, which could lead to a fine of up to five times that amount if the company were found liable.A decade ago, AstraZeneca’s UK rival, GSK, had topay a fine of 3bn yuan (£297m) to Beijingafter being found guilty of bribery by a Chinese court.Explore more on these topicsAstraZenecaPharmaceuticals industryChinanewsShareReuse this content"

It comes with cover art that features the betrothedSelena Gomezand Benny Blanco snuggling in bed, the photograph apparently shot through a keyhole, as if its prospective audience is spying on an intimate moment. Should you not get the gist, there’s an accompanying explanation about how it celebrates the pop star and pop uber-producer’s “love story”, how it came together “organically” thanks to the comfort between them, and “authentically reflects their experiences”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for I Said I Loved You FirstWhether that compels you or sends you running in the opposite direction screaming in horror is doubtless a matter of personal taste. It depends on how you feel about public displays of affection, particularly those designed to make the couple in question money, an idea that history suggests is fraught with risk. Over the years, a host of legendary pop names have chosen to commemorate their love together in song – Sonny and Cher, Kylie and Jason, Nas and Kelis, not to mention Katie Price and Peter Andre – only to watch their relationships crash and burn. Gomez and Blanco, who produced Katy Perry’s Teenage Dream, Maroon 5’s Moves Like Jagger and Rihanna’s Diamonds among other 2010s classics, evengave Interview magazinethe sort of Hello! magazine exclusive in which a Coronation Street star flashes their engagement ring.Still, you can see why they might have done it. For one thing, the first flush of romance can make you lose your head, blind to the idea that your love might give anyone outside your bubble the ick. You could mock passing that kind of behaviour off as “art that authentically reflects their experiences”, but then look at John Lennon and Yoko Ono favouring the world with a photo of themselves in the buff. And we live in an era where pop fandom seems predicated on parsing every lyric for intimations about their idol’s personal life – something Gomez, the most-followed woman on Instagram, knows well. It’s indescribably reductive, but if fans are intent on viewing your music as a footnote to your private life, then why not give them what they want?Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco: Younger and Hotter Than Me – videoSo the album roughly follows a narrative arc, from the wreckage of a failed previous relationship to the couple’s present-day happiness. In fairness, the lyrics are nowhere near as runny as the accompanying blurb might suggest, but they do a lot of things that besotted couples are wont to do: smarming about how happy they are in front of single friends, being passive-aggressive when they run into their exes (“I know you’re going to find somebody perfect”) and offering TMI about their sex lives. It’s “ride it like a cowboy” this and “I just wanna go all night” that. If their forthcoming marriage is blessed with children, you dread to think how it’s going to go down when said kids hit their early teens.Musically, it pulls in a lot of big names, Billie Eilish’s brother and collaborator Finneas, Gracie Abrams, rapper GloRilla and Charli xcx among them, the latter contributing to a bit of trebly and distinctly post-Brat dance-pop called Bluest Flame. I Said I Love You First cycles through a selection of modish pop styles, from J Balvin-assisted Latin pop that leans into Gomez’s Mexican heritage to a piano ballad performed in the slurry vocal style known as “cursive singing” or “indie girl voice” – supposed to indicate confessional intimacy, it can sound remarkably like you’re singing with your bottom lip stuck out like a petulant four-year-old. There is a taut new wave/pop-punk-influenced track with a guitar that goes chugga-chugga (Call Me When You Break Up), a song closely resembling a Billie Eilish ballad (Don’t Take It Personally) and a lot of stuff that sounds like Lana Del Rey, whose influence hangs particularly heavy over How Does It Feel to Be Forgotten? and You Said You Were Sorry.Only Murders in the Building season four review – by far the funniest thing on TVRead moreIt’s all pretty well done, but it means that a project that’s clearly very personal ultimately struggles to develop a clear identity of its own, an issue that has plagued Gomez as a pop star despite some great one-off hits; in recent years, her greatest successes have been as an actor in Only Murders in the Building and the ill-fated Emilia Pérez. Plus, the songs aren’t hugely memorable. That seems baffling, given how successful Blanco is: whatever you made of Teenage Dream or Moves Like Jagger, they’re incredibly catchy songs. You might assume he’d bring his A-game to an album where he shares billing with his fiancee, but killer tunes are surprisingly thin on the ground – the best might be the chanson-like melody of Ojos Tristes – which perhaps accounts for the relatively muted reception afforded the singles released thus far, despite an ongoing media blitz.In all their media appearances together, Gomez and Blanco seem like a genuinely sweet couple: funny, self-deprecating, a lot more self-aware than the stuff about producing art that authentically reflects their appearances might suggest. It’s tempting to say that you can have more fun – and, if you’re interested in such things, get a better insight into their relationship – watching them eat chicken wings dipped in tongue-melting chilli sauce onYouTube series Hot Onesthan listening to I Said I Love You First. It’s certainly not as mawkish as you might fear – you don’t want to bolt from it at high speed – but nor can you imagine spending too much time in its presence, however much you wish its authors well.Explore more on these topicsSelena GomezPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Each of its four hour-long episodes was captured in a single take, which required meticulous planning and endless innovations on the part of its crew.Many of the details are already out there, in a series of social media threads that went viral this week. However, last monthI interviewed the key creatives of Adolescence, and they provided me with several backstage stories that I had to leave out because of a lack of space or because I didn’t want to spoil their head-spinning impact. With that in mind, here are a few leftover secrets from my conversations about Adolescence.It all began as a favour for a mateBefore Adolescence, there was Boiling Point, aone-take movie starring Stephen Graham and directed by Philip Barantini. “This was how the whole thing started,” recalled Graham. “Phil said he wanted to be a director. And I was like: ‘OK.’ And then he said: ‘Will you be in my first film?’ And I said: ‘No. Go and show me what you can do. If it’s any good, we’ll have a talk about another one.’” Barantini did just that, and his second idea was the short that became Boiling Point. “I made that short film as a favour for a mate,” Graham said. “So you never know what can happen.”Its young star is mad about swingballGiven the subject matter, production took a lot of care to protect the show’s young star, Owen Cooper. “We had lots and lots of comfort blankets around him,” said Barantini. “There was a child psychologist on set every day and chaperones. He was very, very well looked after. But I think we were more concerned for him than he was. At the end of each take, it’s emotional, and everyone’s gone through this huge rollercoaster, and I’d be like: ‘Owen, are you OK?’ Then he’d be like: ‘Yeah, I’ve got a swingball game to play with my chaperone. Am I good to go?’” In a separate conversation, the show’s writer, Jack Thorne, said: “All he wanted to do was play swingball.”If you look closely, you’ll see the camera operator at one pointView image in fullscreenMagic … the camera was clipped to a drone.Photograph: NetflixIn the final moments of episode two, there is an incredible shot where the camera magically takes off and flies through the sky before landing next to Graham. Here is how Barantini described it: “As Ashley [Walters, as DI Bascombe] leaves in his car, we have a team coming up behind Matt [the cinematographer, Matthew Lewis], who clip the camera to a drone with a hook. Then we fly the drone over the town. In the meantime, Matt legs it into a van. He drives to the end site, catches the drone with two other people, disconnects it and starts walking towards Stephen’s face.” Lewis’s journey had to be split-second accurate and, as Barantini revealed: “If you watch it again, you’ll see his van drive into the car park as the drone comes in to land.”That incredible drone shot was nearly very different …“The original idea was that the drone would just take off, fly over the murder site, and then keep flying,” said Barantini. “That was supposed to be the end of the episode. But then on Wednesday of the shoot week, Toby Bentley, the Netflix executive, said: ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could have Stephen at the end?’”… and it almost didn’t happen at allFilming for each episode took place over a week. “We’d do a take in the morning and a take in the afternoon every day,” said Graham. “On Wednesday, Toby had his idea. It was like: ‘Shit, that only gives us Thursday and Friday to get it right.’ On Thursday, the winds were too high. Friday morning, the winds were OK, but the drone wobbled and fell.” A plan B was hatched to ditch the drone altogether and end on a shot of Graham standing by the school where the bulk of the episode took place. “Friday afternoon was our final chance,” continued Graham. “It’s the last take. Let’s see what happens. Everyone’s on the same page. We’re all locked in. Away it goes. And the final take of all is the take that you see.”‘Unnervingly on-the-nose’: why Adolescence is such powerful TV that it could save livesRead moreThe locations were meticulously researchedBoiling Point was written in the film’s sole location, a restaurant, so Barantini could figure out the camera moves as he worked on the script. But Adolescence has far more moving parts, and worked across multiple locations each episode. “Matt and I would have the map of the area, then plan it from there,” said Barantini. “Before we had any actors come on set, we would have mapped out the whole episode with the cameras.”The bulk of the first episode takes place in a police station. However, this was a set. “We found a location for the station in Pontefract,” said Barantini. But the house that was raided before the arrest was a real house. “So we had to find a house a three-minute drive from the studio. It was quite a lot of planning.”Cooper’s voice almost gave out in episode threeView image in fullscreen‘I was screaming and shouting in every take’ … Owen Cooper as Jamie Miller and Erin Doherty as Briony Ariston, in Adolescence.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe third episode – the two-hander between Cooper and Erin Doherty as his child psychologist – was the first of the series to be shot; a daunting task given that it was also Cooper’s first acting job. Again, multiple takes were filmed. “The one they used was the one where Owen had a bad cough,” said Doherty. “But Phil loved it.” Cooper said: “I was screaming and shouting in every take, twice a day. So you know, my throat was going all crazy. By the final take, I sounded like I’d been smoking for about 30 years.”Adolescence is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaStephen GrahamNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her grief mirrors Mohamed’s own experience growing up. “There isn’t an answer to [grief],” Mohamed says. “You have to feel it as you go along.” Ali, with her deep connection to the story, was instinctively drawn to the role: “When I approach Somali stories, it’s always a yes before a no because there are so few,” she says.Mohamed, who co-directed theplay Dugsi Dayzin 2022, aimed to create an authentic representation of British-Somali life. “For too long, Somali people have been portrayed through stereotypes in western cinema,” she says. “I want to show all of the beauty and richness of being British-Somali.” Ali echoes this sentiment: “It’s rare to find Muslim stories that aren’t warped with negativity, so I wanted to do it right.” However, achieving this authenticity came with its own set of issue; Ali, who helped source some of the cast, says: “The casting process was really challenging because of a lack of Somali actors. In the end, we had to street cast [approach and ask the general public] and use our networks to make it work.”View image in fullscreen‘The people in positions of power don’t understand our stories’ … Warda Mohamed at the London Critics’ Circle film awards, February 2024.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyBeyond grief, Muna also explores culture, family, and belonging. Ali, who earned her first executive producer credit as well as playing the lead role, is especially passionate about the authenticity of the mother-daughter dynamic. “It isn’t about clashes of culture or religion; it is about two people figuring things out. It is a universal experience that many can relate to.”The soundtrack blends contemporary UK and traditional Somali music, with Muna curating the perfect playlist for her school trip. Ali adds: “I wanted to keep it fun and authentic to me. The music used and the dance scene was a true representation of me as a person, not just acting.”Finding the right oud player for a scene with Muna’s grandfather was also a challenge, but Mohamed’s persistence led her to connect with a musician in Mogadishu through her family. “It was chaotic but beautiful,” Mohamed says. “Shooting inSomaliacaptured the duality of being British-Somali and made it all the more worthwhile.”The production was shaped by Mohamed’s commitment to a faith-based film-making approach to reflect the cast and production staff. “It was important for me that our set reflected the values of the community we were representing,” Mohamed says. “When you see the prayer scenes, they’re not just performances – they’re actual prayers.”Mohamed reflects on the barriers she has faced as a working-class film-maker: “It took more than four years to get funding,” she says. “One of the biggest roadblocks was people not understanding the story. They wanted me to focus on the wake, but I wanted to show it through the eyes of a young girl who doesn’t know why she’s grieving, or what she is meant to feel.”“The people in positions of power don’t understand our stories,” she adds. “Representation is crucial – not just for the audience but for decision-makers too. We need people from different backgrounds in development, executive, and commissioning roles so they can understand stories that haven’t been seen on screen before.”After its successful festival run, Mohamed says she heard from many people wanting to watch Muna again or for the first time – so she is delighted the film is now on the BBC’s iPlayer platform. “The iPlayer release feels like Muna has been given new life,” she says. “It’s been joyful to see different parts of the world respond and hear how people connect with Muna, her brother, or even the parents.” For now, Mohamed has set a new precedent for Somali storytelling in British cinema. “We have to keep making things, keep writing, keep telling our stories,” she says. “And hopefully, people will eventually see us the way we want to be seen.”Muna is now available to watch on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsFilmShort filmsSomaliaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Rebel Girls team has since published numerous follow-up titles, including 100 Immigrant Women Who Changed the World and Rebel Girls Celebrate Pride.While spin-off Rebel Girls titles – such as the Growing Up Powerful series aimed at the first book’s original, now teenage, fans – continue to be published, author Elena Favilli felt that the original book was due an update this year. The US-based Italian writer, who wrote the original Rebel Girls title with her then-civil partner Francesca Cavallo, has written 22 additional stories for the new edition, featuring Earps, Indigenous rights advocateAutumn Peltier, film-maker Greta Gerwig, actor Michelle Yeoh, climate activist Greta Thunberg and more.View image in fullscreenMisty Copeland, one of the rebel girls included in the book, illustrated by Ping Zhu.Photograph: Courtesy of Rebel Girls and DKWith the new stories, Favilli wanted “to really try to focus on the women who have created cool inventions or trailblazed in different fields over the past 10 years”.But how to pick just 22? Whittling down the contenders has “always been the sad part of the process”, Favilli says. But her criteria has remained the same since 2016: “To create a mix of famous and less famous people, and really try to cover all the different geographies in the world and not just focus on western countries.”She also takes care to choose stories “that could expose girls to all the different challenges of life, not just the most successful aspects”.Of course, the book celebrates women’s “extraordinary accomplishments”, but at the same time Favilli tries to “never shy away from also telling the hard or the sad parts”. She says it was important in the first edition to include Nina Simone, for example, who was in some ways “very flawed”.“That’s one aspect of sexism, that women should be celebratedonlyif they are perfect,” Favilli says – instead, she is keen to celebrate the “very human stories” of women.While researching the book, Favilli learned about some “incredible” women, such as Katalin Karikó, the Hungarian-American biochemist whose work led to the discovery of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. “It’s an incredible story of the resilience and talent of a woman who was dismissed for a long time as a researcher but who just kept following her instinct and her passion,” Favilli says. “She made an immense contribution to science and society in a moment that was so desperate and tragic for the entire world.”Nottingham-born Earps, who won the Golden Glove award at the 2023 Women’s World Cup for best goalkeeper of the tournament, has become an inspiration for young players, as more girls than ever have started playing football in recent years in the UK.As a child it would have been “fantastic to see” role models in a book such as Rebel Girls, Earps says. “When you’re younger, you’re told not to be a rebel. You’re told not to disrupt the status quo and just kind of keep quiet and go along with it.”But it’s important to be a rebel sometimes, Earps says: “It’s about having the courage to speak your truth and say your opinion, and maybe challenging things which, in all fairness, should be challenged.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s so important children are exposed to stories that help them to not feel alone’ … Sinéad Burke illustrated by Anja Sušanj.Photograph: Courtesy of Rebel Girls and DKIrish disability activist Sinéad Burke, who is also featured in Favilli’s new edition, is grateful that her nephews and nieces will now have this book. It’s so important children are “exposed to stories that represent their lived experiences and help them to not feel alone”, she says.“When I was a child, there was very little representation of disabled protagonists in stories, particularly written by disabled authors,” she adds. “The representation of a little person living a fulfilled, complete life, not framed by charity or tragedy, while not erasing the difficulties, would have given me a new axis to work from.”Nine years on from the original Rebel Girls book’s publication, feminism is in some ways under more threat than ever, with the rise of misogynistic influencers online and in boardrooms and governments.“The fight for women’s rights is as urgent today as it was 10 years ago,” Favilli says, noting: “Every new push forward when it comes to civil rights or human rights has always, throughout history, been opposed by backward forces.”She thinks we’re living in a period of such pushback, remembering that when she started working on the original book 10 years ago, there was a sense of “excitement” and “hope”.When the book came out: “I thought that my work was really aligned with the zeitgeist. It almost felt as if we were all finally fighting the good fight together … like a wave that kept building and building. And now, unfortunately, it’s not.”She hopes the new edition can be a “sort of beacon of hope for younger generations”.“As long as we keep nurturing our younger generations with stories that show them that these things are possible and that they are achievable to them, I think we make sure that children have the most important vaccine against sexism,” she says. “If anything, this book is probably even more important now than it was when it first came out.”Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls (New Edition) by Rebel Girls (Rebel Girls Inc, £25).

Now rereleased for its 30th anniversary, it was the first in a franchise featuring the squabblingly bromantic Miami cop partnership, created by screenwriter George Gallo, directed byMichael Bayand produced with towering unsubtlety by the legendary action duo Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, one of their final films before Simpson died of a colossal drug overdose.Lawrence plays Marcus Burnett, a married man with kids, partnered up with Mike Lowrey (Smith), who is supposed to be a single guy and ladies’ man. Oddly for a cop, he’s also supposed to be rich, with family money, which explains his smooth bachelor pad in an art deco apartment building; like so many interiors in this film, it is shot from a low angle in a kind of groovy heat haze, with shafts of sunlight beaming through – this being the signifier for interior design classiness. It is in this flat that the film rather bafflingly contrives some goofy sub-Billy-Wilder comedy as Marcus passes himself off as Mike, leading a material witness into this property for her own protection and pretending that the place is his.Marcus and Mike are called in by Captain Howard, played here in time-honoured exasperated-police-chief style by veteran character turn Joe Pantoliano, when a mountain of impounded heroin is stolen from police stores. They have just a few days to get it back before Internal Affairs officer Sinclair (Marg Helgenberger) starts to bust their balls, and it turns out that the villain is bestubbled French bad guy Fouchet, played by Tchéky Karyo. Their witness to his wrongdoing is Julie Mott, played by Téa Leoni; she is robustly and affectionately described here as a “hooker” (that was all cool in 1995) and basically becomes the gutsy third member of their crime-fighting team. The giant finale takes place in a classic Michael Bay locale: a hangar in the middle of what is apparently the desert, full of planes and cars to be blown up.The look and the aesthetic of Bad Boys – the luxury performance cars, night clubs, sunlit streetscapes, man-mountain bad guys, guns and young women – in a way found its cultural importance not in the continuing Bad Boys franchise but in the Grand Theft Auto video game, which launched just a couple of years later. Watched again now, Smith’s performance is weirdly subdued, as if all the emphasis is really on the established comic talent Lawrence, and Smith is his straight man.Bad Boys is in UK and Irish cinemas from 21 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsThrillersWill SmithMichael BayreviewsShareReuse this content"

But who can – and wants to – lug around all that weight? Enter travel minis and decanting your full-size products into bag-friendly pots.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Whether you want to pack light to make room for holiday shopping, or you have luggage restrictions, getting your beauty bag whittled down to a good size is a fine art. One tip is to pack products that have several uses, such as a cleansing balm that removes makeup; and a makeup setting mist that also works as a hairspray.But it’s not just about convenience: travel minis also offer the chance to try out new products without committing to a full-size version. Plus, they often last longer than you think, making them perfect for short trips or even as a backup for your regular beauty routine.But while travel-sized toiletries are convenient, they canalso be bad for the planet.Many mini products come in excessive plastic packaging, and with single-use plastics already ahuge environmental issue, the beauty industry is under increasing pressure to provide more eco-friendly options.So, can you pack smartandthink sustainably? Yes, you can decant full-size products into reusable pots. Choose your pots wisely, though, because some leak, and it’s easy to forget what’s in each unless you meticulously label them. I’ve suggested some of the best pots below. Or you can follow my preferred method: buy mini versions of your larger everyday products, and keep topping them up.Whatever you decide, these are the best beauty travel minis and containers around. After testing hundreds of them, I can fully vouch for their brilliance.The top travel minisTravel-size hair productsView image in fullscreenHoliRoots Good Karma hair set£32 at Sephora£34 at Cult BeautyThis set contains all your haircare essentials: shampoo (50ml), conditioner (50ml), treatment oil (14.4ml) and a mask (50ml). The products are super concentrated so a little goes a long way, making them last longer. I’m heading to the Caribbean this summer and know my hair and scalp will need the extra moisture (salt water is drying for the hair), so this is my go-to kit.View image in fullscreenBumbleand BumblePrêt-à-powder, 14g£16 at Look Fantastic£16 at SephoraA traditional mini can of dry shampoo might be cheaper, but this tiny bottle is the one if you’re looking for multitasking, space-saving prowess. Just apply a little to your roots to soak up sweat and grease. As an added bonus, it also doubles as a great volumising product without looking chalky like many aerosol dry shampoos can.View image in fullscreenL’Oreal Paris Infallible 3-second setting mist, 75ml£9.99 at Look Fantastic£9.99 at SuperdrugThis setting mist is great for keeping your makeup in place – ideal when you’re somewhere a little on the humid side. But I also use it as a light-hold hairspray when I’m away, and it works. It saves precious luggage space and is waterproof and sweat proof. Because this is 75ml, you can still take it on the plane in your hand luggage if you’re flying. It’s always worth checking individual airlines for any restrictions, though.Travel-size skincareView image in fullscreenCliniqueMoistureSurge 100 hour hydrator, 15ml£10 at Look Fantastic£11.20 at BootsWhether you’re skiing in the Alps or basking in the Mediterranean sun, hydration is vital. This mini moisturiser works in every climate and hydrates without feeling heavy or sticky. It’s become my go-to travel moisturiser for this reason. I just decant it from my larger pot using one of those mini spatulas you often get with beauty products.View image in fullscreenInkey List mini oat cleansing balm, 50ml£6.50 at Boots£6.50 at Cult BeautyI’m a massive fan of this mini cleansing balm because it allows you to do away with having a separate makeup remover and cleanser. Apply to your face, and watch it turn to a milky emulsion as you rinse the grime, sweat and makeup off your skin. I always take this on city breaks where pollution and dirt can make my skin flare up.View image in fullscreenOmorovicza Queen of Hungary mist, 30ml£22 at Look Fantastic£17.60 at SpaceNKThis hydrating face mist mitigatesdrying plane airwith Hungarian thermal waters to reduce sensitivity and moisturising agents like glycerine to rehydrate the skin.

This creamy scent with pink pepper and iris was designed to smell different on everyone who wears it. The wax base helps it adhere to the skin better than traditional alcohol-based sprays, and when it’s empty you can buy the refills.View image in fullscreenJo Malone fragrance set, 1.5ml each£20 at John Lewis£20 at Look FantasticThe part of the brain that processes memory is right next to the part that processes scent, so wearing a different perfume on holiday is a nice way to anchor memories.

It’s also water-resistant so it’s great for sports and hot climates, and it contains a hefty dose of antioxidants to give an added layer of protection against environmental damage. Another bonus is that it’s small enough to slip into a pocket. I always have it on hand when I’m heading somewhere tropical.View image in fullscreenDr PawPaw SPF lip balm SPF 20, 8ml£3 at Dr PawPaw£4.95 at SuperdrugThis may be the size of a regular lip balm but it’s a multitasker with SPF.

Even kissing my boyfriend is riskyCaroline CrayFri 21 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 07.16 EDTShareI’ve been diagnosed withmast cell activation syndrome(MCAS). It means your immune system is triggered too frequently and can cause anaphylaxis, so you can become allergic to a huge range of things. It’s a rare, incurable condition.I’d had some minor problems from the age of two, and knew I was allergic to nuts. But a crucial turning point came when I was 18, in 2017. I was at university in Massachusetts and decided to grab a mint chocolate-chip ice-cream with friends. Before I knew it, I went into anaphylaxis, and my friends rushed me to hospital.From that moment, my body started to reject almost everything – my immune system started identifying all food as allergens. Doctors thought it could be stress-related or due to an ex-boyfriend who wasn’t careful about not eating nuts before kissing me.I was hospitalised for a couple of weeks, and doctors ran trials to find food that I wasn’t allergic to. The only things were oats, eggs, bacon and water. For the next four or five months, that’s all I could eat – it was devastating.I started taking mast cell stabilisers and antihistamines to stop my body’s extreme reactions, which gave me more freedom. I was eating more food, able to be around dogs and cats, and, overall, I was stable. I could also go to restaurants.I also managed to go on holiday to the Caribbean. But while I was there I started eating a salad – after two mouthfuls my throat tightened and I went into anaphylactic shock. Given my medical history, the doctors decided to fly me home.My immune system had overreacted again, and my allergies changed once more. The only things that were safe were oats and water. I was losing a lot of weight, and the doctors wanted to find me something more nutritious. A specialist came up with a vanilla hypoallergenic powder formula that contained sufficient amounts of vitamins, minerals and calories. It was difficult to adjust to such a limited diet again – but I considered myself lucky.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I started documenting my experiences online to raise awareness of the condition, and strangers have given me great ideas to introduce more variety in my food, like making oatmeal cookies or oat pancakes.I’ve had to make huge sacrifices in my life. I can’t be near any pets, feathers or wool. I’m a healthcare recruiter, and work from home to minimise daily stresses. I have to get creative when meeting friends because most people aren’t pet-free. Myfriends keep a spare set of clothes in a ziplock bag and change into them before they see me. It also made dating incredibly hard – people have to avoid eating for three hours before kissing me, in case there are allergens in their food. My boyfriend of eight months is really supportive and eats the same food as me whenever we are together.Despite it all, I like to explore: I take walks in the park, ice-skate and go out for days on a boat. I’ve just had to become a very good planner. I still enjoy going out to eat, but I take a box with my food in it, and cutlery from home. While I can’t risk getting on a plane any more because of airborne allergens, I can travel by car with my family. I always have medication on hand in case of an emergency, like EpiPens,Benadryland inhalers.My condition has made me a lot more compassionate towards people with hidden disabilities. I’d like to think being open about it can help change the way people interact with others, and accommodate allergies of all kinds.I know my situation isn’t ideal, but I always remind myself of the positives – my supportive friends and family, the formula that keeps me nourished, and all the things my body does allow me to do.In terms of the future, I’m working with my team of doctors to reintroduce new foods. It’s been a long and gruelling process, as all of the foods I’m trying to reincorporate have caused me to have scary and debilitating reactions. I am hopeful that one day I’ll be able to expand my diet, but there’s no guarantee. I just try to get through each day.Do you have an experience to share?

In their simplest form, you need only three ingredients (Rice Krispies, butter and marshmallows), but I’ve given them a sweet and salty twist by adding a good dollop of miso and some caramel-like brown butter, which makes them even more addictive.Miso and brown butter Rice Krispies barsPrep5 minCook15 minSet30 minServes9175gRiceKrispies120g unsalted butter240g white marshmallows50g white misoA pinch of saltLine a 20cm x 20cm square tin with baking paper, leaving enough overhang to help you pull the bars out later.

News that may confirm fears! News that may present new opportunities! A report, published by KAM Insights, hasfoundthat, when out at the pub with friends, 50% of UK consumers would rather have two so-called “mid-strength” drinks than one full-strength one. The report, entitled The Mid Strength Opportunity, also finds that 13% of consumers are “coasting”, meaning they’re drinking more mid-strength drinks throughout the evening, so they can stay out for longer and keep tabs on how much alcohol they’re consuming.There’s talk that this presents an “opportunity” to develop the mid-strength category to meet this demand, but what defines a “mid-strength” drink? Well, there’s no legal definition, and the report doesn’t land on an official ABV range, either. It focuses on drinks that are two-thirds the strength of a full-strength beer (let’s say 2-3% ABV) and around half the strength of full-strength wine and spirits (6-7% ABV and around 20% ABV, respectively). Not to mention the fact that this report is brought to us bythe Mid Strength Collective, a group of 12 businesses that produce and sell mid-strength drinks. I always feel a little cynical towards brand-funded reports whose findings seem to promote – surprise, surprise – a demand for the very brands that funded it.That said, The Mid Strength Opportunity does feel relevant and timely. As the wine industry bites its nails over decreased alcohol consumption, this report is just the latest that lays bare why. The modern preoccupation with health and wellness, both physical and mental, is detailed as one of the main reasons behind a new interest in mid-strength drinks: the report finds that 38% of us are moderating our alcohol intake for a healthier liver, 25% for weight loss and 15% for better mental health.This is, of course, great news for anyone who already makes lower-alcohol beverages, or for those with the equipment and means to create them (take a look atmy earlier pieceon low- and no-alcohol wines to see some ways that this is achieved). And, as temperatures rise due to global heating, alcohol levels in wine arerising, too, and some wines that are under a protected designated origin may by default be subject to a minimum alcohol strength, which may automatically rule them out from the mid-strength category.The Mid Strength Opportunity coincides with a new proposedDrink Mid-Strength in March campaign(a new Dry January?), which I can see stretching out indefinitely as consumers seek different ways to moderate without compromising on the importance of the post-work drink with friends, that great British cornerstone of public life.Four mid-strength bottles that might take your fancyBersano Monteolivo Moscato d’Asti DOCG£9.99 Waitrose, 5.5%.

You decideFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorGeorgina LawtonFri 21 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 07.35 EDTShareThe prosecution: PaulI don’t mind Mum wanting to visit Vietnam, but why at Christmas, a time our family is always together?Mum recently booked a Christmas holiday to Vietnam with her partner, Mike. I don’t mind that she wants to go away with Mike, who I like. But she booked the trip without saying a word to me or my sister, Christine.It’s not that we don’t want our mum to be happy, and Christine and I are both adults (I’m 28, she is 32). But since our dad died in 2016, we have spent every Christmas together as a family.There’s no understanding from Mum of how it feels to have traditions suddenly change without your input. It’s especially difficult because these traditions were kept in place to make all of us feel more secure after Dad died. A little heads-up would have been nice.I know I’m almost 30 but my friends spend Christmas with their families. It’s expected if that’s what’s always been doneMum has always made such a big deal of Christmas. Since Dad died she hasn’t wanted to be alone, so Christine and I make sure we are around to spend it with her in our old house or with our dad’s family. It feels like now Mum has found something better to do, she has just switched it up without a word. If Christine or I did that, we’d never hear the end of it.Mum said “you’re old enough to sort your own Christmas out now”, but that isn’t the issue. She needs to see why it’s difficult for us after spending every Christmas together as a family since I was a baby. There’s hypocrisy there from Mum, but also a lack of empathy. It makes me sad that she can’t see it from our point of view and tells us that we’re trying to control her or ruin her plans. It feels as though she doesn’t care about us as much now she’s met Mike.I know I’m almost 30, but my friends still spend Christmas with their families – it’s expected if that’s the way it’s always been. We are still grieving for Dad, so any changes in our family plans will impact us.I want Mum to be happy and enjoy her retirement, but also to listen to how Christine and I feel. She has been very adamant that she’s not in the wrong. We are all still speaking but it’s been difficult since she booked this holiday. I want to move forward and I know she does, too.The defence: MargaretPaul called me selfish for booking the trip without telling him. But I’m 68 and want to see the worldI recently booked a holiday with my partner Mike to Vietnam for Christmas. I’ve never been to Asia before and took inspiration from Christine and Paul, who travelled a lot in their early 20s. I never got to as I had responsibilities, such as raising them, but I’m retired now and want to see the world.However, Christine and Paul are annoyed that I booked the trip without telling them. We haven’t spoken much since I told them over the phone a few weeks ago. They both said I should have run it past them first, because we have spent every Christmas together since their father died.I understand that this is different for them, but their father hasn’t been around for almost 10 years and things change. I don’t think I need to ask their permission to enjoy my life. Paul called me selfish, which I was upset about. He said that because we’ve kept our Christmas traditions, they should have been consulted, but I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong. I should be allowed to move on.Mike says we should cancel the holiday and I’m starting to agree with him. I don’t want to cause a riftChristine and Paul get on with Mike, who I now live with. We bought a house together two years ago when I sold the family home my children grew up in. That was an emotional time, but my kids supported me.They like Mike and know that their father wanted me to move on. He said so before he died after a long illness. But this holiday issue seems to have brought up lots of emotions for the kids. Christine is not happy and has barely said a word to me. We used to speak on the phone every week. Paul says he feels abandoned, but that was never my intention. Both of them live far away, and I’m worried they’ll stop coming to see me.Mike says we should cancel the holiday and I’m starting to agree with him. I don’t want to cause a rift and it might be easier to just rearrange the trip for another time. My children are adults but are acting like toddlers over this. They are both single but that’s not my fault. It’s hard for everyone but I have to be able to do what I want. I’m 68 and after watching my husband die I sometimes worry how long I have left.The jury of Guardian readersShould Margaret have consulted her adult children about her holiday plans?Although Margaret has every right to travel and enjoy her retirement, she should have realised this would be hard on the kids. I don’t think she needs to cancel the holiday, but acknowledging that she could have handled it better and maybe locking in another date to spend quality family time together would go a long way.Emily, 34The family spending Christmas together is a convention, and Margaret has broken it without the courtesy of consulting her children and hearing their views.Chris, 39Although I understand that the loss of a long-held family tradition is upsetting (and perhaps Margaret should have discussed this with her family first), it’s now time for her to have some fun. Paul is old enough to do something else.

But now bras are going from invisible to visible. Out are seamless T-shirt bras. In their place? Lace, sheer and mesh versions.M&S, the home of sensible lingerie, is championing a sexier aesthetic for spring. The retailer holds38.2% of the bra market in the UKand in 2023 sold more than 20m of them, with customers under 30 making up nearly a third of sales.At a preview of M&S’s new collection on Wednesday, a £10 lace bra with bow detailing was spotlighted as a key piece.View image in fullscreenThe Peyton pearl bra, £36 from BluebellaSoozie Jenkinson, the head of lingerie design, says: “For years it was all about a T-shirt bra but now it’s about the return of lace.”While the bras are not specifically designed to be worn exposed, their popularity marks a sharp shift from T-shirt bras that are designed to disappear beneath clothing.At the British lingerie brand Bluebella, bestsellers include a £44 sheer black bra with scalloped edging and a £39 mesh bra with floral embroidery around the cups. Even its basics line features mesh and lace pattern bras in fiery shades of orange and electric blues.Emily Bendell, the founder and CEO of the brand, says demand is coming from customers shifting their perception of what practical underwear is. “We believe the bra isn’t just a functional garment, but a fashion piece that should reflect the wearer’s style,” she says. “More and more women are rightly seeing their bra as a layering piece that they may choose to show part of – as part of their outfit.”While previously the obvious shadow of a black bra under a white cotton shirt or irregular texture caused by a lace bra under a silky top would have been considered a wardrobe malfunction, now anything goes. The trend taps into a wider exposure movement.View image in fullscreenGivenchy featured bras as part of their look in the autumn/winter 2025 collection.Photograph: Indigital.TV/GivenchyIn recent months, we have seen the revival of the noughties whale tail (where a thong is purposefully displayed),boxersdeliberately styled to sit above a waistband andpants as actual pants.

AtParis fashion week, Dior placed lacy bras under even lacier dresses while several of Sarah Burton’s looks for her Givenchy debut included bras that were in-built into mesh dresses.Meanwhile at Miu Miu, the brand that previouslykickstarted the latest iterations of VPL, this time round Miuccia Prada showed dresses and tops that appeared to be falling off the model’s body, exposing their bras. Other models wore conical shaped bullet bras underneath light knits and silky tops.For those who are unsure, the American brandVaqueraoffers the best of both.

The 13-month assignment to an isolated research base on the top of a cliff edge is, as the environment ministry drily puts it, “testing”. Average annual temperatures are -16C but drop much lower during the winter darkness.All applicants are subjected to psychometric analysis “to ensure they are able to cope with the isolation, and can work and live with others in the confined space of the bases”, said the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment. “Only candidates who do not have any negative outcomes from all the background evaluations will be considered.”But can humans ever fully prepare for long-duration remote scientific experiments? Thecrisis currently facing the overwintering crewat the Sanae IV station, more than 2,700 miles from Cape Town, suggests not.Early in their stay, claims of physical assault, sexual harassment and a death threat have been made among the team of nine. Apologies have been made andpsychologists from the mainland are now in “constant” contact with the teamto guide them through the fallout.The allegations might never have been noticed by the wider world had South Africa’sSunday Timesnewspaper not published an email sent by a researcher at Sanae IV accusing a male colleague of “creating an environment of fear and intimidation”.A select few know what life is like on South Africa’s Antarctic research stations, which can be accessed only during summer months by an ice-breaking supply ship.Ken Rice, a physicist at the University of Edinburgh, is one of them, having overwintered at a station in the early 1990s. He went through similar psychological testing, and even had his wisdom teeth removed as a preemptive measure since there would be no practical way to do it once on the permafrost.View image in fullscreenBright aurora australis over the British Antarctic Survey’s mobile Halley VI Research Station in Antarctica.Photograph: Stuart Holroyd/AlamyRice’s trip was to the station’s previous location, Sanae III, a much smaller space buried under 20 metres (65ft) of ice that built up over the years. He spent much of his time outside, twiddling with nearby antennas and equipment used to measure the ozone and ultraviolet light. Rice spent hours filming the aurora australis, or southern lights, dancing in the sky. “The cabin fever, certainly in my case, I don’t think that was an issue,” he said.There were disagreements, of course, “but never, ever anything that was genuinely confrontational where you thought: ‘somebody’s going to lose it’. So yeah, there were aspects that were not ideal, but we kind of got through them.”Sanae IV, a three-module research station built on metal stilts, was completed in 1997 and is much bigger. Rice visited when it was erected. “There are very big living quarters, and I think there’s a snooker room, but there’s a couple of lounges and plenty of accommodation space.” That was the one aspect people did not realise about the station, he said: that there is space to get away from your colleagues.The dynamics of how to keep humans living and working effectively together has been a fascination for centuries, particularly during the ages of global exploration at sea.View image in fullscreenSir Ernest Shackleton (left) and his second-in-command Frank Wild on the pack ice with the men of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition ice after their ship, the Endurance, sank in the Weddell Sea in November 1915.Photograph: George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty ImagesAntarctica is the location of perhaps themost celebrated story of teamwork under intense loneliness and stress. Ernest Shackleton’s 1914 expedition failed its mission to make the first land crossing of the continent. Yet personal accounts suggestthe crew remained shockingly united, despite enduring hundreds of days of hardship, including having to shoot and eat their canine companions. All 28 men survived.Acentury later, a new frontier is driving interest in the impact of isolation: space. With years-long Mars missions looking more likely, and long-duration trips already happening on the InternationalSpaceStation, scientists are once again investigating.Several so-called “analogue” missions are under way, in which people are willingly locked away on Earth to simulate what it would feel like to travel deep into space.Last year, a crew stepped out of a 3D-printed habitat in Texas aftera 378-day simulated Mars surface mission. To add realism, artificial time delays to mimic communication lags to Earth – up to 22 minutes each way – were implemented. Nasa has not released details of the group dynamics, although the commander, Kelly Haston, said the worst they experienced were “crabby days”. A separate eight-month Mars simulation in Hawaii ended withone participant saying: “Not once did anyone use a personal insult.”View image in fullscreenDr Suzanne Bell of Nasa’s Behavioral Health and Performance Laboratory walks in Mars Dune Alpha, a 3D-printed Martian landscape at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, 2023.Photograph: Mark Felix/AFP/Getty ImagesThelargest-ever analogue experiment, a 520-day mission in Moscow, also appeared to have been a success, with six men emerging from their artificial Mars500 habitat looking tired and thin but happy. Nevertheless, its crew was reportedly all-male because a previous experiment had ended in a scandal when a Canadian scientist accused a male colleagueof forcibly kissing her.View image in fullscreenParticipants in the 520-day Mars500 experiment, which took place in Moscow in 2010-11.Photograph: Sergei Karpukhin/ReutersAccounts from research stations in Antarctica have also been seen as vital case studies – the continent has even been called “White Mars” because of its desolation – as have those from isolated communities. A1983 US psychology studyasked rural Minnesotans how they dealt with being cut off and found that just being aware of the concept of “cabin fever” helped people endure loneliness.South Africa’s environment ministry says the situation is now calm at the Sanae IV base, where recent developments have drawn comparisons with another incident at one of the country’s Antarctic outposts –an alleged axe attackon a researcher’s laptop by a colleague in 2017.​Niel Malan, an expedition physicist who overwintered at Sanae IV in 1999, said people inevitably took time to get used to isolation and tempers could flare. “But humans adapt, and most teams work through their initial frictions and learn to work together effectively.”View image in fullscreenA physics lab on the Sanae IV base.Photograph: Antarctic Legacy ArchiveThe work at Sanae IV, he said, was no different from work anywhere else. “Most of it is routine and boring,” he said. “Personally, I was a member of a very successful team. We worked through our frictions without violence, and we’re still brothers.”Ultimately, interpersonal conflict may be a shared human problem, he said, whether people are on a cliff in Antarctica or in an office in central London.“As far as I can see it’s a story of violence in the workplace,” he added. “The only things that make it noteworthy is that it happened in an isolated place, and that the email with the complaint was leaked to the media.”Explore more on these topicsAntarcticaMarsSpacePsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The blasts gave off ferocious heat and blinding light. He told her people were not consulted or given protective gear against bombs detonated by the US and UK atKiritimati Island, now part of Kiribati, decades ago.People inKiribatisuffered grave health consequences as a result of exposure to radiation from the tests in the late 1950s and early 1960s, a legacy they say continues to this day. Johnson says there’s a lack of accountability and awareness of how nuclear testing by foreign countries has harmed her people and homeland.“It doesn’t matter if they’re very small island nations, their stories matter,” the 24-year-old says.Endless fallout: the Pacific idyll still facing nuclear blight 77 years onRead moreBetween 1946 and 1996, the US, the UK and France conducted more than 300 underwater and atmosphericnuclear tests in the Pacific region,according toPace University International Disarmament Institute. Kiribati, French Polynesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands were among the most affected.For decades the countries have called for justice for the ongoing environmental and health impacts ofnuclear weapons development. The push intensified this month as supporters of the UNtreaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons(TPNW) – including many from Pacific nations – met to discuss the treaty and call for wider ratification.The treaty imposes a ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries in such activities. It entered into force in 2021 and has98 countries as parties or signatories. In the Pacific region11 countrieshave backed the treaty.Treaty supporters want universal global support but many countries – including the US, the UK and France – oppose the treaty.View image in fullscreenAnti-nuclear activists protest in New York.Photograph: Bianca Otero/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThe nine nuclear armed countries argue thatnuclear weaponsare critical to their security. Likewise, Nato nations, Japan, South Korea and others are not yet party to the treaty.Australia, where theUK conducted nuclear tests in the 1950s, hasnot ratified the TPNW despitethe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, saying in 2018 that Australia would do so the treaty when his party was in power.A spokesperson for Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Australia “shares the ambition of states parties to the TPNW of a world without nuclear weapons” but, like the US, the UK and France,prioritisesthetreaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Many TPNWsupporters arguethat the treatystrengthens and complementsthe non-proliferation treaty, while opponents like Nato say it isincompatiblewith its obligations.Representatives from the UN diplomatic missions ofFrance, the US and the UK did not respond to requests for comment on the TPNW.‘Nuclear risks rising’Against this backdrop, politicians, activists and other representatives gathered at UN headquarters in New York this month for week-long discussions on how to secure more support for the TPNW.Hinamoeura Morgant-Cross, a representative of the French Polynesia assembly, was among the parliamentarians. She says her family wassignificantly affectedby Frenchnuclear detonationsat Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls between 1966 and 1996. Morgant-Cross told the forum high rates ofradiation-induced cancerin her family had motivated her to become an anti-nuclear activist and assembly member.“It started with my grandma with thyroid cancer,” she said. “Then her first daughter – my auntie – with thyroid cancer.

It has expressed concern that article six of the treaty – which calls for countries bound by the treaty to provide victim assistance and environmental remediation – could absolve the US from responsibility to address damage caused by nuclear tests. Efforts to establish aninternational trust fundto support article six are ongoing.“While we want to make sure that there’s no nuclear testing and no nuclear war … we feel the TPNW doesn’t go far enough to address issues that affect all of us,” said theMarshall Islandsambassador to the UN, John Silk.Speaking on a panel of nuclear survivors and frontline communities, Kiribati’s UN ambassador, Teburoro Tito, encouraged the Marshall Islands and all countries to sign and ratify the treaty.“We hope they will soon join the TPNW which we believe is the most effective way of dealing with the aftermath of nuclear use and testing,” Tito said.View image in fullscreenParliamentarians from around the world discuss the abolition of nuclear weapons.Photograph: Derek French/IcanJohnson wants to raise awareness of thedevastating impactsof nuclear weapons in the Pacific and sees the treaty as a pathway toward justice.

For Aubin, it’s Henry Ford, an ardent antisemite whom Hitler called “an inspiration”. She believes being a hater can aid in scholarship: “Disliking someone or having a problem with their historical legacy is worth talking about, and brings more people into learning about history.”That’s why Aubin, who spent last year lecturing in the history department at UC Davis and San Francisco State University and is about to begin a full-time postdoctoral fellowship at Yale, startedThis Guy Sucked, a history podcast about terrible men. In each episode, Aubin speaks to a historian about their biggest villain, from Ford and Voltaire to Plato and Jerry Lee Lewis.Aubin is used to studying some pretty rancid individuals – her area of expertise includes the relationship of the United States to Nazis who immigrated there after the second world war.‘Let’s dig into the archives and tell the truth’: interrogating Yale’s connections to slaveryRead moreThe anti-woke crowd might say Aubin’s work contributes to a retrogressive sort of cancel culture. Or more traditional historians, trained to see these figures as complex products of their time, could say that her name-calling flattens any thoughtful critique. But Aubin believes you can be a scholar and a hater. She allows that “schadenfreude is sort of the initial draw” of the cheeky title. But taking a critical look at a figure who may have been venerated in a high school textbook “shows them as a real person, a person who had flaws, and those flaws are essential to understanding why they’re important”.The guest host historians Aubin taps have spent their entire professional lives studying these men, writing books and teaching classes. “They have nothing to gain from canceling them,” she said. “What they do have to gain is a respect and dedication to talking about history in a way that is holistic, that understands legacy as something that encompasses both positive and negative, and the wholeness of a person.”The only requirement for Aubin’s subjects is that they have to be dead (so she can’t be sued for libel). So far, all of the episodes have been about men, but the title isn’t exclusionary – she’ll get to evil women too, someday.View image in fullscreenClaire Aubin, host of This Guy Sucked.Photograph: Claire Aubin“There is no bias in terms of who I want to talk about,” she said. “Women have complicated roles too. There have been bad people throughout history from all kinds of backgrounds.” But for now, when women come up on the podcast, they’re often “the targets of the men we’re talking about”, meaning victims of their abuse.An episode on Voltaire with the London School of Economics professor Eleanor Janega confronts the French enlightenment writer’s reputation as a champion of universal human rights. Though Voltaire opposed slavery, he never called for its abolition, and made money off the slave trade through investments in the French East India Company (he also had a sexual relationship with his niece).Janega believes that Voltaire’s sharp and witty criticism of the Catholic church and monarchy is rightly venerated, but warns against hero worship of any supposedly great man in history. “The bar is subterranean when it comes to 18th-century people and the concept of human rights,” she says on the show. That’s perhaps why Voltaire has an untouchable, mythic position as a writer and satirist.Some of Aubin’s bad guys come off as low-hanging fruit – an episode onJerry Lee Lewis, for instance, doesn’t reveal much that hasn’t already been covered in numerous films, books and obituaries of the late rock’n’roll icon who infamously married his female cousin. Still, there are enough specific details to keep the podcast from sounding as if Aubin and the guest host Robert Komaniecki, a music theory professor at the University of British Columbia, are merely reading a Wikipedia page, including a tidbit about Lewis once punching Janis Joplin in the face because he didn’t like hanging out with a drunk woman (drunk men were fine).There are people that have had a profoundly negative impact on your life, so it’s important to add them back into the storyClaire AubinSome of the men are not as well known to a general audience, such as Cesare Lombroso, the influential Italian criminologist and eugenicist who believed that criminals could be identified by physical features and defects. Or Samuel Cummings, a small-arms dealer who sold guns to dictators, made millions from South Africa’s apartheid and got Americans hooked on gun ownership, leading to its current crises of mass shootings and violence.“There are people that have had a profoundly negative impact on your life, so it’s important to add them back into the story,” Aubin said.One thing these men have in common: nearly every one of them worked to protect their own legacy while they were still alive. Lombroso requested that his head be preserved in a jar for study; Charlemagne paid court historians to write friendly biographies.“These people are specifically responsible for the way they were largely accepted uncritically by the public after their deaths,” Aubin said. “That makes all of our jobs as historians so much harder.”Though she doesn’t focus on guys that suck in the present day, Aubin believes her work sends an important message to them.“Women are being treated worse now, minorities are being treated worse,” she said. “It’s really important that this show works against that, and shows there are experts who are willing to say: ‘There are people in history who were bad, and historians will remember them negatively.’”Explore more on these topicsHistoryPodcastsPodcastingWomenMenFrancois Marie Arouet de VoltaireJerry Lee LewisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She didn’t think it was going to be possible for her to have a baby. She had looked into solo parenthood, but didn’t think she would be able to afford it.Then, she became friends withTom Hayes. He worked at the Hive, an arts centre in Shrewsbury where Nicola was a trustee.“The first thing we talked about was the fact that all of our friends in Shrewsbury had kids and so didn’t want to hang out with us as much as they used to, and weren’t available to come to the pub. And so that’s what we sort of bonded over.”Tom is gay, and was also single when they met. He told Nicola he had also looked into solo parenting.Eventually Nicola worked up the courage to ask Tom if he would consider having a baby with her. She decided an LGBTQ+ history month party at the arts centre was the perfect moment.“I just started knocking back the wine, and I got really drunk. I was working out what I was going to say. So I grabbed his head and whispered in his ear. I just can’t remember actually asking the question, but I think it was something like: ‘How would you feel about having a baby with me?’ He said: ‘As a donor, or, you know, a dad?’ And I was like: ‘No, I mean let’s do it together.’ And then he’s basically said: ‘Yeah, go on.’”Last year, Nicola gave birth to a baby girl.Nicola and Tom tellHelen Piddabout the challenges and joys of having a baby with a friend. “It’s a struggle having a baby, but it’s also amazing,” Tom tells Helen. “It’s just such a privilege, isn’t it, to be there to experience all of that, experience childhood again, and to do it with your best friend. It just felt right.”Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingToday in FocusPregnancyChildrenFamily"

The volcanic field has been active for more than 80,000 years. It is dotted with craters, lakes and fumaroles as well as roads, factories and the homes of more than 600,000 peopleByAlessandro GandolfiFri 21 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTShareIn the square in Monterusciello, a few kilometres from Pozzuoli, 12-year-old Angelo Di Roberto climbed into the civil defence bus with his grandfather. “None of my schoolmates wanted to come, but I wanted to” he said. “It seemed like the right thing to do.”He was right. It was important. The authorities were simulating a large-scale evacuation, the kind they would have to carry out in the event of a volcanic eruption in the seismically activeCampi Flegreior Phlegraean Fields near the southern Italian city of Naples.Everyone in the sprawling volcanic area hopes it will never happen, but the signs are ominous.View image in fullscreenDuring an exercise to simulate an evacuation in the event of a volcanic eruption in the Phlegraean Fields, Angelo Di Roberto, 70, his nephew of the same name, 12, and Alessandro Celardo, 29, all from Monterusciello, arrive at Naples central station, from where in theory they should depart for Milan.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSince January 2024, the land in certain parts of the Phlegraean Fields has risen by about 20 centimetres (eight inches) as a result of a phenomenon called bradyseism, the gradual uplift or lowering of part of the Earth’s surface caused by the filling or emptying of an undergroundmagma chamberor hydrothermal activity, particularly in volcaniccalderas.Earthquakes continue to be recorded almost every day. There were 6,066 in 2023 and as many as 6,740 in 2024. The seismic swarm continues in 2025, generating anxiety and fear that leads many people to spend nights in their cars or outdoors. The most violent earthquake to hit the area for four decades shook buildings in and around Naples earlier this month.View image in fullscreenEvery year 700,000 tourists climb the great cone of Vesuvius to admire one of the most beautiful gulfs in the world. But if you stretch your gaze westwards, beyond Fuorigrotta, you catch a glimpse of other small, almost completely unknown volcanoes: these are the Phlegraean Fields, an enormous caldera which is home to more than 600,000 people.View image in fullscreenThe Monte Nuovo crater with the Naples bypass on the left and the town of Pozzuoli on the right.

Here the walls are covered with yellowish sulphurous incrustations that are slowly but surely breaking through the walls and floor.“Get out quickly because the carbon dioxide levels are very high and could be harmful,” Rosario shouts.View image in fullscreenHomes and farmland in the Cigliano craters in the heart of the Phlegraean Fields.Solfatara, with its white rocks and perennial vapours, is an evocative place and a destination for tourists. But it is also fraught with danger.

The photo is kept at the headquarters of the cultural association which collects photographs, newspaper clippings, books and other material on the Phlegraean Fields and the phenomenon of bradyseism.Bradyseism, literally “slow movement”, continues to raise the ground across the Phlegraean Fields. It raised Pozzuoli by two metres in the 1980s, leading to the evacuation of 40,000 people from the Rione Terra neighbourhood.Bradyseism has always existed in these parts. On the Roman columns of the Temple of Serapis you can still see the holes made by stone-eroding organisms, created when the ground subsided about 10 metres in the following centuries. For a long time they were submerged in sea water.View image in fullscreenMauro Di Vito (left), the director of INGV’s Vesuvius observatory, in the monitoring room, where signals collected from the Vesuvius, Phlegraean Fields, Ischia and Stromboli volcanoes converge.“The ground keeps breaking and deforming,” Mauro Di Vito, the director of INGV’s Vesuvius observatory, explained. “And the accumulation of stress generates earthquakes. But this is an expected phenomenon and it is very likely that earthquakes will continue. We will all have to get used to reacting in a positive way, without panicking. We scientists cannot exclude anything. Our job is to monitor and measure the parameters.”The Phlegraean Fields are among the most monitored volcanoes in the world, designed to detect the smallest sign of an awakening that will happen sooner or later. There is a contingency plan for a mass evacuation, but will it ever work? If the supervolcano really were to erupt, would it leave anyone behind?View image in fullscreenTwo women enter the swimming pool at the Terme Vesuviana spa in Naples.

Think of Vesuvian apricots, figs and cherries, the Piennolo tomato and native grape varieties such as Piedirosso and Falanghina. They have also generated thermal emissions that have been exploited for centuries and provided precious yellow ash stone known as tuff, with which Campania’s towns were built. This is maybe why, despite being one of the most dangerous lands in the world, the area between the Phlegraean Fields and Vesuvius is also one of the most populous.View image in fullscreenPeople dance, sing and play traditional instruments at the summit of Mount Somma on the morning of 3 May during a celebration dedicated to the volcano when Christian rites mix with pagan tradition.View image in fullscreenCertainly, those who live in the area establish a visceral bond with the volcano built on fear and respect. To protect themselves from the risks, the inhabitants have always relied on a belief in divine benevolence, naming not only churches and festivals after local Madonnas and saints, but also rituals. One is dedicated to the melting of the blood of San Gennaro, which for centuries has been thought by some to ward off magma. The volcano has featured in art, poetry, popular song and everyday festive life. It has moulded the fatalistic character of those who live here, and who know that, at any moment, everything could end.View image in fullscreenA tour of underground Naples, a dense network of tunnels, aqueducts and passages dug into the volcanic rock.There are many problems in the area.

An officer wearing a captain’s epaulettes announced the takeover of the palace in a video and confirmed that troops were inside the compound.In a post on X, Khaled al-Aiser, Sudan’s information minister, said the military had retaken the palace. “Today the flag is raised, the palace is back and the journey continues until victory is complete,” hewrote.Intermittent gunfire could be heard throughout the capital on Friday, but it was not clear if it involved fighting or was celebratory.Following the capture, RSF – led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – responded with deadly drone attacks. Shortly after state television broadcast scenes of fighters celebrating in the palace, three of its journalists were killed in a drone strike, an army source told Agence France-Presse.View image in fullscreenA screen grab from a video shows Sudanese army members celebrating inside the presidential palace.Photograph: Social media/ReutersIn a statement on Telegram, the RSF said it had launched a “lightning operation” around the palace that “killed more than 89 enemy personnel and destroyed various military vehicles.”“The battle for the Republican Palace is not over yet,” the militia vowed.The RSF pledged to “continue to fight” to dislodge the army from areas it has retaken.Its fighters are reportedly still scattered around the city centre, hiding in nearby buildings and stationed in part of the bombed out airport.The seizure of the palace, which overlooks the Nile and was the seat of government before the war, follows months of steady advances for the army in the Khartoum area in recent months. Earlier this week, the army said its forces had merged from the north and south, hemming in the RSF.RSF fighters, who seized much of the capital in the early stages of the war – forcing the army-aligned government to flee to Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast – have been all but expelled from the city.View image in fullscreenPicture released on social media by the Sudanese Armed Forces after taking over the Republican Palace in Khartoum.Photograph: APHowever, the army gain does not mean an end to the war is imminent. The RSF has consolidated control in the western Darfur region, hardening battle lines and moving the country towards de facto partition. The RSF is working to set up a parallel government in areas it controls, although that is not expected to receive widespread international recognition.Late on Thursday, the RSF claimed it seized control of the Sudanese city of al-Maliha, a strategic desert city in North Darfur near the borders of Chad and Libya. Sudan’s military has acknowledged fighting around al-Maliha but has not said it lost the city.Al-Maliha is about 125 miles (200km) north of the city of El Fasher, which remains held by the Sudanese military despite near-daily strikes by the surrounding RSF.View image in fullscreenThe war in Sudan has led to widespread famine across the country.Photograph: Patricia Simon/APThe head of the UN children’s agency has said the conflict in Sudan has created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. The war has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.Sudan, in north-eastern Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced theremoval of the longtime autocratic president, Omar al-Bashir, in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Dagaloled a military coupin 2021. The RSF and Sudan’s military thenbegan fighting each other in 2023.Since the war began, the Sudanese military and the RSF have faced allegations of human rights abuses. Before Joe Biden left office, the US state departmentdeclared the RSF was committing genocide.The military and the RSF have denied committing abuses.The war has attracted external actors with interests in the country, including Chad, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Libya, Qatar and Russia.Saudi Arabiaand theUnited Arab Emirateshave been accused of providing financial and military support to the Sudanese army and the RSF respectively, but they have denied it.AFP, Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSudanMiddle East and north AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He spent the next two years fighting on the frontline. Now he is among those who fear Tigray is on the brink of conflict once more.“We don’t want to become a battleground, but it seems like war is near, maybe even inevitable,” he said.The war between Tigray’s rebellious rulers and Ethiopia’s federal governmentended in 2022, leaving about 600,000 people dead and nearly 10% of women aged between 15 and 49 living in Tigray raped, according to aBritish Medical Journal study.But the failure to implement most of the ceasefire’s provisions – including the return of nearly 1 million displaced people – and a scramble over resources has split the ruling Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) party.Tensions escalated this month when Tigray’s interim president, Getachew Reda,tried to fire three senior military commanders, having previously accused his forces of attempting a coup.Rounded up, massacred and posted on social media: can Ethiopia bring justice for atrocities in Tigray?Read moreA coup now appears to have taken place. Last week, a rival TPLF faction, led by the party chair Debretsion Gebremichael, installed its officials in provincial government offices. It also took over the mayor’s office and the main radio station in the regional capital, Mekelle. Getachew fled to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.On Saturday a skirmish in Tigray resulted in three deaths. A few days before, another person was killed during a dispute in the town of Adi Gudem.All week long queues formed outside Tigray’s banks as people withdrew their cash, and flights out sold out. Armed men roamed Mekelle’s streets at night, checking people’s ID.“Fear and uncertainty prevail,” said a resident, who asked not to be named. “My friends are planning to leave for Addis Ababa, Kenya and Uganda because of the fear of war.”Against this backdrop, concerns are also increasing over tensions between Ethiopia andEritrea. Despite fighting alongside each other in Tigray, the neighbouring countries have been at loggerheads for months over the determination of Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, to regain access to the Red Sea, which Ethiopia lost when Eritrea seceded in 1993.View image in fullscreenA school used as shelter for internally displaced people in Mekelle. The UN put the number of IDPs in Ethiopia’s Tigray region at 1.1 million late last year.Photograph: Michele Spatari/AFP/GettyHaving previously made overtures to the breakaway republic of Somaliland, Abiy set his sights on Eritrea’s port of Assab. He has repeatedly said sea access was “existential” for Ethiopia, which with 130 million people is the world’s most populous landlocked country. He described losing Eritrea’s coastline as a“historical mistake”.Eritrea has ordered a nationwide mobilisation and is trying to undermine Abiy by aiding rebels fighting Ethiopia’s military in the Amhara region bordering Tigray. There are reports that Eritrean intelligence helped Debretsion’s TPLF faction during last week’s coup.Ethiopia has sent tanks and troops to the Eritrean border, and state media have been amplifying voices justifying Ethiopia’s claims over Assab port.Last week, Gen Tsadkan Gebretensae, Tigray’s vice-president,warned that war could erupt “at any moment”and the region risked “becoming a battlefield” again.Payton Knopf and Alexander Rondos, the former US and EU special envoys to the region, described developments as “dry tinder waiting for a match that couldignite an interstate war between Ethiopia and Eritrea”.‘They just left the corpses lying there’: survivors speak about the horrors of a massacre in northern TigrayRead moreAbiy said he wanted Ethiopia to regain the port peacefully. “Ethiopia has no intention to invade Eritreato gain Red Sea access,” he said on Thursday. “Our desire is to talk about it under the principle of give and take, in a mutually beneficial manner, and according to commercial law.”He spoke after meeting the rival Tigray factions. It appears Abiy declined to intervene in support of Getachew, which could have sparked fresh fighting.Abiy could seek a deal to secure the support of Tigray, which still has a formidable 200,000-strong military force.Tigray’s new leaders, meanwhile, want to regain control of western Tigray, a fertile area with gold deposits that was seized by Amhara forces during the war. Any attempt to recapture it could also spark fresh conflict, said Ahmed Soliman, at the geopolitical thinktank Chatham House.“The crux is how things evolve in Tigray and how Abiy responds,” Soliman said. “If there is no agreement, the situation could certainly escalate.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentEthiopiaEritreaConflict and armsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A government filing on Wednesday accused Boasberg of engaging in a “judicial fishing expedition” in seeking more information about deportation flights.Judge demands answers from White House on deportation flights to El SalvadorRead moreThe judge said he often advises his law clerks that their most valuable assets are their reputation and their credibility.“I would just ask you to make sure that your team maintains that lesson,” Boasberg told Ensign.“The policy ramifications of this are incredibly troublesome and problematic and concerning,” Boasbergsaid, adding: “The government is not being terribly cooperative at this point … but I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my order and who was responsible.”The escalating dispute between Boasberg and the Trump White House has raised concerns among critics of the president and some legal experts about a potentially looming constitutional crisis if the administration defies judicial decisions. Boasberg has also ordered US justice department officials to explain by next Tuesday why he should not find that theyviolated the 15 March orderby failing to return two planes carrying the deportees that landed in El Salvador – where the migrants are being held – after he issued his ruling on Saturday evening.Under the US constitution, the executive and the judiciary are co-equal branches of government, along with Congress, in a system devised for checks and balances among the three.Trump has saidhe would not defyany court orders. Speaking to reporters on Friday, the Republican said his administration has the authority to “get bad people out of our country” while insulting Boasberg as “a radical left lunatic”.Trump on Tuesday called for the judge to be impeached by Congress in a process that could lead to his removal from the bench,drawing a rare rebukefrom the US chief justice, John Roberts.Boasberg, appointed to the federal bench by Barack Obama, was confirmed in 2011 in a bipartisan 96-0 vote in the US Senate. He had previously been appointed to a local Washington DC court by George W Bush, Obama’s Republican predecessor.Trump’s administration over the weekend invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify the expulsions of the alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua without final removal orders from immigration judges.Boasberg issued a 14-day block on any such deportations, finding that the Alien Enemies Act did not provide a basis for Trump’s assertion that Tren de Aragua’s presence in the United States amounted to an act of war.Lawyers and family members of several of the 238 men deported to El Salvador over the weekend have said their relatives had no ties to the gang. “I don’t know why they connected him to the Tren de Aragua if he has nothing to do with that,” Deicy Aldana, the wife of detained migrant Andres Guillermo Morales, told Reuters on Thursday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Noem’s notice said they will lose their legal status on 24 April.The new policy affects people who are already in the US and who came under the humanitarian parole program. It follows an earlierTrump administrationdecision to end what it called the “broad abuse” of the humanitarian parole, a long-standing legal tool presidents have used to allow people from countries where there is war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the US.During his campaign,Donald Trumppromised to deport millions of people who are in the US illegally, and as president he has also been ending legal pathways for immigrants to come to the US and to stay.US deportees face brutal conditions in El Salvador mega-prison: ‘Severe overcrowding, inadequate food’Read moreUnder the new policy, parolees must depart before their parole termination date if they have no lawful basis to stay in the US.“Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status,” DHS said.Trump said on 6 March that he would decide “very soon” whether to strip the parole status from some 240,000 Ukrainians who have fled to the US during the conflict with Russia. Trump’s remarks came in response to a Reuters report that said his administration planned to revoke the status for Ukrainians as soon as April.Biden launched a parole entry program for Venezuelans in 2022 and expanded it to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those nationalities. Diplomatic and political relations between the four countries and the United States have been strained.The new legal pathways came as Biden tried to clamp down on illegal crossings at theUS-Mexico border.The Trump administration’s decision to strip the legal status from half a million migrants could make many vulnerable to deportation if they choose to remain in the US. It remains unclear how many who entered the US on parole now have another form of protection or legal status.The order has already beenchallengedin federal courts. A group of American citizens and immigrants sued the Trump administration for ending humanitarian parole and are seeking to reinstate the programs for people of the four nationalities.Lawyers and activists raised their voices to denounce the government’s decision.Friday’s action is “going to cause needless chaos and heartbreak for families and communities across the country”, said Karen Tumlin, founder and director of Justice Action Center, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit at the end of February.

The following evening authorities responded to another call from someone stranded in the mountains with a broken ankle, according to the statement.The number of illegal crossings at the southern border of the US fell last month to thelowest figuresrecorded since 2000, asDonald Trumppledged to dramatically reshape immigration in the country with mass deportations. At the same time crackdowns within the US quickly increased – officials arrested more immigrants inFebruarythan in any month in the last seven years.Research has found that Trump’s immigration policies have led to increasinglydangerous conditionsfor immigrants. The US president’s “impenetrable” border wall, which he made a key pledge of his first term, resulted in increased immigrant deaths and devastating injuries from falling, according to a2022 study.In the Otay Mountain wilderness, where three people died last week, the terrain is “harsh” and conditions are “extreme”, the US border patrol said in a statement. People who attempt to cross the border in the area “often face the risk of dehydration, starvation, heatstroke, and hypothermia”.On the evening of 14 March, as a storm brought rain and cold weather to the area, agents responded to a call for help near a trail where they found two women, one of whom had died. Agents were dispatched to another call that night from a group of people experiencing symptoms of hypothermia and difficulty breathing, and found a 16-year-old girl. Two men who had been traveling with her, including her father, were deceased.In the statement from US border patrol, Jeffrey D Stalnaker, the acting chief patrol agent of the San Diego sector, warned people against crossing the US border illegally.“The Otay Mountain wilderness is unpredictable and unforgiving.

About 60% of the building, including the books, is located inCanada. Upstairs, in the opera house, the audience sits in the US while the performers are in Canada.Under the new rules, Canadians will need to go through a formal border crossing before entering the library.“This closure not only compromises Canadian visitors’ access to a historic symbol of cooperation and harmony between the two countries but also weakens the spirit of cross-border collaboration that defines this iconic location,” the town of Stanstead said in a press release on Thursday.map of US-Canada border delineation at the libraryUS Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to queries posed on Friday.In a statement to Reuters, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the US was responding to drug trafficking.“Drug traffickers and smugglers were exploiting the fact that Canadians could use the US entrance without going through customs.

But adeclassified copy of the reviewwas not released by the government until Friday morning.Even before the change of government in the US, it warned the instability caused by the growing rivalry between China and the US – “a clash of interests and values that has proved impossible to reconcile and hard even to manage peacefully” – was being augmented by a “loose bloc of autocracies” undermining global security.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“The post-Cold War order has collapsed,” the 2024 Independent Intelligence Review said.“It is not yet clear what will take its place, but for the foreseeable future Australia faces a world shaped by competition between nation-states and global geopolitical and economic fragmentation.”The review said a “major regional conflict”, while not likely on its assessment, was “no longer unthinkable”. And it said coercion, disinformation and propaganda were routinely used across the Indo-Pacific region.“The world in which Australia seeks security and prosperity is significantly more contested, fragmented and volatile.“Major-power conflict is no longer unimaginable. New security threats are prominent, many amplified by technological change.”The report’s authors, Dr Heather Smith, a former deputy director general of the Office of National Assessments and a professor at the Australian National University’s national security college, and Richard Maude, a former director general of the Office of National Assessments and executive director of policy at Asia Society Australia, argue three factors are the most consequential for Australia’s intelligence community.There have been shifts in relative global power balances, accompanied by a sharp contest between nation-states for power and influence. This contest is at once diplomatic, military, economic and technological, and is pursued within Australia’s borders as much as beyond them, including through cyber-attacks and foreign interference.New technologies are being used to amplify some old threats while creating entirely new ones.There are a range of transnational challenges, including climate change, pandemics, irregular migration, terrorism, and polarisation and fraying social cohesion in many democracies. In a globalised world, the ripples from even geographically distant conflicts inevitably reach Australia, with significant, often grave, consequences.The review argues that China and Russia are working more closely together to challenge US dominance, along with other autocratic states in loose self-interested alliance.“Closer cooperation between China and Russia in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a notable shift. Russia, Iran and North Korea are deepening ties. A loose bloc of autocracies is now forcibly pursuing their national interests in ways that undercut global security and stability.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And the technologies central to the clean energy transition – like solar panels, batteries and wind turbines – have become vectors of competition in themselves, as countries worry about security of supply and seek sovereign industrial advantage.”The report said climate change presented significant security challenges – including food insecurity, ocean health, water shortages, disrupted supply chains and large-scale climate-induced migration.Albanese said Australia’s intelligence agencies were crucial to the country’s security “and we have full confidence in their capacity”.“We will continue to invest in capability to ensure Australia’s intelligence community can deal with emerging threats and challenges,” he said in a statement accompanying the review’s release on Friday.The review found that while Australia’s intelligence agencies had been broadly successful in protecting national interests, intelligence agencies should be bolstered to be more prepared for future threats.Among the 67 recommendations was a call for an economic security function to be set up within the Department of Treasury to protect against financial threats.The review said economic decisions within the government was an area where national security risks were “becoming more challenging to manage”.“In our judgement, a system re-design is needed,” it said.The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said national security and economic security were becoming more connected.“National security and economic policy have become more and more intertwined,” Chalmers said. “They’ve always been intertwined to some extent, but they’re now almost inseparable from each other.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian intelligence agenciesDonald TrumpAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It is a lot for a 12-year-old.”If their GP on theNew South Walesmid-north coast could prescribe Ritalin alongside her daughter’s other medicines, “it would make everything so much easier”, said Grobke, who takes time off her accountancy work to accompany her daughter on the journey every three months.Ritalin is often first choice for ADHD – but a new Australian guide says there’s no one-size-fits-allRead moreWithrising rates and awareness of ADHDcombined with thedifficulty of accessing specialists in regional areas, the Royal Australasian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) is calling for a federal government commitment to increasing the number of medicines GPs can prescribe, including essential medicines for people with ADHD.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe college says a standardised approach to prescribing ADHD medicine – the regime differs in every state and territory – would alleviate growing pressure on the system responsible for treating the more than a million Australians who live with ADHD.In most states and territories, psychiatrists must diagnose and initially prescribe stimulant medication such as Ritalin and Vyvanse, after which patients are co-managed by a GP. If a patient is under 18, a paediatrician can also fulfil the psychiatrist’s role.In Queensland, GPs can diagnose and prescribe ADHD medicine for children but not adults, while Western Australia has committed to reforms allowing GPs to diagnose and prescribe stimulant medication for ADHD.For patients, the inconsistencies lead to higher medical costs when attempting to access essential medicines; for doctors, the patchwork approach impacts moves between jurisdictions, the college says.Dr Tim Jones, the RACGP chair of child and young persons’ health, is based in Tasmania, where patients face an almost three-year wait for ADHD assessments. He said collaborative solutions were needed now – and that the current inconsistencies in the prescribing of ADHD medication were “very confusing”.“Patients with stable ADHD see specialists on an ongoing basis every six months for scripts. We could take on that care – and that would allow less cost to families, but also it would free up those specialist services to conduct more assessments and deal with some of the wait times,” Jones said.“Having universal rules around ADHD prescribing will be a huge step in the right direction.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rudd’s office laterreleased a statementsaying the comments had been removed and that Rudd was looking forward “to working with President Trump and his team to continue strengthening the US-Australia alliance”.The opposition has marked Australia’s ability to negotiate as a “test” for the Albanese government, while Peter Dutton claimed a Coalition government would have been able to secure the exemption.But Courtney, who has continued to speak out against the tariffs in Washington, said he had been “impressed” with the Australian government’s “restrained” response to the saga.“[The Australian government is] working very, very hard in terms of making their case, which, in my opinion, is overwhelming compared to other countries,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thankfully though, low waste doesn’t have to mean no fun.With a little creativity, out-of-the-box thinking and some help from my community, I was able to throw an entertaining and colourful back yard garden party that produced little waste – and was more affordable to boot. Here are some ideas to help you plan a low-impact party.Reduce food waste and packagingDisposable plates, cups and cutlery are among the most wasteful aspects of parties – they’re single-use, wrapped in plastic and usually get dumped in the rubbish. Over-catering food is also costly to both the environment and your hip pocket. I sidestepped all that by hosting a pot-luck dinner – where each guest brought a plate of food to share – served using metal cutlery and compostable plates.View image in fullscreenDisposable plates are among the most wasteful aspects of parties.Photograph: Penpak Ngamsathain/Getty ImagesAnother option, says zero-waste authorErin Rhoads, is the nationalParty Kit Network. Community members offer reusable tableware, decorations and even party games to borrow, use and return locally. Some party kits are free, while schools and childcare centres may charge a small hire fee for fundraising. “As a parent, planning a party for your child can be really stressful,” Rhoads says. “With the kit, everyone gets to see how easily reusables can be integrated into a celebration.”By hosting my 40th at my place, I could better control sustainable decisions around waste, decorations and food. For example, I placed recycling and compost bins in a prominent location with clear labelling, with the landfill bin further away. If you’re partying in a park or at a venue, consider bringing a compost bin to collect food waste.Reuse, borrow and rentConsider how you might source your get-together’s needs without purchasing new. I began by repurposing items I already had. I gathered couches and comfy chairs from around my house and set them up in the garden – after the party, they simply went back inside. In the weeks leading up to the event, I kept an eye on roadside rubbish and scored a free rug and a couple of extra chairs. Instead of buying new glassware, I used old jars.There’s no point giving a kid an eco-friendly gift they’ll never useErin RhoadsWhen I needed extra items, I turned to my community and borrowed fairy lights, a fire pit, small coffee tables and extra seating.Buy Nothinggroups are an excellent resource for free sharing and loaning in your neighbourhood. If you do need to buy, try second-hand first. I thrifted a drinks dispenser online – for one-third of the usual retail price – and sourced my entire 1920s-themed outfit, from headpiece to dress and shoes, at op shops.Skip presents or try a ‘fiver birthday’At this stage in my life, I have most things I need – and I’m fussy about what I want in my home. To avoid unwanted gifts, I simply asked for none. Alternatively, you could request experiences, consumable treats such as foods and drinks, and even second-hand gifts from thrift shops, eBay or Facebook Marketplace, helping normalise sustainable giving while reducing costs for your guests.Rhoads says a “fiver birthday” is a great option for children’s parties – and helps take the pressure off parents. Each guest contributes just $5 so the birthday child can buy themselves a larger gift afterwards. Handmade cards add a personal touch. Or just ask if there’s anything specific the child needs or wants. “There’s no point giving a kid an eco-friendly gift they’ll never use,” Rhoads says.View image in fullscreenTry newspaper, decorated with ribbons saved from previous presents.Photograph: Amanda Vivan/Getty ImagesAvoid disposable wrapping paper, which mostly can’t be recycled due to metallic dyes, plastic coating and stray plastic sticky tape. Instead, try newspaper or second-hand options such as old sheet music, fabric, scarves or tea towels, decorated with ribbons saved from previous presents. Ensure you choose biodegradable tape, too.Choose low-impact decorations and party bagsIf you make just one change at your next party – ban the balloons. Balloon pollution is a major threat to marine life including seabirds and turtles, which can die after mistaking balloons for food. Instead, consider homemade options made from compostable materials, such as wool, cotton, wood, paper and even plants and flowers from the garden or neighbourhood. Fabric bunting and paper garlands can be folded up and reused again for future parties.For the time-poor or craft-averse, explore Facebook Marketplace or local hire services. Or skip the decorations entirely. I allowed my garden and borrowed fairy lights to provide a natural background to my 40th festivities, combined with a broad ‘any-era’ vintage dress-up theme that made it easier for guests to shop their wardrobe for a costume rather than buying fast fashion.To make kids’ party bags more sustainable, avoid plastic-wrapped lollies or cheap plastic toys that break easily. Homemade play-dough in reusable jars or seed balls made from coconut coir, clay and flower seeds offer a fun, nature-friendly option. Or, Rhoads says, simply send guests home with a slice of birthday cake in a paper bag.“Showing these swaps aren’t that daunting and that events can still be joyful – and perhaps save money as a bonus – is a fun way to get people to rethink living sustainability without the lectures and statistics, which can scare them into inaction,” she says. “It helps shift habits and behaviours in the long term.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsChange by degreesWastenewsShareReuse this content"

Danish law, in contrast, allows citizens to identify their gender as X.“If your passport has the gender designation X or you have changed gender, it is recommended to contact the US embassy prior to travel for guidance on how to proceed,” the Danish travel advisory page now reads.Officials said that no Danish citizens had been refused entry to the US or detained at the border since Trump took office. Instead, the LGBT+ Danmark association said it had requested the advisory update.“We are worried that people could be stopped at the airport and refused entry, or that something inappropriate and uncomfortable could happen at the airport,” Susanne Branner Jespersen toldDanish broadcaster Radio IIII.Earlier this month, Germany alsoreportedlyflagged that transgender travellers or those travelling with the gender X marked on their passports should contact US diplomatic missions before their departure.Soon after, Finland updated its advice page. “If the applicant’s current sex on their passport is different from their sex confirmed at birth, the US authorities may refuse entry,” the page, updated in mid-March, reads.Other European countries have sought to sharpen their language around US entry requirements. In Germany, news that three German nationalshad been detainedat the border led the government to update its travel advisory to note that a visa or entry waiver does not guarantee entry into the US.“The final decision on whether a person can enter the US lies with the US border authorities,” a spokesperson for the foreign minister told Reuters.British officials also appeared to have revisited their US travel advisory, which now notes that anyone found breaking the country’s entry rules could face arrest or detention.Earlier this month it emerged that a British touristhad been detainedin the US for 10 days after she was told she should have applied for a working visa, instead of a tourist visa.When asked by Reuters, the Foreign Office declined to comment on why it had changed the advisory or confirm the date that it was done.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkFinlandEuropeTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Not all the countries in the coalition will have capabilities for Ukraine but might have the capability for other deployments which would free up other nations to deploy to Ukraine.”The intensive UK planning across three days next week is likely to consider whether British troops could be moved from current deployments to support Ukraine, with troops from other nations backfilling the existing UK deployments.The plans will be discussed before a further meeting of the “coalition of the willing” – the group of countries preparing to back Ukraine – in Paris on Thursday.Starmer on Thursday met military officials from 31 countries involved in planning how the coalition of countries might work in practice to support Ukraine. Countries represented included France, Poland, the Netherlands, Romania, Canada and Australia.After the meeting, the prime minister warned Vladimir Putin hewould face “severe consequences”if he breached any peace deal.Asked whether the focus of discussions had shifted away from the prospect of ground troops for Ukraine, a No 10 spokesperson said: “No, nothing is off the table on any of these fronts, so I wouldn’t start ruling anything out.“Clearly, thousands of troops will be required to support any deployment, whether that is at sea, on land or in the air.”The Financial Times had reported on Thursday that Starmer’s focus hadshifted to air and sea support, stressing that Ukraine itself had the capability, the numbers and the frontline experience on the ground.The spokesperson said deployment would require significant support and the firming up of “basic logistics of … moving people and ensuring deployment rotations, so, as the PM said, we need to be prepared for all eventualities”.Delegations from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia on Monday for further peace talks.At the same time, European and Commonwealth allies are seeking to pressure the Russian president as he resists accepting in full a US- and Ukraine-backed deal, as well as ensuring a peacekeeping plan is in place if an agreement is reached.Moscow has agreed to pause attacks on Ukrainian power plants after a phone call between Putin and the US president, Donald Trump, but Kyiv has said civilian targets including hospitals have since been struck.Starmer was expected to have a call with non-EU countries and the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, on Friday about updates that have been discussed at EU level.Ukraine’s president, Volodymr Zelenskyy, has said he is hopeful a “lasting peace can be achieved this year” after he spoke on the phone with Trump on Tuesday, though he rebuffed a suggestion that Washington could take ownership of Ukrainian power plants to ensure their security.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryKeir StarmerUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyUrsula von der LeyenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But uncertainty remains about how or when the part-ceasefire will take effect as Ukraine and Russia prepare to send delegations to Riyadh next week for parallel talks with the US.How Trump’s diplomacy resembles a game of broken telephoneRead moreIt was immediately clear that the three parties had different views about what the pact entailed, with the White House saying “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin saying the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure”, and Zelenskyy saying he would also like railways and ports protected.A senior Ukrainian official told AFP thatUkrainehoped to secure a part-ceasefire at the talks in Saudi Arabia on Monday. “We still want to agree on a ceasefire, at least on what we have proposed,” the source said, referring to calls for a halt to strikes on energy sites, civilian infrastructure and attacks in the Black Sea.The source added it was “unclear” when any ceasefire could be implemented. “There have been no reciprocal steps from the Russians,” they said. “We need to agree on the main thing: what objects and what control. The Americans have enormous intelligence capabilities, so they see a lot,” they added.On Friday, the Kremlin claimed Vladimir Putin’s order for Russian forces to temporarily halt their attacks on energy infrastructure remained in force, but stressed the agreement only covered “energy infrastructure” and not “energy and infrastructure”.Russia also accused Ukraine of violating the part-ceasefire, citing a strike that took place before Zelenskyy formally agreed to the truce.View image in fullscreenPeople inspect the site of a drone strike in Odesa.Photograph: Igor Tkachenko/EPAMoscow’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, told Russia’s Channel One on Thursday evening that Ukraine had breached a proposed 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure by striking a Russian oil depot on Tuesday night, though that strike came before Zelenskyy’s call with Trump the next day where he agreed in principle to the US-brokered proposal.The Ukrainian side has accused Russia of violating its pledges. Hours after Putin’s phone call with Trump on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said there had been “hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure”, including a hospital in Sumy.Moscow appeared to be exploiting the window before any ceasefire takes hold, launching drones at Odesa as well as shelling the southern region of Zaporizhzhia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moscow accused Ukraine of striking the facility, while Ukraine’s general staff denied responsibility, claiming instead that it had been “repeatedly shelled by the Russians themselves”.Russia’s investigative committee said the gas station “was significantly damaged in the blast”.While much of Europe has cut its reliance on Russian gas, countries sympathetic to Moscow – including Hungary and Slovakia – still buy it, with all supplies flowing through the town of Sudzha in Russia’s Kursk region.European leaders of the coalition backing Ukraine are expected to meet again next week, hoping to finalise plans to secure “credible security guarantees”.After a meeting with western military planners near London on Thursday, Keir Starmerappeared to step back from his pledgeto put boots on the ground in Ukraine, saying instead that allied forces would be deployed by sea and air in support of Kyiv’s own forces.The Trump administration has appeared lukewarm toward the idea of European troops in Ukraine and has been reluctant to commit to supporting them if they were deployed. Moscow has repeatedly ruled out the presence of western troops in Ukraine, calling it a red line it will not tolerate.In an interview on Thursday, Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, suggested the US might advocate for troops from Saudi Arabia or India – two countries with relatively warm ties to Moscow – to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential security arrangement.Zelenskyy, meanwhile, pushed back against a reported proposal by Macron, who was said to be exploring the idea of a UN-led peacekeeping mission to protect Ukraine.“With all due respect, the UN will not protect us from occupation or Putin’s desire to come again. We do not see the UN as an alternative to a contingent or security guarantees,” Zelenskyy said during a press conference with Pavel.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

He was the father of two young boys, aged seven and 10, who were tragically found dead in a pond near their home in Trondheim, Norway, in December 2020.”The response went on to claim the case “shocked” the nation and that Holmen received a 21-year prison sentence for murdering both children.Holmen said in a complaint to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority that the “completely false” story nonetheless contained elements similar to his own life such as his home town, the number of children he has and the age gap between his sons.“The complainant was deeply troubled by these outputs, which could have harmful effect in his private life, if they where reproduced or somehow leaked in his community or in his home town,”said the complaint, which has been filed by Holmen and Noyb, a digital rights campaign group.It added that Holmen has “never been accused nor convicted of any crime and is a conscientious citizen”.Holmen’s complaint alleged that ChatGPT’s “defamatory” response violated accuracy provisions within the GDPR European data law. It has asked the Norwegian watchdog to order ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI, to adjust its model to eliminate inaccurate results relating to Holmen and to impose a fine on the company. Noyb said that since Holmen’s interaction with ChatGPT took place, OpenAI had released a new model incorporating web searches – which has made a repeat of the Holmen error “less likely”.AI chatbots are prone to producing responsescontaining false informationbecause they are built on models that predict the next most likely word in a sentence. This can result in factual errors and wild assertions, but the plausible nature of the responses can trick users into thinking that what they are reading is 100% correct.AnOpenAIspokesperson said: “We continue to research new ways to improve the accuracy of our models and reduce hallucinations. While we’re still reviewing this complaint, it relates to a version of ChatGPT which has since been enhanced with online search capabilities that improves accuracy.”Explore more on these topicsChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAINorwayEuropeChatbotsnewsShareReuse this content"

He spent a total of six years in Soviet psychiatric wards that functioned as prisons.His sentence on Friday effectively amounts to life imprisonment, given his age and frail health. Skobov’s lawyer said her client had diabetes, hepatitis C, bronchial asthma and glaucoma.In a defiant final statement before sentencing, Skobov condemned the war in Ukraine, saying: “Today I will be asked whether I plead guilty. Well, I am the one making the accusation here! I accuse the stinking corpse of a regime and the ruling Putin clique of preparing, unleashing, and waging an aggressive war, of committing war crimes in Ukraine, of political terror in Russia, and of the moral corruption of my people.”“I ask the regime’s henchmen present here: do you admit your guilt in being complicit in Putin’s crimes?” Skobov added.As the judge read out the sentence, Skobov – seated inside a locked metal cage and guarded by security officers – washeard shouting: “Glory to Ukraine.”Skobov has been in detention since his arrest in April 2024. Even behind bars, he has remained politically active. Last June, he published an open letter addressed to younger Russian political prisoners. “I want the young people who took the hit to know: the last Soviet dissidents stood alongside them,” hewrote in the letter, which was published by the Novaya Gazeta outletThe sentence Skobov was given on Friday was extreme even by the already-repressive standards of today’s Russia. Observers said it highlighted how modern Russia had surpassed the scale of repression seen during the post-Stalin Soviet era.“The draconian sentence handed down to Alexander Skobov today is emblematic of the war against dissent wielded by Russian authorities insure the country, in parallel to their abuse war in Ukraine,” said Tanya Lokshina, an associate director for Human Rights Watch’sEuropeand Central Asia division.“It is particularly poignant that Skobov had spent years in a Soviet prison for having exercised his freedom of opinion all those years back – and over four decades later the history is repeating itself,” she added.Russia has launched an unprecedented crackdown on dissent since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a campaign that has reached into nearly every corner of society.The independent Russian outlet Proektestimated in 2024that the scale of repression under the Putin regime had surpassed that of the Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, persecuting at least 116,000 people over the past six years alone.The Skobov case also suggests that Moscow has no intention of easing repression at home against those who oppose the war – even as the Kremlin claims to be pursuing peace talks over the conflict in Ukraine.In recent weeks, Russian authorities have detained a string of citizens who have criticised the war, ranging from a film critic to a pensioner and several regional journalists. Each is facing long spells in prison for social media posts condemning Putin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineFreedom of speechEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

If the US president imposes 10% tariffs on all global imports, the impact would be significant, with Irish GDP dropping by 3.2% compared with a no-tariff scenario, the study showed.The ESRI said nearly all tariff scenarios would have a “significant negative impact” on the Irish economy, with a knock-on effect causing job losses and potential loss of US multinationals.“Protectionist policies may also prompt multinationals to relocate to the US, posing further risks to the Irish economy and public finances,” Paul Egan, the report’s author and a research officer at the ESRI, said.Ireland is one of three EU countries with a surplus in goods trade with the US, with pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer and Eli Lilly driving many of its exports, booking the profits from sales across the Atlantic in Ireland – a practice that Trump wants to stop.The Irish government is already nervous about the impact of Trump’s threat of tariffs after the US president singled out what heconsiders to be the theft of jobs and investment by Ireland.In a meeting with the Irish taoiseach in the Oval Office two weeks ago, Trump praised Ireland for being “smart” but said it had the “entire pharmaceutical industry in its grasp”.Experts in Ireland have said that the threat of a tightened tax regime were more likely to incentivise pharmaceutical companies tobook their profits in the US, rather than endure tariffs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A shrinking economy could also trigger inflation, with higher import prices on goods affected by retaliatory tariffs.By value, Ireland’s biggest imports from the US are aircraft, because of the size of the budget airline Ryanair and Dublin-headquartered Aercap, the world’s largest aircraft leasing company. Other significant imports include pharmaceuticals, machinery, optical and medical apparatus and energy, including liquid gas and oil.Egan said his research team could not quantify the scale of the impact of uncertainty caused by Trump’s threats of tariffs but said it would have an impact.“The heightened uncertainty in the short run could actually magnify the impacts, kind of beyond what we discuss in the paper,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.Explore more on these topicsIrelandDonald TrumpEuropeInternational tradePharmaceuticals industryUS politicsEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Drones, planes, artillery, tanks … all the time. It’s as bad as it’s ever been,” said one aid worker now based in Gaza City.After retaking part of the strategic Netzarim corridor that divides Gaza’s north from south, Israeli troops have advanced towards the northern town of Beit Lahiya and into the southern border city of Rafah.Israeli strikes on Gaza add to soaring child death tollRead moreIsraeli officials have escalated their threats in recent days, calling on Palestinians in Gaza to overthrowHamasor face the consequences.“I ordered [the army] to seize more territory in Gaza,” Katz said in a statement. “The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel.”Katz also threatened “to expand buffer zones around Gaza to protect Israeli civilian population areas and soldiers by implementing a permanent Israeli occupation of the area”, should Hamas not comply.The permanent establishment of wide buffer zones in Gaza, particularly along its northern perimeter, has long been thought by observers to be an objective of many in the Israeli security establishment and government.The Trump administration reiterated this week its support for Israel, with the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, saying: “Thepresident made it very clear to Hamasthat if they did not release all of the hostages there would be all hell to pay.”Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Thursday that 504 people had been killed since the bombardment resumed, one of the highest tolls since the war began more than 17 months ago with Hamas’s attack on Israel. More than 100 have been killed since then and many more injured, Palestinian medical officials said.Amjad Shawaa, the head of the Palestinian NGO Network in Gaza, said: “This time it is very, very bad. It is very intensive and very scary. We don’t know when we could be hit. We worry always about our loved ones. Everything is very uncertain and then there are these threats that Israel will expand its operations. This is a suffocation, a psychological condition that is very hard.”View image in fullscreenTroops on the border in southern Israel looking across to the Gaza Strip.Photograph: Amir Levy/Getty ImagesThe IDF said the new strikes were against “terrorist” targets, including a “Hamas military site in northern Gaza where preparations were being made to fire projectiles” and “several vessels in the coastal area of the Gaza Strip … intended for use in terrorist operations by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad [armed group]”.It gave new evacuation orders for northern coastal areas, displacing thousands more people. The UN estimates that 124,000 people have been displaced in Gaza since Tuesday, about one in 20 of the population.Preliminary investigations have found that an explosion that killed a UN staffer in Gaza and seriously injured four others earlier this week was caused by a tank shell, aid officials told the Guardian. The IDF has denied all responsibility for the explosion at a UN guesthouse in the central town of Deir al-Balah.A three-phase ceasefire was agreed in January but Israel refused to begin talks on the implementation of a second phase, which was supposed to lead to a return of all hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a permanent end to hostilities.Instead, Israel proposed a new plan, reportedly put forward by the US envoy Steve Witkoff, involving a 30- to 60-day truce and the release of all remaining hostages. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners – a key component of the first phase.Netanyahu disputes court order freezing decision to fire Shin Bet chiefRead moreHamassaid on Friday it was still debating Witkoff’s proposal and other proposals made by intermediaries, including Egypt. On Thursday, the group fired rockets at Tel Aviv, the coastal Israeli city and commercial hub, in its first military response to Israel’s offensive. One was intercepted by air defence systems, while two hit an uninhabited area, Israel’s military said.The new violence in Gaza comes against a backdrop of internal turmoil in Israel, where thousands of protesters have rallied in recent days, accusing the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, of seeking to undermine Israel’s democratic system and resuming military operations without regard for the safety of the hostages in order to bolster his political position.On Friday,Israel’s supreme court ordered a temporary haltto the government’s dismissal of Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security service, until an appeal could be heard before 8 April. Netanyahu previously cited “mistrust” to justify his sacking of Bar but Israel’s attorney general has ruled that a dismissal by the cabinet has no legal basis.A recent Shin Bet report on the 7 October Hamas attack acknowledged the service’s failures but also accused Netanyahu’s government of pursuing policies that established some of the conditions for the attack.Before the IDF’s offensive, Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, one of the largest providers of food aid in the strip, said on Friday it had only enough flour to distribute for the next six days.About 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, died in the surprise attack by Hamas in October 2023. The ensuing Israeli offensive into Gaza has killed more than 49,000 people, mostly civilians.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuHamasPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The security chief referred to the conclusions drawn by his agency’s investigation into the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, which said “a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup”.1:17Thousands of Israelis protest against resumption of Gaza war – videoHe added: “The dismissal of the head of the service at this time at the initiative of the prime minister sends a message to all those involved, a message that could put the optimal outcome of the investigation at risk. This is a direct danger to the security of the state of Israel.”The court ruling said the freeze on Bar’s dismissal would remain until the appeals were presented to the court before 8 April. According to the earlier government statement announcing his dismissal, Bar was supposed to leave his post when his successor was appointed, or by 10 April at the latest.Bar, whose tenure was meant to end next year, was appointed by the previous Israeli government, which briefly forced Netanyahu from power between June 2021 and December 2022.Israeli strikes on Gaza add to soaring child death tollRead moreHis relations with the prime minister had been strained even before the 7 October Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza, notably over a proposed judicial overhaul that had split the country. Relations worsened after the 4 March release of the internal Shin Bet report on the attack, which acknowledged the agency’s own failures but also pointed to wider policy issues in the run-up.In a statement on Friday, a Netanyahu spokesperson said: “The Israeli government, which is in charge of the Shin Bet, has lost all confidence in Ronen Bar, who continues to cling to his seat while cynically using the families of the kidnapped and politically incorrect use of his position to fabricate futile, unfounded investigations.“Ronen had the opportunity to retire with honour after his searing failure on October 7 … But [he] preferred not to attend the government meeting dealing with his case.”A series of high-ranking officials seen as responsible for mistakes and misjudgments in the period before the Hamas attack have resigned. Netanyahu himself has not accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst ever security disaster, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and has resisted calls for a powerful commission of inquiry.After the government vote against Bar, Israel’s opposition and an NGO said on Friday they had filed a petition against the decision. Their initiative was upheld by the supreme court, ruling as the high court of justice on state decisions, which subsequently issued a temporary injunction.The Movement for Quality Government in Israel NGO had denounced “an unlawful decision … posing a real risk to the national security of the state of Israel”, while the opposition leader Yair Lapid’s centre-right party denounced what it called “a decision based on flagrant conflict of interest”.The communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, said in response to the ruling that the judges had no right to interfere in the government’s decision to fire Bar. “Bar will end his tenure on April 10 or earlier, with the appointment of a permanent head of the Shin Bet,” he said. “You have no legal authority to interfere in this. This is the government’s authority. Your order is void.”A former head of the Shin Bet, Yoram Cohen, condemned Bar’s sacking in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 on Friday, and alleged that the prime minister had compelled him to carry out acts of questionable legitimacy when he was in charge of the agency.He haspreviously allegedthat in 2011 Netanyahu asked him to wiretap the government’s top defence officials to ensure “they were not leaking information from a particularly sensitive security meeting”, the Times of Israel reported.In a separate move on Friday, Netanyahu’s cabinet said it would debate on Sunday a motion of no confidence in the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, accusing her of acting “as the long arm of the government’s opponents”.Baharav-Miara previously warned Netanyahu he could not fire Bar before her office had reviewed his motives for doing so.“According to the decision of the supreme court, it is prohibited to take any action that harms the position of the head of the Shin Bet, Ronen Bar,” Baharav-Miara said in a message to Netanyahu published by a spokesperson on Friday. “It is prohibited to appoint a new head of Shin Bet, and interviews for the position should not be held.”Netanyahu is facing a potential jail sentence at the conclusion of an ongoing corruption trial. The 75-year-old politician, who came to power for the first time in 1996 and has served 17 years as prime minister, is giving evidence twice weekly.On Friday, hundreds of demonstrators protested for a fourth consecutive day against the move to sack Bar, joining protesters angry at the decision to resume fighting in Gaza while 59 Israeli hostages remain in the Palestinian territory.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

His frame is lean, greying hair close shaved, features gaunt, manner reserved and speech moderate.But Bar has found himself on the frontline of Israel’s bitter internal political, social and cultural conflicts. On Thursday night, the government ofBenjamin Netanyahuvoted to dismiss the 59-year-old from his post – the first Shin Bet chief ever to be fired. His sacking prompted massive protests across Israel and revived accusations that Netanyahu wants to dismantle Israel’s democracy.Yossi Melman, a veteran Israeli security reporter, said: “He never intended to be a hero to the opposition or the protest movement. He is a typical product of Israel’s security establishment. He is not a liberal or a softie but he is honest and brought up in the tradition that the state is important but without the law the state is nothing.”Bar served his military service in the Sayeret Matkal, Israel’s elite special forces. He then opened and ran a bar in Tel Aviv, where he met his wife. After obtaining degrees in political science and philosophy from Tel Aviv University and a master’s degree in public administration from Harvard, he joined the Shin Bet and rose steadily through the ranks of its operations division, which manages logistics and support for the frontline teams handling everything from agents to assassinations in the occupied West Bank or elsewhere.The priority of the Shin Bet is counter-terrorism, but the service also investigates espionage, manages security clearance for thousands of sensitive posts and has a legal duty to defend Israel’s democratic system.Bar took over the service in 2021, having been appointed by the then prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and was expected to serve the standard five-year term. Now only a supreme court judgment can stop him from being summarily dismissed a year early.One of the first senior security officials to accept responsibility for the many failures that allowed Hamas’s deadly surprise attack into Israel on October 7, 2023, Bar made it clear he intended to resign.He has stayed on so long, associates and supporters say, to work towards the release of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza and to protect the Shin Bet from political manoeuvres.That first objective has been partly achieved but not the second. Bar became a target himself when he warned of the threat posed by “Jewish terrorism” – a reference to violence perpetrated by parts of the far-right settler movement – and warned the far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, that police action in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem was creating a feeling of collective punishment among Palestinian residents.This may have been honest but made for powerful enemies. The support of Ben Gvir and other far-right politicians linked to the settlers is vital for Netanyahu to maintain his grip on power.In March 2023, amid widespread protests against government plans for judicial reforms, Bar told Netanyahu there was a link “between security threats and the social situation in Israel”, according to remarks reported by Israeli media.A Shin Bet report into the 2023 attack released earlier this month attacked Netanyahu indirectly, saying that Israel had followed for years a“policy of quiet[which] had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup”.The implicit criticism took place as the Shin Bet stepped up an investigation into allegations that close aides of Netanyahu received payments from Qatar to promote its interests even while the Gulf state was partly financing Hamas in Gaza.One of Bar’s greatest concerns is the appointment of a compliant government loyalist as his replacement, with huge consequences for investigations into the “Qatargate” scandal and much else, Melman said.For his part, Netanyahu has cited a “persistent loss of professional and personal trust” for Bar’s dismissal, due to take effect by 10 April.Bar denies this, pointing to months of effective collaboration with the prime minister, and in a letter published this week described his dismissal as being motivated primarily by Netanyahu’s “personal interests”.“The dismissal of the Shin Bet director at this time [and] at the prime minister’s initiative, poses a direct threat to Israel’s security,” the former commando wrote.Critics have claimed that he is trying to cover up the failures that led to the October 2023 attacks. Supporters said he was doing his job and speaking truth to power.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warHamasMiddle East and north AfricaprofilesShareReuse this content"

Construction works are significantly more advanced and extend far higher today.Photograph: Pete PattissonArshad’s death was confirmed by Besix Group, a Belgian construction multinational, whose subsidiary Six Construct is one of the main contractors at the stadium.“A team of three workers was engaged in formwork operations [creating moulds for concrete] at height when the platform they were working on tilted. While all three were equipped with personal fall-arrest systems, one worker was not connected to an anchor point at the time of the incident and fell, sustaining severe injuries,” the company said in a statement. Emergency services were immediately called, but “the worker sadly succumbed to his injuries in hospital”.It is unclear how long Arshad had been working at the stadium, where it is understood he was employed as a foreman, but social media posts show him on the site from last September.After his death, workers were allegedly called to a meeting and ordered to delete any video footage of the incident and not to talk to anyone about it, according to a source who was present.Besix said: “Out of respect for the victim’s family, workers were asked not to share images of the consequences of the tragic accident on social media.View image in fullscreenMuhammad Arshad, who was in his mid-30s, had three young sons.Photograph: Handout“Safety is and remains our absolute priority … The authorities are conducting a full inquiry, and we are fully cooperating to determine the exact circumstances of this tragedy,” the company said.Arshad’s body was flown back to Pakistan on Tuesday, where his coffin was buried near his home in the north-west of the country. “We have just fallen from the sky to the ground. The whole family is in a state of shock,” Arshad’s father, Muhammad Bashir, told the Guardian.Arshad, who was in his mid-30s, had three sons aged between two and seven. “It will have a long-lasting impact on their lives. Arshad’s income was their only source of living. We will have to bear their living and educational expenses. We will try to meet their needs,” said Bashir.On Monday, Bashir said he had not yet been contacted directly by his son’s employer, but had been assured by a relative in Saudi Arabia that his family would receive Arshad’s outstanding salary and benefits.Under Saudi labour law, employers must also pay compensation in the event of a death at work. Besix said it had taken steps to support the family and ensure all payments were, “handled in a timely and respectful manner”.View image in fullscreenThousands of migrant workers, many from Bangladesh and Pakistan, are working on the Aramco Stadium in two shifts.Photograph: Pete PattissonConstruction of the 47,000-seater Aramco Stadium is at an advanced stage, with thousands of migrant workers, many from Bangladesh and Pakistan, working at the site in two shifts. It is being developed by Aramco, the state-owned oil company, which recently became Fifa’s most lucrative sponsor.Aninvestigationlast year revealed that some migrant workers employed at the stadium were enduring highly abusive conditions. They alleged they were saddled with staggering debts from the illegal fees they were forced to pay to get to Saudi Arabia. Housed in grim, cramped rooms, they toiled for 10 hours a day in the scorching 45C (113F) summer heat for paltry wages, which some said were withheld for months.The stadium is one of11 new venues being built for the 2034 World Cup, alongside a huge expansion of the country’s transport infrastructure and hotel accommodation to meet the demands of an expanded 48-team tournament.Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup bid to be ratified by Fifa despite rights violationsRead moreWorld Cup-related construction is just one part of a building boom under way in Saudi Arabia as the Gulf kingdom seeks to rebrand itself on the global stage. The construction is almost entirely dependent on a vast army of low-wage migrant workers, who largely come from south Asia.In a statement, Besix said it had “made significant strides” in protecting workers’ rights wherever it operated, adding that sub-contractors were required to comply with welfare standards that “encompassed the full spectrum of workers’ welfare, from safety and wages to living conditions”. It acknowledged that “some local contexts have proven challenging”, and had taken additional steps to improve these standards. “Our priority is to ensure that all workers are treated with dignity and fairness,” it said.Aramco said the safety and wellbeing of employees was “our highest priority”.“The company follows industry best practices in managing and reporting incidents, including determining the facts, sequence of events and root causes,” it said in a statement.Fifa did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2034Rights and freedomSaudi Arabia and sportMigration and developmentWorkers' rightsWorld CupPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

It clawed a jogger’s scalp and left him reeling. It is said to swoop in from behind without making a sound, has a penchant for tall men’s heads and – so far – has evaded capture.But the violent reign of the Flamstead hawk, which has made men in the Hertfordshire village of Flamsteadafraid to go outwithout covering their heads, may soon be at an end.The Harris hawk is said to have attacked 40 to 50 people in the village in recent weeks, but Flamstead parish council has now told residents that a falconer brought in to try to catch the bird of prey is “extremely close” to catching it, according toThe Herts Advertiser.The fate of the hawk, if it is captured by the council, looks dire.“We are, sadly, getting close to the stage where we may have to euthanise the hawk,” the parish council is reported to have said.“The falconer has been extremely close to catching the hawk on a number of occasions; it has fed on the edge of the trap, for example.“However, we are acutely aware that the hawk’s attacking is becoming more regular and the area in which it is attacking has widened.”When the Guardian called the parish council for an update on the situation, chair Tim Parsons said: “The hawk hasn’t been caught. We’re all getting a bit bored of it actually.”He later added that media reports were picking up on “what’s being said to residents”.The council is understood to have expressed “huge frustration”, due to the closeness of capture.The Herts Advertiser reported that parish councillors believe the bird of prey is being fed “somewhere else” in the village, which is interfering with attempts to capture it.“The hawk is not as hungry as it has been and would not feed at all from the falconer last night, despite having done so over the past few evenings,” the parish council is reported to have said.“This was always going to be a long process, and by feeding the hawk, that process is now taking much longer than anticipated.”According to the newspaper, the council expressed its gratitude to the “majority” of Flamstead who had adhered to its advice not to feed the bird.Despite these challenging circumstances, the falconer is understood to be “very confident” he can catch the offending bird.Its attacks on villagers have attracted international attention, with TV crews descending on the small village – wearing bicycle helmets.When the Guardianvisited last week, few men were spotted walking outside alone. “I’ve been getting my wife to come out for a walk with me because I don’t want to go for a walk by myself,” said resident Michael Hart, who was attacked while out jogging and has now resorted to driving 20 minutes out of the village to continue his daily run.Another resident Glyn Parry, 91,told the BBCthe bird had taken two woolly hats off his head. Initially, he believed “it was just a youngster pulling a prank” after “tapping him on the shoulder”. But the next day, the hawk struck again and this time Parry was able to identify the culprit.“It was such an unusual thing, so I thought it won’t happen again, but it did.”To avoid losing a third hat – or going out hatless while the hawk remains at large – he has fashioned a chinstrap for a fedora out of an old shoelace.Hertfordshire police have urged people not to feed the bird while the situation is dealt with.Explore more on these topicsHertfordshireBirdsAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Police confirmed on Friday evening that the fire was not thought to be suspicious.Travel chaos as Heathrow airport closes after blaze at electrical substationRead moreHeathrow partially reopened on Friday evening and was expected to be fully operational on Saturday, but airlines said the closure would continue to have a “huge impact” on passengers in the coming days.The airport said passengers should come to Heathrow on Saturday as they normally would.Ministers acknowledged the “immense distress and disruption” caused to passengers, vowing “we will learn the lessons”.Asked about an inquiry and whetherNational Gridhad questions to answer, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “There are questions to answer on how this has happened and what can be done to prevent the scale of disruption we’ve seen from happening again, once the situation is under control.”Passengers were warned to stay away from Heathrow all day on Friday after theLondonfire brigade (LFB) was called to tackle the blaze that started shortly after 11pm on Thursday at a substation in Hayes, north of the airport.More than 70 firefighters worked in “challenging and hazardous” conditions to bring the fire under control, the LFB said, but it was still burning at 8am on Friday, with 25,000 litres of oil having caught fire at the substation. Officers said that despite the acrid smell, there was no air quality danger to the public.Power to 67,000 homes was cut off for several hours and more than 100 people were evacuated. Power supplies have now been restored to all customers, including Heathrow, allowing operations to resume at the airport.More than 1,350 flights carrying at least 200,000 passengers had been scheduled to arrive and depart from the airport on Friday, connecting to around 230 destinations, including those in the US for which the airport acts as the main gateway from Europe.About 120 long-haul flights to Heathrow were in the air when the closure was announced overnight, with arrivals diverted to other airports around Britain and Europe.View image in fullscreenPassengers receive information about their flight to Heathrow from Fiumicino airport, near Rome.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersLondon residents will be disturbed by more aircraft noise at night than normally permitted in the coming days after the Department forTransportlifted restrictions on night flights to ease the backlog.Heathrow has experienced significant disruption from external events, such as the air traffic control outage in August 2023 and the mass groundings during the Covid crisis, but the last time the airport was fully closed for an extended period was during heavy snowfall and freezing conditions in December 2010, when 4,000 flights were cancelled.Senior security and aviation figures expressed consternation that the world’s best connected airport could be closed for so long because of a power cut.The International Air Transport Association (Iata) said it was “yet another case of Heathrow letting down both travellers and airlines”. Willie Walsh, Iata’s director general, added: “How is it that critical infrastructure is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case then it is a clear planning failure by the airport.”David Omand, the former head of the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ), told the BBC’s World at One: “Given the importance of Heathrow I am surprised that the whole airport had to be shut for a day.“I mean, you could understand disruption whilst you change over to alternate systems and so on, but such a complete failure over the period of a day – and who knows the disruption may last longer – is a national embarrassment. It shouldn’t have happened.”However, the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, defended the airport on Friday night, saying the “unprecedented situation” had been “totally outside of Heathrow’s control”.“They have stood up their resilience plan swiftly, and they’ve collaborated closely with our emergency responders and the airline operators,” she said. “They do have backup energy supplies, they have generators, diesel generators.“None of that failed on this occasion because that backup supply is designed to protect the critical key systems within the airport and not to provide power to the whole airport.“I would still advise anyone who has got a flight tomorrow [Saturday] to check in with their airline before travelling to the airport. But given the scale and magnitude of this incident, the response has been swift, although I do appreciate there will have been immense distress and disruption to a very large number of people.”View image in fullscreenThe blaze at the North Hyde electrical substation near Heathrow airport early on Friday.Photograph: Matthew Muirhead/APHeathrow’s chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, apologised to “the many people who have had their travel affected”. But added: “I’d like to stress that this has been an incident of major severity. It’s not a small fire.”The Metropolitan police said it was working with the LFB to establish the cause of the fire, which remains under investigation. A spokesperson said: “While there is currently no indication of foul play we retain an open mind at this time.”Detectives were preparing to take away parts of the substation and its equipment to examine them for signs of interference. It is understood initial checks of CCTV covering the perimeter of the substation showed nothing suspicious.Counter-terrorism detectives were expected to stay on the case until an alternative explanation emerged for the fire.Alice Delahunty, the president of National Grid’s transmission business, said it had been “a very significant and serious incident, which is extraordinarily rare in our network” and that it was not possible to verify any “rumours and speculation” over the cause of the fire.She added: “We’re not in a position to rule anything in or out. Our focus has been getting homes and businesses back on supply safely. There will be a time for a full and thorough investigation, but the focus has been on restoring power.”A Heathrow spokesperson said it would initially work with airlines on repatriating the passengers who were diverted to other airports in Europe.“Our priority remains the safety of our passengers and those working at the airport. As the busiest airport in Europe, Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, therefore getting back to a full and safe operation takes time. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this incident.”British Airways, which operates around half of all Heathrow flights, resumed long-haul services on Friday evening after power was restored. Flights also began arriving at the airport.The chief executive, Sean Doyle, said BA had “been forced to effectively ground our flying operation”, cancelling every short-haul and the majority of long-haul flights scheduled for Friday.“Unfortunately, it will have a huge impact on all of our customers flying with us over the coming days,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportHeathrowAir transportTransportLondonBritish AirwaysNational GridnewsShareReuse this content"

He was recalled to Moscow in 1985 and placed under surveillance, despite being offered the opportunity by London to defect.Realising his peril in Moscow, he triggered a long-planned extraction byMI6, evading his KGB watchers during a jog to flee to the Finnish border where he was smuggled to safety.Explaining his motivation, Gordievsky said: “I hated the communist system, I wanted to fight against it,” in an archive recording, which featured in a BBC documentary Secrets and Spies: A Nuclear Game.“Gordievsky was once described to me by an MI6 guy as the only truly ideological Soviet spy he could think of,” wrote journalist Mark Urban on X after the news of his death.“He despised the USSR and sought to undermine it by passing secret intelligence to the west.”After his defection to the UK, Gordievsky lived near Godalming in Surrey, where his identity was protected.However as Richard Norton-Taylornotes in his Guardian obituaryhe was lonely without his family “and suffered the withdrawal symptoms that spies so often experience once the excitement of their secret life and defection has died down”.Later, at the encouragement of MI6, he wrote several books including the one that would prompt the libel action from Foot.In 2007, Gordievsky was honoured by Queen Elizabeth II with the Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George.His first marriage, to Yelena Akopian, a KGB officer, ended in divorce. In 1979 he married Leila Aliyeva, whom he met in Copenhagen, where she worked for the World Health Organization. They had two daughters, Maria and Anna, who are believed to still live in the UK.Explore more on these topicsMI6RussiaCommunismMI5newsShareReuse this content"

But the mole kept changing, and I know a lot about melanoma. I just felt like this mole wasn’t right.”Ryan asked the doctor to remove the mole, but he recommended sending a sample off for histology first. He then phoned her to confirm it had come back showing early melanoma.She said: “He was shocked. He’s like: ‘It doesn’t look like melanoma, but it is melanoma.’”The Big Fat Quiz of the Year star said the doctor made an appointment to remove the mole completely. She later confirmed the mole’s removal in a post on TikTok, in which she shared pictures of it and urged others to get their moles checked.Melanoma is a type of skin cancer, which can spread to other areas of the body. A new mole or a change in an existing mole can be a symptom of the condition. They are often an uneven shape with a mix of two or more colours, and moles that are sore, bleeding, itchy or crusty could be cancerous.The main cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light, which comes from the sun and is used in sunbeds.Explore more on these topicsKatherine RyanCancerComedyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

We look forward to learning more from [and] about the Trump administration’s plans for our agency and expanding exploration at the moon and Mars for the benefit of all.”Nasa’s action is in keeping with compliance by numerous other federal agencies that followed orders to remove mentions of DEI programs and initiatives following Trump’s second-term inauguration on 20 January.Agencies including theInternal Revenue ServiceandNational Institutes of Healthtook swift action to eliminate policies and funding associated with DEI, while the US military followed a presidential order to implement a ban on transgender people from service, a measuretemporarily blocked by a federal judgeon Wednesday.The move by Nasa is particularly notable because the creation of the Artemis program, and decision to land the first woman and person of color on the moon, were made in 2019 during the first Trump administration, according to the science journalArs Technica.The agency has made stridesin recent years to embrace diversityand move away from its reputation as being staffed by old, white men. All 12 people who walked on the moon during six Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972 were white men aged between 36 and 47.The first spaceflight by a US woman did not take place until 1983, when Sally Ride flew on the space shuttle Challenger. Nasa’s first Black astronaut in space was Guion Bluford, who flew a mission on Challenger later the same year.Artemis III is scheduled to land on the lunar surface in mid-2027, with its crew yet to be announced. A paragraph on the Artemis website that preceded the removed section about a woman and person of color continues to state that: “We are exploring the moon for scientific discovery, technology advancement, and to learn how to live and work on another world as we prepare for human missions to Mars.“We will collaborate with commercial and international partners and establish the first long-term presence on the Moon.”A first, un-crewed test mission, Artemis I, flew around the moonin November 2022.Artemis II, which will take humans to the moon and back without landing, is scheduled for April 2026. Itscrew of four, three of whom have flown into space before, includes one female astronaut, Christina Koch, and an African American, Victor Glover.The other crew members are US astronaut Reid Wiseman, the mission commander, and Canadian Jeremy Hansen on his first spaceflight.Explore more on these topicsUS newsNasaDonald TrumpSpaceRaceGendernewsShareReuse this content"

She allegedly exited the bathroom without the schnauzer less than 20 minutes later.Lawrence soon re-entered the terminal and traveled to Colombia, according to reports. A janitor had allegedly spotted the woman in the bathroom cleaning up water and dog food from the stall’s floor.The employee subsequently found the dog’s carcass in a trash container and reported the grim discovery to a supervisor.The dog had a companion vest, collar, rabies tag, a dog travel bag and a bone-shaped dog tag with Lawrence’s name and contact information.An implanted microchip provided Tywinn’s identity to investigators. A necropsy determined that the schnauzer had been drowned.US Customs and Border Protection confirmed that Tywinn’s owner had boarded a flight to Bogota, Colombia, before then flying to Ecuador, according to theAssociated Press.Police ultimately concluded that Lawrence had “taken extreme and tragic action by killing the dog”, according toABC7. They arrested her in Lake county, Florida, on Wednesday on a count of aggravated animal abuse, a third-degree felony. She was reportedly released from custody pending the outcome of the case on $5,000 bail.Dogs traveling from the US to Colombia must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by a veterinarian and a rabies vaccination certificate, according toguidelinesfrom the US Department of Agriculture.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS crimeFloridaAnimalsDogsPetsLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

It has also targeted at least three law firms that the president says helped his political opponents or helped prosecute him unfairly.Among the most contentious of the nine demands, Columbia agreed to place its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department under a new official, the memo said, taking control away from its faculty.“In this role, the Senior Vice Provost will review the educational programs to ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced,” the memo read, explaining that the review would start with the Center for Palestine Studies; the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies; the Middle East Institute; and other university programs focused on the Middle East.The new official would also be in control of the review process for hiring the university’s non-tenured staff and for approving curricular changes.Professor Jonathan Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania and a “proud” graduate of Columbia, called it a sad day for the university.“Historically, there is no precedent for this,” Zimmerman said. “The government is using the money as a cudgel to micromanage a university.”Zimmerman said the White House actions had apparently already had a chilling effect on higher education because officials at other universities failed to band together and speak out.The White House had yet to respond to Columbia’s memo as of Friday evening, and the status of the funding remained unclear.The sudden shutdown of millions of dollars in federal funding to Columbia University this month had already been disrupting medical and scientific research at the school, researchers said.Scientists and doctors who had been awarded grants by the National Institutes of Health after months or years of work described receiving unusual notices by email last week saying their projects had been terminated because of “unsafe antisemitic actions”.Canceled projects included the development of an AI-based tool to help nurses detect the deterioration of a patient’s health in hospital two days earlier than other early warning systems.The administration also canceled funding for a study designed to improve the safety of blood-transfusion therapies for adults, children and newborns, and research on uterine fibroids, which are non-cancerous tumors that can cause pain and affect women’s fertility.The demand had raised alarm among professors at Columbia and elsewhere, who worried that permitting the federal government to dictate how a department is run would set a dangerous precedent.Republican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives last year criticized at least two professors of Palestinian descent working in the department for their comments about the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Trump administration pauses $175m in funds to UPenn over trans athlete policyRead moreThe school has also hired three dozen special officers who have the power to arrest people on campus and has revised its anti-discrimination policies, including its authority to sanction campus organizations, the memo said.Face masks to conceal identities are no longer allowed, and any protesters must now identify themselves when asked, the memo said.The school also said it is searching for new faculty members to “ensure intellectual diversity”. Columbia plans to fill joint positions in the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies and the international affairs school in an effort to ensure “excellence and fairness in Middle East studies”, the memo said. The sudden shutdown of millions of dollars in federal funding to Columbia University this month was already disrupting medical and scientific research at the school, researchers said.Columbia has come under particular scrutiny, following the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled its campus last year, when its lawns filled with tent encampments and noisy rallies against the US government’s support of Israel.Republican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives last year criticized at least two professors of Palestinian descent working in Columbia’s Middle Eastern studies department for their comments about the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS universitiesUS campus protestsUS politicsDonald TrumpNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

Tesla has borne the brunt of the backlash against the tech executive’s role inDonald Trump’s administration. In the months since Trump named Musk the head of what he calls the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), the world’s richest person has dismantled entire federal agencies, canceled contracts across bureaus that had any mention of diversity, equity and inclusion, and made a gesture at a rally that his estranged daughter called “definitely a nazi salute” in aninterview this week.In response,Teslaowners are attempting to sell their vehicles; the company’s stock price has plummeted and Teslas around the country have been vandalized – some even set on fire with Molotov cocktails. The Vancouver International Auto show announced earlier in the week it had removed the company from the lineup for its upcoming showcase over security concerns as the protests against Musk spread.“If you read the news, it feels like Armageddon,” Musk said. “I understand if you don’t want to buy our product, but you don’t have to burn it down. That’s a bit unreasonable.”The day before, Tesla issued a recall for its newest model, theCybertruck, a trapezoidal steel vehicle that has failed to capture consumers. The company is recalling some 46,000 vehicles, nearly all of the Cybertrucks it has ever sold since the model started shipping last year. The recall was related to a part called a cant rail – a stainless-steel exterior trim panel – delaminating and detaching from the vehicle, the company said, which can become a road hazard and increase the risk of crashes. As a remedy, Tesla will replace the rail assembly free of charge.Even longtime financial backers of the company are lamenting Musk’s chaotic political turn and Tesla’s subsequent poor performance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Earlier this month, Musk joined Trump in front of the White House to promote the vehicles andtheir vast technological capabilities.Trump announced he would buy one.During the all-hands, Musk made the same claim he’s been making since 2016 and told employees that Tesla vehicles will be able to drive autonomously at some point, a point he made at theOctober unveiling of the Tesla Cybercab, a proposed self-driving taxi.“What I’m saying is hang on to your stock,” Musk said.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

The plane’s design remains a closely held secret, but would probably include stealth, advanced sensors and cutting-edge engines.The Seattle-based company beat out Lockheed Martin for the deal. Shares ofBoeingwere up 5% after the news. Lockheed’s shares fell nearly 6%. Reuters reported Boeing’s victory before the official announcement.Trump, the 47th US president, announced the winner from the White House, saying the new jet will be called the F-47.For Boeing, the win marks a reversal of fortune for a company that has struggled on both the commercial and defense sides of its business. It is a major boost for its St Louis, Missouri, fighter jet production business.The engineering and manufacturing development contract is worth more than $20bn. The winner will eventually receive hundreds of billions of dollars in orders over the contract’s multi-decade lifetime.NGAD was conceived as a “family of systems” centered around a sixth-generation fighter to counter adversaries such as China and Russia.Boeing’s commercial operations have struggled as it attempts to get its bestselling 737 Max jet production back up to full speed, while its defense operation has been weighed down by underperforming contracts for mid-air refueling tankers, drones and training jets.Cost overruns at the KC-46 mid-air refueling tanker program have surpassed $7bn in recent years, while another fixed-price contract to upgrade two Air Force One planes has created a $2bn loss for the top-five US defense contractor.Lockheed, which was recently eliminated from the competition to build the navy’s next-generation carrier-based stealth fighter, faces an uncertain future in the high-end fighter market after the loss.The billionaire and presidential adviserElon Muskhas voiced skepticism about the effectiveness of crewed high-end fighters, saying cheaper drones were a better option.While Lockheed could still protest against the award to Boeing, the fact Trump announced the deal in a high-profile Oval Office press conference could reduce the possibility of a public airing of arguments against the agreement from the defense firm based in Bethesda, Maryland.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryBoeingUS politicsAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

If the US president imposes 10% tariffs on all global imports, the impact would be significant, with Irish GDP dropping by 3.2% compared with a no-tariff scenario, the study showed.The ESRI said nearly all tariff scenarios would have a “significant negative impact” on the Irish economy, with a knock-on effect causing job losses and potential loss of US multinationals.“Protectionist policies may also prompt multinationals to relocate to the US, posing further risks to the Irish economy and public finances,” Paul Egan, the report’s author and a research officer at the ESRI, said.Ireland is one of three EU countries with a surplus in goods trade with the US, with pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer and Eli Lilly driving many of its exports, booking the profits from sales across the Atlantic in Ireland – a practice that Trump wants to stop.The Irish government is already nervous about the impact of Trump’s threat of tariffs after the US president singled out what heconsiders to be the theft of jobs and investment by Ireland.In a meeting with the Irish taoiseach in the Oval Office two weeks ago, Trump praised Ireland for being “smart” but said it had the “entire pharmaceutical industry in its grasp”.Experts in Ireland have said that the threat of a tightened tax regime were more likely to incentivise pharmaceutical companies tobook their profits in the US, rather than endure tariffs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A shrinking economy could also trigger inflation, with higher import prices on goods affected by retaliatory tariffs.By value, Ireland’s biggest imports from the US are aircraft, because of the size of the budget airline Ryanair and Dublin-headquartered Aercap, the world’s largest aircraft leasing company. Other significant imports include pharmaceuticals, machinery, optical and medical apparatus and energy, including liquid gas and oil.Egan said his research team could not quantify the scale of the impact of uncertainty caused by Trump’s threats of tariffs but said it would have an impact.“The heightened uncertainty in the short run could actually magnify the impacts, kind of beyond what we discuss in the paper,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.Explore more on these topicsIrelandDonald TrumpEuropeInternational tradePharmaceuticals industryUS politicsEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Under this legislation, one needs signatures from 10% of town voters.Ehrlich brandished an envelope claiming that he had 1,800 signatures – but reportedly refused to show it to town workers, alleging that signatories were worried about blowback.After his failed takeover, Ehrlich entered Sea Village’s mayoral race as a write-in candidate. On Tuesday, Ehrlich lost heavily to the incumbent, Elena Villafane, in a1,064-to-62vote, according toreports.Ehrlich’s mutinous moves are reminiscent of the campaign by Donald Trump’s key aideElon Muskto slash federal spending as head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, an ad-hoc body created by the US president upon returning to the White House two months ago. Doge staffers have repeatedly arrived at federal agency officesdemanding access to premises and computer data, while firing or putting on notice hundreds of thousands of public service employees. Many of his moveshave beensuccessfullychallengedin court.After village employees told Ehrlich that his proclamation was “invalid and unsupported by law”, they asked him to leave. But Ehrlich and his associates turned “increasingly confrontational and refused” the villagesaidin a Facebook post.The pushback left Ehrlich’s timbers un-shivered. Although city staff kept calm, Ehrlich and his crew “raised their voices, used profane language, made outlandish claims, and engaged in direct harassment of Village personnel”, the post added – and would not raise anchor.This created “a hostile and disruptive environment that required police intervention”. Village workers suffered “nearly an hour of escalating hostility before Mr Ehrlich and his associates left and order was restored”.Village leaders thanked office staff for remaining cool-headed and respectful despite “being subjected to intense and outlandish behavior”.“They are a credit to our Village and demonstrate the motto of ‘Keep Calm and Carry On,’” the Facebook post said.After his loss, Ehrlich reportedly insisted “I’m still the mayor” and,like Trumpsincehis defeatin the2020 presidential election, claimed the village election “was rigged”.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS politicsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Construction works are significantly more advanced and extend far higher today.Photograph: Pete PattissonArshad’s death was confirmed by Besix Group, a Belgian construction multinational, whose subsidiary Six Construct is one of the main contractors at the stadium.“A team of three workers was engaged in formwork operations [creating moulds for concrete] at height when the platform they were working on tilted. While all three were equipped with personal fall-arrest systems, one worker was not connected to an anchor point at the time of the incident and fell, sustaining severe injuries,” the company said in a statement. Emergency services were immediately called, but “the worker sadly succumbed to his injuries in hospital”.It is unclear how long Arshad had been working at the stadium, where it is understood he was employed as a foreman, but social media posts show him on the site from last September.After his death, workers were allegedly called to a meeting and ordered to delete any video footage of the incident and not to talk to anyone about it, according to a source who was present.Besix said: “Out of respect for the victim’s family, workers were asked not to share images of the consequences of the tragic accident on social media.View image in fullscreenMuhammad Arshad, who was in his mid-30s, had three young sons.Photograph: Handout“Safety is and remains our absolute priority … The authorities are conducting a full inquiry, and we are fully cooperating to determine the exact circumstances of this tragedy,” the company said.Arshad’s body was flown back to Pakistan on Tuesday, where his coffin was buried near his home in the north-west of the country. “We have just fallen from the sky to the ground. The whole family is in a state of shock,” Arshad’s father, Muhammad Bashir, told the Guardian.Arshad, who was in his mid-30s, had three sons aged between two and seven. “It will have a long-lasting impact on their lives. Arshad’s income was their only source of living. We will have to bear their living and educational expenses. We will try to meet their needs,” said Bashir.On Monday, Bashir said he had not yet been contacted directly by his son’s employer, but had been assured by a relative in Saudi Arabia that his family would receive Arshad’s outstanding salary and benefits.Under Saudi labour law, employers must also pay compensation in the event of a death at work. Besix said it had taken steps to support the family and ensure all payments were, “handled in a timely and respectful manner”.View image in fullscreenThousands of migrant workers, many from Bangladesh and Pakistan, are working on the Aramco Stadium in two shifts.Photograph: Pete PattissonConstruction of the 47,000-seater Aramco Stadium is at an advanced stage, with thousands of migrant workers, many from Bangladesh and Pakistan, working at the site in two shifts. It is being developed by Aramco, the state-owned oil company, which recently became Fifa’s most lucrative sponsor.Aninvestigationlast year revealed that some migrant workers employed at the stadium were enduring highly abusive conditions. They alleged they were saddled with staggering debts from the illegal fees they were forced to pay to get to Saudi Arabia. Housed in grim, cramped rooms, they toiled for 10 hours a day in the scorching 45C (113F) summer heat for paltry wages, which some said were withheld for months.The stadium is one of11 new venues being built for the 2034 World Cup, alongside a huge expansion of the country’s transport infrastructure and hotel accommodation to meet the demands of an expanded 48-team tournament.Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup bid to be ratified by Fifa despite rights violationsRead moreWorld Cup-related construction is just one part of a building boom under way in Saudi Arabia as the Gulf kingdom seeks to rebrand itself on the global stage. The construction is almost entirely dependent on a vast army of low-wage migrant workers, who largely come from south Asia.In a statement, Besix said it had “made significant strides” in protecting workers’ rights wherever it operated, adding that sub-contractors were required to comply with welfare standards that “encompassed the full spectrum of workers’ welfare, from safety and wages to living conditions”. It acknowledged that “some local contexts have proven challenging”, and had taken additional steps to improve these standards. “Our priority is to ensure that all workers are treated with dignity and fairness,” it said.Aramco said the safety and wellbeing of employees was “our highest priority”.“The company follows industry best practices in managing and reporting incidents, including determining the facts, sequence of events and root causes,” it said in a statement.Fifa did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2034Rights and freedomSaudi Arabia and sportMigration and developmentWorkers' rightsWorld CupPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

He was the father of two young boys, aged seven and 10, who were tragically found dead in a pond near their home in Trondheim, Norway, in December 2020.”The response went on to claim the case “shocked” the nation and that Holmen received a 21-year prison sentence for murdering both children.Holmen said in a complaint to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority that the “completely false” story nonetheless contained elements similar to his own life such as his home town, the number of children he has and the age gap between his sons.“The complainant was deeply troubled by these outputs, which could have harmful effect in his private life, if they where reproduced or somehow leaked in his community or in his home town,”said the complaint, which has been filed by Holmen and Noyb, a digital rights campaign group.It added that Holmen has “never been accused nor convicted of any crime and is a conscientious citizen”.Holmen’s complaint alleged that ChatGPT’s “defamatory” response violated accuracy provisions within the GDPR European data law. It has asked the Norwegian watchdog to order ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI, to adjust its model to eliminate inaccurate results relating to Holmen and to impose a fine on the company. Noyb said that since Holmen’s interaction with ChatGPT took place, OpenAI had released a new model incorporating web searches – which has made a repeat of the Holmen error “less likely”.AI chatbots are prone to producing responsescontaining false informationbecause they are built on models that predict the next most likely word in a sentence. This can result in factual errors and wild assertions, but the plausible nature of the responses can trick users into thinking that what they are reading is 100% correct.AnOpenAIspokesperson said: “We continue to research new ways to improve the accuracy of our models and reduce hallucinations. While we’re still reviewing this complaint, it relates to a version of ChatGPT which has since been enhanced with online search capabilities that improves accuracy.”Explore more on these topicsChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAINorwayEuropeChatbotsnewsShareReuse this content"

Christian Pulisic is playing some of the best soccer of his career at Milan. Weston McKennie has, improbably, become a stalwart once again at Juventus, the very club that tries to dump him every summer. Tyler Adams is finally healthy and ticking over sweetly at the base of the Bournemouth midfield. Josh Sargent is having yet another productive season with Norwich in the Championship. Chris Richards has grown into his immense potential at the heart of the Crystal Palace defense. You could go on like that for a little while longer.Panama thwart USMNT again with stoppage-time win in Nations LeagueRead moreTiming, on the other hand, is no longer Pochettino’s friend.He wanted to “destroy” Panama in Thursday’s Concacaf Nations League semi-final in Los Angeles, he said, although hastening to add that he meant it “in the sports way”, steering well clear of delving into thepolitics of an expansionist president.Panama, of course, had already defeated the United States twice in the sides’ last two non-friendly meetings. In the 2023 Gold Cup,Los Canalerostriumphed on penalties in the semi-final. A 2-1 come-from-behind win in last summer’s stateside Copa América sent the dominoes tumbling towards a humiliating group stage elimination, Gregg Berhalter’s firing and, ultimately, Pochettino’s hire.On Thursday, the Americans looked jittery, disjointed and lethargic in the first half and, while brighter and more energetic in the second, they were incapable of breaking down the tightly packed Panamanians. A series of chances for the American strikers Sargent and his replacement Patrick Agyemang yielded no goals whereas Panama’s Cecilio Waterman put away his side’s one real chance in the 94th minute, beating a mispositioned Matt Turner to his far post. Tyler Adams’ 98th-minute rocket half-volley from the edge of the box came within inches of saving his team.On the CBS broadcast, which had been swarmed by the Panamanian team as Waterman celebrated with his idol, Thierry Henry, analysts Clint Dempsey and Mo Edu were unsparing.“We weren’t good enough,” said Dempsey. “It’s an embarrassment.”“This feeling feels too familiar,” added Edu. “One team had a plan. And they executed that plan. That team was Panama.”View image in fullscreenThierry Henry is mobbed by Panama players at the CBS desk.Photograph: Étienne Laurent/APPochettino, for his part, was under no illusions about what had gone wrong. Not enough aggression on the ball in the first half, which he called “really painful.”“We areUSA, but you cannot win with your shirt,” he added in his post-game press conference. “You need to come here and be better and suffer and win the duels and work hard. If not, it’s not going to be enough.”This now makes it three consecutive tournaments on home soil where the US has faceplanted, each time to Panama. With just under 15 months remaining until the 2026 World Cup, played mostly in the US, something beginning to approximate a panic will set in now.In terms of meaningful competitions to prepare for the big dance, only this summer’s Gold Cup remains. But this event is far from ideal – it will pit the Yanks against the same old Concacaf competition (plus Saudi Arabia), and the US will have to contest it without Juventus players McKennie and Tim Weah and probably Borussia Dortmund’s Gio Reyna, who should all be away contesting the Club World Cup at the same time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Americans will get to play a feisty opponent in Canada on Sunday all the same, and with a great deal to prove (and no small amount of political pressure). They can take some consolation in a late defeat absent their injured starting full-backs Antonee Robinson and Sergiño Dest – just the sort of attacking talents who could have broken down the narrowCanalerosfrom the flanks. Leading strikers Ricardo Pepi and Folarin Balogun, also injured, were also much missed.Perhaps helpfully, Pochettino has been exposed as a merely mortal coach. The halo is gone. The players in his care are the same as they were under Berhalter, more or less. They have the same shortcomings they’ve always had: A knack for starting crucial games shorn of the requisite energy, and a chronic difficulty picking apart low defensive blocks. There may yet be value in this realization.History, too, might offer some comfort here. There is a long list of host teams who stumbled into their home World Cup on the back of a concerning run of form. Ahead of the 1986 World Cup, Mexico suffered a series of shaky performances, culminating in a 3-0 loss to England in their final tune-up. ButEl Tri, managed by Bora Milutinović – who would take over the US in 1994, as it happens – made a run to the quarter-final, matching its best performance ever.In ’94, the Americans stumbled through their preparations with losses to Romania, Sweden, Chile and, worst of all, Iceland – a total non-factor in international soccer back then. These defeats were wedged around a series of insipid ties with unimpressive opponents. Yet the Yanks made the second round at the World Cup, losing 1-0 to eventual champions Brazil and setting the stage for the modern era of American soccer as we know it today.France won just two of its six matches before lifting the 1998 World Cup in Paris. Germany lost 4-1 to Italy just three months before staging the 2006 World Cup, where it would make a surprise run to the semi-finals regardless. South Africa couldn’t beat Namibia or North Korea as it prepared for the 2010 World Cup, where it was nevertheless competitive and a tad unlucky not to advance from the group stage.On the basis of that knowledge, at least, USMNT fans can take a breath and consider the precedent of host teams who have gotten their acts together at the 11th hour.That said, the Americans have an awful lot of work to do to get there.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

But as the various royals, sporting dignitaries, politicians and billionaires left the Costa Navarino resort on Friday, some really believed the resultcould have turned out very differently.Yes, the 41-year-old Zimbabwean ex-swimmer had won in the first round with 49 votes to become the first woman to lead the IOC. And yes, Juan Antonio Samaranch and Sebastian Coe, the other members of the “Big Three”, had come away with just 28 and eight votes respectively. But in the postmortem there were several stories about how the IOC machine had powered Thomas Bach’s chosen successor over the line.So who is Kirsty Coventry, who now has global sport’s most powerful job? | Sean IngleRead more“We were hearing about phone calls telling members: ‘Don’t waste your vote, do the right thing’”, said one well-placed source. Another admitted: “The lobbying and strong-arming was intense.” There were even reports of at least one IOC member going up to Bach to voice their displeasure.Some camps believe it changed the entire race. For months most candidates had their own internal trackers, which predicted who each IOC member would vote for round by round, as the lowest scoring candidate dropped out. And at the start of the week, several camps had similar numbers for the crucial first round of voting.Samaranch, depending on who you spoke to, had either 24, 28 or 30 votes in the bag. Lord Coe’s ranged from as low as 20 and as high as 26. And while two camps had Coventry in the low or mid-20s, and another a fair bit higher, the consensus was that there was everything still to play for.At this point Coe was still hopeful that his message of being the change candidate was working. And he saw a path to victory in the later rounds, with some promising to switch to him after lending Coventry their first-round vote.View image in fullscreenSebastian Coe possibly over-estimated the appetite for change among IOC voters.Photograph: Nikolas Kominis/APSamaranch, meanwhile, hoped that his charm, his small-c change manifesto and his 24 years at the IOC might turn the vote his way late on. Until the final 48 hours, most reckoned he was the slight favourite.But the danger zone for both men was always going to be the first round. They knew Coventry had to knock them out early, as she wouldn’t pick up many more votes in the later rounds. Their mistake was not believing that she could do it.But 24 hours before the election there were growing signs Coventry was gaining serious momentum. The first came when Bach was made honorary IOC president. As the 71-year-old received the award he feigned surprise, even though he surely knew it was coming. But then came an hour-long eulogy from IOC members, some of whom shed tears while others compared him to Nelson Mandela.“May the Olympic gods continue to guide you, dear president,” said his deputy, Nicole Hoevertsz. No wonder that one critic described it as “a level of unctuousness that would not have looked out of place on the politburo in Pyongyang”.But those in the room were divided about what this choreography really meant. Was it the IOC membership giving Bach a send-off so he didn’t feel too angered when Coventry lost? Or did it mean the 71-year-old German was giving a final reminder to members of his power and how he wanted them to vote?One candidate’s team admitted they misjudged it. “It was a classic example where you see the signs but you tell yourself it is something else,” they said.By Thursday morning it was clear that Coventry was picking up steam. Observers reckoned her vote had risen into the 40s. Meanwhile Bach was looking noticeably more cheery as he cracked jokes about being a lame duck.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn the afternoon a 10-minute coffee break before the scheduled 4pm election turned into 45 minutes. Were Coventry’s supporters trying for one last push, some in the room asked?Whatever the reason, it worked. After a minor delay when IOC member Samira Asghari struggled to vote, causing the IOC director general Christophe De Kepper to tell her: “You are testing my nerves and those of the candidates,” the contest was over after two minutes.While Coventry celebrated, others were conducting a postmortem. Most agreed that Coe took by far the biggest haircut in the final stages and queried if the IOC election rulebook, which states that “the IOC administration shall maintain strict neutrality at all times”, might not be worth the paper it was written on.But when Coe was asked whether it was a clean fight, he was sanguine. “Oh, it’s an election.” While another influential voice made a similar point: “Elections – what’s new?”However this was a contest where the rules were so strict that, when the entire IOC membership had dinner in Lausanne in January, the seven candidates were put together on a table with Bach, where they had a lobster and couscous starter followed by cod, to prevent them lobbying potential voters.Yet while there is still some disquiet in some quarters, the sense is that the membership will move on and close ranks behind Coventry. That is what the IOC tends to do, after all. No wonder IOC honorary member Dick Pound said the voting process “makes the Vatican conclave look like it’s open house”.For Coe, his requiem for a lost dream will perhaps return to whether he misjudged the appetite for change among members and the extent of Bach’s power. Perhaps the die was cast in 2016 when Coe and World Athletics banned Russian track and field athletes from the 2016 Olympics for state-sponsored doping.But Coe can at least reflect on this. His candidacy at least got Coventry talking about the need to do more to help athletes, cut costs at the IOC, and to protect women’s sport, none of which were in her manifesto. Perhaps one day he will see that as a positive. But for now this defeat will sting.Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeOlympic GamesSport politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The new head coach had talked about the need for cut and thrust, for excitement. He was eager to ignite something at the beginning of the road to the 2026 World Cup. Instead, it was one for the more prosaic values – professionalism and control; hard work, especially without the ball.There was the basic ingredient of a victory on what was a showpiece occasion for Tuchel, however flat it might have felt for long spells. Together with one glorious individual story and a much more familiar one.England 2-0 Albania: World Cup 2026 qualifier – live reactionRead moreMyles Lewis-Skelly was excellent on his first England cap, showing the swashbuckling runs from left-back that have lit up his breakthrough season at Arsenal and scoring after just 20 minutes. You could barely have scripted it. Except this is Lewis-Skelly, the 18-year-oldwho writes them himself.Then there was Harry Kane. The captain had suggested beforehand that his scoring exploits have started to be taken for granted. Perhaps people were getting bored of him. Surely no one can tire of him finding the net for England. Kane brought up goal No 70 in his 104th appearance towards the end of a pretty forgettable second half and that was that.It was onlyAlbania, the team ranked 65th in the world, who showed why with their defending for both the goals. But Tuchel has made his first step and it was assured enough, the positives taking in a commanding performance in central defence from Ezri Konsa and some good bits by Jude Bellingham.All eyes were on Tuchel from the moment he emerged into the Wembley spotlight and the scrutiny burned on his selection. There were many headlines. Dan Burn and Lewis-Skelly in for their debuts; Marc Guéhi left on the substitutes’ bench. The use of Curtis Jones alongside Declan Rice in midfield, allowing Bellingham to push high as a No 10.The blockbuster was Marcus Rashford on the left, back for the first time in a year.“Welcome to the Home of Football, Thomas,” read the giant banner behind one of the goals before kick-off. There was a fireworks display. The house DJ even had a track with “Thomas Tuchel’s army” in the lyrics. He could see a snap about his players when they hassled Albania to regain possession. They set the tempo without the ball at the outset. This was good. It was a little more measured in possession; the focus on wearing Albania down.It had the feel of one of those games when the low block would be difficult to dismantle, Albania sitting deep in their 4-5-1 system. Enter Lewis-Skelly. He had taken one confident touch in the opening exchanges, stepping up and away from his man. The kid has no nerves, merely the desire to seize any opportunity and his goal was the latest chapter of the fairytale. He looked a little disbelieving as he celebrated – and not only because of the ease with which he was able to run in behind Jasir Asani. The Albania winger had to be stronger.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane celebrates after scoring England’s second goal against Albania at Wembley.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was a pass from Bellingham after some imperious strutting from him and Lewis-Skelly finished first-time with his left foot, guiding the ball through the legs of the goalkeeper, Thomas Strakosha. If you could bottle the feeling.Albania struggled to get out of their half before the interval, although when they did for the first time in the 27th minute, they had the scent of a freakish equaliser.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England scrambled clear.Jones was busy; Bellingham menaced and England had a clutch of clear chances to score again before half-time. Rashford played a nice return pass to Bellingham, who was denied at close quarters by Strakosha. Bellingham also watched aghast as Strakosha saved superbly with his foot to keep out a header from him while Kane’s rebound effort was blocked just as miraculously by Berat Djimsiti. Burn trampled into space to meet a Rice corner which he thudded into the crossbar.It was Burn’s second Wembley appearance in a week after his goalscoring, man-of-the-match performance inNewcastle’s Carabao Cup final winagainst Liverpool. The magic evaporated for him in the second half. He got away with a high boot that felled Myrto Uzuni but he almost did not get away with his lack of pace, the Albania substitute Armando Broja coming close to exposing it. There was also the moment when Broja beat Burn to a flick-on and Tuchel could be grateful for a saving Konsa challenge on Asani.Lewis-Skelly continued to step up with the ball, to get England moving, to ask questions while Rashford was desperate to make something happen. Perhaps too desperate. Ditto Phil Foden, who could get little going on the right.Bellingham crossed for Kane, who could not get the needed power in the header and Jones might have shot rather than look for another pass after a neat move.The second half became a slog for England but Kane lifted things when Rice crossed and Arlind Ajeti got himself into a muddle, trying to intercept and failing. Kane brought the ball down and caressed the shot into the far corner.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersEnglandAlbaniamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

As the games piled up against her and she visibly struggled physically, Raducanu limped slowly between rallies and she was barely any more agile once they began. It seemed like she had nothing more to give.Even when she appeared to be rounding on certain defeat, however, Raducanu refused to stop searching for a way through. The 22 year-old was rewarded for her faith and fortitude with one of the best wins of her career as she recovered from numerous deficits in the final set of an utterly chaotic tussle to defeat Emma Navarro, the eighth seed, 7-6 (6), 2-6, 7-6 (3) and reach the third round of the Miami Open.Miami Open: Gauff condemns Kenin to double bagel as Fearnley progressesRead moreIt is difficult to overstate the importance of this win for Raducanu, who had arrived in Miami struggling badly for confidence after losing five of her previous six matches. Even though she won the US Open on the same surface, this is Raducanu’s first ever top 10 win on hard courts and her third overall.Asked where this moment ranks in her season so far, Raducanu said: “This is No 1. Emma is a top 10 opponent, I haven’t beaten a top 10 opponent this year so that’s my first one. She made me work hard for every single point. I don’t think the whole match was pretty but just taking into account: I had to fight. I had to scrap. I had to be aggressive because there was no way I was going to beat her trying to out-rally her.”It was clear from the beginning that Raducanu was feeling good on the court. She opened the match attacking her forehand with clarity and confidence. Her serve, which has also been a significant liability this year, was potent. In the final stages of a high quality set, it was Navarro who felt the pressure and squandered two set points.While the durable and consistent Navarro comfortably maintained her steady level at the beginning of the set and continued to drag Raducanu into arduous, lengthy rallies as frequently as possible, Raducanu’s intensity rapidly dropped in set two. Her footwork practically slowed to a halt. As the second set fell away from Raducanu, she was badly struggling.View image in fullscreenEmma Navarro struggled to maintain her level against Emma Raducanu in the third set.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APBefore the final set, Raducanu received treatment from the trainer for what appeared to be blisters on her left foot. The medical timeout appeared to make little difference early in the final set as she hobbled around the court and immediately lost her serve.But Raducanu desperately searched for a way back into the match and her determination left its mark on an increasingly tentative Navarro, whose composure, and forehand, crumbled.From 1-3 down, Raducanu reeled off five games in a row to lead 5-3. The momentum shifts, however, did not stop. Navarro soon served for the match at 6-5. Then the pair found themselves in a final set tie-break. As the lead moved from one player to another and back again, the one constant was Raducanu’s determination to take the ball early and control her destiny. She dictated the vast majority of the final set and she struck the ball cleanly in the decisive moments. Her courage earned her an unforgettable win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just keep fighting. I literally played every point like it was going to be my last.”This breakthrough result for Raducanu had been preceded by her opting to end her trial partnership with the Slovak coach Vladimir Platenik on the eve of the tournament. Still, Raducanu noted that her work over the past few weeks contributed to this result. After a brutal month on and off the court, she has found her way again: “I’ve gone through a lot and I told myself that you’ve gone through too much to leave it to her,” said Raducanu. “I was just fighting every single point.”In the men’s draw Novak Djokovic, the No 4 seed, beat Australia’s Rinky Hijikata 6-0, 7-6(1) to reach the third round where he will face the world No 69, Camilo Ugo Carabelli.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Bronny James was 7 of 10 from the field, showing the growth and promise that makes head coach JJ Redick confident the 20-year-old can and will contribute as a professional.Bill Chisholm reportedly agrees record $6.1bn deal to buy NBA champion Boston CelticsRead more“We’ve obviously monitored him in the G [League] and feel like he’s, you know, in those sort of end game situations when he’s gotten a chance to play with us, he’s been really good,” Redick said. “So not surprised by tonight.”James got the opportunity to play more because starters Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves were each held out because of sprained right ankles, joiningLeBron James(groin) and Rui Hachimura (patella) in street clothes. Important bench options Dorian Finney-Smith (left ankle) and Jarred Vanderbilt (right groin strain) were also out.With so much scoring not in uniform, Bronny James tried to do his part to fill the gap. That included a memorable long outlet pass to Markeith Morris for a layup late in the first half reminiscent of his legendary father.“Gaining my confidence and gain my comfortability over reps, you know, and getting out there and taking advantage of my opportunity if it’s given, so just being ready at all times is the biggest thing for me,” Bronny James said.Thursday marked the third time in his rookie season James has played in at least three straight games, and Redick sees a growing comfort as the Southern California product gets more time on the court. James’ 29:53 of game action was the third highest on the team, behind fellow rookie Dalton Knecht and fourth-year guard Jordan Goodwin.With the Lakers throughly outmanned in the defeat, James was in a familiar position as the primary focal point afterward, a position Redick knows he’s ready to handle given his upbringing.Redick recalled his reaction to James’ media sessions at theNBAdraft combine before he had been hired as Lakers coach.“I texted Bron and I was like, ’Man, Bronny has his head on straight,’” Redick said. “Like, he gets it. And since Day 1, I’ve just been impressed with the person that he is.“It was obvious to me from the moment, you know, I started spending time with him on the court this summer, you know he was certainly going to be an NBA player. And I still believe that. He’ll be an NBA player.”Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles LakersNBALeBron JamesMilwaukee BucksUS sportsBasketballShareReuse this content"

I’m a bit in shock. I can’t believe we get a pole for the sprint race. It puts us in good stead for the race.”McLaren, who had a one-two in qualifying in Australia withLando Norrisand Oscar Piastri, had been expected to dominate in China, and Norris was indeed quickest in first practice and both drivers showed strong pace in the first two sessions of qualifying.However for the final runs Norris, who had been going quicker, made errors in the final sector on both his hot laps. He was on for pole on his final run before going wide at the hairpin and aborting the lap. He finished in sixth with Piastri in third, eight-hundredths behind Hamilton.Norris reiterated his belief that while their car is quick it remains a handful to drive when on the limit.“I made a mistake, locked up in the last corner,” he said. “We struggled a lot with the car. Not quick enough. The difficulties we have been struggling with showed a lot more today.

Here it is, a new way of standing, a new energy, a new outline. How are we going to feel? What isThomas Tuchel? Do I like this thing? What are the semiotics of body shape, stride pattern, arm movements, that will come to signify triumph or despair?At Wembley for day one of his fast-cut mini-era, Tuchel looked good. There is a distinct kind of charisma in that skinny frame, angular, tall, oddly impressive, like a strolling duke. Leaders wear hats. The Tuchel cap is good. Maybe city centre fashion retailers will be doing a blue Tommy T by next summer. Maybe its all going to be fine. Maybe it’s going to be smart Gareth, Gareth+, Gareth without the really Gareth bits. Maybe it’s justAlbania.Lewis-Skelly’s England debut goal sets up Tuchel’s winning start over AlbaniaRead moreBut Englandwere pretty good on Tuchel Day one. This was after all still England on a Friday night, post-work pints football, chip shop stroll football. As ever Wembley was a vast echoey fizzy place at kick-off, given life by the bobbling knot in the Albanian away end and a diaspora of thousands more dotted about the seats in pie crust hats, eagle flags fluttering.It was a slightly strange game, a sleepily comfortable 2-0 win, during which Dan Burn touched the ball 153 times on his debut. Has anyEnglandplayer ever touched the ball this many times? But it was good for Tuchel in other ways. In a bracing break from tradition he was also harsh in victory, disdained the easy ticks, criticising his players, asking for more. This is good. This is unsettling. No easy wins, even in the easy wins.Tuchel’s first selection was interesting too. A returning Marcus Rashford. A defence with two debutants, including of course Dan Burn, who seems to be surging around the country like a novel coronavirus.Words like and energy and intensity had been chucked around in build up. But there just wasn’t really the room or the time for transitions, high turnovers, the dogs of counter-press. How do you do this when you’re noodling about in possession and people are throwing paper aeroplanes on to the pitch?Tuchel isn’t just those words though. This is a manager who also wants control and England were sure-footed at times. It also felt like it mattered. The brevity of his contract has inserted an unexpected jeopardy. Tuchel has been given a target for the World Cup. That target is: win the World Cup! Admittedly this has been the tried before. We remember Greg Dyke’s 2022 World Cup glory countdown clock.But there is an intensity here. Nobody’s fiddling away building a pathway. It’s a high speed monorail. It’s a dash across the collapsing rope bridge to the grail. Fast-cut, instant, TikTok-style management where every choice is condensed.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel offered an intensity with every choice condensed in his World Cup target.Photograph: Alastair Grant/APSo what did we get? Tuchel was out on his touchline early on in premium hooded blue rain mac, skinny jeans, brown shoes, a kind of Sunday lunchtime Surrey banker chic. You half expected to see a Labrador trailing behind him. At the start England just passed and passed, as Albania sat so deep they were pretty much playing in the crowd.It’s a classic Wembley test, too much of the ball, the extended silence, the lull that nags away at the back of an English footballer’s mind like a ticking clock. Go on. Cope with time passing. And the ball. Go on. Be England while people watch.Happily the first really bold pick paid off. It was Myles Lewis-Skelly who scored the first goal of the Tuchel England era. It was beautifully made by Jude Bellingham, spinning and threading a pass for Lewis-Skelly’s run. The finish was calm. Pretty much the entire team ran across to offer proprietary, mentor-like hugs and head pats.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not much happened for a while, the game became an exercise in will-Dan-Burn-score, because of course this is the week when Dan Burn has an incredible week.Harry Kane would eventually score the second with a fine finish. And that was pretty much that. Does it mean much? The energy was a bit different. Tuchel has done interesting things. He talked a lot about club football and intensity. He rejigged training and the press conference times to make it more like a Champions League game. This is a good USP for Tuchel. It’s what he has, elite club football swank.Only one previous new England manager had ever won the European Cup, Fabio Capello, who approached the job with all the carefree enthusiasm of a man cajoled into emptying the cat litter tray at midnight because the bin men are coming tomorrow. Southgate was always running to catch up with the club football optics. Tuchel has that. This is his superpower.

We always want to play with a punch. We want to score goals.”The array of rising stars on show meant this game had been billed as the most valuable Under-21 international ever held with the combined value of both squads estimated at almost €1bn by thetransfermarkt website.Carsley said this week that he feels “very lucky” to be back in charge of such a talented squad after his spell as interim senior coach and had hinted that he would use this and Monday’s friendly against Portugal to try out different combinations with a largely different group to the squad that triumphed in Georgia two years ago.Bournemouth’s Alex Scott was a surprise choice at right-wing back as Adam Wharton – who along with Taylor Harwood-Bellis and Delap trained with Thomas Tuchel’s senior squad this week – and Elliot Anderson showed glimpses of their ability in central midfield in an area of the squad where Carsley is spoilt for choice.He must have thought it was going to be a comfortable evening when McAtee – who may not be eligible for this summer’s finals in Slovakia given Manchester City’s involvement at the club World Cup – slammed home from close range from a corner after Delap’s header deflected off his Ipswich teammate Jaden Philogene in the second minute.View image in fullscreenHarvey Elliott misses a chance to level the match after blasting his penalty over the bar.Photograph: Dave Winter/ShutterstockBut France also have impressive depth in this age group and were level within two minutes when a brilliant through ball from Cherki set up Quentin Merlin inside the area. Harwood-Bellis and the goalkeeper James Beadle were then at fault as a long ball from Cherki allowed Ekitike – who will face Tottenham in next month’s Europa League quarter-final – to race through and score.While they struggled to get to grips with France’s skilful front three, England looked bright whenever they went forward and it needed solid saves from the goalkeeper Obed Nkambadio to keep out efforts from Delap, Philogene and Anderson, before Philogene’s deflected shot struck the post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Elliott gave England renewed hope when he pulled one back from McAtee’s clever header across goal, with Anderson then going within inches of equalising just before half-time.With so many options on the bench, including Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri who was celebrating his 18th birthday, it was a surprise that Carsley didn’t make any changes until later in the second half when the game was already lost.Ekitike soon completed his hat-trick with a simple tap in after Odobert once again left CJ Egan-Riley in his dust, although England refused to throw in the towel and were given a lifeline when Delap headed in after McAtee’s chip struck the crossbar.Elliott was handed a golden opportunity to equalise from the spot when Rico Lewis was taken out but the Liverpool forward’s penalty was reminiscent of Harry Kane’s against France at the 2022 World Cup as it sailed into the stands.It was left for Cherki to apply the coup de grâce when his shot squirmed under the unfortunate Beadle to send Carsley back to the drawing board.Explore more on these topicsEngland Under-21smatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Chinese businessman was disqualified as an owner under the league’s owners’ and directors’ test in February, an action made public at commercial court in London on Friday.During the proceedings, a letter from the EFL was referenced by the lawyer Martin Budworth, who was acting for Dai andReading, detailing its decision to disqualify Dai. The EFL previously pushed to disqualify Dai after multiple breaches of regulations but was overruled by an independent panel and a financial sanction was imposed.It is understood the reason for Dai’s disqualification is related to business matters in China and not related to his running of the club. An EFL statement said: “Following its disclosure in open court earlier today, the league can confirm that Mr Yongge has been recently disqualified under the EFL’s owners’ and directors’ test. The disqualification requires Mr Yongge to divest his interests in the club, and in the event that he fails to do so within the agreed timeframe, the league will consider all options available within its regulations to bring the matter to a conclusion.“The league continues to work closely with Reading FC to progress a sale of the club at the earliest opportunity, in order to end the current uncertainty surrounding its future for its staff, supporters and wider community.”The EFL granted Reading’s request to extend to 5 April the permitted window to divest his shares. Under league relegations, failure to meet the deadline could result in theLeague Oneclub being suspended from playing matches. The EFL will determine possible next steps at a board meeting in the week of the deadline.EFL rules state “the league shall have the power to suspend the club” if a disqualified director “fails to resign and their club fails to ensure their removal from office as required”.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Reading said in a statement: “Mr Dai remains committed to working with the EFL to sell the club and secure its long-term future.”The EFL did not disclose Dai’s disqualification in February because it felt doing so could hinder a sale but progress has been slow.

It’s actually really nice. But also maybe the stage I was at as a coach, maybe actually this is good for me at this present moment.“It allows me to look back, calm down, actually just go through how the week was, what could be improved, what was good, so it probably allows me … maybe it has given me that space and time to improve and reflect, but you have to make good use of it. Time will tell if I’ve made good use of it. But I believe that’s probably more important. I haven’t managed before, Thomas has managed before so he will have a different view of it.“My view of working day to day and now actually being a manager, it’s a really good environment in which to learn. You have to have good people around you and I definitely have good coaches, but also good people above you who plan your days, plan your weeks, keep you active.“I’m definitely grateful for them. They’ve managed to keep me active … probably too active. I don’t feel like I’ve had a big break, I feel like I’m constantly at work.”View image in fullscreenBen Davies, Joe Rodon and David Brooks in training with Wales before their World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan on Saturday.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PABen Davies, the Wales captain in the absence of Aaron Ramsey, who recently underwent hamstring surgery, said theteam’s poor showing at the 2022 World Cup, when they finished bottom of Group B without a win, was a driver for the squad to reach another major tournament.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We didn’t really show how good we can be on the world stage and that hunger to go and do it again is definitely there.”Bellamy said the experience of qualifying for a World Cup would serve him and his squad well. “I can just sit back and let them [the players] do it,” he said. “It’s so valuable. Their calmness with it as well, they’ve been there [to a World Cup]. But also the crowd, they’ve been there as well. It’s so important because they’ve got to experience major tournaments.“When we say ‘Together stronger’ [the Wales slogan], it’s everyone. I expect expectations, I welcome them.

Among its findings, the group observed:296 of the 442 teams have at least one betting partner this season.145 have gambling sponsorship on the front of their shirts.Clubs in Italy and Belgium work around front-of-shirt bans by displaying logos of gambling companies’ charitable foundations or news/entertainment websites.14 of the 31 leagues analysed rely on a betting company as their title sponsor.27 clubs across Europe’s top five leagues are partnered with Asian-facing betting companies.The ubiquity of gambling advertising in the Premier League is well documented. Eleven teams have a gambling logo on the front of their 2024-25 shirts, the highest proportion among Europe’s top five leagues, and every team have a betting partner. Betting brands have spent about $135m (£104m) on shirt deals in the English top flight this season, according to research by Global Data, cited by Investigate Europe.View image in fullscreenClub Brugge have switched their shirt sponsor from Unibet to U-Experts, which is a news app made by Unibet with links to its casino offering.Photograph: Kurt Desplenter/Belga/AFP/Getty ImagesOther continental leagues are closing the gap. Every side in the Dutch Eredivisie has a betting partner or sponsor. Portugal, Greece and Germany are also prominent and lucrative markets, the research found. But even in smaller markets there is widespread advertising, with the majority of top-flight sides in Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria wearing betting logos on their shirts.English top-flight sides have agreed to avoluntary ban on front-of-shirt sponsorshipfrom the ­2026-27 season, but Investigate Europe found that countries which had enacted such bans had clubs apparently exploiting loopholes. In Belgium, for example, a law took effect in January restricting sponsorships to sleeves and the back of shirts. Yet several Pro League clubs display betting insignia on the front of shirts, using sub-brands that incorporate only part of the company’s name. The reigning champions, Club Brugge, for example, switched their shirt sponsor from Unibet to U-Experts, a news app made by Unibet with links to its casino offering.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Milan struck a deal with Boomerang Bet in July 2024 as their regional partner in Europe. This was despite the brand being blacklisted by Italian authorities and operating without a local licence, a legal requirement in the country. Milan and Boomerang did not respond to requests for comment from Investigate Europe.Other clubs endorse companies blacklisted by national authorities elsewhere on the continent for not having the required local licences, and there remains a widespread presence for Asian bookmakers, many of whom do not officially operate in Europe. Twenty-seven teams across the top five leagues were identified as having partnered with 22 Asia-facing . In Italy, eight teams have deals visible only when accessing club websites from Asia or through an Asia-based VPN.The importance of front-of-shirt sponsorship is itself a moot point, further studies have shown. According toresearch by academics at the University of Bristol, on the opening weekend of the Premier League almost 30,000 gambling adverts were broadcast to audiences in stadiums and across TV, radio and social media, 165% more than a year before. Shirt sponsors accounted for less than 10% of that total.Charles Livingstone, a member of the World Health Organization’s expert group on gambling and gambling disorder says research shows that the more exposure you have to gambling ads, the more likely you are to gamble, and that advertising remains key to the strategies of betting firms.The industry spends millions on promotions “because it helps them to recruit new gamblers,” said Livingstone. “And the reason … is because the best customers are those who go broke. So they constantly have to recruit new gamblers to replace the ones who have gone through all their money and all their assets and all their relationships.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballGamblingnewsShareReuse this content"

Construction works are significantly more advanced and extend far higher today.Photograph: Pete PattissonArshad’s death was confirmed by Besix Group, a Belgian construction multinational, whose subsidiary Six Construct is one of the main contractors at the stadium.“A team of three workers was engaged in formwork operations [creating moulds for concrete] at height when the platform they were working on tilted. While all three were equipped with personal fall-arrest systems, one worker was not connected to an anchor point at the time of the incident and fell, sustaining severe injuries,” the company said in a statement. Emergency services were immediately called, but “the worker sadly succumbed to his injuries in hospital”.It is unclear how long Arshad had been working at the stadium, where it is understood he was employed as a foreman, but social media posts show him on the site from last September.After his death, workers were allegedly called to a meeting and ordered to delete any video footage of the incident and not to talk to anyone about it, according to a source who was present.Besix said: “Out of respect for the victim’s family, workers were asked not to share images of the consequences of the tragic accident on social media.View image in fullscreenMuhammad Arshad, who was in his mid-30s, had three young sons.Photograph: Handout“Safety is and remains our absolute priority … The authorities are conducting a full inquiry, and we are fully cooperating to determine the exact circumstances of this tragedy,” the company said.Arshad’s body was flown back to Pakistan on Tuesday, where his coffin was buried near his home in the north-west of the country. “We have just fallen from the sky to the ground. The whole family is in a state of shock,” Arshad’s father, Muhammad Bashir, told the Guardian.Arshad, who was in his mid-30s, had three sons aged between two and seven. “It will have a long-lasting impact on their lives. Arshad’s income was their only source of living. We will have to bear their living and educational expenses. We will try to meet their needs,” said Bashir.On Monday, Bashir said he had not yet been contacted directly by his son’s employer, but had been assured by a relative in Saudi Arabia that his family would receive Arshad’s outstanding salary and benefits.Under Saudi labour law, employers must also pay compensation in the event of a death at work. Besix said it had taken steps to support the family and ensure all payments were, “handled in a timely and respectful manner”.View image in fullscreenThousands of migrant workers, many from Bangladesh and Pakistan, are working on the Aramco Stadium in two shifts.Photograph: Pete PattissonConstruction of the 47,000-seater Aramco Stadium is at an advanced stage, with thousands of migrant workers, many from Bangladesh and Pakistan, working at the site in two shifts. It is being developed by Aramco, the state-owned oil company, which recently became Fifa’s most lucrative sponsor.Aninvestigationlast year revealed that some migrant workers employed at the stadium were enduring highly abusive conditions. They alleged they were saddled with staggering debts from the illegal fees they were forced to pay to get to Saudi Arabia. Housed in grim, cramped rooms, they toiled for 10 hours a day in the scorching 45C (113F) summer heat for paltry wages, which some said were withheld for months.The stadium is one of11 new venues being built for the 2034 World Cup, alongside a huge expansion of the country’s transport infrastructure and hotel accommodation to meet the demands of an expanded 48-team tournament.Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup bid to be ratified by Fifa despite rights violationsRead moreWorld Cup-related construction is just one part of a building boom under way in Saudi Arabia as the Gulf kingdom seeks to rebrand itself on the global stage. The construction is almost entirely dependent on a vast army of low-wage migrant workers, who largely come from south Asia.In a statement, Besix said it had “made significant strides” in protecting workers’ rights wherever it operated, adding that sub-contractors were required to comply with welfare standards that “encompassed the full spectrum of workers’ welfare, from safety and wages to living conditions”. It acknowledged that “some local contexts have proven challenging”, and had taken additional steps to improve these standards. “Our priority is to ensure that all workers are treated with dignity and fairness,” it said.Aramco said the safety and wellbeing of employees was “our highest priority”.“The company follows industry best practices in managing and reporting incidents, including determining the facts, sequence of events and root causes,” it said in a statement.Fifa did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2034Rights and freedomSaudi Arabia and sportMigration and developmentWorkers' rightsWorld CupPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

After the game, the Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar said Alisson would undergo assessment for concussion andLiverpoolhave confirmed he has since left South America to come home: “Alisson is travelling back to Merseyside and will undergo assessment from the Reds’ medical staff.”Lasmar had saidBrazilfollowed the required protocol immediately after the incident. “[Alisson] suffered a trauma to the head region, he was replaced [due to] a suspected concussion,” he told CNN Brazil. “Alisson is normal, with no complaints. He reported no fainting and no memory loss. He thought he was a little slower [and with] this complaint the recommendation is the replacement of the player.”Alisson’s issue is another injury worry for the Liverpool head coach, Arne Slot, after the midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, who was substituted in Sunday’sCarabao Cup final, withdrew from the Netherlands’ squad on Wednesday due to a fitness issue. The centre-back Ibrahima Konaté was also substituted at half-time ofFrance’s 2-0 Nations League defeatto Croatia on Thursday but the head coach Didier Deschamps allayed fears of an injury by suggesting it was a tactical decision.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Foden and Rashford were substituted after failing to seize a chance to impress from the start.Lewis-Skelly’s England debut goal sets up Tuchel’s winning start over AlbaniaRead more“We hope for more impact in these positions,” Tuchel said. “More dribbling and more aggressive runs towards the box. In general that was missing. The chances come from the little runs behind the line. They were not as decisive as they can be.”Tuchel considered whether Foden lacks belief in anEnglandshirt. “We will encourage him to do what he does best, to go at defenders, to go into dribbles,” the German said. “Both our wingers who started were not as impactful as they can be in club football. I’m not so sure why we struggled to bring the ball quickly to them.“We lacked runs off the ball. It was a little bit too much passing, not enough dribbling, not aggressive enough towards goal. They trained very well, they were decisive in training. That’s why I also think they deserved [to start], they were very good in the last weeks with their clubs. We will keep on encouraging them.”England’s start to their qualifying campaign for the 2026 World Cup was sparked by a debut goal from Myles Lewis-Skelly and a late strike from Harry Kane. The performance of Lewis-Skelly, the 18-year-old left-back, was a positive. “Amazing player, amazing personality,” Tuchel said. “He came into camp and showed straight away that it’s normal to fall in love with him. It is well deserved. He’s full of courage, full of quality.”Tuchel’s target is to win the World Cup and he was adamant that England “have to do better”. He felt that his side lost confidence in their structure after half-time and were more open to counterattacks. “I need to watch the game and look for solutions,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s all pretty light and pretty fun’Read more“I’ve very pleased even though I didn’t get the win,” said Kennedy. “My goal was to go 6.4, but I didn’t quite get that, but 6.50 is the next closest thing. I’ll take it at the end of the day.”Kennedy is the first Australian to medal in the blue riband sprint in the 38-year history of the short-track showpiece, surpassing Matt Shirvington’s fifth-place in Lisbon in 2001.But for one moment, it looked as if the Brisbane man had emulated 200m champion Melinda Gainsford-Taylor in 1995, the last Aussie indoor sprint gold medallist, as it was so close for gold, while South Africa’s Akani Simbine was a clear bronze winner in 6.54sec.“I knew in the semi-final, I didn’t run my best so, coming to the final, my coach [Andrew Iselin] and I worked on some things and I just felt super confident, super calm, relaxed and I just executed,” said Kennedy.What was so remarkable was that Kennedy, who’d put athletics on notice by becoming the 10th fastest ever at 60m with his 6.43sec run in an outdoor meet in Canberra in January, had never raced on the indoor boards before.But he looked at home from the moment he won his heat in 6.52sec, then ended up second in 6.54 in his semi behind American Ronnie Baker, who ended up an injured sixth in the final.It represented a terrific breakthrough for Kennedy, a one-time rugby speedster who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a 15-year-old and has to race with a bandage covering the continuous glucose monitor that tracks his blood sugar levels.View image in fullscreenLachie Kennedy dips over the line.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersEarlier, there was disappointment for the Australian challenge when Commonwealth champion Olli Hoare, who’s been struggling with injuries, failed to make the 1500m final.Hoare finished third in his heat in 3min 42.29sec, not enough to earn a fastest-loser spot in a final set to be dominated by Norwegian great Jakob Ingebrigtsen.But Canberran Georgia Griffith reached Sunday’s women’s metric mile final, finishing runner-up in the fastest heat in a personal best 4:09.78.Lifetime bests from Sarah Billings (2:03.60) and Abbey Caldwell (2:05.15) still weren’t enough to earn them a spot in the semi-finals of the women’s 800m, while Cooper Sherman, who’d set a 400m pb of 46.52sec in his heat, was knocked out in the semis.The first champion to be crowned in Nanjing was Italy’s Andy Diaz Hernandez, who produced a world-leading effort of 17.80m to win the triple jump.South Korea’s Woo Sang-hyeok won his second world indoor high jump title as the only athlete to clear 2.31m, dethroning New Zealand’s Olympic champ Hamish Kerr, whose 2.28m earned him silver.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Away from the track he has celebrated the birth of his son, Azaire. On it, the ­swashbuckling 23-year-old has added a global title to hisEuropean indoor crown over 60mafter claiming gold in Nanjing in a thrilling finale on the ­opening day of the World Athletics indoor championships.So who is Kirsty Coventry, who now has global sport’s most powerful job? | Sean IngleRead moreHe joins Richard Kilty, Dwain Chambers and Jason Gardener as British winners over the distance. In a final where there appeared to be no clear favourite, Azu delivered when it mattered most with an imperious run, holding his form to equal his ­personal best of 6.49 sec and ­narrowly edge out Australia’s Lachlan Kennedy, who ran 6.50. South Africa’s Akani Simbine was third.In just a handful of seconds, Azu’s career – and perhaps his life – changed for ever. He got quicker through the heats, culminating in a magnificent run in the final. He spent much longer circling the track soaking up the ­adulation of the crowd and then the emotion began to pour out.“I was emotional before the final with my coach … the last two years have been very difficult for me,” Azu said, ­referencing his decision to relocate back to the UK from Italy and reunite with his old coach, Helen James. “I’ve been reflecting and it’s important to surround yourself with people who believe in you and who care about you.”Azu will now turn his attention to the outdoor world championships in Tokyo this summer over 100m. The eyes of the world will be watching one of athletics’ fastest-rising stars. “I said at the Europeans I wanted to take over the world. This is just the start. The plan is to keep on winning. The sky is the limit.”Britain look handily placed to ­challenge for medals elsewhere across the weekend after the ­opening day of the championship with two fantastic redemption tales. Away from Azu, Georgia Hunter Bell ensured her spot in Sunday’s 1500m final with a straightforward qualification through her heat.View image in fullscreenBritain’s Jeremiah Azu crosses the line to win the 60m final in Nanjing.Photograph: Tingshu Wang/ReutersThe Olympic bronze medallist was the overwhelming favourite at the European championships in ­Apeldoorn butan ear infection led to her missing out on the medalsaltogether. But Hunter Bell cruised through her heat here with the fastest time of ­anyone on the day, 4:09:21, to set up a medal opportunity later this weekend.“I had all the emotions last week, but the best thing I could do is come back and be as strong as possible,” she said. “Heats can be nervy: there’s no room for error, so it’s good to get out and get the job done.” Britain’s Revée Walcott-Nolan, who came third in Apeldoorn, finished fifth in her heat and failed to qualify.Amber Anning shrugged off the ­disappointment of her ­disqualification in Apeldoorn by delivering a statement run to book her place in the final of Saturday’s ­women’s 400m. Anning had ­qualified for the final of the Europeans in an ­impressive 51.01 before a lane infringement ended her medal hopes. However, she delivered an even more impressive display on the opening day in Nanjing, running 50.79sec – the only woman to break 51 sec in the heats. She undoubtedly enters the final as favourite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was just about getting a clean race today but I’m excited to have another opportunity to get on the podium.”The star attraction of the ­championship is Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen, and his quest to become only the second man to win 1500m and 3,000m gold at the same world indoors began with minimal fuss as he coasted through his 1500m heat to advance to Sunday’s final.Ingebrigtsen, who won gold in the 1500m in Apeldoorn, will now attempt to emulate Haile ­Gebrselassie by winning double gold. He will line up in the 3,000m final in Saturday’s evening session in Nanjing, while Britain’s Neil Gourley will join the Norwegian in the 1500m final after running 3:36.60 to win his heat on Friday.“I’m glad I stuck to the plan and it worked well,” Gourley said. Britain’s Adam Fogg came last in his heat. The other gold medals on day one went to South Korea’s Woo Sang-hyeok in the men’s high jump, Canada’s Sarah Mitton in the shot put and Finland’s Saga Vanninen in the pentathlon, with Ireland’s Kate O’Connor taking silver.Explore more on these topicsSportAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

But even illustrious careers have to start somewhere, and Wagner Ruiz’s story is typical of the American game in all its unruly glory.US rugby hopes Ilona Maher will be part of England and Fiji DC doubleheaderRead more“In high school, I played basketball, softball and soccer, and unfortunately, or fortunately, I was a little too aggressive for some of those,” Wagner Ruiz said, before heading out for training. “I had yellow cards, fallings out, all that kind of stuff. But I had a friend that said, ‘There’s this sport that you can actually hit people and you’re not gonna get in trouble for it.’ And clearly, I was an angry teenager, and needed that. And so I found rugby.”Her first club was a men’s club: theNorthern Colorado Flamingoes, a pink-clad band from Fort Collins, near the Wyoming line.“I played with them for a little bit, just to run around and get an idea of what the heck was going on. And then I got to college and played … I never looked back. I played all over the country and all over the world.”Wagner Ruiz played hooker, winning 28 USA caps out ofBeantown RFCin Boston, the club that now forms the backbone of the Banshees, and for Glendale in Colorado – akaRugbyTown USA– the team that now undergirds the Denver Onyx. She taught math too.“I retired in 2014 and immediately started coaching the Gray Wolves – they were the Glendale Raptors then. I didn’t leave teaching until 2017 when I started moving around the country with my late wife, who was a Marine.”Wagner Ruiz hasspokenof Kandis Ruiz elsewhere, of her loss, and of support from theTragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, or TAPS, named for the bugle call played over military graves. “There are people that I’ve met through my time with TAPS that I consider some of my closest friends,” she hassaid. “We are bound by our losses, but can lean on each other to get through our hardest moments and celebrate our joyous moments as well.” Rugby players also treat each other as family. Ruiz played too,for clubs including Glendaleand for the US Under-20s.Wagner Ruiz has coached Life University and Atlanta Harlequins; withAtavus, in Seattle; and at Brown, the Ivy League college in Providence, Rhode Island. Her “full-time day job” is there, as an assistant, “then I get to coach the Banshees at night.”That seems apt, given WER marketing. The Banshees are “supernatural, otherworldly, bringing wails of fury … born of Celtic mythology and the New England history of rebellious women … harbingers of doom to our opponents.” But if training nights in Weymouth might turn a little harum-scarum, Wagner Ruiz hopes to stir up home game days too, first in Quincy, home to the New England Free Jacks ofMLR, the men’s pro league.View image in fullscreenKittery Wagner Ruiz at work.Photograph: Greg Sabin/gregsabinphotography.comWagner Ruiz describes the daily challenge of switching between sevens, Brown’s spring game, and WER’s 15-a-side. But no one in women’s rugby ever had it easy, and the new league simply wants to help its players have it better than before. In New York, Denver, the Bay Area, the Twin Cities and Chicago, all teams built on clubs from the amateur Women’s Premier League, other coaches are working. Theregular seasonwill run for 10 games before playoffs in June.Wagner Ruiz is “really excited. Not that right now there’s a lot of money but … the stepping stone is now they get to just play. Players don’t have to fundraise for their club, they don’t have to pay the coaches, they don’t have to find field space. The league has hired coaches and general managers. It should give the opportunity for athletes to hone their craft.”Wagner Ruiz has coached at national level, U20s and talent ID, giving her insight into players who might boost the Eagles at World Cups after the one in England this summer. The state of the college game, she said, “speaks highly of what’s happening in high schools, because the level of talent and the level of athlete that is looking to play rugby in college has grown.‘This is the time for women’s sports’: investor Deb Henretta backs US rugbyRead more“There are athletes who’ve played since they were eight, nine years old. So they they already know the laws. They already know how to catch-pass. They already are comfortable in contact. Those are the three big things we want them to have, and obviously then being able to read space and all those other things.”At mention of the writer Malcolm Gladwell, who devoted a chapter of hislatest booktowhy women’s rugby is growingin elite colleges, like many in US rugby Wagner Ruiz gives a rueful shake of the head. Maybe the simple fact an esteemed New Yorker writernoticedspeaks for how the game, like women’s sports in general, has begun to surge. Happier thoughts relate to the explosive success of Ilona Maher, the Quinnipiac University and USA sevens standout turned social media genius and reality TV star doing for women’s rugby what the Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark has done for WNBA.Maher has justfinisheda stint in England with Bristol. Back home, she is chasing a World Cup place. To have such a role model on every fan’s phone is simple good news.“Ilona’s from Vermont, right? A New Englander through and through. I think something with this league is, we’re a bit on the coattails ofthe US bronze medal[in Olympic sevens, in Paris last year], and then yes, Ilona’s success and being a very public figure definitely has brought more publicity in general. Young athletes seeing her as a beautiful, big, strong woman – I think about my [six-year-old] daughter, right? I hope kids see Ilona and realize, ‘I can do anything.’ That’s what’s great about rugby: everybody can play. It doesn’t matter who you are, what you look like, shape, size, etc. It’s a place for you.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The prop Lauren Ferridge, like Henrichout of Dartmouth Collegein New Hampshire, is among those chasing a cap.View image in fullscreenIlona Maher scores a try for Bristol.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters“The majority of players have day jobs,” Wagner Ruiz said. “There are a select few that have decided to move here for the five months that we’re training and stock up money or work remotely. But for the most part, people are keeping some semblance of a nine to five … In three to five years, if that is a thing of the past, and we’re training midday, and athletes can come to the facility, whatever that looks like, and can be there to train and then lift and then do a recovery session, that’s kind of my vision.”After two games in Quincy, the Banshees will play three home games in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It’s down to logistics. Wagner Ruiz speaks warmly of the relationship with the Free Jacks. They have won two MLR titles in a row, success recognized with the hoisting of championship bannersat Logan Airportin Boston, alongside honors for the Celtics (NBA), Bruins (NHL), Red Sox (MLB), and New England Patriots (NFL). Rugby is gaining a presence.Phaidra Knight, rugby great, set for pro MMA debut at 50: ‘All roads lead to where I am’Read moreAsked what success for the Banshees and WER might look like, Wagner Ruiz said: “I think success is putting on a good show. I want us to have a team that it plays good rugby, and the athletes to be good ambassadors for the sport.”To the averageUS sportsfan, rugby has a somewhat “traditional” appeal, a sport for non-conformists but very social too. Wagner Ruiz speaks as enthusiastically about a game in which “you beat the crap out of each other, and then you hang out afterwards, and have a good meal together” as she does about elite performance.“We all really want this league to succeed. And for that to happen, we need good rugby. We need good games. We need to be fun and exciting and fast-paced, very close scorelines, things that make people want to come watch. How many rugby games have we watched that were, like, all right? We know so-and-so is going to win, or it’s going to be a blowout. Then it’s boring rugby.“We want to be something that’s exciting, that really makes our fanbase want to come back year after year after year. And that, to me, is success.”WERwill stream live and on-demand for free onDAZNExplore more on these topicsWomen's rugby unionRugby unionUSA rugby union teamUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A bizarre VAR decision denying a penalty rubbed extra salt into the wound. Here in a city that specializes in delays, healing will have to happen quickly.“They really wanted to lift the trophy for the country,” Marsch said afterwards. “It was a knife in the heart to play well but then just short fall short. That disappointment is hard to shake.”The Canadian team bus had snaked its way through South LA’s Thursday rush hour traffic and was pulling into the lower reaches of SoFi Stadium just as Cecilio Waterman arrowed a stunning injury-time winner past Matt Turner to turn this entire week on its head.There was a joke to be found about a Panamanian called Waterman doing it for the canal. You’d hope someone in the bank of Canadian fans Concacaf had seated right next door to the US supporters group had found it. Either way, Panama being the team waiting for a Sunday night dance partner was surely not what the majority had been expecting.Expectations can be fragile things, of course. Marsch has spent his 10 months at the helm first confounding them then passionately demanding they are raised again and again, with last summer’s Copa América odyssey giving him instant evidence to point to. The squad he gathered here in LA, a group he described as the most talented in the country’s history, had bought in, all echoing their coach’s insistence that they were here for hardware. They’ll leave without it, but a showdown with the Americans offers more than mere consolation.View image in fullscreenCanada felt hard done by a few refereeing decisions.Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPAJavier Aguirre has solved some of Mexico’s pressing issues since returning for a third stint after last summer’s dispiriting Copa América. A sturdy but unspectacular 0-0 draw withCanadalast September had been one brick in the rebuild. Here instead of deciding between two in-form frontmen in Jiménez and Santiago Giménez, he went for both, the latter coming in off the left.Within just 45 seconds it paid off. Two sets of players had lined up but just one appeared to hear referee Saíd Martínez’s whistle. Johan Vásquez plucked a ball out of the air and sent it bobbling towards Jiménez who flicked it into his almost-namesake’s path. From there it bobbled again, Alphonso Davies deflected it on to Moïse Bombito and into Jiménez’s path. The Fulham striker made no mistake.They’d only be somewhat successful in doing so as the first half became a breakneck, chaotic megamix of Concacaf classics. Five yellow cards flashed, Martínez threatened to lose control, and then an inexplicable VAR penalty decision.How Canada weren’t awarded a spot-kick on nine minutes was a mystery. Captain Edson Álvarez swung a boot at a ball which Derek Cornelius got to first. SoFi’s giant infinity screens signalled that VAR was checking just as Martinez signalled a restart. On the sideline, Marsch looked in vain for answers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For me, this is the definition of a penalty.”Canada’s Alistair Johnston: ‘Our country is under threat, under attack’Read moreWhile his players did find their feet, they never found control. In the space of 15 minutes midway through the half, Bombito, Alistair Johnston and Davies were all booked, with goalkeeper Dayne St Clair producing a great save from Giménez amid it all.Marsch is crystal clear in his demands for his team to be relentlessly aggressive but when the circumstances and an erratic official require a toning down, can it be done? In the 35th minute, Johnston tried to hoof a free-kick off the nearby Alexis Vega to get him booked. He missed and instead gifted possession back to Mexico, a moment that summed up plenty.Relief came, ironically from VAR, when Álvarez’s close-range header was ruled out five minutes before the break. Canada struggled mightily to create openings, the night finishing with just one shot on target. “We need to slow the game down [in attack],” he suggested. “We should have been able to create more given the way we were approaching the game.”Marsch had sprinted to the dressing rooms early at the interval and when his side continued to struggle for openings, he didn’t wait long to make changes. Wingers Jacob Shaffelburg and Tajon Buchanan asked to bring width, perhaps because in the middle Erik Lira was spoiling to terrific effect.There would be no spoiling the night’s most alluring moment. With 15 minutes left, Jiménez stepped up to a set-piece that was 30-plus yards out and whipped a simply delicious effort that curled inside St Clair’s near post. Mexicans rained expensive cerveza down from above on the striker. A small price to pay. For Canada, tariffs and Trump will come back into the chatter. But the trophy talk is once more parked.Explore more on these topicsMexicoCanadaUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

When Cecilio Waterman scored in second-half stoppage time for a 1-0 victory in the semi-final on Thursday night, Panama became the first team in the still-nascent history of the Concacaf Nations League to prevent the United States from winning that tournament.Los Canaleroshave a chance to win the Nations League for the first time Sunday by defeating Canada or Mexico in the final. The United States will play for third place in the first match of Sunday’s double-header.“We’re still building our identity,” forward Christian Pulisic said, “but this was a tough loss.”Waterman, who entered the game in the 70th minute, scored the winning goal off a pass from Adalberto Carrasquilla, firing a 15-yard diagonal shot from the right side of the penalty area past diving goalkeeper Matt Turner and inside the far post.Waterman’s shot was Panama’s only one on target.“Again, another small moment from nothing, and it’s a goal,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. “We need to look in the mirror before anything and just realize that when we have these type of games, we can’t wait for something to happen. We have to make things happen, put games on our terms.”View image in fullscreenJosh Sargent came into the Nations League in good form but squandered a couple scoring chances v Panama.Photograph: Étienne Laurent/APFollowing the goal, Waterman doffed his jersey, jumped over the advertising barriers and embraced a stunned Thierry Henry, who was doing analysis for CBS Sports and Paramount+. Waterman shouted, “Eres mi idolo,“ Spanish for “You’re my idol,” to the former Arsenal standout, as about half a dozen joyous teammates joined Waterman to celebrate.“They were hungry,” Pochettino said about his opponents. “They fight for the game, every single player, for every single ball. From the touch line, you feel that was the difference.“We didn’t compete in the way that the game required. I feel so disappointed. We all feel disappointed. If you don’t have aggression, it’s impossible. You are going to play safe. You are not going to take risks. If you want to play football, you need to take risks. You need to go forward. You need to win 50-50 balls sometimes.”Raúl Jiménez puts Mexico into Nations League final, and Canada into US clashRead moreThe United States’ Patrick Agyemang, who entered the match two minutes before Waterman, had two late chances to win the game, with the best of those coming in the 82nd minute.Weston McKennie began the potential scoring sequence by intercepting a pass intended for Carrasquilla and sending the ball to Agyemang on the run. After fighting off Panamanian defender Carlos Harvey, Agyemang forced goalkeeper Orlando Mosqueda to dive to his left to deflect his effort. In the 88th minute, Pulisic chested a McKennie pass while on the right flank, dribbled into the penalty area and crossed to Agyemang, who used his right instep to launch a close-range shot high over the crossbar.With Fulham left back Antonee Robinson unavailable for the United States because of an unspecified injury, Pochettino started a three-man backline of Tim Ream, Joe Scally and Chris Richards, with Yunus Musah and Tim Weah serving as wingbacks. The United States began applying intense high pressure early and often, reducing Panama to long balls from the back or trying to generate offense by forcing turnovers.However, the United States failed to create a consistent attack. And when they did create chances, they couldn’t put them away. In the 20th minute, a Josh Sargent shot from 12 yards out deflected off the right leg of Panamanian defender Edgardo Fariña and the base of the right goalpost. Mosquera batted the ball away before Cristian Martínez cleared it. McKennie followed with a close-range header into Mosquera’s midsection.“You know, I think we definitely struggled with that in the first half,” Ream said, “and weren’t able to put enough pressure on them to cough up balls in areas that we felt that we could take advantage of.”Pochettino expressed the situation more bluntly: “The first half, I think, was really painful, really painful to see.”Explore more on these topicsUSAPanamaUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tesla has borne the brunt of the backlash against the tech executive’s role inDonald Trump’s administration. In the months since Trump named Musk the head of what he calls the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), the world’s richest person has dismantled entire federal agencies, canceled contracts across bureaus that had any mention of diversity, equity and inclusion, and made a gesture at a rally that his estranged daughter called “definitely a nazi salute” in aninterview this week.In response,Teslaowners are attempting to sell their vehicles; the company’s stock price has plummeted and Teslas around the country have been vandalized – some even set on fire with Molotov cocktails. The Vancouver International Auto show announced earlier in the week it had removed the company from the lineup for its upcoming showcase over security concerns as the protests against Musk spread.“If you read the news, it feels like Armageddon,” Musk said. “I understand if you don’t want to buy our product, but you don’t have to burn it down. That’s a bit unreasonable.”The day before, Tesla issued a recall for its newest model, theCybertruck, a trapezoidal steel vehicle that has failed to capture consumers. The company is recalling some 46,000 vehicles, nearly all of the Cybertrucks it has ever sold since the model started shipping last year. The recall was related to a part called a cant rail – a stainless-steel exterior trim panel – delaminating and detaching from the vehicle, the company said, which can become a road hazard and increase the risk of crashes. As a remedy, Tesla will replace the rail assembly free of charge.Even longtime financial backers of the company are lamenting Musk’s chaotic political turn and Tesla’s subsequent poor performance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was the father of two young boys, aged seven and 10, who were tragically found dead in a pond near their home in Trondheim, Norway, in December 2020.”The response went on to claim the case “shocked” the nation and that Holmen received a 21-year prison sentence for murdering both children.Holmen said in a complaint to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority that the “completely false” story nonetheless contained elements similar to his own life such as his home town, the number of children he has and the age gap between his sons.“The complainant was deeply troubled by these outputs, which could have harmful effect in his private life, if they where reproduced or somehow leaked in his community or in his home town,”said the complaint, which has been filed by Holmen and Noyb, a digital rights campaign group.It added that Holmen has “never been accused nor convicted of any crime and is a conscientious citizen”.Holmen’s complaint alleged that ChatGPT’s “defamatory” response violated accuracy provisions within the GDPR European data law. It has asked the Norwegian watchdog to order ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI, to adjust its model to eliminate inaccurate results relating to Holmen and to impose a fine on the company. Noyb said that since Holmen’s interaction with ChatGPT took place, OpenAI had released a new model incorporating web searches – which has made a repeat of the Holmen error “less likely”.AI chatbots are prone to producing responsescontaining false informationbecause they are built on models that predict the next most likely word in a sentence. This can result in factual errors and wild assertions, but the plausible nature of the responses can trick users into thinking that what they are reading is 100% correct.AnOpenAIspokesperson said: “We continue to research new ways to improve the accuracy of our models and reduce hallucinations. While we’re still reviewing this complaint, it relates to a version of ChatGPT which has since been enhanced with online search capabilities that improves accuracy.”Explore more on these topicsChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAINorwayEuropeChatbotsnewsShareReuse this content"

A full third of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra’s first-time audience members are coming to the concert hall via their favourite series and movies – and video games. It is a huge cultural growth area, and one that may have gone unrecognised by the general public.“It is impossible to ignore video game music now,” says Tommy Pearson, founder and artistic director of the inaugural London Soundtrack festival. “The sheer creativity and artistry in games is incredible, and it’s been fascinating to see so many composers blossom in the genre.”As one of the lead architects behind the festival, Pearson was eager to make space for video games as part of the celebration – not just as an “add-on” to TV and film soundtracks, but as an equal in the art form. “When I was first thinking about what we would do at the festival, including games music was a no-brainer. It absolutely has to be there alongside film and TV music. It has a very dedicated audience of fans and the music is as good as anything being written in any genre.”View image in fullscreenTommy Pearson, artistic director of London Soundtrack festival.Photograph: London Soundtrack FestivalRunning from 19 to 26 March, the festival will consist of live performances, panel discussions, screenings, Q&As and masterclasses. One of the key events,State of the Art, will include performances of video game music by the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, masterclasses from Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab – composers who recently collected Grammy and Ivor Novello awards for their work on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.Why is 2025 the perfect time for the first Soundtrack festival in London? “We’re seeing millions of streams of game soundtracks, daily,” says Barton. “There’s a huge amount of social media content on Instagram and TikTok that ties into it, not to mention the world of Twitch where a streamer’s playlist is a huge part of their identity. The record industry is just about catching on to this.”“I see the streaming numbers climbing in real time, but beyond the data, you can sense it everywhere,” adds Haab. “Game music isn’t confined to consoles any more – it’s woven into people’s every day lives. My nieces and nephews, for example, have game soundtracks on rotation purely for enjoyment. At gaming events, fans know these themes note-for-note, singing them back with the same devotion you’d see at a concert. Even in broader entertainment circles – award shows, industry mixers – video game scores are part of the conversation now. They’re treated with the same respect as film music, standing on their own as a legitimate art form. And if the surging demand for soundtrack releases tells us anything, it’s that people aren’t just listening: they’re seeking it out.”View image in fullscreen‘Fans know these themes note-for-note’ … Death Stranding.Photograph: Kojima ProductionsComposers Ludvig Forssell (Death Stranding), Harry Gregson-Williams (Metal Gear Solid), Stephanie Economou (Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök), andBorislav Slavov(Baldur’s Gate 3) will all be part of a panel discussing games music in the day, before joining the performances in the evening.From IT worker to god of music: the unlikely story of Baldur’s Gate 3 composer Borislav SlavovRead more“You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who can’t sing a tune from Super Mario Bros or Final Fantasy or Halo or The Legend of Zelda,” says Economou. “Video game music is prevalent because video games are prevalent. The industry itself is more profitable than the film, television and music industry combined. So when people think that it’s suddenly surging in popularity, all I can think is: no, it’s just finally getting more recognition and celebration in more public spheres. I applaud the London Soundtrack festival for highlighting the art form and I’m thrilled to be part of the festival in its inaugural year.”“The London Soundtrack festival is a great opportunity to celebrate the differences and diversities in music for media,” adds Forssell. “Video games may still be the new kid on the block, in some senses, but they are definitely here to stay; and I hope that we as composers will always be able to have our own different approaches to music in general, be it pop, rock or music for film, TV, video games and beyond.”Pearson and the team of composers he has assembled see the event as a celebration of the state of video game music. “These are all brilliant, hugely respected composers producing terrific and exciting scores that live in the game and in the concert hall very successfully,” Pearson says.Will non-gaming audiences ever accept video game music as much as TV or film?“There will always be a bit of snobbery about media music,” Pearson says, “But it’s nowhere near as much as it used to be. And who cares what people think anyway?”London Soundtrack festivalis at various venues until 26 March.Explore more on these topicsGamesFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The education department will also, for the first time, do an in-depth analysis of the national behaviour survey in schools to look at the most successful ways of policing the bans, and the challenges schools are facing.The guidancestates that “all schools should prohibit the use of mobile phones throughout the school day – not only during lessons but break and lunchtimes as well”, but does not say how schools should enforce the bans.Phillipson is understood to have become frustrated that there is no monitoring of whether the guidance is being followed or proving useful to schools. There are no plans for the government to legislate to ban phones in schools, which ministers believe is fraught with problems.School phone bans alone do not improve grades or wellbeing, says UK studyRead moreThe monitoring will look at how well schools are following policies, how many schools have bans in place, how schools implement bans, such as keeping phones in lockers or bags, and what impact it is having on behaviour. Specific further questions on smartphones will be added to futurenational behaviour surveysto gain additional insights.A government source said: “It beggars belief that the Tories repeatedly told voters they were banning phones but did nothing to ensure the guidance was being followed.“While the vast majority of schools are complying with the guidance we need to make sure it’s being followed to the letter. Rather than indulge in gimmicks and headline grabbing after years of telling us the guidance was sufficient like the Tories, we’re going to keep schools honest and ensure classrooms and corridors are phone-free.”A survey of more than 3,000 Gen Z women commissioned by Amnesty International this week found a high prevalence of online misogyny on social media encountered by young people.It found that nearly three-quarters (73%) of Gen Z social media users had witnessed misogynistic content online with half encountering it on a weekly basis, while 70% believed sexist language had increased on social media. As a result, 44% said they had experienced negative mental health impacts.In the Commons on Wednesday, Keir Starmer said he had been watching the Netflix dramaAdolescencewith his teenage children.The series focuses on a family and their teenage son who is arrested for killing a female classmate, and on the impact of online misogynist influencers. The Labour MP Anneliese Midgley asked the prime minister to do more to tackle online male radicalisation.The series’ writerJack Thornehas called for screenings in parliament and said he believes there should be further social media restrictions for young teenagers.Cabinet ministers are split over whether there is a need to do more on the issue.MPs who backed abill from Labour’s Josh MacAlisterthis year, which would have restricted social media algorithms trained on young teens, said the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, was broadly against any wider changes that would go further than self-policing.Phillipson’s department only has jurisdiction over school use of smartphones. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, is among those open to more robust action because of the mental health effects of social media, which affect his department.Speaking to the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, said ending phone use in schools was a “no-brainer”.Trott admitted the guidance issued by the Conservative government last year “hasn’t worked”, with too many children still using phones in classrooms.The Conservatives put down an amendment to the schools bill earlier this week, asking for a full ban on smartphones in schools, which was voted down by the government. Trott denied the amendment was a “gimmick”, saying “parents, teachers, children are all asking for this”.According to an Ipsos poll in September 2024, almost half the UK public believe there should be a total ban on smartphones in schools. A majority of parents said their child’s school did not currently have a full ban in place.MacAlister’s bill included plans to give headteachers legal backing to make schools phone-free.The bill was watered down to gain government assurances on some of the measures, taking out any requirements on tech companies or schools, and just committing the government to do more research.Kit Malthouse, a Tory former education secretary, told the House of Commons the watering down amounted to the “gutting of what could have been a landmark bill”.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsSmartphonesYoung peopleSocial mediaDigital mediaMobile phonesMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

But Europe knows that this administration is unlikely to act accordinglyFri 21 Mar 2025 13.50 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 22.30 EDTShareAs attention focused on diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine this week, the UN human rights office published a powerful reminder of its horrors. Anew reporton children’s lives since the Russian invasion was prefaced with a nursery director’s description of their response to shelling: “Some children fall to their knees – their legs do not move because they are afraid. There are no tears, no crying or screaming, the child just freezes. One child stood there holding a toy and did not let go of it all day.”These are the survivors. Hundreds of children have been killed since February 2022. Hundreds of thousands are internally displaced, and 1.7 million are refugees, many of them separated from a parent. At least 200 have been forcibly taken to Russia.Ukrainematters – not just strategically, but humanely.The US decision toterminate a programmetracking these abducted children is a telling indication of supreme carelessness or callousness about the fate of Ukraine and its people. Vladimir Putin’s maximalist demandsin his call with Donald Trumpthis week underlined that he does not desire peace. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had previouslyobservedthat Ukraine’s agreement to a ceasefire put the onus on Russia: “If they say no, we’ll know what the impediment is to peace here.”Mr Putin offered a halt on attacks on energy infrastructure if Kyiv did the same (a gesture rather than a concession, with the winter drawing to an end) while declaring that peace would require the complete cessation of foreign military aid and intelligence provision to Ukraine. The impediment is obvious. But Mr Trump haslittle grasp of detail, his “deal-making” prowess is self-declared, and he has long been drawn to Mr Putin.Ukraine will at least be in Saudi Arabia forparallel talkswhen the US speaks to Russia next week. It has won a place at the table, or a table. But it is still on the menu. Even as Kyiv attempts to attract the US president with minerals, and avoid alienating him over issues such as his new desire totake over nuclear plants, Russia appears to be outflanking US negotiators. Moscow offers improved economic relations as if that was its gift and not its goal, and is aided by the US right’s fantasies that Mr Putin will turn his back on China. Bilateral relationsare alreadythawing.The security guarantee that Europe wanted has not materialised. If the US cuts off military aid and intelligence to Ukraine again, the consequences would be immense. But Washington can’t force Kyiv to accept a ceasefire – or force Europe to abandon Ukraine. European leaders have recognised that they may shape, but cannot determine, the actions of Mr Trump – but can decide how they respond. That is clear not only through this week’s discussions on a possible “reassurance force” in the event of a ceasefire, but more generally as Europe contemplates a future without US security assurances. Germany’sditching of the debt braketo turbocharge military spending was only the headline.Russia’s threat looms far larger for some than others. Domestic opinion and priorities vary widely. Strategically, leaders differ on whether to prioritise the building up of regional strength or shoring up transatlantic ties. They will differ too on where else to build partnerships. These questions are becoming more acute. The answers will shape the lives of coming generations well beyond Ukraine.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For decades, if not centuries, and always imperfectly, the US offered itself to the world as the guarantor of democracy and the land of the free. Now that it’s pivoting away from that job description, there’s an opportunity for someone else to step in.The evidence that the US is moving, even galloping, away from basic notions of democracy and freedom is piling up. Just because the changes have happened so fast doesn’t make them any less fundamental. We now have a US administration that blithelyignores court rulings, whose officials say out loud“I don’t care what the judges think”. In a matter of weeks, it has become an open question whether the US remains a society governed by the rule of law.In the name of defeating “woke” and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, even historic efforts to advance civil rights are disdained or banished into the memory hole: this week itemergedthat an army webpage celebrating Harry Truman’s 1948 order to integrate the military had disappeared, along with several others honouring distinguished Black soldiers. When asked about it, the press secretary at the Pentagon said: “DEI is dead at the defense department.” As for the Department of Education, this week Trumpmoved to abolish it altogether.But if the US is being upended by the Trump hurricane, so is everywhere else in its path, including those places that once looked to the US with admiration. We can all see the coercion of Ukraine into accepting a supposed peace that will require it to surrender its territory to Vladimir Putin and itsminerals to Trump. Less visible is the way in which the scything of the US federal government by Trump and Elon Musk is aiding Putin’s assault on Ukraine’s most vulnerable people – its children.Among the US projects cut is a state department initiative to collect evidence of Russian war crimes, includingthe abduction of more than 20,000 Ukrainian children, many of them sent to Russia for forced adoption. Now there are fears that that information, which might have helped find the children and eventually reunite them with their parents, has been lost, destroyed by the Musk chainsaw. Captain America thought he was a superhero; turns out he’s the villain’s accomplice.Europe doesn’t need Trump to form a western alliance – and one is already taking shape | Martin KettleRead moreNow it is those contemptuous of democracy who look to the US for inspiration. This week,Benjamin Netanyahu broke a ceasefirehe had agreed with Hamas, resuming devastating airstrikes on Gaza, killing hundreds of Palestinians, in part because he doubtless presumed Trump would give him no grief. But he alsosacked the independent-minded head of Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, the Shin Bet, the latest move in his ongoing attempt to remove every legal or constitutional constraint on his power. If that reminds you of someone, there’s good reason. “In America and in Israel, when a strong rightwing leader wins an election, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people’s will,”Netanyahu tweetedon Wednesday. “They won’t win in either place! We stand strong together.” Trump’s authoritarian power grab is providing cover for others to do the same.This new role for the US, as a beacon of anti-democracy, is having some unintended consequences. Canada was on course to elect a Conservative government; now, by way of a backlash, the Liberals under Mark Carney lookset to ride an anti-Trump wave to victory. However it operates, Trumpism is becoming a key determinant of politics the world over.Perhaps especially in Britain. For most of the last century, the US has been Britain’s foremost ally. Put more baldly, London has all but relied on Washington for its own defence. Britain’s military and intelligence systems are intricately integrated with those of the US; its nuclear capability is not operationally independent. These last two months, it has become obvious that that is no longer sustainable: Britain cannot rely on a US that behaves more like an enemy than a friend.That, in turn, creates a new political fact – we are in an age of rearmament – that will be the organising principle of Rachel Reeves’s spring statement next week. It will require either deep cuts or new taxes. Trump has scrambled Britain’s finances.By itself, that represents a monumental change. But it won’t end there. Almost everything we do will need to be rethought. Much of that is cause for alarm – how can Nato function when its mightiest member has become an adversary? – but it also creates opportunities for Britain, if we are only willing to seize them.Take, as just one example, Trump’s war on science. The US has long been the world leader in almost every field of research. But Trump and Musk are slashing or closing one research hub after another, whether at the National Institutes of Health or theEnvironmental Protection Agency, which could lay off thousands of talented scientists. The administration is threatening academic freedom, forcing US universities tobendto Trumpism or lose funding. This week, a French scientist travelling to the US for a conference wasdenied entrybecause, according to the French government, his “phone contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration’s research policy”. You read that right: the man was subjected to a random check at the airport, US officials went through his laptop and phone, found private messages speaking ill of the president and sent him back home.This is an opening for Britain, which should be promoting itself as a haven for free, unhindered scientific inquiry. The EU has already spotted the chance, and is devising aplan to lure US scholars. But the UK has the advantage of the English language; it should be first in line. Some see the opportunity, but sadly the UK government is not among them: petitioned to reduce upfront visa costs for overseas scientists, which is an average of 17 times higher than for comparable countries,ministers this week said no.But science is only one area where Britain could be taking up the slack. Trump issilencing the Voice of Americaand Radio Free Europe: the BBC should be given the relatively modest funds required to step in and do the job instead, thereby boosting British soft power at a stroke.The first step is understanding that the world has changed and that the old shibboleths no longer apply. It’s absurd that Britain, home toEurope’s biggest arms industry, is, thanks to Brexit, shut out of thenew €150bn (£125bn) EU defence procurement fund, the latest example of how standing apart from its neighbours amounts to reckless folly in the Trump era.What the moment calls for is great boldness. It means Keir Starmer having the courage to tell the country that everything has changed and that we will have to change, too. Yes, that will involve painful sacrifices to pay for rearmament, and the breaking of political taboos, including listening to themajority of Britonswho tell pollsters it’s time we rejoined the EU.It adds up to a vision of aEuropethat includes Britain, stepping into the space the US is vacating, guaranteeing and promoting free speech and democratic accountability at the very moment the US is abandoning those ideals. Trump has blasted the door open. All we have to do is walk through it.On 30 April, join Jonathan Freedland, Kim Darroch, Devika Bhat and Leslie Vinjamuri as theydiscuss Trump’s presidency on his 100th day in office, live at Conway Hall London, and live streamed globally.

Will we take them?Sanmi KoyejoFri 21 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 10.09 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Jordan Moss/The GuardianThe notion that artificial intelligence could help reduce racism might seem counterintuitive. After all, we’ve seen numerous headlines about AI systems perpetuating or even amplifying racial biases. Yet as we enter 2025, amid both a backlash against social justice initiatives and the rapid proliferation of AI technologies, an unexpected opportunity is emerging.Here’s the paradox: while few people want to be labeled racist, study after study reveal persistent racial disparities in everything from healthcare outcomes to economic opportunities. The fascinating twist? Society appears far more willing to critically examine and address bias in AI systems than confront human bias directly.Consider healthcare: many clinicians acknowledge that systemic biases disproportionately affect racial minorities, but very few will admit their own decisions might be biased. Yet systematic audits routinely uncover significant race-based disparities in treatment decisions. This points to a crucial advantage of AI systems – they’re inherently more auditable than human decision-making.This auditability creates three key opportunities. First, AI systems provide a mirror to society’s biases. When an AI makes biased decisions, it’s often amplifying patterns present in historical data – patterns created by human choices. This makes invisible biases visible and quantifiable, forcing us to confront uncomfortable truths about our institutions.Second, unlike human decision-makers who might become defensive when accused of bias, AI systems can be systematically tested, evaluated and improved. We can develop technical tools, like metric elicitation, that help stakeholders define and measure fairness in context-specific ways. This allows us to move beyond superficial “colorblind” approaches to fairness and toward more nuanced solutions that acknowledge historical inequities.Third, AI systems can help reduce the role of implicit bias in decision-making. While humans might unconsciously treat people differently based on race, properly designed AI systems can be explicitly programmed to focus only on relevant factors. This isn’t about making AI “colorblind” – rather, it’s about being intentional about when and how racial differences should inform decisions.However, realizing this potential requires careful attention to both technical and social considerations. On the technical side, we need sophisticated approaches that go beyond simple notions of fairness. For instance, in low-stakes decisions like movie recommendations, representation gaps might be the primary concern. But in high-stakes domains like healthcare or criminal justice, where systematic biases have deep historical roots, we need more nuanced approaches that actively work to correct historical disparities.On the social side, we need diverse voices involved in developing and deploying these systems. Organizations such as Black in AI are already working with institutions like the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop standards for safe and equitable AI systems. These efforts recognize that technical solutions alone aren’t enough – we need inclusive processes that engage affected communities in determining how AI systems should operate.The path forward isn’t about replacing human judgment with AI, but about using AI as a tool for creating more equitable systems. By making biases more visible and measurable, providing frameworks for testing and improvement, and enabling more intentional approaches to fairness, AI could help us build the more racially just society that has proven so elusive to achieve through human efforts alone.This potential exists precisely because AI forces us to be explicit about our values and decisions in ways that human systems often avoid. As we continue to integrate AI into crucial societal decisions, we have an opportunity to build systems that don’t just replicate our current inequities, but actively work to address them. The question isn’t whether AI will impact racial equity – it’s whether we’ll seize this moment to ensure it does so in ways that promote justice rather than perpetuate harm.Sanmi Koyejo is an assistant professor of computer science at Stanford University.

Its consequences could be devastatingLeo S LoThe president wants to eliminate the agency backing libraries and museums. But the institutions do far more than lend booksFri 21 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 10.24 EDTShareWhen President Trump recentlyproposed eliminating the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), librarians and educators voiced outrage, confusion and fear. Soon afterward,the appointment of Keith E Sonderlingas acting director of IMLS highlighted the administration’s intention to reshape the agency’s priorities toward “promoting American exceptionalism” and cultivating “patriotism”.As someone deeply involved in the library world, I wasn’t surprised by Trump’s move.Given escalating book bans, rising censorship and growing hostility toward educational and cultural institutions, this crisis has been building for years. Yet the predictability doesn’t make it less troubling; it signals clearly that the stakes are higher than ever.To understand why this matters so deeply, it’s crucial to recognize whatIMLSactually does. Established in 1996, it is the primary federal agency providing crucial financial support to libraries and museums nationwide. It invests hundreds of millions of dollars annually to help institutions develop literacy programs, workforce training, digital resources, cultural preservation and civic engagement initiatives. Cutting this funding is more than just budget trimming. It means dismantling essential community infrastructure.Many argue that libraries have become obsolete relics in the age of Google and smartphones, but reality says otherwise. About77 million Americansdepend annually on public libraries for reliable internet access, according to Pew Research. In Dallas, Texas, for instance,nearly 3.9m digital resourceswere checked out from the public library last year alone, proving these institutions remain essential gateways to digital opportunity – especially for economically disadvantaged families.Far from being fiscal drains, libraries drive economic growthFar from being fiscal drains, libraries drive economic growth. Programs like South Bend, Indiana’s “Bendable” initiative, a partnership with the Drucker Institute, deliver preciseworkforce trainingthat directly meets local business needs. According to the Ohio Library Council, initiatives like theseyield nearly $4 in economic return for every taxpayer dollar spent. Defunding libraries doesn’t eliminate these economic needs; it simply shifts costs elsewhere, ultimately burdening communities and taxpayers even more.The consequences are especially severe in Indigenous communities. Take the Nisqually Tribal Library in Olympia, Washington, where IMLS grants supported a StoryCorps recording studio that helpspreserve Indigenous languages, histories and cultural identities. Without continued support, nearly 200 tribal libraries nationwide risk closing their doors, depriving communities of irreplaceable resources for preserving their heritage and deepening educational inequities.The consequences of losing federal support would also profoundly harm academia, weakening America’s ability to innovate and remain globally competitive. Federal investment enabled the Association of College & Research Libraries to launch “Assessment in Action”, helping over 200 academic libraries nationwide to clearly measure their contributions to student success and career readiness. At the University of Washington’s Information School, recent grants supported projectscombating misinformation. Similarly, the University of Virginia Library recently received IMLS funding to develop a community-driven AI platform toexpand open educational resources, directly benefiting educators, students and the public by making educational content widely accessible and adaptable. At the University of South Florida, an IMLS grant supports theAutism Informed School Library Educators (AISLE) Project, helping librarians nationwide provide inclusive, accessible services for autistic students. Losing these initiatives would severely limit the kind of research, education and innovation that strengthens society as a whole.Books and looks: gen Z is ‘rediscovering’ the public libraryRead moreHow did we arrive at this moment? The targeting of library funding appears to be financial, but it’s deeply political. Last year alone, the American Library Association reported1,247 attempts to ban library booksnationwide, largely targeting works related to race, gender identity and LGBTQ+ experiences. Librarians increasinglyface intimidationsimply for defending intellectual freedom, the very principle libraries have always championed.Yet libraries remain non-partisan, practical institutions focused on ensuring equitable access to information, learning and civic participation. From Boston’s Edward M Kennedy Institute, which offers IMLS supportedimmersive Senate debate simulations, tovoter registration drivesanddisability-inclusive voting programsin Illinois and Alaska, libraries sustain democracy itself.The challenges libraries face today are indeed worse than expected. They reflect a troubling political shift and they threaten to undermine America’s economic strength, educational equality and democratic foundations in ways we cannot afford.But there is still time to act. If you value libraries, education and equitable access to information, I encourage you to take clear, concrete steps:Contact your legislators directly: Visit ala.org/advocacy to voice your opposition to these cuts.Show up locally:Attend community meetings and school board sessions to advocate for continued funding and speak openly about why libraries matter.Speak out publicly:Share your support online, tell your own library stories and encourage others to act using hashtags like #FundLibraries or #ShowUpForLibraries.We saw this crisis coming, but our response can still make a difference. Let’s ensure that this predictable attack doesn’t quietly become a permanent loss.Leo S Lo is president of the Association of College and Research Libraries and a dean and professor at the University of New Mexico.Explore more on these topicsLibrariesOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

She went to bed as usual last Tuesday, the care home staff got her up to help her to the bathroom in the night and then early in the morning heard she was having breathing difficulties. She died not long after. There can’t be many 101-year-olds whose deaths are described as unexpected by the doctors.To the last, she took us all by surprise. Rosemary was one of the last of her generation. She served as a Wren in the war and was strafed by a German fighter plane in Portsmouth during an air raid while walking home. She could vividly describe the sound of the bullets hitting the tarmac and the houses as she tried to dive for cover. After the war, against her parents’ wishes, she took herself off to music college in London to study piano before marrying my dad, a naval officer who had also fought in the war. They had three children, Veronica and Sue, my two elder sisters, and me. They were ridiculously proud of us all and stood by me even when nearly everyone else had given up. In the early 60s, Rosemary wasn’t wholly delighted to find herself in the role of vicar’s wife after my dad switched career and went on to become a marriage guidance counsellor and supervisor. She also, along with my dad, became a founder member of the Social Democratic party.Her last eight years were painful as she suffered from Alzheimer’s. It was hard to know which was worse, the brief moments of lucidity when she was clearly terrified of the person she had become, or the longer moments of confusion when her memory failed her. It felt as if what made Rosemary Rosemary had already died and I feel bad that I couldn’t have been a better son to her in her final years. The staff at the home and my sisters were nothing short of heroic. My mum couldn’t have got better care and she insisted on carrying her Guardian around in her bag even though she no longer looked at the paper. It was her routine. She once mistook me for an MP; something that horrified me as much as it would them. Now we’ve lost her again. Her body has caught up with her mind. I thought I was ready for her death but I’ve been blindsided. I’m glad her suffering is over but I feel guilty about the conversations we never had. The conversations we couldn’t have. I love you, Mum.TuesdayWhisper it softly, but there may just have been a mutual falling out between Donald Trump and Nigel Farage. Assuming they were close in the first place. It seems to be The Donald who began the conscious uncoupling. In the past, Nige had always been keen to talk up his proximity to the US president – at one time he was even suggesting himself as the next ambassador to the US – but of late he’s gone quiet. Not even posting a photograph of the two of them together. Presumably because no such photos exist. Nige didn’t even get an invitation to the inauguration. Now Trump is in the White House, he’s got more important people to hang out with. Poor Nigel. All he gets to do is bea useful idiot on the fundraiser circuit. Or maybe not. Farage may be counting his blessings that he isn’t on such good terms. Trump’s fondness for Vladimir Putin isn’t exactly a vote winner.Still, being dumped clearly still rankles. You could tell by his reaction to questions at a Reform press conference in central London this week. Farage got visibly tetchy when asked about Elon Musk’s suggestion that he was past it and that Rupert Lowe would make a better party leader. “Boring”, “Good”, he snapped, talking over the female journalist. There is only room for one prima donna in Reform and that’s Nigel. Which is why Lowe has had the whip suspended for alleged bullying behaviour. The press conference was also notable for Farage complaining that the media had not done more to investigate the behaviour of Reform supporters who he said had made Islamophobic and racist remarks about the party chair, Zia Yusuf. This must be the first time Nigel has admitted his party has a problem with racism. Perhaps he has forgotten that the Reform MP Lee Anderson was suspended from the Tory party for refusing to apologise for remarks about Sadiq Khan which the London mayor described as “Islamophobic, anti-Muslim and racist”.WednesdayThings get worse. We also found out this week that our much loved dog, Herbert Hound, has prostate cancer. We first noticed something was wrong at Christmas when he started peeing blood. But he responded well to antibiotics so we hoped it was just a urinary infection. Then, a couple of weeks ago, we saw that he appeared to be in pain and had trouble walking. This time, we hoped it might either be a recurrence of his cruciate ligament problems that healed themselves or that he had twisted his spine when jumping down from the sofa. But an ultrasound scan on Monday revealed the cancer. The treatment is now palliative. We believe his life to be measured in months, not years.But we live in hope. He has responded so well to the antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and painkillers that sometimes he seems almost like his old self. Nagging to be taken out for walks, thrilled to see us and wolfing down his food. Today he even managed to jump up on the bed for the first time in ages. So perhaps we are being too pessimistic.Herbie is 13 and a half years old and I like to think he chose us every bit as much as we chose him. When we went to visit the litter of cockapoo puppies in Essex all those years ago, he raced up to me, rolled over on to his back and demanded to have his tummy rubbed. He was irresistible then and he still is now. He has also led a full life. There aren’t many dogs that have had a book written about them –Taking the Lead– and he has just about forgiven me for trivialising his vital work in government over the past 10 years. But far more important than advising various prime ministers has been Herbie’s ability to give and receive love. The world is a far better place for him having been in it. We will continue to do whatever it takes to keep him comfortable and happy for as long as possible. May he die as well as he has lived.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forgive me for not feeling the joy. On top of everything going on at home we have a war going on in Ukraine, and Israel hasresumed its bombardment of Gaza. Trump has discovered that ending hostilities isn’t quite as simple as concluding a business deal. Global diplomacy seemingly has its limits. Nor is there much happiness to be found in football. A Newcastle supporting friend who was on her way down to London for the Carabao Cup final last Sunday found herself behind the Spurs team bus on the M1. That explains a lot.Spurs were nowhere to be seen at Craven Cottagewhere they were supposed to be playing Fulham on the same day. We’ve given up trying in the Premier league and I’m committed to at least four more home games on my season ticket. Nor can I even get much pleasure from schadenfreude these days. It’s tempting to try to enjoy Elon Musk losing $100bn off the Tesla share price, except it’s clear he doesn’t care. He’s still got far more than he can possibly spend in a dozen life times and all he wants is attention. Which he gets in abundance.Talking of having it all, the former Vanity Fair business feature writer Bryan Burrough has written a review of Graydon Carter’s memoir of his time editing the magazine in the Yale Review. In it, he describes just what it was like working for Vanity Fair. Burrough got paid $498,000 for six months’ work a year, writing just three 10,000-word articles. If his pieces got optioned for the movies, he collected the advance. Better still, he could put any catered dinner parties on expenses, as well as being given a present on his birthday. When travelling to London he was put up in a suite at Claridge’s. In Sydney, he had a view of the Opera House from his room in the Four Seasons. Understandably, Burrough says it is hard to be motivated to write for other magazines now he – and Carter – have left Vanity Fair. Now that’s a lifestyle I might be able to get behind.FridayDuring my recent holiday, I was invited to Adelaide in Australia to talk at their annual writers’ week. As you might have expected, it was a wonderful experience. Apart from the flights, which were brutal. But the chance to meet so many great writers, public intellectuals and politicians was unforgettable and the hospitality was out of this world. Great food and kindness everywhere. My only regret was that I never left the central business district as I had events every day. If I ever get the opportunity to return I will make sure I stay on for another few days – or longer – to explore beyond the city.What made the festival more special was that almost every event was free. All the audience had to do was stroll down to the botanical gardens and show up. Because the weather is so nice, all events take place outside and there are no real constraints on numbers. Even though I’m hardly well known in Australia, I still got large crowds. Also, as well as having private commercial sponsors, the Adelaide festival gets substantial financial support from the state government. South Australia recognises there is huge value in its citizens taking part in an exchange of ideas and cultures. It wants people to go along regardless of their ability to pay. As far as I am aware, there is nothing like this on the UK circuit. Book festivals try to keep ticket prices as low as possible to encourage as many people as possible to come, but almost nothing is free. Talking of which, I am doing a sold-out show in Henley tonight. But there are still tickets for my events in Hedge End and Stowmarket next weekend, and at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London next month. Please do come.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekNigel FarageDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Last week, the party’s Senate caucus seemed poised to do something that they had never done before: block the Trump administration’s proposed continuing resolution, and shut down the government. It would have been a largely symbolic move, one that signaled opposition to the Trump administration’s usurpation of Congress’s spending authority and a willingness to play procedural hardball in order to slow Elon Musk’s radical anti-government agenda. It would have signaled, too, a party willing to take itself seriously as the opposition to a president with authoritarian ambitions.Government shutdowns are unpopular, but so, right now, is the Democratic party: several senators from swing states seemed ready to stick their necks out, ready to bet that it would be better to be seen doing something – anything – to oppose the Trump agenda than to roll over yet again. And for a few days, at least, it looked like Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, wouldback them up.Then he didn’t. Schumer abruptly reversed course on the continuing resolution, vowing to both allow the government funding bill to come to the Senate floor and to vote for it himself. The bill passed.For many, the moment was emblematic of the Democratic leadership’s singular unwillingness to opposeDonald Trump, and their bizarre belief that the Republican party – that cabal of increasingly fascist politicians that has spent the past decade calling their opposition pedophiles, attacking the rule of law and eroding democratic self-government – can be reasoned with, cajoled and brought back to their senses. Weak, ineffectual, unburdened by conscience or principle, unwilling to take their own side in an argument, and preferring to lose with dignity than to win at the risk of offending anyone: in the budget fight, Schumer embodied all of his party’s worst impulses, the ones that have allowed Donald Trump to seize control of American politics and turn our constitutional order to dust.In many ways, Schumer is reading from a 30-year-old playbook, the one that brought Bill Clinton to power in 1992. Clinton, a moderate, tracked to the right, distanced himself from his party on social issues, prized compromise, and touted himself as tough on crime. This formula worked once, and Democratic party conventional wisdom has demanded that the party return to it, over and over again, in spite of changed circumstances and diminishing returns – like the pet dog who continues to lick a greasy spot on the sofa where she once found a piece of dropped cheese. Times have changed since 1992; the people who were infants that year that Clinton’s centrism swept to power are now not only adults, but adults with back pain. There was a moment in the 2024 campaign, after the selection of Tim Walz as Kamala Harris’s running mate, when it looked like the party might finally abandon this old strategy and take on a more aggressive and affirmative tactic; instead, Walz was muffled, and the party leaders are now mistaking the result of their rightward-tacking strategy as a product of the failure to adhere to it faithfully enough. Politics have changed, but the Democrats haven’t: they are old and out of touch, not just in their gerontocratic leadership, but in their worldview. In theNew York Timeslast month, James Carville, a veteran of the 1992 Clinton campaign, advised his party to “roll over and play dead”. But if the Democrats really were dead, would anyone be able to tell the difference?But one Democrat seems to be showing some refreshing signs of life. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young, progressive Democrat from New York, had in recent years seemed eager to show her willingness to cooperate with Democratic leadership, acting as a key vote and public messenger on crucial issues. But her patience with her party seems to have run out. In aCNN interview, she called Schumer’s capitulation to Trump a “tremendous mistake” and a “huge slap in the face” to Democratic voters – and to a major federal workers’ union, which had endorsed a shutdown. “There is a huge sense of betrayal” among voters, she told journalists, at the mainstream Democrats’ unwillingness to fight.The mainstream of the Democratic party has long accused progressives – like Ocasio-Cortez and her mentor, Bernie Sanders – of a kind of moral vanity, a willingness to sacrifice effective governance or policy gains for the sake of personal purity. The shoe is now on the other foot: it is the mainstream Democratic leadership – Schumer and his allies – who now favor decorum over the public interest, personal dignity over principle, a vain hope for a return to the politics of the past over their responsibility to engage with the realities of the present. It is the centristDemocrats, not the progressives, who are living in a delusion, and who are selling out the country in order to maintain it.Schumer may have been a better man for the job in a different era. “Schumer once had a salty, outer-borough pique that did some work to counter Trump,” the writerSam Adler-Bellwrote in New York Magazine, “but his mien today is weary and distracted.” Now, he seems tired, his red glasses slipping down his nose, his affect exhausted. No wonder he doesn’t want to fight Donald Trump – he doesn’t have much fight left in him at all. After her public break with Schumer, some speculated that Ocasio Cortez might challenge him in a primary for his Senate seat. She should. Schumer comes up for re-election in 2028, at which point he will be nearly 78 years old; Ocasio-Cortez will be 39. Would it even be a fair fight?Explore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionUS politicsTrump administrationChuck SchumerDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

In an accompanying press release, the DoJ said it would bring to justice Hamas leaders who murdered and kidnapped innocent civilians in the deadly attack on Israel of 7 October 2023. Few would quarrel with this ambition. In the same breath, however, the press release claimed that the taskforce would also “investigate acts of terrorism and civil rights violations by individuals and entities providing support and financing to Hamas, related Iran proxies, and their affiliates, as well as acts of antisemitism by these groups”.In plain English, this means the student protesters. It could also include universities and colleges that have entered the government’s crosshairs.The US government has sent Columbia University a ransom note | Sheldon PollockRead moreThe legal risks are real. They are perilous, and they are alarming. Where a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) – such as Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, or related organizations such as the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network – is concerned, the line separating political advocacy from material support to terrorism can be razor thin, and any doubt tends to be resolved against those engaged in the political advocacy.FTOs are foreign organizations that the Bureau of Counterterrorism in the US state departmentdesignates as terrorist entitiesunder section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Once such a designation is made, it becomes unlawful for a US person to knowingly provide that group with “material support or resources”. That phrase is defined broadly in the statute as “any property, tangible or intangible, or service”, which can include “expert advice or assistance”. An aggressive interpretation of “service” and “assistance” may easily break down what were seemingly secure boundaries of free speech.The consequences could be far more draconian than the usual campus risk of a misdemeanorWhat most people might assume is first amendment-protected speech and advocacy can be misconstrued by the government as assistance or propaganda provided under the direction of an FTO, and thus criminally prosecuted under the material-support-to-terrorism statutes.This is not just a theoretical possibility. Protected speech is often used to show predisposition, motive or intent in material support prosecutions. Such prosecutions have led to serious federal anti-terrorism convictions that result in lengthy sentences. Typically, sentencing guidelines call for 20 years to life in prison. Actual sentences in double-digit years are not uncommon. Even though this questionable legal strategy has been used before, its use against student protesters would be unprecedented and alarming.Legal jeopardy for political advocacy has long existed in this country despite its storied embrace of the first amendment. But the justice department’s new taskforce and threatened antiterrorist prosecutions reach deeper into policing political dissent than anything seen since the McCarthy era. The consequences could be far more draconian than the usual campus risk of a misdemeanor civil-disobedience arrest or student discipline. The threat to the values of free speech and open debate on college campuses could hardly be more consequential.I am a Palestinian political prisoner in Louisiana. I am being targeted for my activism | Mahmoud KhalilRead moreAlready, a number of well-funded US lawyers who aggressively support Israel’s war in Gaza have identified ways to prosecute civil claims against student protesters. On behalf of 7 October 2023 victims, these lawyers have filed federallawsuits in Virginia, Florida, and Illinois that use the material-support statutes to seek damages against several loosely affiliated student-activist organizations that oppose the war. Like the government’s use of these criminal statutes, the civil cases allege that the US student groups have been acting under the direction of Hamas or its affiliates since 7 October 2023, essentially to disseminate Hamas propaganda.The incriminating evidence turns on the dissemination of someone else’s ideas, often by making arguments and using expressions, or distributing flyers that can be traced back to an FTO. In the ongoing detention and deportation of former Columbia University studentMahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident, the government accuses him of leading activities “aligned to Hamas” and attending protests at which activists distributed flyers from “the Hamas media office”. More recently, the Department of Homeland Security detained, with the intention to deport,a Georgetown University academicwho is an Indian citizen on a visa. The spokesperson for the DHS stated that he was “spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media”. That is precisely how the criminal investigations could proceed: by connecting free speech to propaganda under the direction or control of an FTO.Right now, the United States is allied with Israel, so the most vulnerable are those students protesting the way the state of Israel is conducting its war in Gaza. But that will not always be the case. As evidenced by Donald Trump’s 180-degree pivot against Ukraine and our closest European allies, the situation could change in a heartbeat.US universities face choice to surrender or fight back against Trump’s ‘takeover’Read moreAll social protest movements occur within larger political contexts. That is especially true of the protests surrounding theIsrael-Gaza war, which are taking place not only within the context of an actual ground war in Gaza, but also within the context of larger geopolitical forces, including the ongoing “global war on terror” declared by George W Bush after September 11.In that larger “war on terror”, strategies and emergency powers that have been developed in the international arena have increasingly been deployed domestically and are now coming home to roost with a vengeance on our campuses. Counterinsurgency strategies with fewer constitutional protections for non-citizens abroad are now being repurposed at home.College students should not be forced to shrink from their political beliefs and free speech and advocacy for fear of punitive civil actions, let alone the fear of federal grand jury investigations and the criminal prosecutions threatened by the justice department taskforce.Studentsarrive at universities at a young age when many of them are passionate about human rights and justice – and rightly so. Some universities and colleges pride themselves on a celebrated history of student protest.It goes without saying that university presidents should be fighting against the assault on the first amendment. But by and large, they have abdicated this responsibility. They must now make it part of their mission to protect students in this new reality. They should not disavow international students who face immigration reprisals, nor take adversarial action against their students to protect only themselves. The least they can do now is work with and counsel their students to help them understand the new threats to their exercise of free speech and enable them to make informed choices and judgments.Thomas Anthony Durkin in one of the country’s leading national security lawyers and the co-director of the National Security & Civil Liberties Program at Loyola University Chicago School of Law.Bernard E Harcourt is the Isidor and Seville Sulzbacher professor of law at Columbia Law School and a leading death penalty lawyer.

Thankfully though, low waste doesn’t have to mean no fun.With a little creativity, out-of-the-box thinking and some help from my community, I was able to throw an entertaining and colourful back yard garden party that produced little waste – and was more affordable to boot. Here are some ideas to help you plan a low-impact party.Reduce food waste and packagingDisposable plates, cups and cutlery are among the most wasteful aspects of parties – they’re single-use, wrapped in plastic and usually get dumped in the rubbish. Over-catering food is also costly to both the environment and your hip pocket. I sidestepped all that by hosting a pot-luck dinner – where each guest brought a plate of food to share – served using metal cutlery and compostable plates.View image in fullscreenDisposable plates are among the most wasteful aspects of parties.Photograph: Penpak Ngamsathain/Getty ImagesAnother option, says zero-waste authorErin Rhoads, is the nationalParty Kit Network. Community members offer reusable tableware, decorations and even party games to borrow, use and return locally. Some party kits are free, while schools and childcare centres may charge a small hire fee for fundraising. “As a parent, planning a party for your child can be really stressful,” Rhoads says. “With the kit, everyone gets to see how easily reusables can be integrated into a celebration.”By hosting my 40th at my place, I could better control sustainable decisions around waste, decorations and food. For example, I placed recycling and compost bins in a prominent location with clear labelling, with the landfill bin further away. If you’re partying in a park or at a venue, consider bringing a compost bin to collect food waste.Reuse, borrow and rentConsider how you might source your get-together’s needs without purchasing new. I began by repurposing items I already had. I gathered couches and comfy chairs from around my house and set them up in the garden – after the party, they simply went back inside. In the weeks leading up to the event, I kept an eye on roadside rubbish and scored a free rug and a couple of extra chairs. Instead of buying new glassware, I used old jars.There’s no point giving a kid an eco-friendly gift they’ll never useErin RhoadsWhen I needed extra items, I turned to my community and borrowed fairy lights, a fire pit, small coffee tables and extra seating.Buy Nothinggroups are an excellent resource for free sharing and loaning in your neighbourhood. If you do need to buy, try second-hand first. I thrifted a drinks dispenser online – for one-third of the usual retail price – and sourced my entire 1920s-themed outfit, from headpiece to dress and shoes, at op shops.Skip presents or try a ‘fiver birthday’At this stage in my life, I have most things I need – and I’m fussy about what I want in my home. To avoid unwanted gifts, I simply asked for none. Alternatively, you could request experiences, consumable treats such as foods and drinks, and even second-hand gifts from thrift shops, eBay or Facebook Marketplace, helping normalise sustainable giving while reducing costs for your guests.Rhoads says a “fiver birthday” is a great option for children’s parties – and helps take the pressure off parents. Each guest contributes just $5 so the birthday child can buy themselves a larger gift afterwards. Handmade cards add a personal touch. Or just ask if there’s anything specific the child needs or wants. “There’s no point giving a kid an eco-friendly gift they’ll never use,” Rhoads says.View image in fullscreenTry newspaper, decorated with ribbons saved from previous presents.Photograph: Amanda Vivan/Getty ImagesAvoid disposable wrapping paper, which mostly can’t be recycled due to metallic dyes, plastic coating and stray plastic sticky tape. Instead, try newspaper or second-hand options such as old sheet music, fabric, scarves or tea towels, decorated with ribbons saved from previous presents. Ensure you choose biodegradable tape, too.Choose low-impact decorations and party bagsIf you make just one change at your next party – ban the balloons. Balloon pollution is a major threat to marine life including seabirds and turtles, which can die after mistaking balloons for food. Instead, consider homemade options made from compostable materials, such as wool, cotton, wood, paper and even plants and flowers from the garden or neighbourhood. Fabric bunting and paper garlands can be folded up and reused again for future parties.For the time-poor or craft-averse, explore Facebook Marketplace or local hire services. Or skip the decorations entirely. I allowed my garden and borrowed fairy lights to provide a natural background to my 40th festivities, combined with a broad ‘any-era’ vintage dress-up theme that made it easier for guests to shop their wardrobe for a costume rather than buying fast fashion.To make kids’ party bags more sustainable, avoid plastic-wrapped lollies or cheap plastic toys that break easily. Homemade play-dough in reusable jars or seed balls made from coconut coir, clay and flower seeds offer a fun, nature-friendly option. Or, Rhoads says, simply send guests home with a slice of birthday cake in a paper bag.“Showing these swaps aren’t that daunting and that events can still be joyful – and perhaps save money as a bonus – is a fun way to get people to rethink living sustainability without the lectures and statistics, which can scare them into inaction,” she says. “It helps shift habits and behaviours in the long term.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsChange by degreesWastenewsShareReuse this content"

It was a night of terror, but one that is all too familiar for Gaza’s children and families after 16 months of war. A reported174 childrenwere killed – one of the largest child death tolls in a single day.Events have escalated rapidly since then. The attacks persist, and Gaza is once again divided. The Israeli military has imposed restrictions,blocking accessto northern Gaza from the south. More than 50 of my colleagues in the north now confront the choice of staying to face tanks and bullets or leaving their homes with barely a moment to process their losses.This resurgence of violence is a devastating setback for families who had just begun to find hope after an eight-week pause in the bombardment. Many hadreturned to the northto see what was left of their homes. Parents were starting to get treatment for their malnourished children and focus on their own health. For the first time in a long while, people could grieve their lost loved ones – moments they had missed while simply trying to survive.I arrived in Gaza shortly after the pause in hostilities took effect on 19 January. I felt a whirlwind of emotions: gratitude for the chance to make a difference, but also a deep fear that the pause could collapse at any moment. I had prepared myself for the worst. The images from Gaza flooding social media had been horrific, but the reality on the ground was even worse. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. As I arrived, the bus we were on drove through asea of rubble– nothing was left standing. No buildings. Just endless destruction.How can the world allow this to happen? Entire families wiped out. Parents burying their children; others unable to even do that because their children are buried under rubble.Aid workers killed. Hospitals and schools destroyed. Health professionals forced to treat the injured without basic supplies. The headlines of the past 16 months showed that my government – the UK government – along with other western leaders, stood by,complicit in the suffering. I never knew politics could be so cold, so indifferent to human life.What struck me the most were the children. These children had no shoes, no coats, no protection from the bitter weather. Despite everything, there was a strange kind of resilience. They laughed, they played and they ran barefoot through the rubble. I tried to convince myself that maybe they had found a way to live amid the nightmare.For the past six weeks, I have spent time speaking to families supported by Save theChildren. I have heard heartbreaking stories. Every family I have met has been displaced, some up to 20 times. They have all faced food shortages. Some children have lost up to 15kg in weight due to relentless hunger. Some have been forced to eat animal feed just to survive. Some are so traumatised from the sight of death and losing loved ones that they suffer involuntary urination or scream out during nightmares. Families have lost everything they once owned.Some felt hopeless, believing thatGazawould never be the same again. One mother said, “Look at the destruction. How can it ever be rebuilt?” Yet there were those who remained strong, with optimism that was contagious. One man said to me, “What is life if we don’t have hope?” Another mother told me, “We will rebuild Gaza. Our children will make it better than ever.”Netanyahu is waging war on Gaza and on us – his ‘enemies within’. It’s the path to autocracy | Aluf BennRead moreI believed her when I met two sisters supported through Save the Children’s education programme. With everything collapsing around them, they still dared to dream. Their smiles radiated hope, and their eyes lit up with excitement as they spoke of their aspirations. A few days later, I met a nine-year-old girl in the same programme. A shrapnel wound had destroyed part of her skull, leaving only a dressing and a bandage around her exposed brain. Her parents were desperate to have her evacuated for medical care that doesn’t exist in Gaza. Initially, doctors told them her chances of survival were slim, and if she did survive she would probably be paralysed and unable to speak. It’s almost unbelievable, then, that she walks, demonstrates incredible intelligence and speaks with confidence. She wants to be a teacher, so she can teach others how to rebuild Gaza.These girls, along with thousands of other children and their families, live in ill-equipped tents, with only the bare minimum for survival. Humanitarian aidstopped enteringGaza at the start of this month, and families are again being pushed to the brink. Now, it is theholy month of Ramadan, a time when Muslims gather with family and loved ones. For a second year, people in Gaza have set up empty seats around makeshift tables.As war resumes, so does the death sentence for Gaza’s children. A ceasefire is the only way to shield them from further physical and mental devastation. No child should ever have to look into their parents’ eyes and beg: “Promise me I won’t die.” No child should ever have to sift through ruins, desperately searching for the lifeless bodies of the ones they loved. No child should ever feel so abandoned, so unseen, that they believe their life holds no value at all.The UK government has to do better than this. It must not be an ally to further atrocities. Every moment of inaction is another moment where hope slips further away. I have asked countless families what message they would send to the world if they could. The answer has simply been that they want to live. This is not only a call for help. It is a plea for the most basic of human rights: the right to live without fear.Shaima Al-Obaidi is a senior media manager at Save the Children UK, specialising in reporting on children impacted by conflict.

Who says cards with a rigged deck isn’t an Olympic sport?Marina HydeThe Zimbabwean has global sport’s top job but Britain’s Sebastian Coe was snubbed, and with good reason: he might have changed thingsFri 21 Mar 2025 10.36 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 11.47 EDTShareCongratulations to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on thesurprise election of its new president, Kirsty Coventry, confirming its status as one of the few electorates on Earth never to have had a change election. Another one is Fifa, with those two organisations’ eternal contest to be the worst-run governing body remaining easily the hardest-fought rivalry in world sport.Yes, the IOC has been in its 144th special session to elect a new leader. Don’t worry – it hasn’t been all hard beds, spartan canteens and bad lighting, as is inflicted on the poor old cardinals in Conclave. The three-day event inevitably took place at a five-star luxury Greek resort.Much can and is being made of Coventry being the first woman and the first African to win the role with 49 votes, while much less, as usual, will be made of the opaque backroom politics that saw her blow rival candidates including the World Athletics president, Seb Coe, out of the water, with voting unexpectedly not even having had to proceed to multiple rounds. Coe finished third with only eight votes, a full 20 behind the second-placed Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. Quick primer: Juan’s the son of Juan Antonio Samaranch, himself a former IOC president, whose final act in the top job was to elevate his son to the committee. Very sporting. Juan Sr came via an impeccable IOC pedigree, of course, having previously served as a sports administrator under an actual fascist regime – in his case, that of General Franco in Spain. His tenure is notable for probably the worst corruption scandal in Olympic history. Or rather, let’s face it, the worst that we know about.So close, Juan Jr! Alas, the IOC presidency going semi-hereditary might have been a bad look too far for the outgoing president, Thomas Bach. Either way, for whatever reason, Coventry’s candidacy wasreportedly pushed hardin the very final stages by Bach and various other top IOC bigwigs. Bach has personally appointed more than two-thirds of the electorate, and was voted in as the still-powerful honorary president on the same day as Coventry’s victory. As the Olympic motto famously runs: citius, altius, status quo.Needless to say, Bach wasn’t a fan of Coe’s criticism of the secretive election process. “There is a good democratic rule, when you don’t win,”he said. “Don’t blame the voters and don’t blame the procedure.” Hmm. Not sure quite how pristine a democracy a meticulously assembled band of royals, international businesspeople, politicians and select former athletes is, particularly the ones flown in from autocracies. But look, I hope they enjoyed this election, and at some point might even consider the idea of having free and fair ones in their own countries.Zimbabwe, where Coventry is a sports minister, might be a case in point, with President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s 2023 election victory characterised by brutal suppression of civil and political rights. Asked during her campaign how she could square her close ties with him, with evenFifa having banned Zimbabwe from international fixturesover government interference in the national game, Coventry explained: “It gets criticised, and that’s OK, because at the end of the day, I don’t think you can stand on the sidelines and scream for change. I believe you have to be seated at the table.”In fact, that might have been the most opinion-adjacent opinion she voiced during the entire election, where her answers tended toward the radioactively inoffensive. Asked, for instance, how she’d bring something new, she replied: “Just the fact that I am running is a huge achievement. Now, we’ll see how the next few days unfold, but I’m looking forward to what comes next.”So who is Kirsty Coventry, who now has global sport’s most powerful job? | Sean IngleRead morePlenty more of that, which makes her pledge to protect the female category in sport with “a bit more of a leading role” one to watch. Pushed on this headline issue in the wake of her victory, Coventry explained: “We’re going to create a taskforce that’s going to look at the transgender issue and the protection of the female category.” What do we want? Taskforces to be created! When do want them? In due course!Part of the IOC’s trouble with Coe, who ran on a platform stating that theIOC should ban transgender athletesin the female category in the interests of sporting fairness, is that he does things. His time at the helm of World Athletics saw him found a fully independent anti-doping and sporting integrity unit, rule decisively on the protection of the female category, and ban Russian athletes – the latter being something that seems to have earned him the permanent enmity of Bach. What’s a little light land invasion between friends – especially rich despotic friends? Remember: the IOC and Fifa need autocracies, with the massive financial outlay that any modern sporting mega event requires really only making sense politically for corrupt and autocratic regimes that wish to make a certain statement to the wider world. It’s why they’re having the next summer Olympics in the US. I’m joking, I’m joking.Still, Coe’s decisive loss yet again confirms of the IOC that you can’t win as an outsider in an insider’s race. It’s not that he’s an unknown quantity, more that he’s a known quantity. They certainly can’t be risking a new broom, after all, just as they couldn’t risk looking too hard into a quite staggering array of vote-buying/bribery/corruption/doping/political/sportwashing scandals down the decades. Once you realise that the one thing sport’s biggest wigs really hate is a sporting chance, it all becomes so much easier to understand.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Chinese state media hascelebrated with gleeand will no doubt seek to fill the void.It is an undisguised war on information and evidence; retribution for the objective reporting of Trump over the past decade and a naked attempt to replace it with slavish sycophancy fromsupportive outlets.This reduces truth, frighteningly, at a time when the capacity to influence public opinion with lies and propaganda is outsized.Australia’s key ally has gone rogue – and Trump has us expertly wedged. We need a plan B | Zoe DanielRead moreIt is a relief to see that initiatives with Trumpian overtones, likebans on public servants working from homeand areferendum on deportation of criminal dual citizens, appear to be met with little support in Australia.However, it is clear that Trump will continue to have an impact on Australian politics and our economy, with the tariffs on Australian aluminium and steel exports just the beginning.US companies seeking to benefit from Trumpism areeyeing Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemeand government lawsreining in the harms of social media.US interference in these spheres is not only a breach of our long-term relationship, it starts to hint at a breach of sovereignty.For decades, any Australian with an interest in freedom of expression has looked on with admiration at the benefits to American democracy of the first amendment, not just in relation to the vitality of its media.Freedom of expression is an essential underpinning of academic research.Yet already, Robert F Kennedy Jr as health and human services secretary has been wielding his anti-vaccine axe around his department and therenowned medical research capabilities of the US National Institutes of Health.His most recent foray has been to suggest that poultry farmers should letbird flu spread naturally through their flocksin the hope of identifying those hens with natural immunity.It has emerged that the Trump administration is also pre-emptively acting to end or suspendUS funding for research at Australian universities.At least six Australian universities have had US funding for research projects paused or cancelled. In total, US support accounted for $400m last year.Apart from the grave consequences of withdrawing financial support, the Trump administration is also attacking academic independence with a detailed questionnaire demanding that researchers confirm that their programs are not a “DEI project”, not a “climate or ‘environmental justice’ project”, do “defend against gender ideology” and combat “Christian prosecution”.Australian universities are rightly alarmed that this will undermine the breadth and quality of research with significant costs to advances in medical treatment and technology.The impact of Trump 2.0 on Australia is evidence of how American we suddenly aren’t | Van BadhamRead moreShutting down truth in the form of education, information and research is a dark path. It’s been used by regimes across history, including the Khmer Rouge whose trials I covered as a journalist in Cambodia.Nearly a century ago Australia turned to the United States “free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom”, when Britain could no longer protect our shores.Trump is now threatening that relationship of great mutual benefit.He is extending that to freedom of speech, one of the very principles on which this enduring democratic relationship has been founded.And if the opposition leader is right that this is the intentional product of deep thinking, rather than shortsightedness, that’s even more worrying.Zoe Danielis the independent member for Goldstein and a member of the joint standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade.

It is a stain Labour may never be rid ofFri 21 Mar 2025 07.23 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 12.07 EDTShareWrong, badly wrong, and it won’t easily, if ever, be forgotten or forgiven.To take £5bn from those with the least, disability claimants already well below the median income who are clustered in the poorest towns, will leave a lasting scar on Labour’s reputation.Sending Labour ministers out on the airwaves to defend the indefensible has been like sending lambs to the slaughter. The welfare secretary, Liz Kendall, and the employment minister, Alison McGovern, used to speak with passion about their optimistic plans for the future of work – but they never meant £5bn cuts. Torsten Bell, the treasury minister, is fresh from heading the Resolution Foundation with its myriad reports on reducing poverty and inequality, but he had to back£5bn cuts on Newsnight. Stephen Timms, social security and disability minister at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), is one of the most thoughtful and knowledgable ministers about social security. He surely never intended this, yet he too was sent out on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Rachel Reeves was a Keynesian, not originally a cutter, but the Treasury is good at frightening the life out of chancellors, and was likely induced to stick to her iron fiscal laws with threats of a Truss crash. Withdeeper cuts expected, and some departments losing up to 7% of their budget, you can expect no spring in the step of Labour ministers after next week’s spring statement.A woman called Emma recently contacted me. Do I remember her? How could I forget, although it’s 13 years since I visited her in Horsham, West Sussex,back when the then Tory work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, was inflicting savage disability cuts. Hers is one of those stories of misfortune and fortitude that stays in your memory with “there but for the grace of God” admiration.Here’s what I wrote thenabout her life with three hyperactive disabled children living in a two-bedroom home: “Rhys, six, is in special school, a child with no sense of danger, on impulse throwing himself down stairs, pulling furniture down on top of himself or hurtling into the road regardless of traffic. Outside he needs a wheelchair. Barely speaking, he eats with his hands, smearing food everywhere and he needs Ritalin to manage at school. He wakes at 4am every morning and has to be watched every waking minute from then on … Martyn, seven, manages in mainstream school with a teaching assistant to help: he bounces about the sitting room with the youngest, Caitlin. She has just had a heart operation, wears a hearing aid and, aged three, hardly talks, so she starts in special school soon.”Emma told me then that if she had understood what the autism diagnosis meant for her first two, she never would have risked having a third. As often in families under stress of disabilities, her marriage has broken up since we met.Now Emma herself uses a wheelchair, as she has severe rheumatoid arthritis, so she relies on her personal independent payment (Pip). Without it to pay for her car and her wheelchair she couldn’t have travelled to her beloved but low-paid job as an NHS administrator for the past four years. All three of her children are now on Pip: Martyn, 21, is holding down a job in WH Smith but needs support; Caitlin uses a wheelchair, and is still at school. Rhys needs the most help – after leaving his special school at 19, he’s now at college on an independent life skills course. “He has just learned to cross the road safely. The jobcentre took one look at him and said he couldn’t be there unaccompanied, so I don’t think an employer would look at him. I hope one day he might volunteer somewhere,” Emma said. The prospect of what will happen if her family lose their benefits has given her panic attacks. Rhys gets £800 a month: “He really needs that to get him to college, for his lunches, his phone, his basic needs. Buthe’s not 22so he’ll lose that. He’ll be on about £300 a month universal credit, and we won’t manage.” Together, the family stands to lose thousands.Although Emma is assessed with “ongoing” needs, she fears she faces another test. To keep her Pip, she needs to score four points for any one incapacity. “I have 13 points, but only twos or threes for any one activity,” she told me. Here’s how it works: anyone needing help to dress or wash their lower body (two points), help to manage incontinence (two points), help to bath or shower (three points), help to cut up their food (two points). Emma doesn’t have four points for any single one of her needs. And some imagine that the benefits system is too lax.“Keir Starmer came to our hospital once and said hello when I was at work. He seemed a nice bloke,” she said. “I wouldn’t expect him to do something like this.” Yet here we are, back in Duncan Smith territory. When Labour said “no return to austerity”, it only meant no return to austerity as severe as the George Osborne era at its worst.The original plans Kendall and McGovern used to talk about were all to do with support, encouragement and training for good jobs with good prospects – not any old job – with highly skilled work coaches offering face-to-face personal help. Kendall will still have £1bn to do some of that New Deal programme that worked for the last Labour government. The focus will be on thosealmost 1 million Neets, the young not in jobs or education, need a big support programme. But there’s an irony in that £5bn cut: that number is almost exactly the sum in 1997 that Gordon Brown seized in awindfall on privatised utilitiesto spend on Labour’s new deals for young people, disabled people,lone parentsand the over-50s: it was spent with singular success in getting people into jobs. This time, analysts say that £5bn cut will get relatively few off benefits while mostly inflicting a brutal hit on families such as Emma’s. And no, benefits tests have not got easier: the Joseph Rowntree Foundation points to a higher rate of refusals over the past five years.Why do this? Spending on working-age adult benefits, at about 5% of GDP, has changed little intwo decades. A third of the growth over the past five years is due to the rise in pension age, with disabled older people claiming while they wait. The government could instead redistribute triple-locked pensions – one of the most generous welfare benefits, but the winter fuel payment row doubt deters them.Though they’re yet to see the final details of Reeves’s plan, children’s charities estimate about 100,000 more children will fall into poverty because of disability cuts in their family. Labour, so scrupulous about sticking to its fiscal responsibility straitjacket, seems less concerned about its manifesto pledge to “develop an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty” which “not only harms children’s lives now, it damages their future prospects, and holds back our economic potential as a country.”Maybe Labour’s child poverty review, due out in the summer, will reverse this backwards direction of travel. But if so, that’s no help to the million, like Emma, about to be knocked down by these cuts. Just in from work, Emma said to me: “Today I have been shaking. I have palpitations. I am tearful. I don’t know what I am going to do. I won’t be able to afford to work – we could lose everything.”Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBenefitsOpinionWelfareDisabilityLiz KendallInequalityPovertySocial exclusioncommentShareReuse this content"

Toxic waste – and ministers don’t careGeorge MonbiotWater companies let waste disposers, for cash, dump their loads into sewage farms. When it is recklessly used as fertiliser, we are all at riskFri 21 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 12.46 EDTShareIf humanity has an epitaph, it might read something like this: “Knackered by the things we missed.” It is true that several existential threats are widely known and widely discussed. But some of the greatest dangers we face appear on almost no one’s radar.How often have you thought about this one: spreading sewage sludge on farmland? I would guess very few would include it in their top civilisational hazards. Despite the best efforts of a handful of us, it trundles on, unknown to most. Surprising as it may seem,new research suggeststhat it could help call time on us.In principle, we should return human waste to farmland, as it is rich in nutrients. But thanks to years of regulatory failure, this waste in many countries isnow contaminatedwith a vast range of toxins. Some come from runoff into the sewers: from roads, building sites, homes and commercial premises. But what we are now discovering is that a great volume of contaminants is introduced deliberately.At some sewage farms, you can witness tanker lorries queueing to offload liquid waste. In return for a fee to the water company, they can pour this effluent into the “head of the works” (the top of the sewage processing chain). Whistleblowers from the Environment Agency report that these loads arescarcely tested. The testing that does occur is often for chemicals that may damage the sewage equipment, rather than those that may poison people and ecosystems. The fees appear to create an incentive for water companies to turn a blind eye.Many of these tankers are delivering leachate from landfill sites, containing a dense cocktail of pollutants, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (Pfas, or “forever chemicals”), other persistent organic compounds, pharmaceuticals and a thick sludge of microplastics. Some tankers come from, well, who knows where? The lack of adequate testing looks like an open invitation to organised crime, which, thanks to a totalfailure of enforcement, hasnow corneredmuch of the UK’s hazardous waste disposal market. Altogether, whistleblowers estimate, in England about 1m tonnes a year of liquid effluent is dumped under this system into sewage works.Where do these toxins go? Some of them, especially the soluble compounds, will wash through the sewage plant and into our rivers and the sea. Some will be trapped in the sludge. Where does the sludge go? About 87% of it issold or given to farmersand spreadon their landas fertiliser.What does this fertiliser contain? Good question. It is tested (if at all) only forfluoride, heavy metals and bacteria. No tests are conducted for the vast majority of potential contaminants. From the government’s own,suppressed research, we know that it is likely to contain such toxins as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins, furans, benzo(a)pyrene, polychlorinated biphenyls and phthalates, many of whichbio-accumulate in the soil. A study published this month by the James Hutton Institute found that after four years of sewage sludge spreading, microplastic levels in the fields it testedrose by up to 1,450%. It also discovered that there was little reduction in the soil of microplastics dumped 22 years ago: once they arrive, they don’t leave.An investigation by the Ends Report last year found forever chemicals in the sewage sludge being sold to farmers at levels up to135 times higherthan those considered safe by scientists. Almost all the sludge samples it took had concentrations above the risk threshold. For such reasons, Switzerland and the Netherlands have banned sludge spreading.Thenew researchI mentioned at the beginning shows how microplastics absorbed by plants could severely inhibit photosynthesis, and therefore crop production. All the major sources of microplastics in farmland soils arise from breathtaking negligence. In some places, trailer loads of microplastic have beenspread deliberatelyby farmers to make the soil more friable. Some havebeen introducedto the soil in the form of pelleted fertilisers, coated with polyurethane, polystyrene, PVC, polyacrylonitrile or other synthetic polymers. Some may now come fromoxo-degradable plastic sheeting. Oxo-degradable polymers are ordinary plastics mixed with compounds which ensure they shatter into microplastics after a while, allowing farmers to plough them in when they have done their job. Such plasticsare bannedin the EU, butremain legalin the UK. Good old Brexit, eh?But the major source of microplastics in fields is likely to be sewage sludge spreading. What are the combined impacts on crops of microplastics and the many other toxic compounds in contaminated sewage sludge? Again, no one knows.At no point in the chain is adequate routine testing conducted: not of the contents of the tankers before they discharge into the sewers; not of the sludge dispatched to farms; not of the fields receiving repeated applications;not of the crops,meatandmilkcoming from those fields. But of one thing we can be sure: like the chemicals themselves, the impacts will accumulate over time.We’re facing a ‘forever chemicals’ crisis. We must stop Pfas at the sourceRead moreIf comprehensive testing of farmland is ever conducted, we could discover that large areas are now too toxic for safe food production. Even the government’sown researchwarns that the cumulative effects of these pollutants could render the soil “no longer … suitable for supporting crop growth”. We have to face this issue just as the global food system looksdangerously fragile.The legal campaignFighting Dirty, which three of us set up, sought tooblige the Environment Agencyto set a date for the proper regulation of the sewage sludge being spread on farmland. Welost our case, partly on the grounds that the Environment Agency had no duty to act without government direction, yetno such directionhad been issued. The judge also decided that contaminated sludge spreading could not be regarded as “a matter of imperative urgency”, because the Environment Agency was not treating it as such. Perhaps they make sense in law, but these grounds look to me like circular reasoning.We discovered from the court papers that the agency had pressed repeatedly for a “ministerial steer”, but was not receiving one, and that better regulation is being impeded by resistance from the water companies and the waste industry. Life is just full of surprises.The case revealed a massive loophole in the law, which the government still has failed to close. I’ve been told that officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs were crowing over the result: three cheers for mass contamination!Perhaps another epitaph would read, “Some of us tried, but no one in power would listen.” A more concise version would be, “RIP FFS.”George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFarmingOpinionPollutionEnvironment AgencyPlasticscommentShareReuse this content"

TV has made the issues plain; now politics must do its jobFri 21 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 12.30 EDTShareIt’s the story every parent of teenagers I know has been watching horrified through their fingers. The Netflix dramaAdolescencestarts with armed police breaking down an ordinary front door to arrest a 13-year-old boy for murder, in front of his bewildered parents. Though initially it seems there must have been some terrible mistake, Jamie’s Instagram account soon yields clues that all the adults – police, parents and teachers alike – had initially blundered past, oblivious.Though talk of misogynistic “manosphere” influencers such as Andrew Tate hovers over the storyline, this isn’t really a story of radicalisation. What it skewers is the feeling of growing up very publicly in a world where sending nudes risks them instantly being shared round the class and everyone automatically films playground fights on their phones, and how that intensifies dangerous feelings of shame and rejection in immature minds. Over half of young women now say they’re frightened of their male peers, according toa sad little surveyfor theLost Boysproject at the Centre for Social Justice thinktank. What’s not always obvious is that beneath their anger, boys are often equally frightened of them.Asked about it this week by the Labour MP Anneliese Midgley, Keir Starmer saidhe’d been watching Adolescencewith his own teenage children. But what has the prime minister, whose own governmentbalked at a backbench billbanning under-16s from social media barely a fortnight ago, learned from it exactly?As the mother of a teenage boy, I’m wary and weary of public debates that crudely stereotype them all as either damaged or damaging. The world is still thankfully teeming with funny, friendly, kind and remarkably well-adjusted boys, whose worst crime is their locust-like emptying of fridges and deplorable attitude to the tidying of bedrooms. But where they’re thriving it is sometimes against the odds, and where they’re not it’s often too hard to get help. The former England football managerGareth Southgate was rightto warn this week about the dangers of “callous, manipulative and toxic influencers” moving into the vacuum with their warped ideas of what it is to be a man, but what really can’t be repeated enough was his reassuring message to boys who are struggling that success is often built on mortifying early failures. (Even Harry Kane once got released by Arsenal.)Southgate’s call for more adult male mentors to step up – whether as teachers or coaches or youth group leaders – in boys’ everyday lives was also helpfully echoed by a newly formed alliance of Labour MPs,pushing for better paternity leaveand measures to boost fathers’ role in their children’s lives. (One of the few bright spots in Adolescence is its unexpectedly tender portrayal of fatherhood, from Jamie’s dad trying to support his son through whatever he might have done to the lead detective nudged into rethinking his relationship with his own son.)Much of this thinking reflects a conversation quietly ongoing for months within the Labour party about what fuelled the rise of the populist right in Britain and in the US, wheremore than half of gen Z menvoted for Donald Trump over Kamala Harris. Add in ProfBecky Francis’s government-commissioned reviewof the school curriculum – suggesting it isn’t working well enough for kids outside the A-levels-to-university track, who arestatistically more likelyto be boys – and you have the beginnings perhaps of something giving young men a more secure footing, without penalising women.But what’s still missing is regulation of the violent and extreme algorithmicallydriven content teenage boys are steeped in, and professional support for families who can sense something going wrong – from early years help with emotional regulation in nursery through to youth clubs, school Send provision and NHS mental health services. For while Netflix’s story of a young murderer erupting completely out of the blue makes for relatable drama, it isn’t perhaps what police most often find themselves facing.This weeka judge sentenced 19-year-old Nicholas Prosperto at least 49 years in prison for murdering his mother, Juliana Falcon, his 13-year-old sister, Giselle, and his 16-year-old brother, Kyle, and for plotting a massacre at his old primary school. Prosper’s parents and teachers had picked up on the fact he seemed withdrawn and overwhelmed by normal social interactions, but he wouldn’t talk to the GP to whom he was referred. Instead he dropped out of his A-levels and spent hours online, fixating on content about school shootings, extreme porn and images of child abuse. He became secretly obsessed with the idea of killing his family and copying the Sandy Hook school massacre, whose perpetrator also shot his mother first; at one stage, Prosper also planned to rape his own sister. Having managed to buy a gun using a forged firearms certificate, Prosper’s plot only went awry when his mother sensed something wrong on the morning of the planned atrocity and challenged him. She and his siblings paid the ultimate price for trying to stop him, but in doing so probably saved countless lives at the school.His case fits the picture painted by the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism, Jonathan Hall, ofa new phenomenon in Britain, involving would-be spree killers with no previous convictions or ideology who seemingly go from 0 to 100 overnight: usually loners, usually boys, heavily online and often neurodivergent, though the latter is a sensitive subject. (Prosper was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorderafter the killings, and the judge stressed while that might explain his social difficulties and tendency to fixate, there’s no reason to assume it caused his violence;an assessment suggested he also had psychopathic tendencies.) For all the raging argument about mental health problems being supposedly overdiagnosed in teenagers, Prosper’s case is a reminder that plenty of families struggle with underdiagnosis, or being bounced from pillar to post in search of answers that never come while struggling to cope (in the worst cases) with the risk their own children’s violence poses to them.But these are also crimes, Hall has said, that wouldn’t happen without the internet because that is “the source of the idea that certain types of violence are the solution” – at least to the already vulnerable. With the new regulatory powers given to Ofcom by theonline social harms billfinally kicking in, it’s crucial that the watchdog for once actually bares its teeth and that politicians step in quickly if that doesn’t work. The writers of Adolescence deserve our gratitude for bringing parents and children together on the sofa, giving both an opening to talk honestly about something difficult. But it’s for politicians to finish the job.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After years of drift, Germany is finally ready to answerJohn KampfnerA historic vote to boost spending on defence and infrastructure shows the country is shedding its excess of caution – and its complacencyFri 21 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 12.46 EDTShareFew people outside Berlin’s political bubble will have heard ofLars Klingbeil. They will soon, though, as he is about to become one of the pivotal players in the new German government. The co-leader of the Social Democratic party (SPD) captured the moment in this week’s debate in the Bundestag, one of the most important in Germany’s recent history.“A few weeks ago, many would have thought that we couldn’t have come to an agreement. The differences were too great,” he said. “What differentiates this country from others is that we are ready, as parties of the democratic centre, to find solutions and not to leave the ground for populist extremism to blossom.”Donald Trump has made this happen. After four years of drift under the hapless Olaf Scholz, Germany has woken from its torpor. By voting for a €500bninfrastructure and environmental injection, and for a whatever-it-takes increase in defence spending, it has shed two shibboleths in one day. It is no longer the country of austerityad absurdumand it is no longer the country that sub-contracts its defence to a superpower it thought was a friend and now fears may be an adversary.There are many frustrations, paradoxes and anxieties arising from the dramatic events. The man who will shortly be chancellor,Friedrich Merz, has spent most of his political career opposing borrowing. The debt brake, which hugely restricted public investment in the name of “sound” fiscal rules, was an article of faith for him, his predecessor, Angela Merkel, for their conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), and even for the SPD.Then came the assault on Germany and the west at theMunich security conferenceby Trump’s lieutenants, a week before Germans went to the polls. As John Maynard Keynes is said to have asked: “When the facts change, I change my mind – what do you do, sir?” Merz’s response is to admit that, yes, he has performed the ultimate U-turn, but in a good cause – so that Germany can modernise its economy and play its part in the reinforcement of Europe in the face of the twin threats of Trump and Vladimir Putin.The Greens have every reason to feel aggrieved. For years they ardently called for more military aid toUkraineand more spending on environmental and other essential causes. Throughout this time, they were denounced by the conservatives as being spendthrift and by the left as being trigger happy. As a result, they lost votes and have been sent into opposition. They have been brought back in from the cold briefly by Merz, who needed their votes to secure the two-thirds majority required to change the constitution in order to circumvent the debt brake. Even though they felt used, they did the decent thing.That was not Merz’s only sleight of hand. He needed to ensure that the measure was put to the outgoing parliament, rather than an incoming one where the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and leftwingDie Linkewould have been able to block the change. It has been ugly to watch. And unprincipled. Or rather, Merz has shown a lack of principle in order to bring into being reforms that are not only principled but vital.No matter how determined Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, have been, no matter how much they have coordinated their efforts, any European security strategy would have little credibility withoutGermany. And Germany would have little credibility unless it turned around its decades-old reluctance to arm itself properly and be prepared to use hard power for good ends.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Germany is set on a new course. A political culture that is often regarded as dour and incremental knows, on occasion, how to do drama. In 1999, led by the Greens’ foreign minister Joschka Fischer, the Bundestagvoted to take partin military action for the first time since the second world war to defend Kosovo. In 2015, Merkel took the controversial decision to allow in more than a million refugees, from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. In 2022, Scholz responded to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine with hisZeitenwendespeech and a special€100bn fundfor military spending. It felt defining at the time, but the now outgoing chancellor spent the rest of his tenure looking over his shoulder. That moment, as it now transpires, was just the overture.Germany is a land I have long praised for the deliberative, serious nature of its politics, for its durable constitution and its mature process of building and testing coalitions in the regions and at national level. It has not indulged in the type of clownism that afflicted the UK in the Boris Johnson era. It takes its responsibilities earnestly. Yet it has also been hamstrung by an excess of caution, a lack of self-confidence and also – when it comes to issues of peril – a complacent assumption that others will come to its aid. Thanks to Trump, that is no longer the case and most Germans know it.They are about to embark on a bumpy ride, with the CDU at the helm and a chastened SPD alongside. Two different parties are coming together to produce a tough and durable coalition in order to keep the populists at bay. Unpredictable and confrontational, Merz is impatient to get things done. Alongside him will be Klingbeil and Boris Pistorius (who may keep his defence portfolio) representing a wing of the SPD shorn of its naivety towards Russia. That is what Germany,Europeand the wider west need in their darkest hour.John Kampfner is the author of In Search of Berlin, Blair’s Wars and Why the Germans Do It BetterExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionEuropeUkraineFriedrich MerzcommentShareReuse this content"

Her grief mirrors Mohamed’s own experience growing up. “There isn’t an answer to [grief],” Mohamed says. “You have to feel it as you go along.” Ali, with her deep connection to the story, was instinctively drawn to the role: “When I approach Somali stories, it’s always a yes before a no because there are so few,” she says.Mohamed, who co-directed theplay Dugsi Dayzin 2022, aimed to create an authentic representation of British-Somali life. “For too long, Somali people have been portrayed through stereotypes in western cinema,” she says. “I want to show all of the beauty and richness of being British-Somali.” Ali echoes this sentiment: “It’s rare to find Muslim stories that aren’t warped with negativity, so I wanted to do it right.” However, achieving this authenticity came with its own set of issue; Ali, who helped source some of the cast, says: “The casting process was really challenging because of a lack of Somali actors. In the end, we had to street cast [approach and ask the general public] and use our networks to make it work.”View image in fullscreen‘The people in positions of power don’t understand our stories’ … Warda Mohamed at the London Critics’ Circle film awards, February 2024.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyBeyond grief, Muna also explores culture, family, and belonging. Ali, who earned her first executive producer credit as well as playing the lead role, is especially passionate about the authenticity of the mother-daughter dynamic. “It isn’t about clashes of culture or religion; it is about two people figuring things out. It is a universal experience that many can relate to.”The soundtrack blends contemporary UK and traditional Somali music, with Muna curating the perfect playlist for her school trip. Ali adds: “I wanted to keep it fun and authentic to me. The music used and the dance scene was a true representation of me as a person, not just acting.”Finding the right oud player for a scene with Muna’s grandfather was also a challenge, but Mohamed’s persistence led her to connect with a musician in Mogadishu through her family. “It was chaotic but beautiful,” Mohamed says. “Shooting inSomaliacaptured the duality of being British-Somali and made it all the more worthwhile.”The production was shaped by Mohamed’s commitment to a faith-based film-making approach to reflect the cast and production staff. “It was important for me that our set reflected the values of the community we were representing,” Mohamed says. “When you see the prayer scenes, they’re not just performances – they’re actual prayers.”Mohamed reflects on the barriers she has faced as a working-class film-maker: “It took more than four years to get funding,” she says. “One of the biggest roadblocks was people not understanding the story. They wanted me to focus on the wake, but I wanted to show it through the eyes of a young girl who doesn’t know why she’s grieving, or what she is meant to feel.”“The people in positions of power don’t understand our stories,” she adds. “Representation is crucial – not just for the audience but for decision-makers too. We need people from different backgrounds in development, executive, and commissioning roles so they can understand stories that haven’t been seen on screen before.”After its successful festival run, Mohamed says she heard from many people wanting to watch Muna again or for the first time – so she is delighted the film is now on the BBC’s iPlayer platform. “The iPlayer release feels like Muna has been given new life,” she says. “It’s been joyful to see different parts of the world respond and hear how people connect with Muna, her brother, or even the parents.” For now, Mohamed has set a new precedent for Somali storytelling in British cinema. “We have to keep making things, keep writing, keep telling our stories,” she says. “And hopefully, people will eventually see us the way we want to be seen.”Muna is now available to watch on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsFilmShort filmsSomaliaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He talks about fooling a Python, hating Noel Edmonds … and why he can’t escape the giant phoneFri 21 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTShareThe first episode of Trigger Happy TV aired 25 years ago. Its very first sequence was of a man screaming into an oversize phone, startling the unwitting diners at a fancy restaurant. “The following Monday I was on a train, and that ringtone went off,” recalls the show’s co-creator and starDom Joly. “Three people in the carriage stood up and went: ‘Hello! I’m on a train!’ And I sat there thinking: ‘Holy shit, something extraordinary has happened.’”Joly isn’t often drawn into conversation about Trigger Happy TV. In the 20-plus years since the show ended in 2003, he has busied himself with plenty of other projects – books, columns, TV shows, podcasts – but nevertheless has found it hard to shake off his breakout hit. “Every time I do anything, even if I’mwalking across Lebanonfor 27 days for one of my books, someone will go: ‘Did you take the big mobile with you?’” he laughs from his home in Gloucestershire. “Of course I fucking didn’t take the big mobile with me. Why would I take the big mobile with me?”But the show’s silver anniversary has encouraged him to re-examine his work. In October he’s taking Trigger Happy on tour, showing old clips and reintroducing characters. As such, he’s in a warm, expansive mood, especially when I try to put the show in some sort of context.After all, 2000 was a big year for prank shows. The form had existed in one way or another since 1948, when Allen Flunt’s Candid Camera first experimented with tricking the public (and in one instance formerUS president Harry Truman) with hidden cameras. But by the late 20th century, thanks to Noel Edmonds and Jeremy Beadle, the form had taken on a slightly insipid chumminess. “I remember watching those shows,” remembers Joly, “and thinking: ‘I fucking hate this.’”View image in fullscreenCall waiting … Dom Joly and that phone.As such, Trigger Happy TV felt like a violent shake-up. Lower-budget and more prone to surreal flights of fancy, it was also much faster than anything people were used to. Set-ups that Beadle would have laboured over for an entire episode were done within a matter of seconds. It felt like the prank show as guerrilla attack.“I don’t like calling Trigger Happy a prank show because I’m a ponce,” frowns Joly when I mention this. “It’s hidden camera. Prank shows are the lowest rung in comedy. It’s normally done by thick people or jocks.”Instead, much of Trigger Happy bordered on performance art. As well as the big phone – which Joly never thought was particularly indicative of the broader show – there were dog walkers performing CPR on taxidermied alsatians, people in rabbit costumes loudly rutting in London’s Prince Charles Cinema, chefs chasing man-sized rats out of their kitchens. People leaving public toilets would be shocked to find Joly and a brass band standing outside, loudly celebrating them as the millionth person to have relieved themselves there. Opera singers would scream atonally at strangers then demand payment.Unlike previous hidden camera shows, Trigger Happy went without a studio audience. There were no laugh tracks to their stunts, with that role being filled by music; in the case of Trigger Happy, it often provided a sombre counterpoint to the silliness on screen.Joly credits Trigger Happy’s ability to disrupt the form to his upbringing. He was born in Beirut, and grew up reading French comic books such as Astérix and Lucky Luke, before discovering notorious phone pranksters the Jerky Boys. “There was also a Belgian guy called Noël Godin, who was a very stoned, drunk Belgian anarchist,” he says. “He came up with a manifesto that there’s no better way of judging someone’s character than by how they react when they’re hit in the face with a custard pie. And so he’d go and custard pie people they thought had got above themselves in public life. What I loved about it was they did it for the beauty. They didn’t film it. They were just doing it because they felt it needed to be done.”View image in fullscreenAnother fine mess … Dom Joly in a scene from Trigger Happy TV.Photograph: Channel 4This bled into the show. “When we were making Trigger Happy, we had the things we were doing for the show,” he says. “But the things that really made us laugh were actually things we didn’t film. They were stuff we did for the beauty.”Like what? “I’ll give you a great example,” he replies, grinning. “Our office was just around the corner from a radio station, and every day at 10 o’clockTony Blackburnwould walk past our office. One day we just thought it’d be funny to pose as fans and get his autograph. And he was like: ‘Oh, yah guys,’ and signed something for us. From then on, we decided we were going to do it every day.” He pauses. “We got 262autographs off him, and never once in those 262 days did he say: ‘Have I not seen you guys before?’”Not that Blackburn was the only celebrity he encountered. Although most of Trigger Happy TV involved members of the public, who all had to sign consent forms – “If people wouldn’t sign, it was usually because we’d filmed them with someone they shouldn’t be with. The amount of people wandering around having affairs is quite astonishing” – with public figures he could skirt the issue by asking if they’d mind being filmed “for Channel 4”, subtly implying that they would end up on that evening’s news.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most recent volume ofMichael Palin’s diariesincludes an entry that reads: “Terry G [Gilliam] has come from an aborted street interview, in which an annoying busker had his guitar smashed by the interviewer who chased him off into Wardour Street and never returned.” Needless to say, unbeknown to all involved, the interviewer was Joly, and this scene played out at the end of the show’s first episode, with Gilliam blurting out a bewildered “Fuck” as Joly chased the busker into the distance. “We did actually contact him about that,” Joly admits now. “He came back saying it was perfect gonzo comedy. I loved that.”If 2000 really was year zero for the modern-day hidden camera show, Joly is quick to credit it to a technological breakthrough. “A year before Trigger Happy happened, if I’d wanted to make that show I would have had to hire a proper cameraman, a proper soundman; it would have cost a fortune, they would have been grumpy, we’d have had to have a lunch break. But a camera had come outcalled the VX1000and it was just good enough quality to be shown on TV. It meant that we could film and film, and we didn’t have to worry about any of that stuff. In a sense, that was the birth of YouTube.”In that regard, Joly is now master of all he surveys. “Hidden camera is by far the biggest comedy format in the world,” he asserts. “Almost all the stuff you see online, on YouTube and TikTok, is hidden camera. The ultimate endgame from Trigger Happy isMrBeast. MrBeast online is astonishing. I mean, it’s a bit crass, but it’s so much more interesting than what you see on telly.”View image in fullscreenOn the go … Sam Cadman with Dom Joly in Trigger Happy TV.Photograph: Channel 4“I’m longing to make a show called International Prank Stars,” he continues, “because we’ve all seen these videos that get like 200m hits, but you’ve no idea who made them. It’s a very anonymous format.” That said, the modern hidden camera scene is still full of tropes that grind his purist gears. “I hate that a lot of them are faked,” he says. “I can smell a fake a mile off, and that’s the thing that really irritates me.”If nothing else, Joly is finally comfortable embracing the Trigger Happy TV legacy. “Of all the things I’ve done, Trigger Happy is the thing I’m most proud of,” he says. “It was a work of absolute love and total control. Sam [Cadman, the show’s co-creator] and I did everything, from coming up with the ideas to filming everything all day to editing. Every element of it was just us.”Now that he’s more comfortable with his legacy, Joly has been meeting with the old Trigger Happy TV team. “Not so long ago we had a For the Beauty night back at the pub off Charing Cross Road where we used to come up with all our ideas,” he says. “I met everyone we made it with. And that was so annoying. All my runners are now, like, Bafta award-winning directors and stuff.”What’s charming is that his notion of “For the Beauty” – just doing something for the hell of it, not to make content – still seems to be his defining mantra. “If I ever write a proper autobiography, I think it’ll be called For the Beauty,” he explains, before grumbling. “Obviously someone would want it to be called Pranks for the Memories.”The Trigger Happy TV: Live! 25th AnniversaryTourstarts 7 October.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A full third of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra’s first-time audience members are coming to the concert hall via their favourite series and movies – and video games. It is a huge cultural growth area, and one that may have gone unrecognised by the general public.“It is impossible to ignore video game music now,” says Tommy Pearson, founder and artistic director of the inaugural London Soundtrack festival. “The sheer creativity and artistry in games is incredible, and it’s been fascinating to see so many composers blossom in the genre.”As one of the lead architects behind the festival, Pearson was eager to make space for video games as part of the celebration – not just as an “add-on” to TV and film soundtracks, but as an equal in the art form. “When I was first thinking about what we would do at the festival, including games music was a no-brainer. It absolutely has to be there alongside film and TV music. It has a very dedicated audience of fans and the music is as good as anything being written in any genre.”View image in fullscreenTommy Pearson, artistic director of London Soundtrack festival.Photograph: London Soundtrack FestivalRunning from 19 to 26 March, the festival will consist of live performances, panel discussions, screenings, Q&As and masterclasses. One of the key events,State of the Art, will include performances of video game music by the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, masterclasses from Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab – composers who recently collected Grammy and Ivor Novello awards for their work on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.Why is 2025 the perfect time for the first Soundtrack festival in London? “We’re seeing millions of streams of game soundtracks, daily,” says Barton. “There’s a huge amount of social media content on Instagram and TikTok that ties into it, not to mention the world of Twitch where a streamer’s playlist is a huge part of their identity. The record industry is just about catching on to this.”“I see the streaming numbers climbing in real time, but beyond the data, you can sense it everywhere,” adds Haab. “Game music isn’t confined to consoles any more – it’s woven into people’s every day lives. My nieces and nephews, for example, have game soundtracks on rotation purely for enjoyment. At gaming events, fans know these themes note-for-note, singing them back with the same devotion you’d see at a concert. Even in broader entertainment circles – award shows, industry mixers – video game scores are part of the conversation now. They’re treated with the same respect as film music, standing on their own as a legitimate art form. And if the surging demand for soundtrack releases tells us anything, it’s that people aren’t just listening: they’re seeking it out.”View image in fullscreen‘Fans know these themes note-for-note’ … Death Stranding.Photograph: Kojima ProductionsComposers Ludvig Forssell (Death Stranding), Harry Gregson-Williams (Metal Gear Solid), Stephanie Economou (Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök), andBorislav Slavov(Baldur’s Gate 3) will all be part of a panel discussing games music in the day, before joining the performances in the evening.From IT worker to god of music: the unlikely story of Baldur’s Gate 3 composer Borislav SlavovRead more“You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who can’t sing a tune from Super Mario Bros or Final Fantasy or Halo or The Legend of Zelda,” says Economou. “Video game music is prevalent because video games are prevalent. The industry itself is more profitable than the film, television and music industry combined. So when people think that it’s suddenly surging in popularity, all I can think is: no, it’s just finally getting more recognition and celebration in more public spheres. I applaud the London Soundtrack festival for highlighting the art form and I’m thrilled to be part of the festival in its inaugural year.”“The London Soundtrack festival is a great opportunity to celebrate the differences and diversities in music for media,” adds Forssell. “Video games may still be the new kid on the block, in some senses, but they are definitely here to stay; and I hope that we as composers will always be able to have our own different approaches to music in general, be it pop, rock or music for film, TV, video games and beyond.”Pearson and the team of composers he has assembled see the event as a celebration of the state of video game music. “These are all brilliant, hugely respected composers producing terrific and exciting scores that live in the game and in the concert hall very successfully,” Pearson says.Will non-gaming audiences ever accept video game music as much as TV or film?“There will always be a bit of snobbery about media music,” Pearson says, “But it’s nowhere near as much as it used to be. And who cares what people think anyway?”London Soundtrack festivalis at various venues until 26 March.Explore more on these topicsGamesFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It comes with cover art that features the betrothedSelena Gomezand Benny Blanco snuggling in bed, the photograph apparently shot through a keyhole, as if its prospective audience is spying on an intimate moment. Should you not get the gist, there’s an accompanying explanation about how it celebrates the pop star and pop uber-producer’s “love story”, how it came together “organically” thanks to the comfort between them, and “authentically reflects their experiences”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for I Said I Loved You FirstWhether that compels you or sends you running in the opposite direction screaming in horror is doubtless a matter of personal taste. It depends on how you feel about public displays of affection, particularly those designed to make the couple in question money, an idea that history suggests is fraught with risk. Over the years, a host of legendary pop names have chosen to commemorate their love together in song – Sonny and Cher, Kylie and Jason, Nas and Kelis, not to mention Katie Price and Peter Andre – only to watch their relationships crash and burn. Gomez and Blanco, who produced Katy Perry’s Teenage Dream, Maroon 5’s Moves Like Jagger and Rihanna’s Diamonds among other 2010s classics, evengave Interview magazinethe sort of Hello! magazine exclusive in which a Coronation Street star flashes their engagement ring.Still, you can see why they might have done it. For one thing, the first flush of romance can make you lose your head, blind to the idea that your love might give anyone outside your bubble the ick. You could mock passing that kind of behaviour off as “art that authentically reflects their experiences”, but then look at John Lennon and Yoko Ono favouring the world with a photo of themselves in the buff. And we live in an era where pop fandom seems predicated on parsing every lyric for intimations about their idol’s personal life – something Gomez, the most-followed woman on Instagram, knows well. It’s indescribably reductive, but if fans are intent on viewing your music as a footnote to your private life, then why not give them what they want?Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco: Younger and Hotter Than Me – videoSo the album roughly follows a narrative arc, from the wreckage of a failed previous relationship to the couple’s present-day happiness. In fairness, the lyrics are nowhere near as runny as the accompanying blurb might suggest, but they do a lot of things that besotted couples are wont to do: smarming about how happy they are in front of single friends, being passive-aggressive when they run into their exes (“I know you’re going to find somebody perfect”) and offering TMI about their sex lives. It’s “ride it like a cowboy” this and “I just wanna go all night” that. If their forthcoming marriage is blessed with children, you dread to think how it’s going to go down when said kids hit their early teens.Musically, it pulls in a lot of big names, Billie Eilish’s brother and collaborator Finneas, Gracie Abrams, rapper GloRilla and Charli xcx among them, the latter contributing to a bit of trebly and distinctly post-Brat dance-pop called Bluest Flame. I Said I Love You First cycles through a selection of modish pop styles, from J Balvin-assisted Latin pop that leans into Gomez’s Mexican heritage to a piano ballad performed in the slurry vocal style known as “cursive singing” or “indie girl voice” – supposed to indicate confessional intimacy, it can sound remarkably like you’re singing with your bottom lip stuck out like a petulant four-year-old. There is a taut new wave/pop-punk-influenced track with a guitar that goes chugga-chugga (Call Me When You Break Up), a song closely resembling a Billie Eilish ballad (Don’t Take It Personally) and a lot of stuff that sounds like Lana Del Rey, whose influence hangs particularly heavy over How Does It Feel to Be Forgotten? and You Said You Were Sorry.Only Murders in the Building season four review – by far the funniest thing on TVRead moreIt’s all pretty well done, but it means that a project that’s clearly very personal ultimately struggles to develop a clear identity of its own, an issue that has plagued Gomez as a pop star despite some great one-off hits; in recent years, her greatest successes have been as an actor in Only Murders in the Building and the ill-fated Emilia Pérez. Plus, the songs aren’t hugely memorable. That seems baffling, given how successful Blanco is: whatever you made of Teenage Dream or Moves Like Jagger, they’re incredibly catchy songs. You might assume he’d bring his A-game to an album where he shares billing with his fiancee, but killer tunes are surprisingly thin on the ground – the best might be the chanson-like melody of Ojos Tristes – which perhaps accounts for the relatively muted reception afforded the singles released thus far, despite an ongoing media blitz.In all their media appearances together, Gomez and Blanco seem like a genuinely sweet couple: funny, self-deprecating, a lot more self-aware than the stuff about producing art that authentically reflects their appearances might suggest. It’s tempting to say that you can have more fun – and, if you’re interested in such things, get a better insight into their relationship – watching them eat chicken wings dipped in tongue-melting chilli sauce onYouTube series Hot Onesthan listening to I Said I Love You First. It’s certainly not as mawkish as you might fear – you don’t want to bolt from it at high speed – but nor can you imagine spending too much time in its presence, however much you wish its authors well.Explore more on these topicsSelena GomezPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The artist reluctantly takes time out from her studio in order to grant a rare interviewFri 21 Mar 2025 07.31 EDTLast modified on Fri 21 Mar 2025 09.38 EDTShareWhen Arpita Singh’s Remembering opened this week at the Serpentine inLondon, despite being one of India’s leading artists, it was her first solo institutional show outside her native land in her six-decade-long career. It also marked the first time the Serpentine has given over its main galleries to a show by a south Asian artist. But Singh, who spends most of her waking hours in her Delhi home studio, is muted in her reaction. “Serpentine is a known gallery, so it is a prestigious thing for me,” is about as effusive as she gets.At 87, Singh is reluctant to give her time to anything that might take her away from her canvas – and that includes this interview. Her vivid, unhinged paintings, chock-a-block with adrift figures, motifs and text often structured by narrow borders crammed with ornament, have won her a devoted following. In an epicMappa Mundi-like piece, My Lollipop City: Gemini Rising, perspectives jar and scales switch in a way that jauntily recalls storytelling scroll paintings and lavishly detailed miniatures.View image in fullscreen‘A way of seeing things completely’ … Arpita Singh.Photograph: © Vadehra GalleryThese splashy, discordant canvases are also stacked with influences from the European modernists Singh encountered during her fine art studies at Delhi Polytechnic in the late 1950s under modernist legendsBiren DeandSailoz Mookherjea. “In our third year, our professor took us to the library and introduced us to western art,” Singh recalls. “I was so impressed byDer Blaue Reiterand Kandinsky. More so than the French artists.”At the time, international art could be seen only in printed reproductions. India was a recently independent country, and although Nehru, then prime minister, had just opened theNational Gallery of Modern Artin Delhi, it was not – and isn’t today – a space for touring shows from the west. But the little that Singh saw deepened her curiosity, and she went on to read those artists’ writings. She singles out Paul Klee as her favourite.Forty-eight years after absorbing his written output, she finally stood face to face with his original paintings during a trip to Switzerland. The experience was revelatory. Singh tells me that she wanted to say: “Master, I have come back to you.” Klee’s influences are particularly apparent in one of Singh’s earliest watercolours, a patchwork of lightly painted shapes of colour that opens her Serpentine show. For many, this will be strikingly at odds with the figurative imagery that has made her one of India’s most highly valued female artists. Singh’s style fluctuated after art school, when she was also a consultant at theWeavers’ Service Centre, a government co-op tasked with preserving and promoting India’s textile traditions. One can see her testing different styles in off-kilter scenes where Chagall-like waywardness is crossed with surrealist eccentricity.Arpita Singh: Remembering review – beautiful chaos reigns in India’s tumultuous pastRead moreBeing given her first solo show in the centre of Delhi byKekoo Gandhy, an esteemed art dealer, plunged her into a period of doubt and introspection. Feeling that she was “not moving naturally on canvas” she decided to give up “painting figures” and turned to the fundamentals – dots and lines – in an effort to retrain herself. “For six years, I kept repeating these dots and lines,” she says. “It naturally became an abstract form.” When she did return to figuration, in the 1980s, the social and political experiences of a country reeling fromIndira Gandhi’s imposition of emergency rulesuffused her ostensibly whimsical worlds. And yet, even as Singh’s paintings make allusions to state violence, most often through the inclusion of a lurking military figure, her work from this time can seem curiously dulled and undramatic. Look closely and amid the chubby flowers and squat aeroplanes, most of her subjects seem forlorn and apathetic. AsAtul Dodiya, a fellow artist who is close to Singh clarifies: “The work is superficially childlike and naive, but it comes from deep experience.”View image in fullscreen‘From deep experience’ … Devi Pistol Wali, 1990, by Arpita Singh.Photograph: Courtesy of Museum of Art & Photography, Bengaluru, India. © Arpita SinghIt would be wrong, however, to consider her work an articulation only of her life. Women take up a large portion of space in her paintings, usually eclipsing men. But their colouring, often a chalky pink or pale, distances them from Singh. The goddess figure brandishing a small pistol in the painting Devi Pistol Wali is not a stand-in for Indian society. Neither is it a statement of female power in the face of victimisation. “It is nothing like that,” Singh tells me. “Why must I see her as a source of power? Neither do I see a man as a source of power. Both are the same for me.” When I gently ask her about the maternal figures that recur in her works and how her experience of motherhood (Singh’s only daughter, the artistAnjum Singh, died of cancer aged 53 in 2020) might have affected her practice, she replies with a question: “How can that change my work?”Singh has never allowed herself to feel limited. She stayed clear of the artistic debates that consumed others such as theBombay Progressive Artists’ GroupandGroup 1890, and has avoided being dogmatic about her process. That might be why, over her illustrious career, she has been reluctant to speak to the press. She has, it seems, been protecting the freedom of her vision. Singh’s stimulus is varied, her practice porous and her paintings animated by their time. AsNilima Sheikh, another of India’s visionary artists who has written on Singh’s work and exhibited with her extensively, told me, Singh “has a way of seeing things completely, which I have tried to emulate”.This comprehensive vision is fed by newspaper stories, text from books and exhibition catalogues, aspects of theatre and dance that mix with her memories.“Things happen on their own,” Singh says. “The affairs of political and social life come into my painting like the way light comes as colour and breeze comes as movement.” Ultimately, Singh is concerned with form and visual drama. And she realises these with apparent ease; her paint glides – from areas where it looks like sheets of paper to patches of thick impasto – so effortlessly that, she says, it feels as if the paintings are painting themselves.Arpita Singh: Remembering is atSerpentine North gallery, London, until 27 JulyExplore more on these topicsArtSerpentine GalleryLondonIndiaExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We are in the middle of a rangy conversation on a video call, meandering our way from Bob Dylan to the anthropomorphism of bees, viaCrazy Heart,Cutter’s WayandThe Big Lebowski. There are sidetracks and double-backs and loose threads. Intermittently, an unseen assistant hands the actor pairs of glasses seemingly identical to the ones he is already wearing. Bridges, in a soft brown cardigan, inspects each pair and dismisses them. “Where was I?” he asks.The garage here serves as Bridges’ jam space and ceramics workshop. He has drums set up for his grandson, and a picture of Captain Beefheart on the wall. Since December, when his FX seriesThe Old Manwas cancelled, the 75-year-old has been spending more of his days here. “Now I’ve got some time for letting some other things bubble up and I’m really happy about that,” he says. “A lot of music, some more art stuff.”Bridges is good at finding the silver lining. Mention the recent loss of his Malibu home in the Los Angeles fires, for instance, and he is sanguine. “We’ve lost five homes to fires, earthquakes, floods. We’re waiting for the locusts,” he says. His 2020 diagnosis and subsequent treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma – or, in Bridges words, “some real health issues” – is mentioned only in passing, as the catalyst for him to release more music: “Hey,” he reasons, “if you’ve got some stuff that you want to share, now’s the time, man!” I tell him how despite it all he seems remarkably chipper, and he smiles. “Absolutely,” he says. “I’m happy.”View image in fullscreen‘After a movie yourpretendmuscle gets exhausted’ … Jeff Bridges (left) and Cybill Shepherd in The Last Picture Show, 1971.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThe primary focus of our conversation today is intended to beSlow Magic, a collection of Bridges songs lost for close to 50 years and now due to be released on Record Store Day. The way the release came about, he says, “is so mysterious and wonderful to me. Shall I give you a little history?” He launches into a story that involves the musiciansKeefus CianciaandT Bone Burnett, a Squarespace advertisement for the Super Bowl, the 1975 comedyHearts of the West, the New Age music charts, and a single cassette tape of some tunes Bridges had set down with some old high school buddies, labelled “July 1978”. One soon grasps that much of Bridges’ life has moved this way, in bursts of what we might regard as cosmic serendipity and connection.View image in fullscreenA young Jeff Bridges.Photograph: Candy ClarkBridges was born into a well-known Hollywood family. His mother, Dorothy, and his father, Lloyd, were both actors, as was his older brother, Beau. Although the young Jeff showed promise in art and music, his father encouraged him to join the family business, taking him along to set, securing him minor roles on his productions. “I had questions about what I was going to do, and my dad would say: ‘Jeff, don’t be ridiculous, that’s the wonderful thing about acting, it’s going to call upon all of your interests.’”All the family loved music. They would sit around the piano, singing show tunes together. One of Bridges’ earliest memories involves the Broadway composerMeredith Willsonvisiting the family home to try to persuade his father to take the lead role in The Music Man. “His wife, Rini, was playing the piano and Meredith Willson was coming up to me singing: ‘You got trouble! Right here in River City!’”He was a teenager in the 1960s, just as music shifted gear from the early rock’n’roll of Chuck Berry and the Everly Brothers to the likes of the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones. “I mean every day, can you imagine, waking up going to school and here are the new Beatles songs?” he says. “And that happened over and over! You take it for granted, kind of, but it’s amazing!”View image in fullscreen‘To do a movie, to bring me to the party, I resist’ … Jeff Bridges in The Last American Hero, 1973.Photograph: Rojo Productions/RGR Collection/AlamyBridges’ high school was largely made up of the children of the entertainment industry. He hung out with an artsy bohemian crowd, rather than the jocks, each school day starting by getting stoned in his Buick while he and his buddies listened to the radio: “[There was] a lot of drug experimentation you know, during those times.”On Wednesday evenings, a group of them would meet for a jam session at his friend Steve Baim’s home. “There was a main rule that there were no songs allowed,” Bridges says. “Singing was encouraged, and making up songs, but nothing that would be played on the radio or anything like that. Just a big jam session.” As they left high school and moved through their lives, the Wednesday Night Jams continued – a way of rooting the group in their city, their friendship and their creativity. At some point around 1977, Bridges, who had been writing music alongside acting, invited his friends over to record some of his tunes. “And the album is a result of that.”Despite his father’s advice, music had always remained an alluring and viable career path for Bridges. In the late 60s he even sold two songs to Quincy Jones, who used one of them, Lost in Space, for the soundtrack ofJohn and Mary, starring Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow. As time went on, the indecision continued. “I’d done 10 movies, I’d been nominated for an Academy Award [best supporting actor forThe Last Picture Show, 1971], and I still wasn’t…” He pauses, and his eyes glance off to the assistant once more. “Oh thank you dear, I appreciate that,” he says, taking the latest pair of spectacles. “Those are the ones!” He says, then looks at them more closely. “No, these are not the ones!”Something of a shift happened after making 1973 motor sports movieThe Last American Hero. “I had a great time making it, but usually after a movie yourpretendmuscle gets exhausted,” Bridges says. “You don’t want to pretend any more, you just want to be who you really are and not be in character.”View image in fullscreen‘A little experiment on myself’ … (from left): Robert Ryan, Jeff Bridges and Sorrell Booke in The Iceman Cometh, 1973.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyShortly after filming wrapped, his agent was approached by the director John Frankenheimer with a part in his adaptation of Eugene O’Neill’sThe Iceman Cometh. Bridges knew it would be a big deal – Frederic March, Robert Ryan and Lee Marvin were already signed up. Nevertheless, he was unsure. He told his agent to turn down the role. Five minutes later, he received a call from Lamont Johnson, director of The Last American Hero. “He said: ‘I heard you turned down The Iceman Cometh?’ I said ‘Yeah Monty, I’m bushed, man.’ And he says, ‘You’re bushed? You’re an ass!’ And he hung up on me!”Bridges took stock and decided “to do a little experiment on myself and go kind of against what my intuition is telling me”. He took the role, loved the movie, and decided he would throw his hat fully into the acting ring.It was an early example of Bridges exploring what he regards as the resistant element in himself. “I find I have a lot of resistance, that’s kind of how I roll,” he says. “To do a movie, to bring me to the party, I resist, I resist. And there’s such satisfaction in exploring that resistance and getting on the other side, not being afraid of it.”Lately, he has been examining his resistance to cold. “I’m getting into the cold-plunging, I’ve been doing that for a while, and my relationship with cold has shifted a bit,” he says. “Normally you think of cold as an enemy, but it’s just a feeling. All of those different emotions that come up, they’re no big thing man! Come on!” He was always this way, he says, always resistant. “I don’t think I’ve changed much since I was a little kid. I feel basically the same.” I ask Bridges how he would describe himself at his essence, and he leans back in his chair and thinks. After a moment, he smiles, broadly. “Frightened, and game.”View image in fullscreen‘I don’t think I’ve changed much since I was a little kid’ … Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski, 1998.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyHe is reluctant to be drawn on how different his relationship with music might be to his relationship with acting – whether it still holds any of that same resistance, if it requires him to use his “pretend” muscle. “It’s a facet of myself,” he says. “I don’t think we ultimately know who we really are all the time. The task for all these different things, whether it’s acting, music, painting, ceramics, the main task is getting out of the way, letting the thing come through you. And it can be frightening sometimes. But sometimes it just has its way with you, and when that happens, man it’s a gas! And when it happens with a bunch of other artists and you’re all doing it together, it’s real magic. It’s the magic of trees and flowers.”Music has often been the thing that has glued together the various facets of himself, and connected Bridges to others. “Whether it’s making a movie or music, you’re harmonising,” he says. “You’re saying: let’s combine our strengths here and see what we can come up with and make it beautiful and real.”Often, he will make a playlist for the character he’s playing (for the Dude in The Big Lebowski, it was “a lot of Creedence”). “Then you play them in the makeup trailer,” he says. “You get made up with all the guys in the show, you make that transition from who you are back into your characters. You get painted, you share music.”He recalls shooting 1984’sAgainst All Oddsin Mexico with Taylor Hackford, and how on their first night in Mexico “we split a bottle of tequila, and went through the whole Beatles catalogue”. How, stuck for nine months on the set ofHeaven’s Gatein Montana, Kris Kristofferson and T Bone Burnett invited a string of musical friends to join them. “And we would just jam all the time. When we weren’t working, we were playing.” Later, when he was offered the lead in Crazy Heart, playing an alcoholic country singer trying to turn his life around, he took the part because Burnett signed on to write the score.View image in fullscreen‘When we weren’t working, we were playing’ … Jeff Bridges on stage with the Abiders at the Lebowski fest in 2014.Photograph: Richard Shotwell/Invision/APIn 2003, Bridges appeared alongside Bob Dylan inMasked and Anonymous. One day the director, Larry Charles, made a suggestion: “Why don’t you and Bob go off and you teach Bob some acting? Go and do some improvisation or something.” Bridges, resistant, eventually agreed. “He was so great to work with,” he says. “He’s such an incredible actor. I mean his presence, right?”Not long afterwards, Bridges was in his trailer, playing guitar, when Dylan appeared in the doorway. “He said ‘Hey man, you want to jam?’” Bridges still looks flabbergasted. I ask if he saw A Complete Unknown. “Yeah, yeah,” he says. “They all did such a great job but …” He seems puzzled by the film’s existence. “You know, you got the real thing …”Lately, Bridges has been spending a little time going through what he calls his “song mine”, wondering what to do with all the tunes he’s written. He is still writing. The songs fill his notebooks and his GarageBand files. Sometimes he sets them down with Ciancia in their band the Abiders. Sometimes he puts them out as rough sketches on his website under the banner Emergent Behaviour. He asks only that if you dig them, you might make a donation to his chosen charities,No Kid Hungryand theAmazon Conservation Team. “Let’s create beautifully together,” the website suggests.“I wrote a song recently about my old buddyJohn Goodwin,” Bridges tells me. He and Goodwin grew up in the same neighbourhood, and Goodwin became a professional songwriter – he provided material for the Crazy Heart soundtrack, which won an Oscar and two Grammys, and for Bridges’ self-titled 2011 album, recorded after the film’s success.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Slow Magic, 1977-1978.Bridges has called his Goodwin tribute song We Know That One. “I don’t know what style you’d call it. It’s my own style, kind of. Let me see if I can find it …” He picks up a tablet, peers at the screen. “All right. Let’s see here. Scrolling, scrolling, music, lyrics, my lyrics, my chorus, lyrics …”In the quiet of his garage, Bridges leans far back in his chair, hands behind his head, and begins to sing. His voice is dusky, and warm and kind, and as he sings, something about him seems to glow. The music is having its way with him, and it is real magic; the magic of trees and flowers.Rock’n’role: a dizzying number of actors want to be pop stars, but which ones are worth listening to?Read more“From the top it looks deep, from the bottom it looks high,Dive into the lake through the reflection of the sky.No need feeling lonely Johnny, on this road heading home,We’re all heading that way, no one’s really alone.Can’t you hear us laughing as we cover our gold with the ashes,Our freedom, yeah we’re ditching our souls.Johnny can’t you see we use hilarity to numb.I think we’re just too damn sensitive Johnny, we couldn’t be that dumb.Do we need some kind of friction?

However, as well as its content, there is also widespread fascination about its technical mastery. Each of its four hour-long episodes was captured in a single take, which required meticulous planning and endless innovations on the part of its crew.Many of the details are already out there, in a series of social media threads that went viral this week. However, last monthI interviewed the key creatives of Adolescence, and they provided me with several backstage stories that I had to leave out because of a lack of space or because I didn’t want to spoil their head-spinning impact. With that in mind, here are a few leftover secrets from my conversations about Adolescence.It all began as a favour for a mateBefore Adolescence, there was Boiling Point, aone-take movie starring Stephen Graham and directed by Philip Barantini. “This was how the whole thing started,” recalled Graham. “Phil said he wanted to be a director. And I was like: ‘OK.’ And then he said: ‘Will you be in my first film?’ And I said: ‘No. Go and show me what you can do. If it’s any good, we’ll have a talk about another one.’” Barantini did just that, and his second idea was the short that became Boiling Point. “I made that short film as a favour for a mate,” Graham said. “So you never know what can happen.”Its young star is mad about swingballGiven the subject matter, production took a lot of care to protect the show’s young star, Owen Cooper. “We had lots and lots of comfort blankets around him,” said Barantini. “There was a child psychologist on set every day and chaperones. He was very, very well looked after. But I think we were more concerned for him than he was. At the end of each take, it’s emotional, and everyone’s gone through this huge rollercoaster, and I’d be like: ‘Owen, are you OK?’ Then he’d be like: ‘Yeah, I’ve got a swingball game to play with my chaperone. Am I good to go?’” In a separate conversation, the show’s writer, Jack Thorne, said: “All he wanted to do was play swingball.”If you look closely, you’ll see the camera operator at one pointView image in fullscreenMagic … the camera was clipped to a drone.Photograph: NetflixIn the final moments of episode two, there is an incredible shot where the camera magically takes off and flies through the sky before landing next to Graham. Here is how Barantini described it: “As Ashley [Walters, as DI Bascombe] leaves in his car, we have a team coming up behind Matt [the cinematographer, Matthew Lewis], who clip the camera to a drone with a hook. Then we fly the drone over the town. In the meantime, Matt legs it into a van. He drives to the end site, catches the drone with two other people, disconnects it and starts walking towards Stephen’s face.” Lewis’s journey had to be split-second accurate and, as Barantini revealed: “If you watch it again, you’ll see his van drive into the car park as the drone comes in to land.”That incredible drone shot was nearly very different …“The original idea was that the drone would just take off, fly over the murder site, and then keep flying,” said Barantini. “That was supposed to be the end of the episode. But then on Wednesday of the shoot week, Toby Bentley, the Netflix executive, said: ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could have Stephen at the end?’”… and it almost didn’t happen at allFilming for each episode took place over a week. “We’d do a take in the morning and a take in the afternoon every day,” said Graham. “On Wednesday, Toby had his idea. It was like: ‘Shit, that only gives us Thursday and Friday to get it right.’ On Thursday, the winds were too high. Friday morning, the winds were OK, but the drone wobbled and fell.” A plan B was hatched to ditch the drone altogether and end on a shot of Graham standing by the school where the bulk of the episode took place. “Friday afternoon was our final chance,” continued Graham. “It’s the last take. Let’s see what happens. Everyone’s on the same page. We’re all locked in. Away it goes. And the final take of all is the take that you see.”‘Unnervingly on-the-nose’: why Adolescence is such powerful TV that it could save livesRead moreThe locations were meticulously researchedBoiling Point was written in the film’s sole location, a restaurant, so Barantini could figure out the camera moves as he worked on the script. But Adolescence has far more moving parts, and worked across multiple locations each episode. “Matt and I would have the map of the area, then plan it from there,” said Barantini. “Before we had any actors come on set, we would have mapped out the whole episode with the cameras.”The bulk of the first episode takes place in a police station. However, this was a set. “We found a location for the station in Pontefract,” said Barantini. But the house that was raided before the arrest was a real house. “So we had to find a house a three-minute drive from the studio. It was quite a lot of planning.”Cooper’s voice almost gave out in episode threeView image in fullscreen‘I was screaming and shouting in every take’ … Owen Cooper as Jamie Miller and Erin Doherty as Briony Ariston, in Adolescence.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe third episode – the two-hander between Cooper and Erin Doherty as his child psychologist – was the first of the series to be shot; a daunting task given that it was also Cooper’s first acting job. Again, multiple takes were filmed. “The one they used was the one where Owen had a bad cough,” said Doherty. “But Phil loved it.” Cooper said: “I was screaming and shouting in every take, twice a day. So you know, my throat was going all crazy. By the final take, I sounded like I’d been smoking for about 30 years.”Adolescence is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaStephen GrahamNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I knew he’d been unwell but he was in great spirits. He wanted to go back to work – Laura and I were like, ‘You can do it! You could work from the trailer.’ He was not, in any way, done. I could see the creative spirit alive in him.”Lynch died after announcing in August 2024 that he had beendiagnosed with emphysemaand in November revealed thatbreathing difficultieswere preventing him from working on sets, saying: “I can hardly walk across a room. It’s like you’re walking around with a plastic bag around your head.”Lynch’s final major work as a film-maker was the 2017 seriesTwin Peaks: The Return, in which both Watts and Dern appeared; he later made a cameo appearance as film director John Ford inSteven Spielberg’s 2022 autobiographical drama The Fabelmans. Watts first worked with him on his 2001 drama Mulholland Drive, after the director discovered her photograph in a pile of actors’ headshots.Watts added: “There’s a lot I could share [about Lynch] but I want to be private about it because of his family.

A riff-heavy swagger of a song that repeats its central mantra, “I am not who I was yesterday”, with increasing force, it’s the culmination of a record that consistently gives credence to this argument. Though the cosmic vibrations and reggae-influenced neo-soul of Aria Wells’s previous material – most recently 2022 mixtapeGreenzone 108– are still on display,Tell Dem It’s Sunnysends her musical palette into new realms while streamlining her lyrics into direct and self-examining terrain.My Neck enlists genre-bending artistWu-Lu, finding a pleasingly ominous middle ground between his lo-fi hip-hop and Wells’s fluidity, before segueing via 90s scratching and grizzled guitars into highlight Create or Destroy 432. Lead single Tardis (Hardest), with its mentions of Babylon, still finds space in the seam of healing and spirituality. But in stripping much of this away, such as on the Morcheeba-esqueOne Foot, with its plaintive questioning (“Is it too late for me?”), Greentea Peng finds even more richness in reality.Watch the video for Tardis (Hardest) by Greentea Peng.Explore more on these topicsMusicThe ObserverR&BHip-hopSoulalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Live, it would be more than understandable to find a musician of that age in a period of slowing down and winding up, cranking out the hits to please old fans.John Caleis absolutely not doing that. An early outing of Captain Hook, a sprawling avant art-rock deep cut from a 1979 live album, sets the tone for an evening that is less about delivering the obvious and more about showcasing the staggering breadth and depth of his songcraft.Sitting almost permanently behind a keyboard, Cale doesn’t give his masterly viola skills an outing tonight, but he sounds in remarkable voice for a man returning after several cancelled shows and four days on doctor-ordered vocal rest. Under a deep red light, Cale and his band play a tense, moody-bordering-on-menacing take on Elvis’s Heartbreak Hotel, although the heavy-handed delivery of The Endless Plain of Fortune fares less well, feeling drained of all its subtlety and tenderness.There’s a double tribute to Cale’s beloved late friend and collaborator Nico, via a groove-locked Moonstruck (Nico’s Song) and a deeply textural, atmospheric and moving version of her 1968 track Frozen Warnings, with the immersive sound of a bow scratching against bass strings filling the room like a dense fog. Cale forgoes the predictable once again and ends on Villa Albani, a song from Caribbean Sunset, an album so out of print it’s not even officially on streaming: he turns it from a piece of strutting funk-rock into an almost psychedelic jam.The house lights go up and masses of bodies are already out of the door when Cale and co return and those unmistakable piano stabs of the Velvet Underground’s I’m Waiting for the Man ring out. As confused audience members pile back in, the band develop it into a wonderfully elongated and grinding version. By the end of its fiery and hypnotic charge, it feels almost unrecognisable from its beginnings. In his ninth decade, Cale remains more interested in forging new paths than retreading the familiar.Explore more on these topicsJohn CaleVelvet UndergroundPop and rockExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

In response to the Korean American’s last outing, 2021’s bouncier, electronic-leaningJubilee,For Melancholy Brunettes…features mid-tempo indie rock warmed by vintage organs, the sigh of steel guitar and other trappings of wistful Americana. It’s all impeccably produced bythe busy Blake Mills, who can call up session stars such asdrummer Jim Keltneror actor Jeff Bridges to duet with Zauner on Men in Bars. Two tracks – Orlando in Love andMega Circuit– point in different directions meanwhile: one to elliptical pop about literature, the other towards sorrowful, barbed looks at modern masculinity.At her best, Zauner can pull the rug out from under a listener. But on a record teeming with big themes – flawed humanity, Greek myth and the brevity of life; one regularly stacked with great lines (“Pissing in the corner of a hotel suite, do you always remember where you are?”, from the excellent Little Girl), all this mellow prettiness doesn’t really do Zauner’s best writing justice.Watch the video for Orlando in Love by Japanese Breakfast.Explore more on these topicsJapanese BreakfastThe ObserverPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

But amid the chaos, YHWH Nailgun (pronounced Yahweh Nailgun) evade easy comparisons with a genuinely fresh and singular sound.Their MVP is drummer Sam Pickard, whose playing is less backbeat than a series of fills repeated again and again: he sends you toppling into each new bar but also keeps you just about upright. Sometimes he fidgets at a high tempo, focusing on drum rims and tight hi-hats, to make indie-disco tracks for salsa-quality dancers; slower numbers such as Tear Pusher have an almost boom-bap hip-hop sensibility. The other half of the rhythm section isn’t bass guitar but synths: Jack Tobias’s playing on Iron Feet andSickle Walksounds like the serendipitously tuneful machinations of a lift shaft or slowing locomotive.On top is astounding singer Zack Borzone, whose lyrics can’t really be made out, but they’re not the point anyway: Borzone is all about pure hoarse expression, or chatter that acts as its own funky percussion instrument. The synths mix almost imperceptibly with guitar from Saguiv Rosenstock to form a shifting murk at the bottom of the mix, but the drumming stays afloat – positively buoyant on the poppiest track here,Castrato Raw (Fullback). Punk-funk has long been a part of New York, but this feels like an evolutionary leap for the style.Explore more on these topicsMusicPunkPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Ariyan A Johnson plays Chantel, a young Black American high schooler who lives with her stressed parents and two kid brothers in Brooklyn (in an era before its gentrification) and rides the subway’s IRT Eastern Parkway line.Chantel is getting great grades in school, and plans to be a doctor, but is addicted to talking back to the teachers and won’t restrain herself, even when she’s sent to the principal’s office. Her relationship with her mother and father is just as fraught – and as far as dating goes, Chantel is not going to sell herself short. And when she finally has sex with her boyfriend Tyrone (Kevin Thigpen), dizzied by his ownership of a Jeep – so she doesn’t have to travel on the IRT – it ends in pregnancy and further disasters. Tyrone gets 500 bucks from his uncle to get her an abortion, but Chantel blows it all in one afternoon on a shopping spree with a friend, in deep denial about what is happening to her, a set piece of black-comic calamity that only intensifies the compassion you feel for her. And when the baby comes, a further existential crisis is in store.The performances are rough and ready, with a loose, improv feel, and Johnson carries the movie with unselfconscious charm and grace. Her fourth wall breaks always feel natural and amusing; there’s a very funny moment when Chantel goofily sneaks out of the school library while singing the theme tune to TV’s Mission: Impossible.Once she becomes pregnant, though, the tone and the meaning of the film pivot to something more serious, and the unformed acting style perhaps begins to look a little more exposed; maybe it works better with comedy, but it still has an honesty and directness. This is a political film about race, sex and class, and it’s a reminder that nothing brings all these political issues into sharper focus than the question of having a baby. It’s a film with the power of youth.Just Another Girl on the IRT is in UK cinemas from 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsRacePregnancyComedyParents and parentingreviewsShareReuse this content"

ThinkAstrid Sonne,ML BuchorTirzah, all of whom have put out records that are simultaneously cosy and jarring. Affectionately, the debut album byRaisa K, has a similar blueprint: simple melodies, unaffected vocals and scrappy production.View image in fullscreenRaisa K: AffectionatelyThe formula makes sense: K is a longstanding member of the pop-not-pop group Good Sad Happy Bad, and the record enlists some of the key players from that world: bandmates Marc Pell andMica Levi(also Tirzah’s producer) plus friend and collaborator Coby Sey. Here K takes the lead, exploring the mundanity of love, trust and tension with unembellished candour. The lyrics are unshowy – the kind of nonchalant sentiment you might jot down in your Notes app.These 12 short tracks are almost entirely laptop-produced, and each one is as wonky as it is soft and hooky, with an industrial crunch looming over a sweet sentiment, or a rickety Midi loop throwing off an otherwise-steady rhythm. Even with their simple mechanics and clear shared scene DNA, K’s songs are striking. Feel It is especially hefty, with its confrontational vocals, clattering percussion and dense low-end frequencies. That weight carries into the more stripped-back interludes, as in the gorgeous, tenderStay. Standouts like As It Seems, or the more peppy Step, are also brilliant in a different way, as moreish as chart music from a parallel universe.The record was apparently written in snatches in K’s schedule: mid-commute, during work breaks, watching her kids at the playground. It’s a small detail that captures the album’s strength: it celebrates a kind of everyday intimacy, one that’s messy and unpredictable.Also out this monthDon Kashewhas been crafting percussive, downtempo rhythms in a corner of the internet for some time. This month, the Zurich-based producer adds to the canon withBellows(Subject to Restrictions), a collection of hypnotic, almost eerie, tracks, where neo-folk woodwind instruments wind around swampy synthesisers. In 2017, Japanese experimental musician and former punkPosuposuOtanirelocated to the mountains of Kanagawa to explore his connection to nature through the medium of throat singing and the Jew’s harp. On his self-titled debut album (33-33), we hear those guttural, gurgling sounds offset against gentle melodies: a strangely relaxing listen. There’s another strong debut fromHorse Vision.Another Life(inadvertent.index) presents the Stockholm duo’s exciting brand of midwestern emo and country music for the online age.

Million Dollar Secret feels shamelessly derivative; arguably without the charm but with a lot more dosh to compensate. Peter Serafinowicz hosts with comic relish, as a sharkish bunch of Americans (most of whom look like models) are locked in a beautiful country pile and forced to play various fiendish games to deduce which of their rivals has a stash of $1m locked in their room.Netflix, from Wednesday 26 MarchDeceptionView image in fullscreenHigh life … Marketta Tikkanen as Linda and Daniel Virtanen as Riku in Deception.Photograph: Janika Kaappola/Channel 4Expect class war, Finnish style in this intriguing drama from Channel 4’s Walter Presents strand. When charismatic and enterprising young criminal Riku plots to infiltrate the elite of society, he has robbery and revenge in mind. However, his methods are slightly too successful and, before long, he’s fallen in love with an heiress, started to enjoy the trappings of wealth and privilege, and generally got a taste for the high life. However, Riku isn’t working alone and soon his underworld associates are pressuring him to stick to the original plan.Channel 4, from Friday 28 MarchNumber One on the Call SheetView image in fullscreenUndeniable progress … Angela Bassett in Number One on the Call Sheet.Photograph: Apple TVThe rise of Black actors in Hollywood has been a series of victories won over generations.

The volcanic field has been active for more than 80,000 years. It is dotted with craters, lakes and fumaroles as well as roads, factories and the homes of more than 600,000 peopleByAlessandro GandolfiFri 21 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTShareIn the square in Monterusciello, a few kilometres from Pozzuoli, 12-year-old Angelo Di Roberto climbed into the civil defence bus with his grandfather. “None of my schoolmates wanted to come, but I wanted to” he said. “It seemed like the right thing to do.”He was right. It was important. The authorities were simulating a large-scale evacuation, the kind they would have to carry out in the event of a volcanic eruption in the seismically activeCampi Flegreior Phlegraean Fields near the southern Italian city of Naples.Everyone in the sprawling volcanic area hopes it will never happen, but the signs are ominous.View image in fullscreenDuring an exercise to simulate an evacuation in the event of a volcanic eruption in the Phlegraean Fields, Angelo Di Roberto, 70, his nephew of the same name, 12, and Alessandro Celardo, 29, all from Monterusciello, arrive at Naples central station, from where in theory they should depart for Milan.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSince January 2024, the land in certain parts of the Phlegraean Fields has risen by about 20 centimetres (eight inches) as a result of a phenomenon called bradyseism, the gradual uplift or lowering of part of the Earth’s surface caused by the filling or emptying of an undergroundmagma chamberor hydrothermal activity, particularly in volcaniccalderas.Earthquakes continue to be recorded almost every day. There were 6,066 in 2023 and as many as 6,740 in 2024. The seismic swarm continues in 2025, generating anxiety and fear that leads many people to spend nights in their cars or outdoors. The most violent earthquake to hit the area for four decades shook buildings in and around Naples earlier this month.View image in fullscreenEvery year 700,000 tourists climb the great cone of Vesuvius to admire one of the most beautiful gulfs in the world. But if you stretch your gaze westwards, beyond Fuorigrotta, you catch a glimpse of other small, almost completely unknown volcanoes: these are the Phlegraean Fields, an enormous caldera which is home to more than 600,000 people.View image in fullscreenThe Monte Nuovo crater with the Naples bypass on the left and the town of Pozzuoli on the right.

Here the walls are covered with yellowish sulphurous incrustations that are slowly but surely breaking through the walls and floor.“Get out quickly because the carbon dioxide levels are very high and could be harmful,” Rosario shouts.View image in fullscreenHomes and farmland in the Cigliano craters in the heart of the Phlegraean Fields.Solfatara, with its white rocks and perennial vapours, is an evocative place and a destination for tourists. But it is also fraught with danger. The area was closed in 2017 after a child and his parents fell into a cavity and died.View image in fullscreenEvening training on a football pitch a few dozen metres from Solfatara.The true morphology of this crater-rich land can only really be grasped from above. A bird’s eye view reveals that those circles disguised as hills and covered with dwellings are, in fact, extinct volcanoes.View image in fullscreenThe Temple of Serapis or Macellum was in reality a Roman public market. Today it has become a symbol of bradyseism because sometimes it is completely dry and at other times it is flooded with seawater.View image in fullscreenEvacuees in Pozzuoli in 1983 when earthquakes and bradyseism triggered an emergency. The photo is kept at the headquarters of the cultural association which collects photographs, newspaper clippings, books and other material on the Phlegraean Fields and the phenomenon of bradyseism.Bradyseism, literally “slow movement”, continues to raise the ground across the Phlegraean Fields. It raised Pozzuoli by two metres in the 1980s, leading to the evacuation of 40,000 people from the Rione Terra neighbourhood.Bradyseism has always existed in these parts. On the Roman columns of the Temple of Serapis you can still see the holes made by stone-eroding organisms, created when the ground subsided about 10 metres in the following centuries. For a long time they were submerged in sea water.View image in fullscreenMauro Di Vito (left), the director of INGV’s Vesuvius observatory, in the monitoring room, where signals collected from the Vesuvius, Phlegraean Fields, Ischia and Stromboli volcanoes converge.“The ground keeps breaking and deforming,” Mauro Di Vito, the director of INGV’s Vesuvius observatory, explained. “And the accumulation of stress generates earthquakes. But this is an expected phenomenon and it is very likely that earthquakes will continue. We will all have to get used to reacting in a positive way, without panicking. We scientists cannot exclude anything. Our job is to monitor and measure the parameters.”The Phlegraean Fields are among the most monitored volcanoes in the world, designed to detect the smallest sign of an awakening that will happen sooner or later. There is a contingency plan for a mass evacuation, but will it ever work? If the supervolcano really were to erupt, would it leave anyone behind?View image in fullscreenTwo women enter the swimming pool at the Terme Vesuviana spa in Naples. The mineral springs connected to Vesuvius have been exploited for their health benefits since Roman times.View image in fullscreenMen sunbathe on the public beach in Torre Annunziata. The black volcanic sand is renowned for its healing properties.What we do know is that past eruptions have made the land of the Gulf of Naples some of the most fertile in the world. Think of Vesuvian apricots, figs and cherries, the Piennolo tomato and native grape varieties such as Piedirosso and Falanghina. They have also generated thermal emissions that have been exploited for centuries and provided precious yellow ash stone known as tuff, with which Campania’s towns were built. This is maybe why, despite being one of the most dangerous lands in the world, the area between the Phlegraean Fields and Vesuvius is also one of the most populous.View image in fullscreenPeople dance, sing and play traditional instruments at the summit of Mount Somma on the morning of 3 May during a celebration dedicated to the volcano when Christian rites mix with pagan tradition.View image in fullscreenCertainly, those who live in the area establish a visceral bond with the volcano built on fear and respect. To protect themselves from the risks, the inhabitants have always relied on a belief in divine benevolence, naming not only churches and festivals after local Madonnas and saints, but also rituals. One is dedicated to the melting of the blood of San Gennaro, which for centuries has been thought by some to ward off magma. The volcano has featured in art, poetry, popular song and everyday festive life. It has moulded the fatalistic character of those who live here, and who know that, at any moment, everything could end.View image in fullscreenA tour of underground Naples, a dense network of tunnels, aqueducts and passages dug into the volcanic rock.There are many problems in the area. There is unemployment, widespread crime, illegal waste disposal and reckless urban planning that fuels landslides and floods with devastating consequences.Amid all this, the possibility of an eruption is secondary, and a recent survey revealed that for the population of the Phlegraean Fields the perception of risk is low.View image in fullscreenA family relaxes on the shores of Lake Fusaro, born of a sulphurous volcanic formation in Pozzuoli.View image in fullscreenArchitect Anna Savarese from Legambiente notes the narrow underpass through which the autorities have identified an escape route in the event of a volcanic eruption in Pozzuoli. ‘Not even an ambulance would pass through it, it would block all the traffic,’ she says.Those who live in the Pozzuoli area forget that although they do not have a conical mountain looming over them, what they have under their feet is a time bomb. And no one really knows when it will explode.Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayItalyVolcanoesEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It serves modern European food and caters to the kind of audience who follow restaurant news in much the same way as others follow opera gossip or Formula One, and they’ll book out of sheer curiosity to experience this all-new, deeply chilled affair fromIsaac McHale, chef/owner of the two Michelin-starredClove Clubnearby.We were led to believe that Bar Valette would not be at all like that well-known destination-dining spot. Not as formal. More come as you are. Clapshot croquettes (that’s mashed swede and potato, by the way), chicken in a basket, fancy fish with spuds, flan for pudding. The prices, however, aren’t informal at all and are very much still wearing tuxes, cummerbunds and spats. Small plates from £16 and snacks at £11. Want spuds with that? That’ll be £9, please.View image in fullscreenBar Valette’s clapshot croquettes: ‘That’s mashed swede and potato, by the way.’Watching the old guard ofenfants terriblesnoughties Michelin chefs do “informal” is all rather fascinating. These people flew in the face of formality over a decade ago, chipping away at all the stuffiness and forlock-tugging, and making dinner at the Ritz seem like a prison sentence. Now those same chefs are opening places like Bar Valette to show us how to be truly relaxed while paying £11 for a bowl of kale.But, guys, how much more chilled can we get? While the Clove Club is in the rather grand Shoreditch town hall, Bar Valette is just a room overlooking a busy east London bus route. A glass-fronted room with brick walls painted white, a blackboard for wines and specials, and jars of chickpeas and white asparagus used as decor. We began with Vichy Catalan, at £6.50 per bottle, but, spotting that I was a non-drinker, they kindly offered to make me a non-alcoholic spritz with a shot ofSylva Padauktopped with soda. I notice only later that they charged me £18.50 plus service for the privilege.View image in fullscreenBar Valette’s buttermilk fried chicken on a bed of pine is ‘a nod to the chef’s rabble-rousing era’ at the Clove Club in the early 2010s.Two apparently complimentary devilled crab tarts appear – pretty unmemorable, but, hey, a gift … and added to the bill at £12. Fried boned chicken – reportedly bathed in buttermilk, though that might just be conjecture – is £14 and, in a nod to the Clove Club’s rabble-rousing era, comes in a basket and on a bed of pine branches. Fried Torbay prawns turn up, shell on and inviting us to crunch our way through their sweet tails and heads. For £27. A basket of perfectly nice swiss chard and ricotta barbajuans keep us happy while we chat, even though they’re £11. Gosh, we’ve spent some money so far at this draughty table near the door.For mains,fabada Asturianaarrives – a sticky pork and bean stew featuring blood sausage and belly pork – and then something curious happens: there is a lump of hard plastic in it, which my guest, mistaking it for some pork offcut or other, initially tries to eat before retrieving it from his mouth. “Oh God!” I mutter. “This will cause chaos.” That’s because this is an expensive restaurant, and while they may not be serious about, say, wallpaper, errors of this kind generally lead to kitchen staff offering to fall on their swords. So I brace for the rumpus. “Oh, I am sorry,” our server says, and whisks the offending item off to the kitchen. We wait. But no further word or explanation is forthcoming, and the stew stays on the bill.View image in fullscreenBar Valette’s lamb chops with spicy mayo come in at £11 each.Alert, alert: in the smart, cool dining stakes, I think we may have hit Peak Relaxed Mode. No sane diner pines for the days of the special-occasion restaurant, where servers scowled while you fumbled over the 10 terrifying cutlery options. But the etiquette used to be that if a stew cost £26, someone would care if it contained miscellaneous plastic packaging. Two plump lamb chops “with spicy mayo” are up next, and at £11 a pop. Then some red mullet fillets with a green olive emulsion for – reach for your smelling salts here – £44. One large potato, sliced up and sauteed in duck fat, was £9. A lump of Stichelton with two figs was another £14. By this stage, we are £249 poorer for this experience.View image in fullscreenBar Valette’s potato side, featuring ‘one large potato, sliced up and sauteed in duck fat’, costs all of £9.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The GuardianWe exit, feeling a bit befuddled and glancing around for anyone who might care to say good bye, but Bar Valette is not the sort of place where people stand on ceremony. “Is the white asparagus in those decorative jars the same white asparagus that they have on the menu for £16?” my guest wondered. “If so, that’s fairly brass-necked.” It’s hard to say, but I do know that everything is informal here except the price.Bar Valette28–30 Kingsland Road, London E2, 020-3976 0076.

In their simplest form, you need only three ingredients (Rice Krispies, butter and marshmallows), but I’ve given them a sweet and salty twist by adding a good dollop of miso and some caramel-like brown butter, which makes them even more addictive.Miso and brown butter Rice Krispies barsPrep5 minCook15 minSet30 minServes9175gRiceKrispies120g unsalted butter240g white marshmallows50g white misoA pinch of saltLine a 20cm x 20cm square tin with baking paper, leaving enough overhang to help you pull the bars out later.
