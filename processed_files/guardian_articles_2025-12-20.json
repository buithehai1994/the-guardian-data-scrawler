There are reports that she is in advanced talks to host her own chatshow.At least there’s one thing we can all agree on: three cheers for Claudia Winkleman | Polly HudsonRead moreThere have been many runners and riders.Holly Willoughby, Fleur East and Emma Willis are among names who have been floated since the news was announced but, earlier this week, Ladbrokes suspended betting on replacements after Zoe Ball announced she was stepping down from her BBC Radio 2 show. Industry experts are also considering her as the new host, with Boyd Hilton, the entertainment director at Heat magazine, calling her a “good bet”.The broadcaster is probably looking for another duo to take the mantle, with the Sun reporting those in the running are being put through an in-studio chemistry test. So, who could take the Strictly helm?View image in fullscreenSpeculation around Zoe Ball’s possible takeover rose after she announced she was leaving her Radio 2 role.Photograph: Ian West/PAZoe BallBall, 55, is hardly a Strictly novice. She competed in the show in 2005, coming third with her dancing partner, Ian Waite. In 2011, she replaced Winkleman as the host of Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two, presenting the companion show until 2021. “She has been connected to the show before and is clearly a fan of it. She is just a brilliant presenter,” said Hilton, adding that he could see Rylan Clark “alongside her, doing the Claudia job”.Speculation that Ball could take on the Strictly mantle intensified last week after she announced live on air that she would step down from her BBC Radio 2 Saturday show. While the news has led to some theorising about a Strictly takeover, Ball, who is one of the BBC’s highest-paid stars, might just want some downtime. Last year, she announced that she was stepping down from her BBC Radio 2 breakfast show after six years to “focus on family”.View image in fullscreenAlan Carr’s star rose after his The Celebrity Traitors victory. But does he have the time?Photograph: Ian West/PAAlan CarrThe Chatty Man made the nation laugh and, in the end, cry with his plodding double-bluffs on Celebrity Traitors. After Carr, 49, managed to outwit Stephen Fry, David Olusoga and Nick Mohammed, he now finds himself a sudden and unexpected frontrunner for one of TV’s most prestigious hosting gigs. He addressed the mounting speculation earlier this week. “I know my name’s been bandied about,” he told the Daily Mail. “It’s nice to be in the running, but no one approached me.” Hilton said Carr would “be amazing but I just don’t think he needs it right now” because, after his Celebrity Traitors win, “he’s almost too big for it now, he could do anything he wants. Does he really need a weekly live TV gig. It’s a stressful thing.”Carr also announced a 2027 tour on Wednesday, which could knock him out of the running because, as one Strictly insider told the Daily Mail: “Saturdays are sacrosanct to the Strictly team, and as brilliant as Alan is, they won’t be able to accommodate a change.”View image in fullscreenAlison Hammond has become one of the country’s most beloved TV presenters.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/ShutterstockAlison HammondHammond, 50, who has had an astonishing rise from Big Brother contestant to one of the nation’s most widely known and well-regarded presenters, is in pole position to step into one of TV’s top jobs. Hammond is no stranger to the ballroom herself, having competed in the 10th series in 2014. ITV may be catching wind of the growing momentum behind one of its star presenters. Hammond signed a new contract with the broadcaster this week, where she will continue her hosting duties on This Morning – though, in theory, she could still present the Saturday primetime hit as This Morning does not air at weekends.Hilton said Hammond “would be amazing and also someone who I think the BBC would be thrilled to get”, but questioned whether she could fit the show into her schedule. Alongside This Morning, Hammond co-hosts The Great British Bake Off and Alison Hammond: For the Love of Dogs. “I just wonder whether she would have the time,” he said.View image in fullscreenBradley Walsh presents the daytime TV hit gameshow The Chase.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockBradley WalshWalsh, 65, has been mooted as a potential Strictly successor. He is a studio formats veteran who has presented several gameshows, including the ITV daytime hit The Chase. That show is filmed next door to Strictly, so Walsh has probably already rubbed shoulders with the dancing show’s crew. The Sunreportedthat Walsh had done a chemistry test with Alex Jones. He was pressed about this on Friday by Denise Welch on The Scott Mills Breakfast Show. When Welch asked Walsh if this was true, he dodged the question, saying: “I think it’s a big old commitment. I really do. It’s a great gig. It’s a great show.”Hilton said Walsh was “the closest to Bruce Forsyth in the sense of an old-school comedian doing it”, but questioned whether he really wanted the job. “He’s very busy. It doesn’t feel like it’s the kind of show that he would immediately go: ‘Yeah, I definitely want to do that.’ But I may be wrong,” said Hilton.View image in fullscreenHolly Willoughby is one TV’s best-known presenters.Photograph: Kieron McCarron/ITV/Rex/ShutterstockHolly WilloughbyWilloughby, 44, was one of TV’s best-known presenters, dominating ITV’s schedule for the past two decades. But the former This Morning host took astep backfrom the limelight in 2023 after a former security guard was arrested over a foiled plot to kidnap, rape and murder her.She has made a slow return to our TV screens but landing the Strictly job would plant her back in the big league. Hilton said: “The BBC would be quite excited about her. She’s probably the biggest name who could do a great job.” He added that she was “such box office because she’s a big star. I wouldn’t be surprised if they went for her.”Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingBBCEntertainment TVReality TVTelevisionClaudia WinklemanBradley WalshfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I saw how one community came out on topJason OkundayeA social housing victory at the ‘luxury’ Battersea power station development shows the power of grassroots politics – and holds a lesson for all of our citiesSat 20 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 20 Dec 2025 12.28 ESTShareWhat happens when international capital arrives on your doorstep and threatens to devour your home? The residents of the housing estates surrounding Battersea power station in London, including the Patmore where I was raised, faced that prospect when, in 2012, a consortium ofMalaysian investorsbought the derelict power station, decommissioned since 1983, for £400m.Two years earlier, David Cameron had launched the Conservative manifesto in the ruined power station. He promised to increase foreign investment into the UK, and so the international investors came and bought the thing and much more. Over the years, Battersea and the adjacent Nine Elms area was refashioned as a playground for oligarchs and other international elites. The US embassy arrived, aworld-first glass sky poolwas commissioned, and whenBattersea power stationshopping centre opened in 2022, it came with Rolex and Cartier stores, luxury private members’ clubs and apartments with multimillion-pound price tags.The whole assembly looks like a Dubai waterfront, and forlong-term localsa fear emerged of being forcibly displaced as occurred inElephant and CastleandStratford. In these areas of London, regeneration had become a byword for the social cleansing of working-class communities and their replacement by affluent residents.Yet a quiet victory has occurred that shows how communities can bargain with developers. Last month, Battersea power stationannouncedthat it would be working in partnership with Wandsworth council to build 203 council homes as part of the development’s 17-hectare (42-acre) master plan.This win is a genuinely radical vision of what local government can achieve. And it matters because it is a radical assertion that mixed-income communities should continue to exist, and be actively facilitated, in the centre of London. Mixed communities have increasingly come under attack as ire against the housing crisis is directed at social housing tenants occupying central London locations, particularly if the household is born overseas. As Henry Hillwrote in UnHerd: “Even without the immigration angle, it was only a matter of time before voters noticed that broad swathes of central London and other prime locations are currently used to house others at taxpayers’ expense.”This is a particularly personal grievance for me. I grew up in this patch of Battersea when it was seen as a relic of industrial decline, a sad and neglected avatar of inner-city roughness. Yet now that it’s been put on the map, neoliberals and cynics of state support would have it that these communities and families should uproot their foundations to make way for those with deeper pockets.It is worth considering how Wandsworth council fought back against this tide. In 2017, the then Conservative-run council approved areductionin the provision of “affordable” homes to be built on the site from its own 33% target at the time of the 2010 planning application to only 9%.View image in fullscreenShae Clarke, left, of Patmore youth group, with the council development team. Aydin Dikerdem, cabinet member for housing, is in the centre.In 2022, Labour ended the 44-year Conservative-majority control of Wandsworth. With this came the appointment of the socialist councillor Aydin Dikerdem. “As a local representative, I thought the local government should be acting almost like a trade unionist on behalf of the residents,” Dikerdem tells me. Developers went from playing on easy mode with neoliberal conservatives to having to wrangle with municipal socialism. Shunning champagne and freebies, Wandsworth Labour councillors controversiallyboycotted the Battersea power station launchover the low levels of social housing.The council housing agreement was won after robust negotiations, aided by the Greater London authority, which included the council ending all collaborations until the housing question was addressed. Eventually a deal was brokered, because even if the primary pursuit is profit, developers still want to be seen to be building and facilitating “a vibrant and friendly community”, as is said in one of thebrochures.The neighbouring Embassy Gardens in Nine Elms, with itssky pool and “poor doors”, had already been viewed as an almost dystopian symbol of the UK’s grossest inequalities and prioritisation of global elites, and example of how not to do a local development.Community simply cannot exist without the presence of existing long-term residents. I am reminded of that whenever I pass the roadside memorial for Patmore estate legend and footballing talent Theo Porteous, who wasstabbed to death in 2023in an unprovoked and senseless attack by a man not from the area. When he died, my entire estate poured out to pay tribute, light candles and lay flowers. There was a strong sense that the community had lost someone precious. It was an expression of familiarity and local love that is built up over years and generations, and cannot be replicated by brownfield developments.A leaked memo, a Maga-style hat and a trail of broken pledges – it’s Labour’s great housing betrayal | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreThe council’s efforts go further than the power station. This year, it has built 57 new council homes for rent on the Patmore, an estate not far from the power station. There are also new outdoor play spaces, including a multi-games area named in honour of Theo. It has been beautiful seeing new families and children move to the estate and have a better start in life, as had been the case for mine 27 years ago.I hope that future residents of the power station development will be able to enjoy their new homes, playground and all the other amenities that will surely come. If you have lived in an area all your life, through its roughest periods, why should you not feel the benefits when development turns up at your door?I wish this could be rolled out across London, but the unilateralslashing of affordable housing quotasfrom 35% to 20% in the capital proposed by the housing secretary, Steve Reed, could scupper any future wins for local councils. The policy has been proposed as a way to get shovels in the ground and stimulate the economy. However, this is short-termist. As Dikerdem tells me, “when the market slows down (as the housing market has) and building costs go up and developers are struggling, it’s precisely the moment when the state should step in”. That could allow local government to stimulate housing demand, provide workers and cover construction costs, so long as certain social obligations are met or increased.If government could take a leaf out of Wandsworth’s book and stand up to developers, rather than rolling out the red carpet, then perhaps local communities would be all the richer for it.Jason Okundaye is an assistant opinion editor at the Guardian and the author ofRevolutionary ActsExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionHousingLocal governmentLondonSteve ReedLabourCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

Thomas Massie and I are exploring all options,” he also said, among them possible impeachment of justice department officials, finding them in contempt ofCongress.Trickle release of Epstein files on a Friday signals move to bury Trump tiesRead moreKhanna also floated the possibility of “referring for prosecution those who are obstructing justice”.“Unfortunately, today’s document release by @AGPamBondi and @DAGToddBlanche grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago. @RepRoKhannais correct,” Massie, a Kentucky member of Congress and co-author of this legislation,saidon X.“A future [justice department] could convict the current AG and others because the Epstein Files Transparency Act is not like a Congressional Subpoena which expires at the end of each Congress,” Massiesaidat another point.Frustrations mounted on Saturday as the justice department released some new files, including transcripts, while also removing more than a dozen others from its website related to Epstein, with no explanation.At least 16 files disappeared from the department’s public webpage, according to an Associated Press tally. The documents included images of paintings depicting nude women, and one showing a series of photographs along a credenza and in drawers. In that image, inside a drawer among other photos, is a photograph of Trump, alongside Epstein, Melania Trump and Epstein’s longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell.The unexplained missing files have fueled speculation about what was taken down and why the public was not notified. Democrats on the House oversight committee pointed to the missing image featuring a Trump photoin a post on X, writing: “What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.”The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, also called out the apparent removal of the photo of Trump,calling the handlingof the Epstein files release possibly “one of the biggest cover ups in American history”.Trump’s justice department was required to release all investigative files involving the late financier by 19 December under theEpstein Files Transparency Act. The legislation does allow for records to be withheld or redacted if their disclosure would imperil present criminal investigations, threaten national security or identify Epstein’s victims – but otherwise it mandates disclosure of everything else.The department’s initial disclosure on Friday afternoon, and subsequent releases throughout the night, did not abide by this requirement. Justice officials recognized as much on Friday morning, pre-empting this apparent slow walk on television. Todd Blanche, Trump’s former criminal defense lawyer turned deputy attorney general, said the justice department would not release all its files on Friday.“I expect we’re going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms, photographs and other materials associated with all of the investigations into Mr Epstein,” Blanche said during a Fox Newsinterview.“I expect that we’re going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,” Blanche also said. “There’s a lot of eyes looking at these and we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials we are producing, that we are protecting every single victim.”New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among the bipartisan chorus of lawmakers slamming Trump’s justice department, including the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the FBI director, Kash Patel, for the documents’ lackluster rollout.“Now the coverup is out in the open. This is far from over. Everyone involved will have to answer for this,” Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat,said on Xon Friday. “Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, whole admin. Protecting a bunch of rapists and pedophiles because they have money, power, and connections. Bondi should resign tonight.”Fellow Democratic congressman Robert Garcia voiced similar sentiments.“The [justice department] is breaking the law by not releasing the full Epstein files. This is not transparency. This is just more coverup by Donald Trump and Pam Bondi. They need to release all the files, NOW,” the Democratic oversight committee leadersaidon X.“The [justice department] has had months and hundreds of agents to put these files together, and yet entire documents are redacted – from the first word to the last. What are they hiding? The American public deserves transparency. Release all the files now!” he alsocommented.In ajoint statementfrom House oversight committee Democrats, Garcia and Jamie Raskin said: “Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law as they continue covering up the facts and the evidence about Jeffrey Epstein’s decades-long, billion-dollar, international sex trafficking ring …“We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law,” the statement added.The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer,saidthe release violated both “the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law”.“Senate Democrats are working to assess the documents that have been released to determine what actions must be taken to hold theTrump administrationaccountable,” Schumer also said. “We will pursue every option to make sure the truth comes out.”Trump’s justice department has gone on the defensive over this criticism, insisting on social media that authorities are complying with the law. A justice department account on X pointed to the many photos of Bill Clinton released in the tranche, claiming their disclosure bolstered claims of accountability. (Clinton has denied wrongdoing related to Epstein and expressed regret for previously associating with him.)“To set the record straight: No Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) were redacted from today’s released Epstein documents. All references to PEPs were disclosed in full. Do you not see Clinton’s face??” a justice department media relations accountsaidon X.The Associated Press and Marina Dunbar contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressUS politicsShareReuse this content"

But several legal experts disagreed.Raj Chada, a partner at Hodge, Jones & Allen and a leading criminal lawyer with expertise in human rights and protest, said: “There is no reference to cumulative disruption in the original [legislation]. The regulations that introduced this concept were quashed in May 2025, so I fail to see how this can still be the approach taken by police. There is no legal basis for this whatsoever.”The Network forPoliceMonitoring (Netpol) said the revelations showed the “ongoing crackdown on protest” had reached an “alarming point” whereby the Met allegedly appeared not to care if it was acting within the law.Campaigns coordinator Kevin Blowe said: “The problem is zero police accountability and transparency in the use of their powers to restrict or limit protests.”In October, the home secretaryannounced plans to reintroduce the powerto consider cumulative impactin toughened form, through the crime and policing bill currently passing through parliament.Nick Glynn, a retired senior officer who spent more than 30 years with Leicestershire police, said: “The police have too many protest powers already and they definitely don’t need any more. If they are provided with them they not only use them [but] as in this case, they stretch them. They go beyond what was intended.”He added: “The right to protest is sacrosanct and more stifling of protest makes democracy worth less.”Regulations to put curbs on protests if their “cumulative” impact met the threshold of causing “serious disruption to the life of the community”were quashed on 2 May 2025, after a legal challenge by the human rights group Liberty.Documents obtained under freedom of information laws show that on 7 May, five days after the regulations were quashed, the Met police banned a Jewish pro-Palestine group from holding its weekly protest in Swiss Cottage, northLondon, citing the cumulative impact on the local Jewish community. Lawyers for the group, known as the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network (IJAN), say the ban has been renewed every week since then.In November, the Met forced the Palestine Coalition to change the route of its march at three days’ notice, citing the cumulative impact on businesses during the Black Friday retail weekend. This happened even though the route had not been used for more than a year, according to the organisers.Ben Jamal, the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, recalled being told by the deputy assistant commissioner Alison Heydari that her decision on whether to impose conditions, shifting the starting point by about half a mile, “will be purely around the cumulative effect of your protests”.She reportedly said: “This is not just about Saturday’s protest but it’s a combination of all the impacts of all the processions so far,” referencing “serious disruption” to the business community.“You’ve used this route in November 2024, and you’ve used it a few times before then as well,” she reportedly added. “So there is an impact.”Jamal said the Met’s repeated imposition of conditions caused “immense disruption” and was a “demobiliser”, creating confusion over starting points which “had led to people being harassed” by officers who accused them of breaching protest conditions.A Met spokesperson said: “The outcome of the judicial review does not prevent senior officers from considering the cumulative impact of protest on the life of communities.“To determine the extent of disruption that may result from a particular protest, it is of course important to consider the circumstances in which that protest is to be held, including any existing disruption an affected community is already experiencing.“We recognise the importance of the right to protest. We also recognise our responsibility to use our powers to ensure that protest does not result in serious disorder or serious disruption. We use those powers lawfully and will continue to do so.”The Home Office said “the discretion to consider cumulative disruption” was implied within the Public Order Act 1986 and that its forthcoming amendment would make it an “explicit requirement”.Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policePoliceProtestLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Its scale and the devastation caused to so many families cannot be over-estimated, as was laid bare in Liz Sayce’s report. Any suggestion that this is anything other than a systemic failure over a number of years is unacceptable.”Yeandle, who sat on the advisory panel for the government-commissioned Sayce review, said that while ministers initially claimed to have accepted “the vast majority” of the report’s 40 recommendations, 13 had been only partially accepted and two were rejected.“Sayce calls for swift action on longstanding issues, some of which the DWP should have resolved long ago,” Yeandle said, adding that she was speaking in a personal capacity.She said: “The official response and internal DWP memo published last weekend don’t give me much confidence that senior officials will now address these with the urgency and commitment needed.”Ministers last monthvowed to fixthe systemic failings after a Guardian investigation exposed how scores of vulnerable families had been left with huge debts and hundreds with criminal convictions for fraud.Peter Schofield, the DWP’s most senior civil servant, is facing scrutiny for in effect overseeing the crisis despite promising MPs in 2019 that it would be fixed. He told MPs on the public accounts committee earlier this month: “I am sorry for all of those who are affected by this, but I am going to sort it out.”Those who care for loved ones for at least 35 hours a week are entitled to £83.30 a week in carer’s allowance, provided their weekly earnings do not exceed £196. But if carers exceed this limit, even by as little as 1p, they must repay the entire week’s allowance.The draconian nature of the rules is compounded by the DWP’s failure to alert unpaid carers when they have overstepped the earnings limit, despite the department having access to near real-time data.As a result, hundreds of thousands of peopleunwittingly built up huge debts– sometimes of more than £20,000 – which the DWP often seeks to recover years later, threatening carers with criminal prosecution if they do not pay.Ministers last month pledged about £75m to fix the scandal and ordered about 200,000 historical cases to be reassessed. The DWP says about 26,000 carers are likely to have debts cancelled or reduced, although experts believe this figure should be far higher.Yeandle said the failures had put vulnerable families under “intolerable strain”.She said: “To rebuild trust, government and the DWP should issue an unreserved apology for this. It’s left a terrible enduring legacy for some carers, and in these cases I think government should consider compensation. Some debts built up over long periods, with carers not made aware of this by the DWP until years had passed.”Yeandle, the former director of the Centre for Care at the University of Sheffield, said the government’s initial response to the Sayce review “looked promising”, but she had lost confidence in the department’s commitment following the Couling controversy and its refusal to fully accept several key recommendations.One recommendation only partially accepted by the DWP was to issue clearer guidance on what expenses carers can be allowed under the rules.Katy Styles, of We Care Campaign, said she believed Couling should resign and said it was difficult to have confidence in Schofield, the DWP’s permanent secretary.“Systemic failings aren’t abstract policy problems,” she said. “They translate into stress and financial insecurity. It’s a constant battle to be believed by a department that holds immense power over people’s lives.”The DWP’s response to the failings was crucial, she said, because for carers it was about “really being listened to and protected from further failure”.She added: “Ministers need to ask whether a culture that has repeatedly minimised these concerns can change itself, or whether clear political leadership is required to impose the cultural and leadership change that the victims of this scandal so deserve.”Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, told the BBC’s Laura Kuennsberg programme earlier this month that Couling’s comments were “not the position” of the DWP and said the carer’s allowance issue was a”longstanding problem that was ignored by the previous government”.A DWP spokesperson said: “We inherited a system that let carers down – but we’re taking decisive action to put things right and rebuild trust, accepting the vast majority of the Sayce’s review recommendations.“We’re already making changes, hiring extra staff to stop carers building up large debts, updating internal guidance, and making sure letters clearly explain what changes carers need to report.“And we will continue putting things right by reassessing affected cases, and potentially reducing, cancelling or refunding debts for tens of thousands of carers, as well as working to modernise the benefit so this doesn’t happen again.”Explore more on these topicsCarersCarer's allowance crisisCivil serviceBenefitsSocial careWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

The assistants can be paid salaries of up to £49,282, excluding national insurance and pension contributions.The Liberal Democrat group leader, Antony Hook, accused Reform of “wanting to spend public money on a political apparatchik to tell them what to do”.He said: “Kent county council is in a worsening financial state under Reform with the projected overspend now at £46m and rising.“The person mentioned appears to have a record of concerning views such as endorsing the racist Enoch Powell who spoke against the idea people of different races living happily together in Britain. The person named has evidently also said we should work with Russia.”A Reform UK Kent spokesperson said: “Providing professional political support to its leadership is entirely proportionate, and the role will be cost neutral.“Kent county council’s budget is double that of the Treasury department, which has eight political advisers, and larger than the Department for Business and Trade, who employ four political advisers, despite both already employing armies of civil servants.“Political assistants are a normal and established part of local government. Many councils, including the Lib Dem-controlled Gloucestershire county council, have allocated budgets for these roles.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKKentLocal governmentShareReuse this content"

She was accompanied by a retired SpaceX executive also born in Germany, Hans Koenigsmann, who helped organize and, along with Blue Origin, sponsored her trip. Their ticket prices were not divulged.An ecstatic Benthaus said she laughed all the way up – the capsule soared more than 65 miles (105km) – and tried to turn upside down once in space.Nasa loses contact with spacecraft orbiting Mars for more than a decadeRead more“It was the coolest experience,” she said shortly after landing.The 10-minute space-skimming flight required only minor adjustments to accommodate Benthaus, according to the company. That’s because the autonomous New Shepard capsule was designed with accessibility in mind, “making it more accessible to a wider range of people than traditional spaceflight”, said Blue Origin’s Jake Mills, an engineer who trained the crew and assisted them on launch day.Among Blue Origin’s previous space tourists: those with limited mobility and impaired sight or hearing, and a pair of 90-year-olds.For Benthaus, Blue Origin added a patient transfer board so she could scoot between the capsule’s hatch and her seat. The recovery team also unrolled a carpet on the desert floor after touchdown, providing immediate access to her wheelchair, which she left behind at liftoff. She practiced in advance, with Koenigsmann taking part with the design and testing. An elevator was already in place at the launch pad to ascend the seven stories to the capsule perched atop the rocket.Benthaus, 33, part of the EuropeanSpaceAgency’s graduate trainee program in the Netherlands, experienced snippets of weightlessness during a parabolic airplane flight out of Houston in 2022. Less than two years later, she took part in a two-week simulated space mission in Poland.“I never really thought that going on a spaceflight would be a real option for me because even as like a super healthy person, it’s like so competitive, right?” she told the Associated Press ahead of the flight.Her accident dashed whatever hope she had. “There is like no history of people with disabilities flying to space,” she said.When Koenigsmann approached her last year about the possibility of flying on Blue Origin and experiencing more than three minutes of weightlessness on a space hop, Benthaus thought there might be a misunderstanding. But there wasn’t, and she immediately signed on.It’s a private mission for Benthaus with no involvement by the European Space Agency (ESA),which this year clearedreserve astronaut John McFall, an amputee, for a future flight to the International Space Station. The former British Paralympian lost his right leg in a motorcycle accident when he was a teenager.An injured spinal cord means Benthaus can’t walk at all, unlike McFall, who uses a prosthetic leg and could evacuate a space capsule in an emergency at touchdown by himself. Koenigsmann was designated before flight as her emergency helper; he and Mills lifted her out of the capsule and down the short flight of steps at flight’s end.“You should never give up on your dreams, right?” Benthaus urged after touchdown.Benthaus was adamant about doing as much as she could by herself. Her goal is to make not only space accessible to disabled people, but to improve accessibility on Earth too.While getting lots of positive feedback within “my space bubble”, she said outsiders aren’t always as inclusive.“I really hope it’s opening up for people like me, like I hope I’m only the start,” she said.Besides Koenigsmann, Benthaus shared the ride with business executives and investors, and a computer scientist.

So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn’t aboutBill Clinton. Never has, never will be,” the statement added.Epstein files: which royals, politicians, musicians and actors are in the photos?Read moreIt continued: “Even Susie Wiles saidDonald Trumpwas wrong about Bill Clinton,” it said, referring to comments made by White House chief of staff to Vanity Fair in which Wiles acknowledged that Clinton had not been on Epstein’s Caribbean island despite repeated claims by Trump to the contrary.Clinton has long maintained that he cut ties with Epstein around 2005, before the disgraced financier plead guilty to solicitation of a minor in Florida.In the statement, Clinton’s spokesperson Angel Ureña said: “There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that. Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.”The photographs released on Friday show Clinton in an underground swimming pool with Maxwell and a woman whose facial features have been redacted, as well as at a dinner with Mick Jagger, Epstein and other public figures.The picture of Clinton in a swimming pool was laterposted on Xby the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, with the caption “Oh my!” and a red-faced emoji.“Slick Willy! @BillClinton just chillin, without a care in the world. Little did he know… ,” Steven Cheung, the White House communications director,posted to X.Epstein visited the White House at least 17 times during the early years of Clinton’s presidency, according to White House visitor records cited in news reports. He later travelled with Epstein on the financier’s private jet in the years after he left office in 2001, including to Asia and Africa, on trips related the Clinton Global Initiative. Clinton has never been formally accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.But Trump has repeatedly made insinuations about the relationship between Clinton and Epstein. Last month, he called for the justice department and the FBI to “investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton”, part of a long-running campaign to characterize the Epstein scandal as an issue uniquely connected to Democrats.The justice department photo dump comes as both Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and presidential candidate, are scheduled to give depositions to the House oversight committee over their ties to Epstein.The depositions, originally scheduled for last week, have been pushed to 13 and 14 January. The committee’s chair, James Comer, has threatened to hold contempt proceedings if the couple do not sit for depositions on those dates,Politico reported.Explore more on these topicsBill ClintonJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationDonald TrumpRepublicansDemocratsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There never really seemed to be a doubt that the department would release the files late on Friday afternoon, deploying the well-worn Washington trick of burying unflattering news before a weekend.Then, on Friday morning, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, went on Fox Newsto saythat the department wouldn’t actually be releasing all of the files on Friday as required by the law. “I expect that we’re going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today, several hundred thousand, and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,” Blanche said on Fox News. “There’s a lot of eyes looking at these and we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials we are producing, that we are protecting every single victim.”By the time the department eventually did release thousands of pages of materials on Friday evening – not the hundreds of thousands Blanche promised - many of the documents had been heavily or completely redacted. Other than a few pictures, the materials made no mention of Trump, even though attorney general Pam Bondireportedly toldTrump earlier this year his name was in the files.The release underscores how the Trump administration is trying to balance both the demand to release the files – something encouraged in large part by the Maga base – while also obfuscating with a slow trickle of document dumps to prevent any embarrassment to Trump,who was friendswith Epstein for years before they had a falling out. Blanche has said the department will continue to produce documents on a rolling basis in the coming weeks – a holiday period – a bet that Americans will simply tune out the story as it drags on.Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who sponsored the law to release the files, was one of many members of Congress to express outrage. Hesaid on Twitterthat the release “grossly fails to comply” with the statute.The justice department did not immediately return a request for comment.“The Trump Administration is the most transparent in history. By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.The Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law that mandates the release of the materials, requires attorney general Pam Bondi to submit within 15 days of the document release a report detailing all categories of the records and a summary of the redactions made and their legal basis. It’s unclear whether that report will be delayed since the records will be released on a rolling basis.While Trump barely made an appearance in Friday’s release, Bill Clinton appears in several images. The Daily Wire, a Trump-friendly site,obtaineda photo of Clinton and Epstein on Thursday, a day before the release. Photos of Clinton lounging in a pool and a hot tub were among those released on Friday. Justice department and White House spokespeople were quick to highlight the images on Twitter.“Beloved Democrat president. The black box is added to protect a victim,” Gates McGavick, a justice department spokesperson,posted alongsidea photo of Clinton in what seems to be a hot tub with another person whose face is redacted. Steven Cheung, the White House communications director,posted another photoof Clinton with someone whose face is redacted and, quoting the song Jumpman by Drake and Future, wrote “them boys is up to something”.Angel Ureña, a Clinton spokesperson, released a statement on Friday saying theTrump administrationwas using the former president to try to distract from Trump’s connection to Epstein.“The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton. This is about what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever,” he said. “So they can release as many 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn’t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be.”Several other celebrities appeared in the images released on Friday, including Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Richard Branson, Chris Tucker, David Copperfield and Kevin Spacey. Like Clinton, none has been accused of any crime in connection to Epstein. But their immediate appearance in the files benefits Trump, creating the impression that it was not unusual for famous men to hang out with Epstein.Meanwhile, the strategy did not appease Democrats on Capitol Hill. The party’s leadership roundly decried the limited release, and some calls for Bondi’s ouster emerged. “Now the coverup is out in the open. This is far from over,” the US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezwroteon X. “Bondi should resign tonight.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationPam BondiUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

We’re putting up a mirror to what is happening.”More than65,000immigrants across the US are confined in federal detention, a two-thirds increase since January, and recent data shows that 74% of those in custody have no criminal convictions.View image in fullscreen‘The photos draw contrast to the cowardice of the masked men who hide their faces because they know what they’re doing is wrong.’Photograph: Courtesy of the California Community FoundationA few of the faces in Am I Next? are familiar: the veteran actors and activists Edward James Olmos and George Takei, who was incarcerated as a five-year-old boy during the second world war, and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass. The dozens of others are LA residents who Pulitzer-winning photographerBarbara Davidsonmet throughout city neighborhoods such as East LA, Venice and Echo Park.“Some were too nervous to participate because they, or a family member, were in the process of becoming citizens and didn’t want to risk jeopardizing their application,” said Davidson. “Others were eager to take a stand against the ICE raids.”A dedicatedwebsiteallows people to submit their own photos in a show of solidarity.“The photos draw contrast to the cowardice of the masked men who hide their faces because they know what they’re doing is wrong,” said Santana, whose own portrait appears on CalFund’s building, which is visible from City Hall and walking distance from ICE’s downtown LA detention center. “Courage is the best antidote to authoritarianism.”For the Japanese Americancommunity, the use of force, dehumanization tactics, lack of due process and the racist targeting of immigrants feels all too familiar.The Japanese American National Museum, or JANM, in historic Little Tokyo is not only a nightly canvas for protest art, but was where more than 37,000 Japanese Americans from Los Angeles boarded buses for American concentration camps in 1942. It’s also where about 75 armed federal agents conducted an immigrationraidin August, during a news conference event with Gavin Newsom, a sight that caused widespreadoutrage.“What’s at the heart of this campaign is a reminder to people that when we protect the rights of anyone in our community, we are really protecting the rights for everyone, including ourselves,” said James Herr, director of the Democracy Center at JANM. “The same kind of xenophobia, fear, prejudice and racism that Japanese Americans faced during world war two is what our current immigrant populations are facing.”View image in fullscreenProjections on a building as part of We Belong Here, a public art installation project, in Los Angeles on 16 October 2025.Photograph: LA Plaza de Cultura y ArtesJANM’s evening projections also incorporate images of former incarcerated people with Angelenos standing against ICE raids.At the nearby LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, over 30 large-scale digital images and neon from 10 LA-based artists, including Brandy González, Lalo Alcaráz and Patrick Martinez are on view in addition to images from Am I Next? The bold and colorful works, entitledWe Belong Here, reflect the immigrant experience and call for justice with messages such as “Invest in the oppressed“ and “It is the weak who are cruel”.More institutions in Los Angeles and Long Beach plan to host Am I Next? on their walls, and Santana said he’s heard from colleagues in San Francisco and New York who are looking to project similar images to bring awareness.“The violent way in which [immigration enforcement] is happening really needs to be exposed and not normalized,” said Santana, who said the project will run indefinitely. “We will keep it going until we can all sleep at night knowing that our core American constitutional rights are not going to be violated. We’re living in a moment where every American has to decide if those rights apply to all of us or some of us.”Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesBuilding powerCaliforniaWest CoastArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lots of things change about you, the condition of your skin, you start to turn grey, both in terms of the hue of your skin but also you notice more grey hairs, everything manifests physically,” says Teuta Hoxha, 29, awaiting trial at HMP Peterborough. “There are days where it feels very, very heavy on the mind and on the shoulders. But from my end, and I think for my comrades, we remain strong mentally and determined.”On Saturday, Hoxha will be on day 42 of her hunger strike with other Palestine Action-linked prisoners, amid increasing fears for their health. Most of the group are being held on remand over alleged criminal damage, aggravated burglary and violent disorder at a factory for the Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit systems ​in Filton, near Bristol. Many have been taken to hospital, some on multiple occasions; the justice secretary, David Lammy,has refused to meettheir representatives.All will have spent more than a year in prison – significantly more than the standard pre-trial custody limit of six months – before being tried. Their demands include immediate bail, as well as endingthe ban on Palestine Action, which they say hasled to them being treated as terroristsin jail, despite their alleged offences pre-dating proscription. They also ask for an end to restrictions on their communications, which they link to the proscription decision.Asked questions by the Guardian through an intermediary, Hoxha acknowledges the potential consequences of what she is doing. “You get to the stage where you’re constantly reminded of the big and irreversible changes that happen with prolonged starvation. It is something that plays on the mind,” she says.She cites the possibility of blindness, organ failure and brain damage: “Basically everything that brings you autonomy and has given us the ability to go on hunger strike, we’re at risk of losing that.”View image in fullscreenHoxha at a protest against Elbit Systems in February 2024.Photograph: Martin Pope/GettySome symptoms come and go, like chest pains, she says. “But then there’s the symptoms which are constant – dizziness, headaches, shortness of breath, and when you stand you have to sit back down again because you start blacking out.”She says prison officers tell her “you need to be healthy to fight your case”. But she asks: “What is health without freedom, especially with what they’ve labelled us as?”The first two prisoners began the rolling hunger strike – believed to be the biggest coordinated hunger strikes in the UK since thoseby IRA prisoners in 1981– on 2 November, to coincide with the Balfour declaration, in which the British government pledged to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The pair are Qesser Zuhrah, 20, and Amu Gib, 30, who are being held at Bronzefield prison, in Surrey. They were joined the following day by Heba Muraisi, 31, who is at HMP New Hall.Kamran Ahmed, 28, at Pentonville prison, London, is on day 41 of his hunger strike, and Lewie Chiaramello, 22, who is refusing food every other day, because he has diabetes, is on day 16. Umar Khalid, 22, who has muscular dystrophy, and Jon Cink, at Bronzefield, stopped their hunger strike this week after 13 days and 41 days respectively, Cink after being hospitalised.As time has passed concerns about their health have mounted, with the Labour MP John McDonnell saying he and colleagues had used “every parliamentary device we possibly can” to get Lammy to resolve the situation, but to no avail.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators protesting on Thursday outside Pentonville prison in solidarity with the prisoners on hunger strike.Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty ImagesDr Ian Miller, a senior lecturer in history at Ulster University, said that hunger strikes were relatively common, having been used bythe suffragettes, Irish Republicans andGuantánamo prisonersas well as individual inmates – although the last rarely get publicity and so tend to be ineffective and quickly abandoned. Hoxha had refused food on her own for four weeks earlier this year.“Going back to the suffragettes, the government always said ‘Oh, it’s blackmail, and we don’t care if you die’ so they always presented it as suicide,” said Miller. “Of course, the difference with suicide is [there is] usually an intent to die.“The government has often portrayed hunger strikers as irrational, as fanatics, whereas when you look at the perspective of the hunger strikers themselves and their families they do believe they’re fighting for a very righteous cause and that they’re using their bodies as a last resort because they can’t change much in prison.“They can be effective,” he said. But, he noted bleakly, “I think it’s usually when someone dies – [IRA hunger striker] Bobby Sands is an example – that the public really becomes sympathetic to them.”At a press conference on Thursday, Dr James Smith, an emergency physician and lecturer at University College London, who is in contact with some of the hunger strikers and their families, described some of the medical realities they now face. “After approximately three weeks, the body has exhausted fat stores and begins to break down muscle and organ tissue in order to generate enough energy simply to maintain essential bodily functions,” he said. “Thereafter, there is a risk that grows with every passing day of sudden, severe and unpredictable bodily dysfunction.View image in fullscreenQesser Zuhran’s friend Ella Moulsdale, Kamran Ahmed’s sister Shahmina Alam and solicitor Daniel Cooper speak at a press conference in London on Thursday.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images“The heart muscle begins to break, the kidneys are unable to filter effectively, the muscles that aid breathing are compromised, The ability to mount an immune response to infections is severely diminished, the brain is at high risk of irreversible damage … On this trajectory, put simply, the hunger strikers are dying.”Smith, one of hundreds of health professionals who have written to Lammy and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, believes that the prisoners’ care needs “must now be managed with regular specialist inputs if not continuous monitoring in a hospital environment” and said they were “alarmed by accounts of substandard monitoring and treatment within the prison system”.He cited the case of Zuhrah, who on Wednesday afternoonwas taken to hospitalafter protesters gathered overnight on Tuesday accusing prison staff of refusing to allow an ambulance in despite her being in severe pain from approximately 5pm on Tuesday. Zuhrah’s designated next of kin, her friend Ella Moulsdale, 21, fears“she can’t survive another [hospitalisation]”.Ahmed’s sister, Shahmina Alam, 33, said at Thursday’s press conference: “His heart is slowing down, so what are we waiting for, for it to stop?”Both Sodexo, which runs Peterborough and Bronzefield, and the Ministry of Justice have consistently said that prisoners refusing food receive regular medical assessment and support from clinicians, ​in accordance with the relevant policies. In the House of Commons on Thursday,the prisons minister, Lord Timpson, said​ the government was experienced in dealing with hunger strikers “with prisons working alongside our NHS partners every day, making sure our systems are robust and working – and they are”.Official Prison Service guidancesays: “Staff must make every effort to try and find out why the prisoner is refusing food and/or fluids and address the reasons for their refusal.” Department of Health guidance for detainees refusing food says they “should be told of the consequences of their actions and provided with information on how their body may respond and how they may feel”.John Podmore, a former governor of Belmarsh and Brixton prisons in London, said that clinical staff on site would decide whether they should be taken to hospital. “It’s not nice for the staff, it’s not nice for the prisoner, it’s not nice for the doctors and nurses in the hospital,” he said.View image in fullscreenTeuta Hoxha’s sister Rahma told a press conference on Thursday that her life had been ‘shattered’.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images“If I were governor of Bronzefield and these ladies were on remand and their health was seriously deteriorating, I’d be contacting the court and say ‘Look, these women need to be bailed’.”Ian Acheson, who worked as a prison officer, governor and senior Home Office official, said whether the court would be approached would be centrally mandated. He said: “Nobody wins in this. Individuals cannot use blackmail to compel democratically elected government …[but] in this case humanitarian grounds trump a kind of bloody-minded decision to keep these people remanded in custody.”At Thursday’s press conference, Hoxha’s 17-year-old sister, Rahma, said: “I feel as if the state has taken away a piece of me and shattered my life … I can’t imagine life without her but the government is forcing us to now she’s instructed her doctors on what to do if she collapses.”From her cell, Hoxha says: “I hold faith and hope, and those are the most important feelings to have in these moments. If they do not make any concessions, then they need to prepare for a scandal on their hands and prepare to answer the question: ‘Why did you let prisoners die?’”Explore more on these topicsUK newsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The audience sat, transfixed by the almost unbearable intensity of the spectacle.The nativity play, performed on a recent evening at Kharkiv’s puppet theatre, was a reminder that conflict has seeped into the fabric of almost everything in Ukrainian life over the past four years. “We can’t just put on comedies and escape from reality,” said Oksana Dmitrieva, the nativity play’s 48-year-old director. “The stage is a mirror, and we have to live through our emotions again, but this time from outside ourselves, together with others,” she said.View image in fullscreenOksana Dmitrieva, the director of Nativity Scene. War. Poems., at the Kharkiv puppet theatre.She admitted, however, that dissecting the darker emotions on stage does not always translate to a lighter mind in real life. “Sometimes it’s possible to immerse yourself in the work, but sometimes I also lose my bearings and I wonder, ‘What comes next? What should we talk about? What buttons should we press? I guess that’s what every Ukrainian is living through now.”This winter, the fourth since Russia’s full-scale invasion, threatens to be the bleakest yet for Ukraine. Trump, during his first year in office, has proved much more receptive to Moscow’s talking points than to Kyiv’s, Russian troops continue a slow but grinding advance in the Donbas region and missile attacks on energy infrastructure haveleft cities without power for hours on end, day after day. There are holes in the budget, a crisis in conscripting new recruits and – perhaps most devastatingly – the absence of a plausible positive outcome on the near-term horizon.MapThe glass-half-full view is that Ukraine’s continued existence as a state is in itself a positive outcome, and that while things are tough, there is no sign of an imminent collapse at the front. Military innovation in spheres such as drone production is booming, and in big cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv, there is still a vibrant metropolitan life, even amid the air alerts and blackouts. Growling generators on every street corner keep supermarkets, restaurants and bars open, and on a recent Friday evening, a 12,000 hryvnia (£212) champagne tasting event in Kyiv was sold out days in advance.View image in fullscreenChristmas decorations in the Kharkiv metro.But as Donald Trump’s negotiators attempt topush the countrytowards the peace that so many crave but on terms that terrify them, and with questionable guarantees that Russia won’t simply resume its attacks in future, exhaustion and existential questions are rarely far from people’s minds.“This is one of the most difficult moments in our modern history, when every one of us is living on the edge between exhaustion and strength, between compromise and our principles,” said Sevgil Musaieva, the editor-in-chief of the popular news outlet Ukrainska Pravda, at a recent awards ceremony in Kyiv, honouring the 100 most influential Ukrainians of the year.“We know that this winter will be difficult, we understand that our army lacks people and weapons, we also see that the positions of some of our allies are changing. We are facing questions to which there are no simple answers,” she added.View image in fullscreenKyiv in darkness in November after Russian attacks destroyed critical infrastructure.View image in fullscreenShopping by phone torch in the Kyiv blackout.Simple answers are indeed in short supply these days. Ask people what they feel about the continuing peace negotiations and the answer will probably be long, anguished and often contradictory. Most people are ready for compromises, but few are ready for the kind of sacrifices that might persuade Vladimir Putin to stop fighting.Dmitrieva is originally from Kramatorsk, one of the Donbas cities controlled by Ukraine, but whichTrump has suggested Kyiv should cede to Russiaas part of a peace agreement. “My niece is still in Kramatorsk, she didn’t run away, she’s working there. And what should we say to people like her, ‘Leave, this will be Russia now’? And what will happen to those who stay?”View image in fullscreenA central Kharkiv constructivist landmark from the Soviet era, the Derzhprom building was completed in 1928.The closer to the frontline, the more tangible are the stakes, given that the Russian army’s mode of advancing has largely been by destroying the towns and cities in its path. One of the places to have already suffered that fate is Vovchansk, north-east of Kharkiv and just across the border fromRussia.Vovchansk was occupied in the first months of the war, but Ukraine won it back in September 2022. Oleksiy Kharkivskyi, the head of the town’s police force, raised the Ukrainian flag in the main square that month. Then, last summer, Moscowlaunched a surprise offensive on the city, attacking it from land and air. Kharkivskyi spent weeks driving towards the frontline in missions torescue civilians and evacuate them to safety.View image in fullscreenBuildings and murals in central Kharkiv, reflecting how the city’s architecture and public space have been reshaped by the war.Ukraine halted the Russian advance, but Vovchansk lies abandoned and in ruins. A few months ago, drone footage suggested three or four people may be still eking out a living in a house in one suburb of the city – a few remaining residents in a town that was recently home to 20,000 people.Kharkivskyi compared his home town to Pripyat, the abandoned town near Chernobyl that was evacuated after the 1986 nuclear disaster. “The difference is that you can at least walk around Pripyat now. I don’t think anyone will be walking in Vovchansk for years. There are a huge number of corpses, dead livestock, all the unexploded shells and mortars. Half the Mendeleev [periodic] table lying around on the ground. It would take years to clean up,” he said.Now, as villages south of Vovchansk come under intense Russian drone attacks, Kharkivskyi is again spending his days driving towards the frontline to evacuate civilians.View image in fullscreenOleksiy Kharkivskyi, police chief of the abandoned city of Vovchansk, now working in Staryi Saltiv.Some of those are people he evacuated last year, who went back home and now want to leave again. It feels a bit like the film Groundhog Day, he conceded, as his mud-spattered police car slalomed along a cratered dirt track on another visit towards danger. A drone detector on his lap beeped to let him know that, somewhere nearby, a drone was flying. If a drone gets within a mile, the handheld device intercepts its camera signal and relays it on to a small screen.“Once you see a picture on the screen, it’s better to turn around and drive away quickly. If you see yourself on there, then you’re in real trouble,” he said. He laughed, but darkly: last year, a drone hit the car behind him during an evacuation. His friend and colleague was killed. Several others have been injured during evacuations.View image in fullscreenBuildings damaged by shelling in Staryi Saltiv, south of Vovchansk.View image in fullscreenResidents stand next to a damaged car outside a house in Staryi Saltiv.He admitted that he was exhausted by the continuing struggle, but said he was in no mood to surrender: “I think everyone would be ready to stop the war on the current contact line. But to just give away territory, how can we do that? What have we been fighting for for four years, then?”Kharkivskyi’s base since his home was destroyed is in the town of Staryi Saltiv, south of Vovchansk. Staryi Saltiv has not seen active conflict since Ukraine regained control in September 2022, but war damage is everywhere.GraphicThe school building, reduced to rubble in 2022, had been under reconstruction for nearly two years, but was completely destroyed again in a missile strike last spring, just as it was almost finished. Now, an underground school is being constructed next to the ruins of the building.“Some people say, ‘Why do you bother building anything here when you’re so close to Russia?’ But without a school, people who work and pay taxes won’t come back,” said Konstiatyn Gordienko, who works in the local administration and went to the same school, in the 1980s when it was newly opened.Gordienko railed against what he described as Europe’s indifference to Ukraine’s fate and blindness to the danger posed by Russia, but then relented, conceding that he too had not taken the threat seriously after the annexation of Crimea. “To be honest, I don’t blame the Europeans. When 2014 happened, I also didn’t understand the war in the way I understand it now,” he said. “When you have your tooth pulled out, you can’t explain the pain to someone who’s never had toothache.”View image in fullscreenMykola and Halyna Spivak, whose home was destroyed during shelling, now live in a container on the site of their former house.There are few buildings in Staryi Saltiv that do not bear signs of war damage, and many are completely destroyed. Mykola Spivak and his wife Halyna, both 87, live in a temporary container home, provided by a Christian charity. From the window, they can see the remains of their old house, where Halyna was born in 1938 and from which the Nazis deported her as an infant in 1942.View image in fullscreenMykola Spivak shows fragments of rockets that fell on his house.Spivak gave a mournful tour of the ruins, pointing with his walking stick at piles of rubble and cracked tiles, announcing what they had once been: “The bathroom … the summer kitchen … the living room … here there was parquet flooring.”A worried relative bought them a small apartment in Kharkiv, but after trying it for a few months they decided it was better to be back in Staryi Saltiv, where both had spent their entire lives, whatever the conditions. “Birds migrate home, and so do we, it’s only natural,” said Spivak.Each evening, the couple walk a few hundred metres down the road to stay the night at a friend’s house, where the noise from drones and air bombs is a little quieter and the heating works better. Every day, they listen to the radio. They don’t care much for geopolitics, but hope to hear that a peace deal has been struck that would make the nights quieter and the last years of their lives a little more bearable.“Peace, peace, peace, we are just waiting for peace,” said Spivak. “Maybe they’ll all sit at the table, have a shot of vodka and finally hammer it all out.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had a new teaching contract coming up in the Middle East, but there were delays with the construction of the school and I found myself with three months to spare. I decided to go and hike the Inca trail.I booked with a tour provider and on the second night, as we all got to know each other, this tall, handsome Aussie with a huge smile caught my eye. Once we hit the road, my attraction to Jarod quickly grew and it didn’t take too long – or too many beers at altitude – before we shared our first kiss.By the time we made it to Cusco, the capital of the Incan empire, we peeled off from the group and spent a day together. As we sat across from each other at a cafe with the city buzzing around us, I was so distracted by my feelings that I couldn’t even read the guidebook in front of me.We saw the sights and as we took a break on a bench later in the afternoon, it began to rain. Jarod pulled out this lavender-coloured umbrella, then – and you couldn’t make this up – someone in a nearby house started playingClose to You(made famous by The Carpenters) on a saxophone.It was a moment of pure stardust; I hadn’t felt anything like it for the longest time.View image in fullscreenJenny and Jarod sitting together on the train ride back from Machu Picchu, Peru in 2011.Photograph: Jenny and JarodWe were in separate groups for the hike to Machu Picchu, but the chemistry between us was so strong that even after three days trekking, he still smelled delicious to me. I was overjoyed to be reunited with him.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAfter the trek, Jarod had plans to keep travelling, so I stayed on as long as I could before I had to go home for Christmas and head off to the Middle East. We didn’t see each other for seven months. We messaged and Skyped virtually every day; at the start, I wasn’t sure that whatever we had would last because of the distance, but I soon realised our connection was special.View image in fullscreenAttending Jenny’s father’s wedding in 2012.By the following summer, Jarod’s adventures had taken him to Africa and I went to meet him in Kenya before we both travelled back to the UK for my father’s wedding. As the photographer snapped photos of us, he quipped: “You’ll be next.” And for the first time in my life I thought: “Yeah, maybe I will be.”For the next 18 months we endured a crazy long-distance relationship: half-term visits in Doha, holidays in Sri Lanka and a few months on his parents’ cattle station in central Queensland. Eventually I got a job in Singapore, Jarod joined me and we spent two and a half years there.View image in fullscreenJenny and Jarod’s wedding at the Singapore Botanical Gardens.While holidaying in Indonesia, Jarod proposed and we were married in a small ceremony in Singapore Botanic Gardens in 2014. We had a good life there but I had some health problems and life got complicated, so we decided to relocate to Melbourne. Throughout it all Jarod was my absolute rock.View image in fullscreenOn the ferry to Tasmania in 2023.We have had so many amazing adventures together, but I realise now that it’s the days you don’t take pictures that really count; when he tries to make me laugh when I’m sad, or comes to the rescue when, on a very difficult day full of medical appointments, my car has been rear-ended.View image in fullscreenJarod, Jenny and their dog Bertie in 2025.It hasn’t been an easy few years, but that magical feeling I experienced under the umbrella in Peru has never left me. When I look back on everything I went through, and how amazing Jarod has been throughout it all, I feel like the pain was balanced out by the joy he brings me.We now have a lovely home, a cute schnauzer called Bertie and a little black-and-white cat called Minnie. We still bicker, still love to travel and I still love the smell of him.Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Theattack in Bondihasreverberated internationally, tragically bookending a year that already challenged humanity, hope and the future of the planet.Indeed as 2025 ends it is defined by yet more abject and ignoble political, economic, technological and environmental derelictions of dire proportions.Acts of war have bombarded our screens in real time, the Earth reached its first“catastrophic” climate tipping point, and the US has perniciously slid towards autocracy under Donald Trump. Meanwhile the tech billionaires who have aided this decline grow ever richer and more powerful on the theft of our intellectual capital.Under the weight of such bleak realities, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness can arise. Faith in mankind – in goodness and kindness – is threatened.Amid a sea of bees, mourners flow out the door to pay tribute to Matilda, the youngest victim of the Bondi attackRead moreIn such times it can be tempting to look away and seek escape. Alternatively, we can face our fears and threats, stoke resistance and nourish understanding through the knowledge that reading can foster. Through books, people can seek both escape and wisdom.Guardian Australia asked some prominent activists, writers and thought leaders what writing they turn to for hope, understanding, comfort, emotional and intellectual strength, and to restore their faith in human nature.Bob Brown: ‘I frequently give this book to friends’The environmental activist and writer Bob Brown says: “Worst-case scenario is that if we keep knocking down [environmental] tipping points like we did this year then by 2050 there’ll be a 25% collapse in the economy and 2 billion people dead.”That is why his first recommendation is The Lorax, a picture book by the children’s authorDr Seuss, whose central character declares: “I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees.”“It ends with the word ‘unless’.Unlesswe do something we’re leaving our kids a very troublesome mess. I frequently give this book to friends,” the former Greens leader says.“It’s a surface look at the situation the world thinks it’s in where everyone says it’s about the economy. But it’s not. It’s about the environment with the economy subservient to that.”Brown also offers 12 Rules for Strife, a comic book call to action and social unity by Jeff Sparrow and Sam Wallman, as well as historian Mark McKenna’s recently released The Shortest History of Australia.“That way Mark McKenna has, of standing back and looking at 65,000 years of human history on this continent rather than looking at just 200 years [of European habitation], is actually very uplifting.”View image in fullscreenFormer Greens leader Bob Brown.Photograph: Matthew Newton/The GuardianBrown, whose latest book, Defiance, aims to inspire environmental activism, also finds consolation in the memoir A Feeling For Nature by the nonagenarian natural history documentary maker and photographer Stanley Breeden.“It’s a beautiful book about his interactions with nature and the destruction of nature over the last century.”Brown also suggests reading A Memory of Solferino by Henry Dunant, who co-established the Red Cross after seeing the aftermath of an epic battle in Italy. “It’s a great story about looking at the outcome of the worst of human nature and employing the best of human nature to do something about it.”Anna Funder: ‘See these things fully, from all sides’The celebrated Australian author Anna Funder says she does not read much escapist material, “because it doesn’t engage with the real”.“Then there are works that, in looking at the dark, hard stuff about humans, the societies we make, the structures of fairness we develop in politics and law to rein in brutal impulses, are much more interesting. Because they are dealing with what it is to be human and not a fantasy version of that, there is relief in it, even if there is also horror.“And there is hope, because the first step to countering the problems we face – in misogynist authoritarian regimes, techno-broligarchical surveillance and theft of our work, and the climate catastrophe – is to see these things fully, from all sides.”View image in fullscreenMargaret Atwood.Photograph: Christopher Wahl/The GuardianThat’s why it’s important, she says, to read Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale for all it conveys about “the primal power move in all societies, which is that of male power over women”.“We are living in an age in which the authoritarianism, totalitarianism, untrammelled techno-surveillance is very gendered. It is gendered male, and it comes as a backlash to 100 years of feminism, and 50 years of gains by women in western cultures in achieving legal and economic rights.”Funder, who is writing from Europe as Germany and France reintroduce “voluntary, for the moment” national service, recommends “as an anti-war read” All Quiet on the Western Front, the 1929 novel by German writer Erich Maria Remarque.“The idea of sending young people to their deaths because politicians didn’t use their words horrifies me.”Jason Stanley’s How Fascism Works is another thematically consistent recommendation from Funder.“[It] shows how fascism is an extreme form of patriarchy (first move: control women to make men central and powerful, exclude them from the public sphere, confine to reproductive uses,thenfind internal enemy – immigrant or Jew – to scapegoat etc). So, to my mind, we are going to need to look at these authoritarian and totalitarian regimes in a gendered way, in order to bring other values which are more humane, and often gendered ‘feminine’, to confront them.”Margaret Atwood: The Handmaid’s Tale has become ‘more and more plausible’Read moreFunder’s own major works – the nonfiction Stasiland, her novel All That I Am and her most recent book, Wifedom, all “examine tyranny from below,” in her words, “from the point of view of characters who see and feel how unjustly it works, and who find in themselves the courage and conscience to resist”.Behrouz Boochani:‘It takes us into the depth of an authoritarian regime’The award-winning Kurdish author and journalistBehrouz Boochani– incarcerated under Australia’s immigration detention system for seven years on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island – chose three books and a documentary film, all about personal and collective resistance.View image in fullscreenAuthor and journalist Behrouz Boochani.Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/The GuardianThen The Fish Swallowed Him, a novel by Amir Ahmadi Arian, chronicles a political prisoner’s torture and survival in Tehran’s Evin prison.“I think this book is important because it takes us into the depth of [an] authoritarian regime and how this kind of system works. Also it creates an image of how citizens feel under watch by the system and how anyone is potentially targeted.”Boochani, who now lives in New Zealand, recommends Te Waka Hourua’sWhītiki, Mātike, Whakatika, a book that follows a group of Māori activists in New Zealand who carried out a “treaty redaction” in the national museum in Wellington to achieve self-determination of their people.He suggests reading his own second book Freedom Only Freedom – a collection of essays about resistance and resilience by Boochani and other contributors – and watching the feature-length documentaryGulîstan, Land of Rosesabout female Kurdish fighters opposing Islamic State.Kate Fullagar: ‘This novel brought me hope’View image in fullscreenThe nonfiction writer and historian Kate Fullagar says What We Can Know by Ian McEwan ponders many big questions of our epoch. The novel is set in the 2120s in a Britain reduced to small islands after “the inundation” caused by climate breakdown and wars.In the novel, Fullagar says, “people can sustain themselves (though chocolate is supremely rare), and they even go to university. McEwan makes the extraordinary point that other than the Catholic church, universities are one of the few institutions to have survived so many world-historical transformations. Why not this transformation? This novel brought me hope about two of the things that most panic me – climate change and the fate of universities.”She also suggests a 2019 essay by Liane Carlson,What is Called Thinking in the Anthropocene?She re-reads it often.“It’s really beautiful, and sad, but somehow uplifting … Carlson makes such a great case for why studying thought matters at all – it’s never really to find solutions, as university defenders feel compelled to say now, but instead to realise our fellowship with all other humans – past and present – in our inevitable failures among the successes.”View image in fullscreenKate Fullagar recommends anything written by Australian constitutional law academic Megan Davis (pictured).Photograph: Dean Sewell/Oculi/The GuardianFullagar’s most recent book is Bennelong and Phillip, the joint biography of Wangal man Bennelong and colonial governor Arthur Phillip. The award-winning author says she reads anything written by Australian constitutional law academic Megan Davis because she finds “her graciousness towards Australia, her love of it in fact, even while allowing for anger and frustration, something close to superhuman”.“Whenever I read her being positive or reflective or encouraging about Indigenous issues to the Australian people, I am too ashamed to be furious about our systematic denial of Indigenous sovereignty.”Finally she suggests Anna Funder’s All That I Am.“What remains in my mind is the vision of the modern Australia that the older Ruth character lives in, and her summary of why Australia could be a viable place for refugees. ‘After the war I came to this sunstruck place. It is a glorious country, which aspires to no kind of glory. Its people aim for something both more basic and more difficult: decency.’ This was the nicest thing I think I’ve ever read about any country. I remember it made me sign up the next day to help volunteer at Villawood [immigration detention centre]. That is galvanisation by a work of literature!”Thomas Mayo: ‘Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon’Union leader, justice advocate and author Thomas Mayo says that Kevin Gilbert’s 1973 book Because A White Man’ll Never Do It – an expose of Australian race relations – has profoundly influenced his own public activism.“He was Australia’s Mandela in some ways. He wrote this book in prison I think, most of it. It is about [political, social and racial] resistance really. For Blackfellas finding their way in activism I think it is a really important book to read.”View image in fullscreenThomas Mayo says Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr both served as ‘inspirational figures’ in his life.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianHe recommends Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals by Saul Alinsky (with its wisdom that “ridicule is man’s most potent weapon”) and Hegemony How-To: A Roadmap For Radicals by Jonathan Smucker.He says of Alinsky’s book, “This was an important book for me. I read it around 2011 as part of my union training. It taught me a lot about organising – strategies and principles.”Are we falling out of love with nonfiction?Read moreHe also lists Nelson Mandela’s autobiography Long Walk to Freedom andMartin Luther KingJr’s exposition on the American civil rights movement, Why We Can’t Wait. Mayo says both have served as “inspirational figures” in his own public life.“Most of the books I read are historical because I think history does repeat itself. It’s important to understand the struggles that have preceded us as we try to create a better world and to fight against the darkness that is creeping in these days,” he says.“I’d describe the world as being on the brink right now … there’s never been a more critical time.”Explore more on these topicsBooksDr SeussNelson MandelaMartin Luther KingFictionBiography booksBehrouz BoochanifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ryan Coogler, the acclaimed director who rose to prominence steering Marvel’s colossal Black Panther franchise, was thought to be out of his depth for trying to midwife a script he himself said he cobbled together in two months. Warner Bros, the studio fronting the film’s near $100m budget, was supposedly out of its mind for not only throwing that much money behind the project, but further agreeing to singularly favorable authorship deal terms that gave him control over the film’ final cut and full rights over the film after 25 years. Hollywood machers were convinced the film would never make money and that Warner Bros’ big gamble “could be the end of the studio system”. But Sinners never let that cynicism in.Sinners is a horror film about the highs and lows of the Black experience | Andrew LawrenceRead moreSinners landed in theaters on Easter weekend and delivered its own miracle resurrection, racing to a $368m gate on the way to becoming the highest grossing original film in the past 15 years, and the 10th-highest domestic-grossing R-rated film of all time. (That’s right: higher than Terminator 2 and the Hangovers.) At a time when Black heritage and culture are once again under intense political assault,Sinnersprovoked zeitgeist-y discourse around Black history, cultural erasure and entertainment industry politics. And the online memes poking fun at juke-joint scenes hit as hard as the thinkpieces unpacking the venue’s under-appreciated contributions to the American musical canon.For Sinners to resoundingly beat the odds and become the year’s most defining film, one that is already being hyped as a heavy awards favorite, is just yet another testament to Coogler’s singular Midas touch. His script may have taken two months to write, but it was informed by years of research into Mississippi Delta folklore, antebellum cultural motifs and blues history – a deep dive that started with Coogler’s late uncle introducing him to the genre through his record collection as a kid. Coogler lost himself in 1930s photography and Native American mythos; he drew on the expertise of university history professors and the experiences of Chinese immigrants – oft-forgotten figures in the history of the American south, fictional or otherwise. “We were both happy that we could portray Asians speaking English without a stereotypical accent,” the Malaysian actor Yaosaid in an interviewwith Sinners co-star Li Jun Li; they play married grocers in the film. “We’re also sexy as fuck.”View image in fullscreenMichael B Jordan and Ryan Coogler.Photograph: Lee Watt/AFF-USA/ShutterstockAnd as ever Coogler manages to fold those thick layers of context and the corresponding religious overtones into the film – with major assists from costume designer Ruth E Carter, set decorator Monique Champagne and his wife and producing partner, Zinzi – without weighing down Sinners’ nighttime survival narrative or holding up his exquisitely capable cast. Hailee Steinfeld was a revelation as Mary, a character so well drawn it apparently had her making discoveries abouther own ethnic background. Delroy Lindo, who plays the wino blues man Delta Slim with trademark dignity,saidthat Sinners reckons with the past in a way that makes private investigators out of the cast “because one is uncovering aspects of history that heretofore had been either expurgated, entirely erased, or diminished”.‘A safe haven from racial violence’: Sinners shows the importance of juke jointsRead moreThose history lessons would culminate in broader takeaways that challenged Hollywood orthodoxy. Wunmi Mosaku – a full-figured, dark-skinned mature woman – disproved industry conventional wisdom that sexy female leads only come young, skeletal and fair-skinned – and hammered that point home with a recentNew York magazine cover. All the while Michael B Jordan showed himself to be more than a pretty-boy leading man.It feels weird touting his star turn in Sinners as his arrival given his quarter-century long run as a prestige entertainer, and that Sinners was his third collaboration with Coogler. But Jordan delivered the performance of his career while breathing humor, headache and heroism into the double-minded Smokestack twins bootleggers – training his body and his voice to draw nuanced distinctions between the brothers. “The way he was able to create the characters individually made it easy for me to establish my relationship with both of them,”saidMiles Caton – the baritone guitar man who imbues Sinners, his feature film debut, with song and soul. And that’s as Jack O’Connell – who gamely plays the foil as Remmick, the culture-vulturing nightwalker – connects Coogler’s early grounding in the blues to his sincere curiosity in Irish folk music.Whether experienced in the theater as intended or enjoyed via streaming, where it proved a hit for HBO Max, Sinners got people talking – about how it moved them, about how it explains these troubled times, about all the potential in this cinematic universe despite Coogler calling Sinners a standalone project. (As if that’ll stop visions of a Smokestack twins prequel that has them ripping and running with Al Capone’s Chicago Outfit … ) And after all the second-guessing Coogler endured while releasing the film, which turned out not to bethestudio extinction-level event involving Warner Bros, there’s sweet poetic justice in seeing the critics who onceasterisked the film’s successnow ask, with overdue flattery:what’s next? “I believe in cinema,” Coogler wrote ina thank-you letterto Sinners-goers. “I believe in the theatrical experience. I believe it is a necessary pillar of society. To see your response to the film has reinvigorated me and many others who believe in this art form.”Explore more on these topicsSinners2025 in cultureRyan CooglerMichael B JordanHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Behind the headline positivity, however, must be a realisation that more convincing performances are required to hold on until the final reckoning.Viktor Gyökeres’ emphatic first-half penalty sealed a slender yet merited win over an Everton team missing several important components.Arsenalwere more efficient than impressive and rarely troubled throughout a scrappy contest. But this was a test of title-winning character as much as quality after three away games without a win in the league and having lost top spot for the first time since mid-October before kick-off. In that respect Arteta can be encouraged by a reaction that ensured Manchester City’s stay in first place would be brief and Arsenal would be top at Christmas for the third time in four years.Everton v Arsenal: Premier League – liveRead more“It gives me belief and confidence, the level of performance and the consistency of that,” said the Arsenal manager. “It is very difficult to do that in this league. We are going to have to go to difficult places but we have to enjoy the process of winning.”There was nothing to report from a tedious opening aside from the pathetic and frequent poverty chanting by the Arsenal away support. Fair play to theEvertonemployee who decided to display an advertisement for ‘Fans Supporting Foodbanks’ on the giant stadium screens in response.Finally, and inexplicably, Jake O’Brien enlivened proceedings with a chaotic cameo. The Everton defender nudged Gyökeres over when the Arsenal striker appeared certain to convert a deflected Jurriën Timber cross almost on the goalline. Gyökeres appealed for a penalty that the video assistant referee checked and rejected on the basis there was no foul. The striker had to be stronger when challenging for the cross.No matter. From the corner that resulted from Vitalii Mykolenko getting the final touch on Timber’s delivery O’Brien blatantly handled under pressure from Riccardo Calafiori and Piero Hincapié. The referee, Sam Barrott, having missed the offence, was sent to the pitchside monitor where the sight of the Republic of Ireland international raising both hands to the ball gave him no alternative but to award a spot-kick. The Arsenal captain, Martin Ødegaard, insisted Gyökeres take it. The power and pace of the forward’s penalty gave Jordan Pickford no chance despite the fact he dived the right way.The remainder of the first half reverted to type. Dull. With Declan Rice and Martín Zubimendi controlling proceedings in midfield Arsenal performed with greater composure although the visitors, and Everton, created little. William Saliba slipped in Gyökeres shortly before the interval but the forward shot over under pressure from James Tarkowski.View image in fullscreenJake O’Brien handles the ball to concede the decisive penalty.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersEverton’s lack of threat came as no surprise. Without Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Iliman Ndiaye, injured and away at the Africa Cup of Nations respectively, David Moyes was missing two of his best and most creative talents of the season. The drop in quality from the absent duo to their replacements, Carlos Alcaraz and Dwight McNeil, was steep and inevitably felt by the home side.A more open and intense second half brought welcome improvement. Arsenal were close to doubling their advantage when Bukayo Saka and Timber combined brilliantly down the Everton left. Having released his overlapping full-back inside the box, Saka followed in for a perfectly weighted return ball. Saka’s low shot beat England colleague Pickford but was blocked in front of the line by Tarkowski.The visitors also struck the woodwork twice in four minutes. Leandro Trossard curled a first-time shot around Pickford and against the far post after Rice unselfishly laid the ball into his path. Trossard should have scored. Zubimendi then swept an effort against the base of the same post from Ødegaard’s fine cut-back from the byline.Everton’s performance improved too although their best hopes of an equaliser centred on penalty claims. The first was optimistic and ignored when Thierno Barry tumbled under a challenge from Zubimendi after a careless pass out of defence by Saliba. The hosts’ second shout looked stronger when Saliba and Barry challenged for a loose ball inside the box and the Arsenal defender kicked the Everton striker’s foot after the latter had played the ball. VAR deemed there was insufficient contact to award a penalty. “It could have been given,” said Moyes.The Everton manager added: “Arsenal give up very few chances but, even so, we didn’t create as many as we’d have liked. We started better than Arsenal but the penalty turned things. We gave away a stupid penalty kick.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Certainly not Tottenham, even if they ended the game bellowing, blustering and battering at the door with nine men. The fact they went down fighting in those circumstances, clawing back into contention after controversially going two goals behind, will buoy up theembattled Thomas Frankbut that would be to overlook elements of a performance whose discipline deteriorated to their cost.It may not have been a moment of lift-off forLiverpool, either, although they did eventually wobble to three points. The scales had tipped in their favour when Xavi Simons, with one of those very modern and exasperating video review red cards, was dismissed in the 33rd minute but they looked blunt until the half-time substitute Alexander Isak sent them on their way. As soon as he had done so, the striker departed with a nasty-looking injury. The legacy could be costly regardless of the fact that, almost undetected, Arne Slot’s side have edged themselves back up to fifth, at least until Manchester United visit Aston Villa on Sunday.‘The game is gone’: Thomas Frank fumes over VAR decisions in latest lossRead moreThe touchpaper on what had been a circumspect affair, initially light years from the6-3 rampage Liverpool delivered a year agoto the weekend, was set ablaze when Simons caught Virgil van Dijk after the ball had long gone. In one sense the flashpoint had been coming: Simons had been haring around off the ball, pleasing the crowd with one sliding intervention near his own corner flag. In another it felt rather overblown, the offence not seeming sufficient to rob the evening of its standard proportions.View image in fullscreenJohn Brooks shows Xavi Simons a red card for raking his studs down Virgil van Dijk’s calf, causing the hole in his sock (inset).Composite: Shutterstock, GettyVan Dijk had passed the ball backwards when Simons, failing to put the brakes on when pressing, raked his studs down the defender’s lower left leg. He had been a little off balance when contact was made. The referee, John Brooks, showed a yellow card and that seemed a reasonable end to the matter.But Simons was clearly in trouble once the video assistant referee called for a review, events running their inevitable course after the slow-motion replays invited a different conclusion. Presented at a fraction of the speed his challenge did look dangerous; ultimately, though, it reeked of the kind of dismissal that rarely occurred before micromanagement by technology was railroaded through to become an integral part of football. Simons should have cooled the jets but he had been rash rather than malicious.There was no suggestion Van Dijk would need replacing and indeed it was he, in a late example of Liverpool’s enduring skittishness, who would air kick and allow the substitute Richarlison to drill Spurs back into the game. By then it seemed to have been won, the visitors drawing blood from their two moments of genuine threat.Liverpool had not exceeded room temperature in the first half so it was little surprise Isak was called to enhance their threat even if the player he replaced, Conor Bradley, was injured. With his fourth touch, Isak clipped in his secondPremier Leaguegoal of the campaign after Dominik Szoboszlai and Florian Wirtz had made the most of a sloppy pass from Romero. It was Wirtz’s first top-flight assist in England but the good news ended there.Quick GuideKey factsShow• Tottenham have lost 11 home league games in 2025, their most ever in a single calendar year across club history.• Alexander Isak became just the second player to be subbed on, score and then be subbed off for Liverpool in a Premier League game after Yossi Benayoun vs Manchester City in November 2009.OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Isak was taken out by a scissor-like challenge by Micky van de Ven as he scored, the tackle worse than anything Simons had produced but perhaps diminished by the move’s outcome, and had to be helped from the field after lengthy treatment. The problem appeared to be with his ankle and Slot will hope his prize asset, finally getting up to speed, is not sidelined for long.Spurs’ main threat with 11 men had come through Randal Kolo Muani, who could not get enough power on a free header soon before Simons departed. He gamely ploughed a lone furrow when they had 10 and almost equalised when, after a show of strength and speed, his angled shot snicked off Milos Kerkez and dropped down on to the bar. It was the first of two deflections that would have a significant influence on the outcome of the match.The second followed quickly. Jeremie Frimpong, who had replaced Isak for his own return from injury, twisted Djed Spence inside out before delivering a cross that clipped the left-back on its way. Hugo Ekitiké, hanging in the air while taking what seemed an illegal liftoff atop Romero, met the ball with a looping header and Spurs had further cause to rage.Tottenham v Liverpool: Premier League – liveRead moreView image in fullscreenCristian Romero lashes out at Ibrahima Konaté resulting in a second yellow card.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesThey finished with five yellow cards including the two shown to Romero, the second awarded three minutes into an epic period of added time after he kicked out at Ibrahima Konaté. Spurs may have been fuelled by righteous anger but the last thing Frank needs is to lose both Simons and his captain. They kept balls flashing across the Liverpool box until the last despite such depleted numbers, Wilson Odobert requiring Alisson to claw one away at the very end.Liverpool clung on, their game management a mess but a six-game unbeaten run suggesting the darkest hour has passed. This, though, had hardly been an occasion to draw firm conclusions about anyone.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Newcastle have now dropped 13 points from winning positions this season, but their manager blamed the match officials rather than lax defending for this latest setback.With the score 2-1, Trevoh Chalobah’s 54th-minute challenge on Anthony Gordon propelled the Newcastle player into the hoardings, but Madley declined to award a penalty, a decision endorsed by the video assistant referee.João Pedro rescues Chelsea draw as Newcastle squander two-goal leadRead more“It was a clear error and a clear penalty,” said Howe, who is normally reluctant to criticise referees. “Anywhere else on the pitch that is a blatant free-kick. I thought it would be overturned.“The defender only focuses on Anthony. [VAR] said it was shielding. I don’t agree with that. I think the player has gone into Anthony aggressively, too aggressively, so I think it’s a stonewall. The defender’s only looking at Anthony, not the ball. It was the wrong decision.”Howe was “devastated” that Newcastle, who led through two early Nick Woltemade goals, had not won. “It’s difficult because we played so well,” he said. “It was an outstanding performance, especially in the first half. It was a reminder of how good we can be. It’s further evidence that we’re improving.

But overall, a draw is correct.“It’s not easy to come back from 2-0 down here. Not many teams can do that. It’s an important result. I’m happy with the reaction of the players.”Maresca was unwilling to discuss the behind-the-scenes discord he had hinted at after last Saturday’swin against Everton. “My last week has not been complicated, it has been good,” he said. “We beat Everton,we beat Cardiffand we drew with Newcastle away, so in terms of results, I’m happy.

Bristol, on the other hand, continue to dazzle in the way their hosts have recently struggled to.These two are probably the Premiership teams most renowned for dazzling. Indeed, they both enjoyed 60-point wins last weekend against lacklustre visitors from the deep south-west of France. But only one side brought it to the big, wide stage of Twickenham.Greg Fisilau double edges Exeter to comeback victory at SaracensRead moreMuch has been made of the way Pat Lam has his players making a thousand touches a week in training, but he does seem to be on to something. During Bristol’s utterly dominant first 50 minutes, front-five forwards put each other through gaps as if they were Fijians. One of Bristol’s team actually is, but Kalaveti Ravouvou, though brilliant, was no more light of touch than Ellis Genge or Joe Batley and their mates in the boiler room.We still talk about thePremiership semi-final of 2021, Bristanbul as it is known, so jaw-dropping was the comeback Harlequins summoned from somewhere, 28-0 down after half an hour of unplayable Bristolian genius, yet prevailing in extra-time. It was probably the greatest match in Premiership history, and there were high hopes for this one, but it takes two to tango. Alas, there was only one team here.Quick GuideHarlequins 14-40 Bristol teams and scorersShowHarlequinsDavid; Cleaves (Isgro 52), Beard, Northmore (Waghorn 52), Murley (capt); Smith, Porter (Friday 65); Hobson (Wenger 65), Walker (Riley 65), Williams (Delgado 54), Petti, Treadwell (Launchbury 65), Carr (Evans ht), Kenningham, Cunningham-SouthYellow cardWalker 43TriesIsgro, SmithConsSmtih 2BristolRees-Zammit; Boshoff (Heward 65), Van Rensburg, Williams, Ravouvou (Worsley 71); Jordan, Marmion (Randall 61); Genge (Woolmore 52; Genge 59), Oghre (Thacker 52), Chawatama (Kloska 52), Rubiolo, Batley, Owen (B Grondona 57), S Grondona, Harding (capt)Yellow cardJordan 58, Williams 71TriesRavouvou, Batley, Oghre, Rees-Zammit, S Grondona, GengeConsJordan 4, WilliamsRefereeAnthony WoodthorpeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bristol had their bonus point by half-time again, but no repeat of that extraordinary playoff. How far away such heroics must seem to Harlequins, how far away the form of the champions they went on to become four years ago.“People always talk about Bristanbul and all that,” said Lam. “We’ve worked hard to make sure that doesn’t happen to us again. The type of rugby we played – and on free-to-air TV too – was pleasing. That was something we did talk about. Let’s show young people that if you’re going to watch rugby, this is what it is.”If the difference between good and great rugby is precision, the Bears were the embodiment of that in the first half. Bristol had four visits to the Harlequins 22 in the first half and scored from each. They scored from their fifth visit too, at the start of the second half to open a 33-0 lead.Harlequins were the opposite. They had nearly all the ball in that period and could not score a point, their efforts foundering time and again on a solid Bristol defence and their own loose handling. They spilled passes and balls in the tackle, right, left and centre.View image in fullscreenKalaveti Ravouvou scores Bristol’s first try.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty ImagesBristol scored from their first attack, in the eighth minute. A thing of beauty it was too. Genge put Batley through, Tom Jordan sent a fabulous pass out wide, where Ravouvou finished with power and precision. Batley scored himself early in the second quarter, collecting Ravouvou’s offload for Bristol’s second. Their third came five minutes later, Genge this time putting Gabriel Oghre through a hole to the line. And then it was Ravouvou’s turn again to dazzle with his hands, sending Louis Rees-Zammit, enjoying his first start at full-back, away on the overlap. He chipped Nick David, his opposite number, who didn’t stand a chance, for the bonus-point try.Quick GuidePrem roundup: Hendy double helps Northampton overwhelm SaleShowGeorge Hendy (pictured) scored two tries asNorthamptonproduced an impressive display to defeatSale47-21 at Franklin’s Gardens. The thumping victory was enough to lift Saints up to second in the table, with just points difference separating them and the new leaders, Exeter, after they ran in seven tries, some of which were spectacular.Northampton began with tries from Henry Pollock, Hendy and Toby Thame and after Tom O’Flaherty struck for Sale, Kemeny’s sensational individual score put the hosts 26-7 ahead. Hendy scored his second before O’Flaherty and Arron Reed pulled back tries for the Sharks, with George Furbank and Tom Pearson then rounding things off for Saints.One score stood out for Phil Dowson, Northampton's director of rugby. He said: “Josh Kemeny’s try had me off my seat, I thought it was exceptional and I think the athleticism Josh has is sometimes underestimated. He is very fast, he is very athletic and I think he has been one of our best signings.”Geoff Parling was pleased with how hisLeicesterplayers kept up the pressure againstGloucesteron Friday despite the game being won with something to spare. The Tigers scored seven tries at Welford Road to move level on points with the pre-weekend leaders, Bath, who visit Newcastle tomorrow.A 20-minute red card for the replacement hooker, Charlie Clare, was their only negative, but there were welcome returns from injury for Ollie Chessum and Jack van Poortvliet in a 45-14 win.Parling said: “We did plenty of good stuff and worked hard for each other. I’m really pleased to get not just the outcome, but to see lads still kick balls into the corner late in the second half, lads still working for each other. We were still hustling, we were still trying to get more points.\"Scores by James Thompson and Solomone Kata eased Leicester ahead before a penalty try on the stroke of half-time gave them a 19-0 lead. A comfortable night was completed by second-half tries by Tom Whiteley, Tommy Reffell, Billy Searle and Chessum, with Josh Hathaway and Jack Clement scoring for Gloucester.Gloucester's director of rugby, George Skivington, said: “I didn’t see that coming. We’ve had a good six weeks and I thought we were in a good spot for it.Losing a couple of lads [to injury] early definitely wasn’t helpful, but our accuracy was really poor.\"PA MediaPhotograph: David Rogers/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Matters deteriorated further for the home team. Jack Walker was shown yellow two minutes into second half. While he was away, Santi Grondona finished from the attacking lineout that followed.We had to wait an hour for Harlequins to score the first of their two tries. Rodrigo Isgró leapt over a ruck between the posts, after a lengthy series of drives at the Bristol line. But that just inspired Genge to his most outrageous trick yet. Gathering the ball about 40 metres out, he galloped down the right touchline and through the despairing David for the most popular try of the afternoon.Marcus Smith scythed through for Quins’ second in the last 10 minutes. But by then an impressive crowd was beginning to thin out. The flashing lights and pounding music that greeted the score felt somewhat in vain.

Not so much about boxing’s future, but about the world now consuming it – and the environment that enabled Friday night’s artless, cynical spectacle to generate a reported purse of $138m (£103m) to be divided between its participants.Paul is not an aberration within boxing so much as a stress test of its contradictions. His five-year foray into professional fighting, oncederided as vapid cosplayin this space, has been legitimately impressive in a sport where countless celebrity interlopers have failed miserably down the decades and vanishingly few who start past their teenage years make any mark at all. Speed-running a credible fistic education is easier with Paul’s limitless time, money and resources, but the Ohioan has plainly given himself over to the discipline. He has built a profile on a procession of faded mixed martial arts fighters, fellow YouTubers, a retired basketball player anda 58-year-old Mike Tyson. But when Paul says boxing has helped him as a person, as he didthrough a broken jawduring Friday’s aftermath, it’s not hard to believe him.3:32Anthony Joshua calls out Tyson Fury after knockout victory over Jake Paul – videoHe is a better boxer than his critics allow, but he is a genuinely brilliant businessman, even if he’s preying on our baser instincts. Paul rattles off his many jobs easily: venture capitalist, chief executive, boxer, entrepreneur. At heart, though, he remains a YouTuber, unafraid of looking stupid on camera in pursuit of views and clout. He has found a lane that uses spectacle to turn notoriety into capital, and boxing, ruthless about exposing frauds, has offered just enough legitimacy to make the enterprise scalable.What’s funny is that Paul chose a trade that he knew would inevitably find him out. For all his bluster and force of will, he knew this night would come. He had simply made peace with it. In the end, Paul gave the worldwide audience afforded by Netflix’s roughly 300 million subscribers exactly the Christmas present it wanted: to see him knocked out brutally. The clip of Joshua fracturing Paul’s jaw in two places during the final assault will almost certainly be the most-viewed piece of boxing content on YouTube before the new year.The event nearly sold out the 20,000-seat home of the NBA’s Miami Heat, helped by ticket prices that fell as low as $31 by fight night. The atmosphere felt less like that of a boxing crowd than a content farm: phones everywhere, people filming one another in the concourses, strangers wandering into streams and dapping each other up for the camera. Paul’stheatrical ringwalkalongside the widely despised SoundCloud rapperTekashi 6ix9inewas a calculated provocation, a reminder that outrage still converts. Then came the fight itself. Paul’s gameplan – circling endlessly in a 22-foot ring, avoiding engagement – drew boos within 45 seconds. He was obviously gassed after nine minutes, throwing fewer than 10 punches in each round. Afterwards, Joshua said the right things, but looked almost sad and embarrassed by it all.Baumgardner and Dubois win as women’s champions shine on Paul v Joshua undercardRead moreSo why has it left such a sour taste? Perhaps because sport has always reflected society – boxing most of all – and we probably didn’t like what we saw in the mirror on Friday night. Certainly not at the nadir of the farce, as a pathetic Paul repeatedly threw himself to the canvas without so much as a point deduction, so physically spent from his perpetual retreat that a stiff breeze might have felled him.Some argue Netflix should be embarrassed for endorsing a fight that may not have been sanctioned in Las Vegas, let alone by the British Boxing Board of Control. But the streaming company didn’t stumble into this moment; it merely identified it early. In an era when the Oscarsare decamping from network televisionto YouTube and live sports have become the last reliably communal media experience, this was a proof of concept in a crucial theatre of the streaming wars. It is no longer unthinkable that the Super Bowl will be off broadcast within a decade. From that perspective, Friday night was less a money-burning sideshow than a strategic investment.Paul’s entry into boxing may be a net positive. Consider Amanda Serrano, the first fighter he signed to his promotional company. An eight-division champion unknown to all but hardcore boxing fans for most of her career owing to a lack of investment in female fighters, she went from getting paid $1,500 for a world title defence to earning multiple seven-figure purses by riding the slipstream of Paul’s fame. Attention, unevenly distributed, can still redistribute money to the deserving. Thefour women’s title fights on Friday’s cardwere the highlight of the show by some distance.View image in fullscreenAmanda Serrano, seen here in 2022, signed to Jake Paul’s boxing promotion company in March 2025.Photograph: Ian Hodgson/PAOverall, things are going well in the world of Jake Paul Inc. He will reportedly earn at least $70m for Friday’s proceedings, possibly more. His fiancee, the Dutch speedskating star Jutta Leerdam, is favoured to pick up a medal in the Olympic 1,000m in two months’ time; together they are in effectthat sport’s Travis and Taylor. He is a very good talker, he’s corporate-approved and can do pretty much whatever he wants. I’ll be shocked if he’s not a major-party US presidential candidate in the next 20 years.Boxing will emerge from the Jake Paul era intact – even improved in places – because it still demands something real: preparation, pain, consequence. What should trouble us more is the world that allowed a 13-fight novice to become a face of a sport built on merit. Paul’s popularity tells us plenty about where we are heading, and it is not to higher ground.Explore more on these topicsBoxingAnthony JoshuafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Villa had won only two of their first 11 games of the season and lay 17th in the Premier League table. Unai Emery was appointed as manager 12 days later, since when the transformation in Villa has been remarkable. In his three years in charge, no side in the top five leagues in Europe have won more home games and Villa have finished seventh, fourth and sixth, while reaching the quarter-final of the Champions League.It’s not just Emery, of course: significant money has been spent as well – £35m that January, £100m the following season, nearly £200m the season after that. It’s only fair to point out that significant sales have been made, so the net spend since Emery took over is only around £40m, but there has also been a significant increase in salaries, with the latest available financial results showing Villa had the seventh highest wage bill in the Premier League – although that does not include Marcus Rashford, Marco Asensio and Axel Disasi, who were signed on loan in January in an effort to ensure Champions League qualification.Emery, at least to a non-Spanish audience, had always seemed a slightly unfortunate manager, not helped by his resemblance to the manager of the Bureau de Changeplayed by Steve Cooganin The Day Today’s spoof fly-on-the-wall documentary. He was clearly gifted, as his record in the Europa League showed, but he kept on taking the wrong job: Spartak Moscow when they were a basket case; Paris Saint-Germain when Neymar was still the boy-king, so he was reduced to cutting the cake during the Brazilian’s three-day birthday celebrations; Arsenal straight after Arsène Wenger. But he took over Villa at the perfect point, when expectations were relatively low and significant investment was about to be made. They were ready for growth and he was ready to lead it.His first game in charge was a3-1 home win over Manchester United,whom Villa host on Sunday afternoon. That felt hugely significant. It was Villa’s first league win over United since the opening day of 1995-96, the “you’ll win nothing with kids” match. But in one specific sense, that game was illusory: United remain Villa’s betes noires. Villa have beaten them only three times in their past 53 meetings.View image in fullscreenAston Villa players congratulate Lucas Digne (second right) on their second goal in the 3-1 defeat of Manchester United in November 2022.Photograph: Carl Recine/ReutersIn that regard, what happened on the final day of last season was perhaps only to be expected. Victory for Villa at Old Trafford, where nine other sides had won league games last season, would have guaranteed Champions League football. As it turned out, with Newcastle losing, a point would have been enough for Villa. But Emi Martínez was witlessly sent off in the first half and theyconceded two in the final 15 minutesto slip into the Europa League.That disappointment seemed to affect them. Their summer transfer activity was limited as they lost Jacob Ramsey and bought Evann Guessand. Off the pitch, there was a lot of grumbling about profitability and sustainability rules and how they check ambition, a stance that ignores both the happenstance that they are owned by Egypt’s richest man and a billionaire American asset manager, and that the biggest check on their ambition was losing to a terrible United. On it, Villa began as though in a funk, failing to win any of their opening six games.Bologna at home at the end of September, though, marked the beginning of a run of 15 victories in 17 games. They have won their past 11 Premier League games other than the2-0 defeatat Liverpool. Crystal Palace are the only side to have beaten them at home in 2025. If the Premier League season had begun on the day of the Bologna game, Villa would be three points clear of Manchester City at the top. As it is, they went into this weekend three points adrift of Arsenal, the leaders.There is still a widespread assumption that Villa are not really in the title race, a feeling based on more than preconceptions about their status. Only Tottenham are overperforming their expected goals by more than Villa this season; in only two games have Villa had an xG more than 0.5 greater than their opponents. But this to an extent is Emery’s method.View image in fullscreenJohn McGinn scores the only goal as Aston Villa beat Bologna 1-0 in late September to kickstart their season.Photograph: Paul Currie/Colorsport/ShutterstockHe seems more comfortable at an aspirant upper mid-table club than a true giant (and if they have the letters V, L and A in their name, so much the better). Although part of the Basque school that has replaced the German gegenpressers and the Portuguese periodisationalists as the pre-eminent force in modern tactical thinking, Emery is no great philosopher, no evangelist for any particular system. Rather he is a pragmatist adept at working with the margins.There is a growing theory that xG models, trained as they are on data from a period in which Pep Guardiola-style process football was dominant, may not be such a good guide to the more direct, set-piece-based game that has taken over in the past year or so. As the first flush of excitement at the possibilities of data fades, there is a renewed interest in character and mentality.Villa have that in spades: they have come from behind in four of their past five away league games. The odd game out there was theirstrangely limp defeat at Anfieldwhen, although they hit the woodwork twice, there was a sense of failing to exploit Liverpool’s obvious weakness to direct balls played behind the full-backs.But then Villa’s record against Liverpool – no wins in their past 11 meetings – is almost as bad as that against United. It’s as though they have some strange inferiority complex against the two most successful sides in English history. That fits with the sense of Emery as honest upper mid-table striver, a Europa League man who doesn’t look quite right in the Champions League.That may be unfair. There were plenty of issues during his stints at PSG and Arsenal that had nothing to do with Emery. And Villa have won three of their last five against Arsenal, the third most successful side. But his Villa would look a lot more persuasive as potential champions if they could end the hoodoo and see off an inconsistent United on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaInside footballUnai EmerycommentShareReuse this content"

Mark Viduka achieved the same feat in 2003, helping secure his side’s top-flight status with his instinctive finishing, another achievement the latest Elland Road No 9 is aiming to replicate.The former Everton striker cannot have imagined almost 40,000 singing his name at Christmas when he was unemployed for much of the summer, reminding everyone that sometimes the best gifts are free. It took until mid-August for newly promoted Leeds to convince Calvert-Lewin this was the right place to rebuild his career and they are proving one another right, helped by the scorer of the third goal Ethan Ampadu’s long-throws.Erling Haaland double sinks West Ham as Manchester City put heat on ArsenalRead more“The numbers don’t lie, he’s in red-hot form at the moment,” Daniel Farke said of Calvert-Lewin. “[He is] one of the best English strikers in this league. He has proved it before, whenever he was fit, he has shown his quality. Right now he’s on a path to be a top, top-class player forLeeds United. I don’t like to speak about quality and top-class player just after a few weeks. You have to show this with consistency over the whole season.”Palace spent the opening stages trying to dictate the tempo, helping them manage the workload of nine games in 26 days, partially explaining why they failed to make this competitive by being unable to match Leeds physically and deal with set pieces. There were 11 changes from Thursday’s draw against KuPS, and Oliver Glasner might have feared another was required when Marc Guéhi and Calvert-Lewin clashed heads but both were able to continue, ensuring the game played out in Leeds’s favour.The plan to bombard the Palace box with set pieces was apparent from the start; a long throw-in belatedly fell to Joe Rodon on the edge of the box but his shot was deflected wide and from the resulting corner, the Welsh centre-back headed wide. Palace could not cope and did not learn from their mistakes, as they were punished by four.A clumsy challenge by Tyrick Mitchell on Brenden Aaronson caused greater ire among the home supporters. Even more so when the referee, Thomas Bramall, and VAR deemed the left-back had got the slightest of touches on the ball prior to clearing out the American.The anger was replaced with euphoria soon after when an Ampadu missile was flicked on to Calvert-Lewin in space at the back post. The striker was thwarted by Henderson the first time but not the second as a weary Palace slept. The goalkeeper’s complaints about poor marking made the moment even sweeter in Yorkshire.View image in fullscreenEthan Ampadu scored Leeds’s third goal after a corner, having helped set up the first two with long throws.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAChants of “England’s number nine” rang around the stadium for a striker whose previous five goals required 40 appearances to amass. It was a boisterous atmosphere; if the Palace fans were upset by a difficult journey after an 8pm kick-off on a Saturday five days before Christmas, the Leeds brethren had embraced the opportunity.Another throw, another Calvert-Lewin goal thanks to him once again being the first to react at the back post after a flick. This time it was a first-time header before he wheeled away but the feeling was the same for the striker and the majority inside Elland Road.Calvert-Lewin began his Leeds career with one goal in 13 prior to this run of six in five. Few had belief in a 28-year-old who had suffered numerous injuries in recent seasons but Leeds are reaping the rewards. He is looking sharper and more confident as each game passes, and with a dearth of English No 9s around, maybe Thomas Tuchel will hear choruses. “In the six yard box is where I need to be,” Calvert-Lewin said. “When you’re in a good moment the ball starts dropping for you and that’s where I’m at.”Ampadu got his reward as Palace once again struggled to clear their lines from a set piece. This time it was a corner which Aaronson headed back into the danger zone, made even more precarious by no one tracking the Leeds captain, who jabbed home. “We were bullied from every single set play, we could have conceded two or three more from set plays.” Glasner said. “ Conceding four set-play goals is also a bit embarrassing.”Calvert-Lewin and Ampadu were given standing ovations when taken off late on, before Justin Devenny pulled one back from the spot, only for Anton Stach to restore the three-goal advantage in the 101st minute from a free-kick.Leeds can enjoy Christmas relieved by being two wins clear of 18th-placed West Ham. There is no rest for the very wicked, as Palace face Arsenal in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, where they will be desperately hoping to rediscover the energy they forgot to bring to Yorkshire.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

I dreamed about this as a boy and now it came true. I’ve survived until Christmas and it’s such a good feeling.”Dobey, the eighth seed, was beaten by an inspired performance from the 55-year-old Andrew Gilding, who averaged 99.01 and hit a 10-dart leg in a 3-1 victory. “How do I feel? Amazing,” said Gilding. “I don’t know what happened. I felt really bad in practice, but that’s usually a good sign.”Chisnall was dumped out by the German Ricardo Pietreczko despite hitting 11 maximums. The No 21 seed paid the price for double trouble and missed a match dart in the final set when it seemed as though he would complete a remarkable recovery.View image in fullscreenAndrew Gilding meets the media after beating Chris Dobey.Photograph: Katie Chan/Action Plus/ShutterstockJames Hurrell claimed one of the biggest wins of his career by upsetting Van Duijvenbode, the 29th seed, 3-2. Hurrell missed two match darts for a final-set whitewash, but he held his nerve to win the next leg and will next meet the fourth seed, Stephen Bunting, who avoided the carnage with a routine 3-0 win over India’s Nitin Kumar.The crowd favourite Motomu Sakai bowed out, with his conqueror, Andreas Harrysson, admitting he had been worried by the Japanese’s exuberant walk-on. Sakai has become a cult hero this week, with fans warming to his energetic dance moves and his signing autographs en route to the stage.The 28-year-old qualifier won his opening match against Thibault Tricole 3-0, but went down by the same scoreline to Sweden’s Harrysson as the second-round action got under way.“I was a bit worried seeing his walk-on,” Harrysson said after following up his first-round win over the 12th seed, Ross Smith. “But I think I managed it quite OK. I think he wasn’t as he was in the first game on the stage. It’s a great feeling. I didn’t play my best, but nor did he. It was a great win.”Ryan Searle averaged over 98 in an impressive straight-sets win over Brendan Dolan.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipsDartsnewsShareReuse this content"

Otherwise, it will not be enough to arrive in March and April in contention to win titles.“We did not do the right process to do what we have to do. There were many good things – I always have to thank Erling for the goals but thanks to him and Phil [Foden] and Nico O’Reilly – they helped us to do this type of game. Defensively, we are improving. We are visualising it with the ball.“If they follow me, we will be there, but they have to improve. I know the level in Europe, I know Arsenal and other teams. The spirit is there – we didn’t have that last season – aggression, hunger, all the attributes that they need that are not about highlights. Hopefully Rodri is back [soon] but we cannot forget Jérémy [Doku] is not here, [Mateo] Kovacic, Omar Marmoush, Rayan [Aït-Nouri].”There was also rare criticism for Bernardo Silva. Guardiola said: “Bernie is my weakness. He’s top, but today Bernie had to play better. Today I’m not happy with Bernie. He’s my weakness, my favourite one, but today I’m not happy with him. He knows exactly what we need to play better.”View image in fullscreenErling Haaland scores Manchester City’s first goal, putting it past Alphonse Areola.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersSix straight wins in all competitions faced off against zero in five in the league. Factor in West Ham’s previous victory over the hosts beingin September 2015 (2-1)and Nuno Espírito Santo’s team were seeking to bridge a 21-game gap to the club’s last triumph over City.Inside five minutes, the task became harder. The constant passing of those in sky blue can be a torment, hammering away constantly before a knockout blow. This is how Haaland opened festivities. Constant possession wore down those in claret. Then Foden swapped passes with Nico González on the left and rolled the ball to the striker, who unloaded. Alphonse Areola beat the ball back to him and a thunderous right boot made no mistake.Quick GuideKey statsShow• Manchester City’s Erling Haaland has scored 19 Premier League goals this season; it’s the joint-most by a player in a campaign before Christmas along with Andy Cole (1993-94), Kevin Phillips (1999-00) and Luis Suárez (2013-14).• West Ham have lost 10 of their 17 Premier League games this season (W3 D4); only in 2002-03, 2006-07 and 2022-23 have they reached 10 losses in fewer games in the competition (all 16th game).OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.West Ham were confined to an approach City often enforce on opponents: playing chase-ball and hoping to prosper from a counterattack. A Lucas Paquetá free-kick intended for Jarrod Bowen was misdirected, so Josko Gvardiol headed back toward Gianluigi Donnarumma, but it drew a clap from the forward for being the right idea.So, too, was Rayan Cherki’s contribution for Reijnders goal. With John Travolta-esque feet he prised the Hammers apart and tapped the ball to Haaland in the area. He did the same to Reijnders a foot away and the Dutchman’s shot bulged the roof of the net.Here was the sort of playmaking from Cherki that has impressed Guardiola of late, following the manager’s mix of praise and criticism earlier in the season.View image in fullscreenWest Ham fans protest against Karren Brady and David Sullivan.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAn easy period for City ended with Guardiola putting his arms between his assistant, Pep Lijnders, and the officials, for who knows what reason. The manager was displeased, too, at the space allowed Mateus Fernandes to shoot from long range as the second half began, though he blazed high.Guardiola’s unit slackening off led to a rollicking for Foden. Cut to Bowen rounding Donnarumma on the left and hitting the side-netting, then rolling wide, seconds after, from the other side, and the manager was vindicated.On 65 minutes, a triple change that reaped an instant dividend. Cherki, González and Reijnders went off for Rico Lewis, Abdukodir Khusanov and Savinho. Done to jolt City, it worked – one more illustration of Guardiola’s cunning.Savinho fed Lewis, who tapped the ball towards Haaland. After a mix-up involving Jean-Clair Todibo and Kyle Walker-Peters, he rifled his second home.Crysencio Summerville forced a Donnarumma save and that was it for West Ham. There was still time for Haaland to narrowly miss a chance for the hat-trick. The contest ended with a third clean sheet in three league matches for City and the Hammers sitting third-bottom on 13 points.“Of course, I’m concerned,” said Nuno. Asked how he would turn things round, he replied: “By insisting, by believing, and by working really hard on the training ground. Everybody has to be committed. The only way I know is to work harder and commit more.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityWest Ham UnitedErling Haalandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It is a sword that fell on the necks of two sets of Australians. Yet again, young Australian Jews will be asking parents why they are hated, and that is heartbreaking. In a different sense, so will young Muslims.During their apparent sojourn in a Campsie B&B, the alleged terrorists could not have been confident of their own survival, but they must have been confident in producing a reaction. It is a matter of civic pride that a Muslim man accosted one of the gunmen and took a weapon from him; a matter of a small yelp of praise and gratitude amid the cruelty.In all this, there is a tendency to decide politicians are to blame. But the truth is that in cases of such egregious savagery as this, our democracy feels inadequate – that’s why the events are so scary. And there are good grounds to wonder why the father had so many legal firearms to call on. Yes, that should have rung a preventive bell. The reasonable Australian equation is that we can march for a general cause, we can argue for it, but we cannot physically punish those who oppose us.The immediate shock and terror of the Bondi shooting is giving way to anger and division. We must look for the light | Paul DaleyRead moreNetanyahu, a man of politics I cannot agree with, blames the PM for backing a two-state solution. But when has a one-state solution ever worked, except by obliteration or disappearance of the second group? I find it hard to believe that two-state appeasement motivated the killers one way or another, and if I am wrong, then I apologise. We trip ourselves up in these situations. Events like Bondi are designed to do that. Pluralism does not countenance or condone spilled blood; it is far more along the lines of what Syrian Muslim Ahmed al Ahmed did in disarming one of the shooters for a time.By the way, wasn’t it sinisterly interesting that one of the alleged shooters appeared to signal some people away, as if saying that he did not want to kill non-Jews? This was just another dubious and sinister aspect of the attack. Among the people killed was a former cop with an Irish name, Meagher. For the truth is, none of us can be fully shielded once terror speaks. We have to trust our neighbours. There is no peace by setting one group of society against another.The aftermath of the Bondi terror attack is not a time to blame, politicise or dilute democracy | David HeilpernRead moreSo, if the desperate opposition stoops low enough, they will now masquerade as the best hope of the Jewish community. But it will also be the grossest form of opportunism, for the awful truth is that the very multiplicity of our causes means we would prefer a society where police are not armed with rifles at every event of joy and camaraderie. That is the unspeakable irony.Attacks such as these are designed to shut up debate; to drive one side to a rancour, and serve to make government more radical, while encouraging acts of radicalism from one’s own side so that the cauldron boils over, stoked from every side.At the end of the day, would more police have been a remedy on the terrible evening? If a relative of mine had been threatened, I might say yes. Terror begs these questions as it does of so much of what we do. But after experiencing that extra protection, I might find them an excessive presence.Thomas Keneally is a novelist.

Just don’t mention beef tomatoes or buffalo wingsSat 20 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 20 Dec 2025 12.45 ESTShareMost of what you eat is sausages. I mean, if we’re going to get literal about it. Sausage derives from the Latinsalsicus, which means “seasoned with salt”. You might think of a sausage as a simple thing, but on this reading it is everything and nothing, a Borgesian meta-concept that retreats as you approach it.From another perspective, a sausage is an offal-filled intestine, or the macerated parts of an electrocuted or asphyxiated pig or other animal – generally parts that you wouldn’t knowingly eat – mixed with other ingredients that, in isolation, you might consider inedible. For some reason, it is seldom marketed as such.But to the legislators of the EU, a sausage can now have only one meaning: a cylindrical objectcontaining meat. Never mind that cylindrical objects containing no meat have been marketed under names such as “Glamorgan sausage” (selsig Morgannwg) for at least 150 years. Never mind that even Germans once felt the need to call animal sausagesmettwurst, to distinguish them from other kinds. Never mind that almost everyone knows what “veggie sausage”, “vegan sausage” or “plant-based sausage” mean. Arecent surveyof 20,000 Dutch people found that 96% are not confused by such terms, which is probably a higher percentage than those who can readily distinguish left from right. The consumer must at all costs be protected from an imaginary threat.For the same reason, members of the European parliament decided,burgers must also contain meat. It happens that no one is sure why a burger is called a burger. They were once called “Hamburg steaks”, but no clear link to Hamburg has been established.Nevertheless, before the term was abbreviated, meat patties were widely known as hamburgers, whose literal meaning is an inhabitant of Hamburg. If “veggie burgers” are misleadingly marketed, so is any burger not made from the minced inhabitants of a north German city.Last week, the European Council and European Commissiontried and failedto make sense of all this. They were unable to agree a common position with the European parliament, and bumped the decision to January, when a new council presidency will have to deal with it. I can’t blame them. You cannot make sense of a senseless policy.The parliament’s food literalism is remarkably selective. Given the time of year, perhaps I should point out that there is no meat in mincemeat, which is used to fill mince pies. Many years ago there was, but the meat component fell out of fashion. Minced meat, by contrast,ismeat – I’m sure that’s not confusing. Similarly, sweetbreads are meat, but sweetmeats are not. None of these terms appear to cause any problems for legislators, though they have insisted that the onlypermissible definitionof meat is “edible parts of the animals referred to in points 1.2 to 1.8 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004”, which is, let’s face it, how it’s commonly understood by shoppers across the EU.If a vegetarian hotdog is to be ruled out, as the parliamentarians demand, on the grounds that it contains no meat, the meat version should be ruled out on the grounds that it contains no dog (hothorse should in some cases be permissible). They might also be shocked to discover that there is no beef in beef tomatoes, butterfly in butterfly cakes, cottage in cottage pie, baby in jelly babies or finger (mostly) in chocolate fingers. And don’t get me started on buffalo wings.All this must be deeply confusing to shoppers. Like Wednesday Addams, who, whenoffered girl scout cookies, asked whether they contain real girl scouts, we puzzle every day over what such names really mean. Human beings are entirely incapable of pattern recognition, derived and secondary meanings, metaphor or conceptualisation. Language never evolves, and nor does food. This is why, when confronted with “pigs in blankets”, “toad in the hole” or “spotted dick”, people curl up on the floor, banging their heads and moaning weakly (OK, there might be other reasons). Everything can have only one meaning, and this meaning must be what legislators say it is.If you are thinking “benefit of Brexit”, I’m sorry to disabuse you. If the European Council and Commission eventually decide that terms such as veggie burgers and vegan sausages are to be banned in the EU, they arelikely to be banned in the UKas well, for fear of jeopardising trade agreements. Already, after acourt interpretationof a previous European decision, terms such as oat milk, soy butter and vegan cheese areprohibited on UK labels, but not – because consistency is for suckers – coconut milk or peanut butter.View image in fullscreen‘From another perspective, a sausage is an offal-filled intestine.’Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesSo what explains the selectivity?Lobbying. The decision in the European parliament is a response topressure from the meat and dairy industries, which have long been seeking tostamp out competition. It has no more to do with preventing confusion than aRocky Mountain oysterhas to do with a marine bivalve. It’s about protectionism. This is why peanut butter and coconut milk are still legal: they seldom compete directly with animal products.‘Veggie burgers’ could be off EU menu as MEPs back renaming plant-based foodsRead moreThese anti-competitive practices have a long history. In the 19th century, the US dairy industry managed first to get margarine declared a “harmful drug”, then had its sale restricted under the 1886 Oleomargarine Act. It’s reassuring to know that legislators made just as good use of their time then as they do now.The livestock lobby isimmensely powerful. Its campaigns are reinforced by rightwing influencers, whowage waragainst a wide variety of plant products (vegetable oil, soya, almonds, avocados,any plant-based meat substitute), often on entirely spurious health or environmental grounds, while conveniently ignoring the far greaterimpacts of animal productsonhuman bodiesandthe living planet.The food industry knows that words are a powerful weapon. If Moses had promised the Israelites a land of mammary secretions and insect vomit, I doubt many would have followed him to Canaan, though these are accurate descriptions of milk and honey. It knows that if plant-based foods have to be marketed under alien and alienating names, this will depress their market share.The livestock lobby seeks to normalise and naturalise the cruel, grotesque, planet-wrecking realities of its industry, while casting plant-based foods as unnatural and wrong. As usual, it has made minced meat of European legislators.

CBS wants to knowArwa MahdawiBari Weiss is touting a new debate series at the network as the billionaire Ellisons’ media power growsSat 20 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 20 Dec 2025 09.02 ESTShareThings That Matter (to billionaires)Has feminism failed women? I know that may seem like a silly question to ask when women’s rights are declining around the world thanks torightwing authoritarian politics, but trust me, OK? The problems with feminism are what we really need to be focusing on right now.Or rather, don’t trust me. Trust the millennial media mogul Bari Weiss (and Bank of America). Starting in 2026, CBS News and Weiss’s media startup, the Free Press, are kicking off a debate series called Things That Matter, looking at questions like ‘Has feminism failed women?’, ‘Does America need God?’ and ‘Should gen Z believe in the American Dream?’ All of which issponsoredby the Bank of America.Weiss is positioning Things That Matter as a way to bring together polarized America and get people talking about important issues. Zoom out, however, and this new series looks rather more like a vehicle to amplify the Things That Matter to Donald Trump’s Billionaire Friends, and Bari Weiss.As you may have noticed, rightwing Trump allies are rapidlytaking over the US media ecosystemand reshaping it to reflect the Maga worldview. Earlier this year, for example, CBS’s owner, Paramount reached a$16m settlement with Trumpover an interview on 60 Minutes and axed Stephen Colbert’s Late Show. Many commentators saw these moves as a way to butter up Trump before a potential $8bn Paramount sale to Hollywood studio Skydance Media, owned by David Ellison. Lo and behold, the mega-merger went ahead and the centi-billionaire Larry Ellison, and his son David, became two of the mostinfluential people inmedia. Daddy Ellison is also one of the most powerful people in Washington; the Trump donor has been described by Wired as a “shadow president”.The Ellisons have been busy. In October, Paramountbought Weiss’s the Free Pressfor $150m and installed Weiss as CBS News editor-in-chief. It’s not her editorial experience that seems to have landed her the role; rather, it’s her pro-Israel views and obsession with criticizing “wokeness” andprogressive causes: the Financial Timesreported in Octoberthat David Ellison courted Weiss for months “as part of an effort to reset CBS’s editorial direction” and “Weiss’s vocally pro-Israel stance was among the factors that appealed to Ellison.”Weiss isn’t content with just staying behind the scenes at CBS News. Last Saturday, she appeared on camera for a massively hyped town hall with Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk. It was a very weird piece of content for a supposedly objective news channel: Kirk talked about the importance of “God’s word” a lot, in what the New Republic described as a “sermon on Christian Zionism”. Numerous media commentators were concerned about how heavily the softball interview leaned into a religious framework, leading some to question whetherthis was advocacyor journalism.Whatever it was meant to be, the town hall was aratings flop, drawing 1.9 million viewers, according to Nielsen data. That’s an 11% decline for the year-to-date average for the 8pm EST time slot and a 41% decline in the key 25-54 demographic. Big advertisersalso stayed awayand airtime was bought by companies like the dietary supplement SuperBeets.The great thing about data, however, is that you can often find a way to get it to tell the story you want. In apress release, CBS said that the town hall broadcast outpaced the network’s season-to-date performance in the time slot by 32% in total viewership and 19% in the key demo. CBS clearly thinks the snooze-fest was successful enough to replicate, anyway, because the conversation with Erika Kirk was positioned in the first part of the Things That Matter series. According to promotional material for the new series, we’re now going to be treated to exciting guests like JD Vance (whom Erika Kirkendorsedfor president in 2028 on Thursday night) and Ross Douthat (the conservative columnist who recently asked if liberal feminismruinedthe workplace.)I can’t imagine any of these town halls becoming ratings bonanzas but it doesn’t really matter. If the Ellisons aren’t happy with the way CBS is going, they have plenty of other ways of reaching Americans. “The Ellison family is cornering the market on attention and data the same way the Vanderbilts did railroads and the Rockefellers did oil,” Wirednoted ina September piece. That market now includes TikTok; on Friday the social media app signed a deal to hand control of a portion of its US business to a group including the software giant Oracle, founded by Larry Ellison. The Guardian reportsthat Oracle“will license a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm as part of the deal, in a partnership that will expand on Oracle’s existing management of TikTok’s trove of data collected about its US users.”I’m sure I don’t need to spell out why Ellison has been so keen on acquiring TikTok. “Think of TikTok as video data – unstructured data that fits into another slice of that Oracle matrix,” a former Oracle executive told the New York Timesearlier this year. “Whoever has the data has the power.”Now if Weiss conducted a town hall about that, instead of all the problems with feminism, I’d tune in! I’m fairly sure that the ultra-richaround the worldusingmedia ownershipfor political ends counts as a Thing That Matters.US funding cuts have caused 1,394 family planning clinics to shut down.Millions of people have been leftwithout access to contraceptives or care as part of a “radical shift towards conservative ideologies that deliberately block human rights”, according to the International Planned Parenthood Federation. But make sure you tune into CBS to hear if feminism is bad for women!Texas is collecting a list of transgender people who request gender marker changesThe state has created a list of more than100 trans peoplewithout explainingwhy it’s collectingthis data. And that’s not all Texas is doing: the state attorney general, Ken Paxton, is encouraging the public tohelp enforce the state’s“bathroom bill” via a tip line for suspected violations of the new law, which restricts which toilets transgender people can use.Elon Musk tweeted about Sydney Sweeney’s breastsThe tech billionairecontinuesto be one of the creepiest people on Earth.Ultra-conservative José Antonio Kast elected Chile’s next presidentHe’s the son of a Nazi party member,opposes abortionand same-sex marriage, and wants to deport undocumented migrants.Brigitte Macron faces lawsuit after being filmed using sexist slurThe French first lady was documented calling feminist protesters at a theatre show in Paris “sales connes” – which roughly translates to “stupid bitches”. More than 300 women are nowfiling a legal complaintfor public insult.Yet another newborn freezes to death in GazaOn Friday, Doctors Without Bordersreportedthe death of a four-week-old baby. That brings the number of children who have frozen to death to five in less than 10 days. Israel continues not to allowlife-saving aidinto Gaza.

No, it’s not just a biting crossword clue for “millennial”: they have all previouslybeen crownedword of the year. Admittedly, there are now so many “words of the year” that, if they were physical objects, they could make a decent-sized museum collection. Which, as it happens, is exactly how I like to imagine them – artefacts of their time, telling a story of a changing society.This year’s winners – from “parasocial” (Cambridge Dictionary’s choice) to “rage bait” (Oxford English Dictionary), “67 (six-seven)” (Dictionary.com) and “slop” (Merriam-Webster) – will join the group, though where in the “museum” remains to be seen. Will they sit in the permanent collection, along with 2005’s “podcast” and 2015’s “binge-watch”? Or the archive, where irrelevances such as 2007’s “w00t” are packed off to, to see out their days alongside David Cameron’s lesser-remembered very bad idea: not Brexit (Collins, 2016), but “big society” (Oxford, 2010).Play curator with me, and let’s take a tour.To look back at the winning words from the past 20 years is to look back at life through rose-tinted glasses. Seriously, people bang on about the hope and optimism of the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, but how about a 2006 Britain seemingly so untroubled that its Oxford word of the year was “bovvered”? Or a country where, in contrast to 2024’s shared cultural experience of “enshittification”, it was “sudoku” (Oxford, 2005)? Were these times really much simpler – sorry, “simples” (a 2009 winner)? Surely not, given some words feel like prophecy. Indeed, when in 2009 I graduated into a recession, blissfully unaware of how it would define my generation, I’d have done well to have registered 2008’s “credit crunch” and “bailout”. Still, earlier winners feel almost innocent: Merriam-Webster’s 2013 “science” (that’s right, no particular field, just science) or Dictionary.com’s “change” (2010). See also: “youthquake” (Oxford, 2017), “occupy” (American Dialect Society,2011) and “feminism” (Merriam-Webster, 2017). These words speak to a hunger for progress, even as darker terms such as “fake news” (Collins, 2017) or “post-truth” (Oxford, 2016) emerged.But it’s 2018 where it gets really bleak. Words that would suit an apocalyptic horseman dominate (“climate emergency”, “permacrisis”, “toxic”, “gaslighting”, “polarisation”), before giving way to the language of fleeting tech crazes (“NFT”, “homer”) and variations on the theme of ennui (“quiet quitting”, “existential”). Which I suppose will at least give future visitors to the museum an understanding of not only what burned Rome, but the soundtrack coming from the metaphorical fiddle (Charli xcx, duh: “brat” was Collins’ winner last year).As for this year’s words, many fit right in. “Rage bait” surely belongs in the central gallery, given it’s a now-permanent fixture of online life, and a neat summary of how algorithms reward emotional manipulation. Meanwhile, I only hope “slop” – the grim churn of mind-numbing AI video – goes the way of “metaverse”(Oxford runner-up, 2021) as another bit of overhyped ephemera, quietly scrubbed from our lives once we all realise how rubbish it is. To the basement with thee!What about “parasocial”, this year’sdarkest winner? It may need a room of its own. It gained relevance amid stories of users bonding with AI and peak fan moments such as Taylor Swift’s engagement dominating the internet. Personally, it is not the “fan” element that gives me the chills, but rather how parasocial is replacing real human connection, as we continue to retreat from lives lived with one another to something far lonelier.Which brings me to “six-seven”. Where to place a “word” such as that? Dictionary.com’s 2025 choice, it’s the first ever word of the year that is near-exclusively used by teenagers. Meaning “so-so” but mainly deployed at random to annoy adults, it is a joke without a punchline. So there’s only one place for it: the Mona Lisa spot.Hear me out. You see, there’s one other trend that has emerged from word of the year recently, and it’s one I can get behind: the fun words. “Goblin mode”, a term for slobbing out (Oxford, 2022)? A truly poetic self-effacement. How about “rizz” (2023)? One could argue it shouldn’t be included given it’s just an abbreviation of another word (charisma), but what could be morenowthan a word that works quickly, flexibly (“rizz” is also a verb, dontcha know) and I’m sure from home too, if it could.Some might regard this slang as “brain rot” (Oxford, 2024). But humour is precious. It’s human, even if distilled through tech. And crucially, it’s full of potential. Because if you can share a joke, you can truly connect. And if you can connect, you can rebuild.And so we return to “six-seven”. How does this sound for its exhibition placard? “This form of ‘anti-humour’, though it appears senseless and even nihilistic, is in fact a piece of guerilla performance art exposing the meaninglessness of our times.” OK, OK, maybe I’ve taken this curator thing a bit too far. Because it’s actually quite simple: saying “six-seven” at random is just a very, very teenage thing to do. And that is great.I say this as someone who was at school during the height of the Budweiser advert frenzy, in which schoolkids would burst into “wassupppp” at quite literally any time. Yes, it was random – that was the point, as was the fact no one else was laughing bar the perpetrator and their friends. With “six-seven”, we see the hallmarks of this same daft, kind of annoying and quintessentially teenage energy. It may be internet slang, but its power is in real life – forging social bonds with other teens, and creating a shared identity. And given everything we hear about teens being worryingly self-conscious, lacking friendship and paralysed by anxiety, this harmless bit of fun heartens me. Maybe the kids really are alright. Could it be the most hopeful word of 2025? The one that symbolised the beginning of something beautiful again, a triumph of human nature as we start to rebuild a new world? We shall see. For now, we shall consider it on display, pending further review.Coco Khan is a freelance writer and co-host of the politics podcast Pod Save the UKExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionLinguisticscommentShareReuse this content"

The network is one of the outlets where you can find reality-based and largely dependable reporting – especially in breaking news situations like the one that wasdevelopingnear a New Hampshire storage facility.ButCNN, now 45 years old, is in a precarious situation as two huge media conglomerates vie for ownership of its parent company, Warner Bros Discovery.Whatever the outcome, the fate of CNN has become part of a high-stakes game of corporate ownership, not as a question of what benefits the information-seeking public.America’s media system isn’t set up for that lofty goal. It’s set up for corporate profitability, for shareholder gain, for ever-increasing size and ever-decreasing competition.It’s time to accept that the US supreme court is illegitimate and must be replaced | Ryan Doerfler and Samuel MoynRead more“This is yet another example of the deep structural problems with roots in decades of policy decisions,” said Victor Pickard, author ofDemocracy Without Journalism?and a University of Pennsylvania media policy professor.The speculation about who will own Warner Bros Discovery – will it beNetflixorParamount Skydance? – misses a larger point.“It gets presented as a business story with powerful individuals as the protagonists, but there is very little discussion of the public interest,” Pickard said. He, along with two other scholars, is the author of a sweepingnew Roosevelt Institute reportabout media consolidation and its dire effects, addressing how we got here and pointing a better way forward.The CNN scenario is complicated byDonald Trump’s views about a network he has long portrayed as perhaps his primary “fake news”antagonist. Recallthechantsof “CNN sucks!” at the president’s rallies, or his administration’s punitivewithdrawalof Jim Acosta’s press credentials, or hissparringwith Collins in press briefings.Trump now says thatCNN needs new ownership. You can read that as ownership that will protect him from criticism and scrutiny. That is part of why he seems to come down on the side of Paramount Skydance, which has madea hostile bidintended to overcome an earlier accepted deal by Netflix. The Warner Brothers Discoveryboard rejectedthe Paramount bid this week, but there are still plenty of regulatory battles ahead, and the Trump administration may well involve itself.Trump has reason to like that suitor more. For one thing, it is controlled by David Ellison, son of the Trump-friendlyLarry Ellison, one of the world’s richest people.Paramount, parent of CBS News, also recently installed the right-leaningBari Weiss, known for her “anti-woke” beliefs, as the top editor of that storied news network. Trump haspraised Weiss publicly,and as an example of her news judgment, she recentlyconducteda “town hall” interview with Erika Kirk, the widow of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk.Notably, ifNetflixprevails, CNN and other cable outlets would first be spun off into a separate entity, and they would not be part of the Warner Bros Discovery acquisition. That would be a relief to many at the network, but it’s hardly a safe harbor. That arrangement could set up CNN and the others for another sale. It never ends.If you ask Timothy Wu, much of this is illegal, anyway. The prominent critic of big tech’s dominance of major media platforms wrote recently that anti-trust laws should prohibit both deals.“Either merger would be bad for the country, and both should be challenged by anti-trust authorities,” Wu recentlywrotein the New York Times.Trump’s crackdown on factchecker visas won’t protect free speech | Margaret SullivanRead moreWhatever happens in this situation, the bigger problem remains. And Pickard, for one, is not ready to throw up his hands and say nothing can be done to reverse what has happened.“What we have now is a very anti-democratic system, but we shouldn’t give in to learned helplessness,” he said. Policy decisions – dating back to the 1930s and 1940s in the heyday of radio – helped to create this hyper-commercialized monster, and new policy decisions can address it.Will that happen in the Trump era in which Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carrwon’t even affirmthat the agency is independent? Reform is very unlikely now, but that doesn’t mean it will never happen – or that it should be regarded as impossible.Policies that strengthen independent news organizations, bolster local journalism, fund public media, and prohibit the concentration of media power in too few hands are not only possible – they are necessary for a functioning democracy.In the world of media ownership, bigger isn’t better. And news organizations including CNN shouldn’t be pawns in the latest merger game.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCNNOpinionTelevision industryTV newsUS television industryNetflixNews agenciesNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

Both vessels were headed to Asia.The British maritime risk management company Vanguard told Reuters that the vessel was believed to be the Panama-flagged Centuries and was intercepted east of Barbados in the Caribbean Sea.The vessel does not appear to be on the list of US-sanctioned vessels, according to multiple reports, which would represent an escalation in American enforcement of its blockade.In a post onXSaturday afternoon, the US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the US Coast Guard and the defense department had stopped the tanker early Saturday morning in “pre-dawn action”.“The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco-terrorism in the region,” Noem said. “We will find you, and we will stop you.”The administration hassuggestedthat any vessel carrying Venezuelan oil could be subject to the US blockade and has been working to expand its list of sanctioned vessels.The first oil tanker that the US seized earlier in the month was on the sanctions list and was what the White Housecalleda “sanctioned shadow vessel known for carrying black-market sanctioned oil”.The development comes as Trump and his advisers haverefused to rule outthe potential for open conflict withVenezuelaas its country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, has urged his navy to escort oil tankers, defying the largest US fleet deployed in the region in decades.After the first oil tanker was seized, the Venezuelan government said in a statement that the US had committed “blatant theft” and described the action as “an act of international piracy”.In an interview broadcast on Friday morning,Trumptold NBC News that going to war with Maduro’s regime remains on the table. “I don’t rule it out, no,” he said in a phone interview with the network.The US further ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela this week, accusing the country of taking US oil and saying the US lost out on investments in the country. “You remember they took all of our energy rights,” Trump said. “They took all of our oil not that long ago. And we want it back. They took it – they illegally took it.” On Tuesday,the US president ordereda “total and complete” blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.View image in fullscreenThe Centuries crude oil tanker, last docked in Venezuela, as it is apprehended by the US Coast Guard.Photograph: US secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem’s X account/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Thursday, theUS militarycarried out its latest lethal strike on a vessel it said was engaged in drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific, killing four people, and bringing the death toll to 99 in its campaign of striking alleged drug-trafficking boats since September.Maduro claims the US seeks regime change instead of its stated goal of stopping drug trafficking.The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum,waded into the dispute on Wednesday, declaring that the United Nations was “nowhere to be seen” and asked that it step up to “prevent any bloodshed”.Jeremy Paner, former US sanctions investigator, told Reuters the seizure of the vessel Saturday “marks a further increase in Trump’s pressure on Venezuela”.“It also runs counter to Trump’s statement that the US would impose a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers,” he said.Since the first seizure, Venezuelan crude exports have fallen sharply. While many vessels picking up oil in Venezuela are under sanctions, others transporting the country’s oil and crude from Iran and Russia have not been sanctioned, and some companies, particularly Chevron in the US, transport Venezuelan oil in their own authorized ships.China is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, which accounts for roughly 4% of its imports, with shipments in December on track to average more than 600,000 barrels per day, analysts have said.For now, the oil market is well-supplied and there are millions of barrels of oil on tankers off the coast of China waiting to offload. If the embargo stays in place for some time, then the loss of nearly a million barrels a day of crude supply is likely to push oil prices higher.Since the US imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela in 2019, traders and refiners buying Venezuelan oil have resorted to a “shadow fleet” of tankers that disguise their location and to vessels sanctioned for transporting Iranian or Russian oil.The dark or shadow fleet is considered exposed to possible punitive measures from the US, shipping analysts have said. Centuries, which loaded in Venezuela under the false name “Crag” and is part of the dark fleet, was carrying some 1.8m barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude oil bound for China, according to internal documents from state oil company PDVSA, the oil’s seller.The vessel departed Venezuelan waters on Wednesday after being briefly escorted by the Venezuelan navy, according to company sources and satellite images obtained by TankerTrackers.com.The crude was bought by Satau Tijana Oil Trading, one of many intermediaries involved in PDVSA’s sales to Chinese independent refiners, the documents showed.As of this week, of more than 70 oil tankers in Venezuelan waters that are part of the shadow fleet, around 38 are under sanctions by the US treasury, according to data from TankerTrackers.com. Of those, at least 15 are loaded with crude and fuel, it added.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryVenezuelaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

paying £20.01Taro KanekoSat 20 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShareDrivers have accused a leading petrol station security company of issuing “false” fuel theft debts, which left one family unable to fill up their car at more than 1,000 filling stations for more than a year.Amjad Khan and his family were barred from multiple petrol stations around Blackburn for 19 months after he was accused of driving out of an Esso petrol station in Manchester without paying for £20.01 of fuel.VARS Technology – which provides automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras and debt recovery services to one in eight petrol stations across the UK – wrote to Nasim Khan, the registered owner of the couple’s car, in July 2023 and told her she had to pay for the cost of the fuel, plus a £30 admin fee: a total of £50.01.Amjad, 58, was adamant he paid for the fuel with cash and was forced into a one-and-a-half-year battle with the company.During this time the couple’s car was barred from the more than 1,300 petrol stations that VARS Technology operates at – leaving them struggling to refuel their car.Nasim described the rejection from petrol stations as “embarrassing”, saying that an alarm system would trigger as if there was “an armed raid” any time they drove on to a forecourt with the company’s security system.The couple say they were even left unable to visit their son, who lives more than 200 miles away in London, out of fear that they would be left stranded without fuel if petrol stations refused to serve them.Amjad requested video footage from VARS Technology and the petrol station operator in order to prove that he paid for the fuel with cash but says he never received it.A debt recovery company called DCBL then sent them a demand for £140.01 in October 2023 and threatened a claim against the couple if they did not pay.During a small claims mediation hearing a year later, Amjad said VARS Technology presented a still image of him dispensing fuel – captured by its ANPR camera – and a handwritten note by a forecourt employee as evidence of fuel theft.However, Amjad said the company’s timeline of events made “no sense”, as the handwritten note stated that he had driven off the forecourt at 10.28pm, while the ANPR image showed him dispensing fuel three minutes later at 10.31pm.View image in fullscreenAmjad said VARS Technology presented a still image of him dispensing fuel, captured by its ANPR camera.Photograph: Rob Hawkins/AlamyDespite the couple’s efforts to prove their innocence, they received a letter from Burnley combined court centre about a claim that VARS Technology had submitted against them, and that they would have to attend court in February this year.However, when the couple arrived at court, they found that VARS Technology had discontinued the claim and was no longer going to present its case to a judge.During the one-and-a-half years the Blackburn couple spent disputing the debt, they described VARS Technology as “intimidating, aggressive and having zero customer support”.The couple are not alone in their frustration: on review websites such as Trustpilot, a number of individuals have accused VARS Technology of wrongfully issuing them with fuel theft debts and typically providing no evidence of them committing the alleged offence other than a still photo of them dispensing fuel.VARS Technology provides forecourt protection and debt recovery services for major petrol station operators including Asda, EG Group and Valli Forecourts.Angela Binns says she was issued with a fuel theft debt this summer after allegedly not paying for fuel at an Esso petrol station in Leeds in May – despite having a bank statement proving she had paid.The 59-year-old’s husband, Mark King, sent VARS Technology copies of her bank statement to appeal against the debt but the company did not discontinue it.King says: “They just steamrolled on to debt collection and should have stopped the process as soon as they received the appeal.“This has had a huge impact on my wife, to the point she can’t even talk about it without getting stressed.”The “stress and anxiety” from the situation led to the couple paying DCBL the debt in order to “just move on from it”.An ex-employeeof VARS Technology has told Guardian Money that the ANPR software is “terrible” and has been known to the company as an issue since 2023.A spokesperson for VARS Technology said: “We completely refute the suggestion that our market-leading ANPR system is unreliable, which derives from a false and unsubstantiated claim from a former employee.“The system is trusted by thousands of petrol stations to protect them against the growing issue of drive-offs.“The VARS ANPR system holds multiple accreditations, including Police Preferred Specification through the Secured by Design scheme.”They added: “We deal with thousands of fuel recovery claims every week on behalf of forecourt operators, in many cases small, family-owned and run businesses where fuel theft is a significant threat to their viability as a business.“Incidents like those flagged up are rare, and when they do happen, we make every effort to resolve them promptly and fairly.”Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

The company urged customers to allow extra time for their journey.The Port of Dover post said: “We also ask that all port-bound traffic remain on the main roads to the port, the A20 and A2, and keep the local roads clear for the community.“If customers do miss their scheduled sailing due to the wait times, their ferry operator will place them on the next available crossing.”An estimated 37.5m leisure trips by car were planned between Wednesday and Christmas Eve, the RAC said.Shaun Jones, an AA expert patrolperson, said: “It’s beginning to look a lot like traffic. Our advice is simple: plan ahead, check your route and allow extra time.“Patience will be your best present this year.”The RAC’s mobile servicing and repairs team leader, Nick Mullender, said: “With record numbers predicted to be taking to the roads this Christmas, journeys have the potential to be Grinch-worthy without some careful planning.“The week before Christmas is one of the few times of year when most of the UK hits the road simultaneously, with 2025 looking to be the busiest getaway period since our records began.”National Highways, which manages England’s motorways and major A roads, said it would “remove as many roadworks as we safely can so everyone can get where they need to go this Christmas”.Explore more on these topicsTransportRoad transportKentFerry travelEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The vehicle was later found outside a storage facility in Salem, Massachusetts, and, along with it, the body of Neves Valente.Investigators have since confirmed that Neves Valente had been a doctoral student at Brown and previously studied with Loureiro and attended the same academic program between 1995 and 2000 at Instituto Superior Técnico, Portugal’s premier engineering university.A motive for the killings has not been formally established by authorities. Areport from Boston’s WCVB5on Saturday quoted a former classmate of Neves Valente that the suspect was “bored” and “hated” his time at Brown.Scott Watson, now a professor at Syracuse university, told the outlet that Neves Valente complained that the classes at Brown were too easy. “He was bored because he knew more than any of us, he already should’ve had a PhD,” Watson said. “He hated Brown and he hated Providence.”Portugal’s foreign minister, Paulo Rangel, said on Friday that his government was taken aback by revelations that a Portuguese man was the suspect in the mass shooting at Brown and the killing of Loureiro,according to the Associated Press.He said Portugal has provided “very broad cooperation” and told the national news agency Lusa that “the investigation is far from over”.In the wake of the killings, the Trump administration has ordered the suspension of the green card lottery program that it claimed Neves Valente had used to enter the US in 2000. “This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” the US homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem,saidon X.But Oscar Perez, the police chief in Providence, Rhode Island, said Valente entered the US on a student visa and became a permanent resident in 2017.Explore more on these topicsBrown University shootingNew HampshireRhode IslandMassachusettsGun crimeUS crimeShareReuse this content"

As the Trump administration abandons US climate initiatives, can California fill the void?Dani AnguianoSat 20 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 20 Dec 2025 10.02 ESTShareAs officials from around the world met in Brazil for the Cop30 climate summit last month, the US president was nowhere to be found, nor were any members of his cabinet. Instead, the most prominent American voice in Belém was that of the California governor,Gavin Newsom.During the five days he spent in Brazil, Newsom described Donald Trump as an “invasive species” and condemned his rollback of policies aimed at reducing emissions and expanding renewable energy. Newsom, long considered a presidential hopeful, argued that, as the US retreated, California would step up in its place as a “stable, reliable” climate leader and partner.Among the talking points he used to demonstrate California’s leadership was its progress on renewable energy – and the battery capacity needed to store that power.“We’re running the fourth-largest economy in the world [on] 67%, two thirds, clean energy on nine out of 10 days in 2025,” Newsom said. “Outside of China, there’s only one other jurisdiction in the world – California – that has as much battery storage implemented.”The Golden state has transformed how it powers its main electrical grid in recent years, setting ambitious targets to create an emission-free grid by 2045 and investing heavily in solar, wind and battery storage. And as the federal government abandons climate initiatives, California seems poised to take on an increasingly important global role.The state appears to have much to celebrate. Since 2019, the state has added 30,800 megawatts of clean energy and battery storage. And while natural gas still remains the top energy source in the state, that’s on the decline:California sawits largest-ever year-to-year drop in natural gas production this year.Meanwhile, solar and batteries, which allow energy to be stored for later use, providing an alternative to gas, are stepping up to replace it, said Mark Jacobson, a Stanford professor and renewable energy expert: “This is a remarkable shift.”View image in fullscreenWind turbines generate electricity near Palm Springs, California.Photograph: Robert Alexander/Getty Images‘A leader in the clean-energy space’When touting his achievements as governor, Newsom has frequently pointed to California’s grid. State lawmakers in 2018 passed abillrequiring California to generate 60% of its electricity from renewable and zero-carbon sources by 2030 and 100% by 2045.So far, California appears to be on track, Jacobson said. Clean energy accounted for 67% of retail electricity sales in 2023, according to the mostrecently available data. For the first time, clean energy – which the state recognizes renewables such as as solar, wind, small hydro, geothermal, and biomass, as well as large hydroelectric and nuclear – provided 100% of power to the state’s main grid almost every day for at least some of the day in 2025.Renewables arebooming worldwideand are expected to grow more quickly than any major energy source over the next 10 years with more projects in the next five years than in the last 40, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).California is no exception and is in the midst of what the state’s energy commission (CEC) has described as the “biggest transformation of its power grid in a century”. The state is seeing new solar and battery storage projects in “record numbers” and is expected to soon completely eliminate coal from its power supply, according to the CEC.Key to this growth has been the expansion of battery storage, a crucial tool to retain the energy produced from renewable sources. In 2019, California had 771 megawatts – by October of this year, it had almost 17,000. The state has 2.5 times more battery storage available than it did in 2022.The batteries have helped the state avoid rolling blackouts and allowed the California Independent System Operator (Caiso), the non-profit that manages the flow of electricity on the state’s main grid, to store solar energy when there is an excess during the day.A line chart demonstrating that California’s electricity is increasingly coming from solar“Then we can use that stored energy and release it in the evening hours when the sun is going down,” said Mark Rothleder, Caiso’s senior vice-president and chief operating officer. “Having a mix of resources that are capable of producing when needed is an important addition as we try to make this transition to renewable resources.”But, he said, solar and wind are intermittent sources, meaning they can only be generated when there is sun or wind and the state’s main grid continues to rely on gas resources that can be utilized as needed.Natural gas was the single largest resource for electricity production in 2024, but natural gas generation fell by 8% that year, in part because of the growing role of solar and wind power and enhanced battery storage, according to the CEC.Nuclear power too plays a role – in 2024, it accounted for nearly 10% of the state’s total electricity generation – although not without controversy. California has been a center of anti-nuclear activism for decades, but supporters argue it could be a crucial tool to provide reliable power as the state transitions from fossil fuels.While natural gas may be on the decline, it’s far from obsolete – and is relied on as a critical backup during times of peak energy usage. California has nearly 200 natural gas plants that provideroughly a third of the state’selectricity generation, said Julia Dowell, a senior campaign organizer with the Sierra Club.“California is seen as a leader in the clean-energy space,” Dowell said. “But we’re really struggling to figure out how we meet demand in those evening hours when we’re seeing the most electricity demand, and that’s historically when we’ve relied on gas plants.”A 2025 report from Regenerate California, which Dowell helped author, found that batteries are a less expensive and more reliable alternative to gas plants, and reduce toxic air pollution.“They can directly compete with gas plants, and they can provide even more benefits because of their ability to ramp up so quickly,” said Heena Singh, with the California Environmental Justice Alliance and a report author. “That’s something that is important in California, where we have all these heatwaves and natural disasters.”Fending off the Trump administrationCalifornia has long been a frequent target of Trump’s White House – and strife has only intensified during his second term.With Trump back in power, the federal government has been focused on expanding fossil fuels and putting a damper on seemingly any effort to reduce emissions. The White House has proposed offshore lease sales along California’s coast. The president blocked California’s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2030, and his EPA terminated a $7bn program to bring solar energy to low-income communities.The administration cancelled $679m in funding for offshore wind developments across the US – California was expected to see about $427m for a project to build the first offshore wind terminal on the west coast. Months earlier, California and nearly 20 other statessuccessfullysued after the federal government moved to pause offshore wind development.More lawsuits are expected. The state attorney general’s office has established an office dedicated to pushing back against the president’s agenda.View image in fullscreenCalifornia has positioned itself as a counterweight to the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy.Photograph: ABACA/ShutterstockRepublicans and theTrump administrationhave also sought to blame the transition to renewable energy for high utility bills – California has some of the most expensive in the nation. But experts attribute those costs to power companies passing the costs of wildfires to customers.Despite these pressures, California’s energy transition is well under way – and unlikely to reverse course.“You’re going to see California fiercely litigating every single effort of the federal government to undo the fight against climate change and the fight against clean energy,” said Noah Perch-Ahern, an environmental attorney. “I think that’s going to continue for years.”Meanwhile, advocates and experts hope to see California continue to expand clean energy with more rooftop solar projects that can reduce demand on the grid, and ultimately phase out gas plants.“We’re just really hoping that people start to recognize that we don’t need these gas plants,” said Maia Leroy, an author of the Regenerate report, adding that there are significant costs to keeping them running even when the state isn’t using them for power. “It’s time to shut them down. It’s an expensive insurance policy.”She’s hopeful California will continue to move ahead despite the federal obstacles.“We made it through the first Trump administration. California survived, and we never once went back on any of our clean-energy goals. And so I don’t foresee that being an issue again this term,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaRenewable energyGavin NewsomTrump administrationUS politicsClimate crisisWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Greater warmth enables pests to develop faster, produce more generations each year and attack crops for longer as winters shorten. Rising temperatures are also helping pestsinvade places further from the equatorand on higher ground that were previously too cold.As a result, the climate-driven flourishing of pests will be worst in temperate places, such as Europe and the US, the researchers said. Temperatures may have already hit a limit for some insects in the tropics, they said, although the cutting of croplands into tropical forests is supporting more pests.Pest movement is alsobeing accelerated via food exportsalong global trade networks. In parallel, the destruction of natural habitats and heavy use of pesticides and fertilisers is crippling the natural predators of pests, while the expansion of farmland creates new areas for crop pests to infest.Pests and diseases destroy about 40% of global crop production, “creating a major challenge for global food security”, the scientists said. The direct impact of the climate crisis on wheat, rice and maize is predicted to cut yields by 6-10% for every 1C of global heating.“The world is focused on these major grains – wheat, rice, maize, soybean – and it’s a very simplified and vulnerable system,” said Prof Dan Bebber, from the University of Exeter, UK. Monocultures – large areas growing a single crop variety – could be wiped out by a single pest. “We’ve been lucky so far. But with the multiple threats of climate change and numerous pests and diseases, we need to start thinking about a resilient system to feed everyone.”“The green revolution, with simplification, plant breeding, massive use of fertiliser and fungicide and pesticide, has saved millions of people from hunger,” he said. “But that was in a world where we weren’t warming rapidly, where pests and pathogens were only just starting their global journey, and where the negative impacts on soils and biodiversity weren’t coming back to bite us. We were living on borrowed time but we’re heading towards crunch time, and we need to do things differently.”The analysis,published in the journal Nature Reviews Earth & Environmentby Bebber and international colleagues, is a conservative assessment of the increased pest damage to crops due to the climate crisis as it focused on insects and key grain crops, and did not include microbial diseases, fungi and nematodes and the whole range of foods that are grown.Crop pests have evolved alongside the plants they target, which provide high quality food sources, and can reproduce and disperse rapidly. They have often developed pesticide resistance.Intensive agriculture’s use of fertilisers and irrigation boosts the quality and quantity of the plants, meaning crop pests are much less affected by the destruction of natural habitats which has seenmany wild insect populations plummet.Rising temperatures can cause sudden impacts, the analysis said, with small temperature rises allowing insects to produce another generation within a season. “When the Colorado potato beetle manages to get through another life cycle, that causes big problems,” said Bebber.The climate crisis is increasing heat levels but also causing greater downpours of rain in places. These can wash away small pests, the analysis said, but the wetter conditions benefit the pests overall. First, as small creatures, insects are at high risk of drying out, and second, evaporation of rainwater cools the local environment, protecting them from heat.The scientists said environmentally-friendly pest protection can be achieved by restoring natural habitats to boost the numbers of parasitic wasps andother natural pest predators.“Our ever simpler agricultural systems are vulnerable but are maintained by fungicides and pesticides, which is OK as long as they work,” Bebber said. “But we’ve got the evolution of pesticide resistance and we’ve got to think hard now about whether we want to use diversification as a strategy to help make our systems more resilient.”Diversification could also include growing different varieties of a crop together and integrating crop and animal farming. Examples of the latter include traditional systems in Japan where ducks eat the snails and insects that attack rice and in the UK where sheep grazing on winter wheat remove leaves affected by fungal disease.The analysis also said that artificial intelligence can boost crop protection by analysing field and weather data to predict infestations and devise strategies to tackle them.Explore more on these topicsFood securityFoodClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

This was a manifesto commitment, and the new animal welfare strategy that will be announced on Monday is understood to outline a planned legislative pathway to the ban.‘No one knows where it came from’: first wild beaver spotted in Norfolk in 500 yearsRead moreCampaigners have long said the rules need to be tightened because foxes are still often torn to shreds by dogs who are following an artificial fox scent and run into the path of a live animal.The nature minister,Mary Creagh, said: “Brown hares are a cherished part of our countryside, an iconic British species, and it’s simply wrong that so many are shot during breeding season. I am determined to stop the decline of this wonderful animal.”It is hoped that the animal welfare package, to be announced in full, will also raise the spirits ofLabourMPs and voters after months of party infighting, continuing rises in the cost of living, and a prolonged slump in the polls.Previous polling showed79% of the public thoughtthe law on foxhunting should be tightened to stop trail hunts from accidentally killing foxes. Labour sources said their polling showed 85% of the public believed there was a moral duty to protect animal welfare.The new close season will ban hare hunting during the breeding months of February to October to protect mothers and the young. At present, hares are shot for their meat, for fun, and because some landowners in the countryside believe it is overpopulated with the animals.However, the claim that the countryside is overpopulated with hares is dubious. Brown hare populations in England and Wales have declined by 80% over the past century.George Eustice, the former Conservative environment secretary, tried while in post to implement a close season for hares but was blocked by No 10.He told the Guardian: “The first principle of conservation is to protect species during their breeding season, so it is excellent news that the government will now create a modern close season on the shooting of hares. Every year, approximately 200,000 hares are killed in organised, commercial shoots during February and March and this has a devastating impact on the orphaned leverets, which are left to starve to death.“Even the Victorians recognised the need for a close season but the 1892 act was based on a ban on sales, so no longer works. The current government deserves credit for finally getting this important change done.”Explore more on these topicsHuntingConservationEnglandAnimalsWildlifeAnimal welfareLabournewsShareReuse this content"

That was five times less than the emissions in 2018.Last year, more than 40% of electricity generation on Christmas Day came from renewables. It stood at 1.7% in 2009. Earlier this month, wind turbines generated enough electricity “to light up nearly 3bn strings of 100-bulb LED fairy lights” at one point.Neso said an extra 2GW of wind and 3GW of solar power came on to the network in 2025, taking Britain’s total renewables capacity to an historic high of 53GW. Greater capacity, combined with lower than average energy demand for the time of year, should mean emissions are lower on the 25 December.While power may be greener this Christmas, heightened consumption at the end of the year can have a damaging impact on the environment. UK households have already thrown away anestimated 168m light-up Christmas items and other “fast tech” gifts over the past year, according to research by Material Focus.Meanwhile, separate research found that 1.1bn of all types of electric products and 450m batteries are thrown away irresponsibly each year.A greener Christmas this year comes as the government tries to transition away from fossil fuels to net zero by 2050. Analysis by Neso earlier this year found the UK already spends about10% of its gross domestic producton investments related to net zero, and forecast that these costs would climb over the coming years and remain higher than they are today until the 2030s.It forecast that costs could peak at about £460bn by 2029 in its most ambitious scenario, before beginning to decline to about 5% of GDP by 2050 or roughly £220bn a year. In the “falling behind” scenario, which is based in a future in which Britain misses its net zero target and ignores the cost of climate damage, the total costs are about £350bn lower.Explore more on these topicsEnergyEnergy industryRenewable energySolar powerWind powerWastenewsShareReuse this content"

Since August 2022 the company has received between £28m and £70m.The government stepped in on Tuesday to give Ineos £50m to support Grangemouth, fearing that without it the UK would lose its last plant making ethylene, an important material for making plastics. The government also backed a £75m loan guarantee, while Ineos will invest £30m of its own money.Ineos had alreadyclosed the next-door oil refinery in September 2024with the cost of 400 jobs, in ahuge blow to the communityand a political problem for the government.Ratcliffe, who is worth $14.5bn (£11bn) according toBloomberg’s billionaires index, asked the government for help in October.It comes at a time when the expansive group of Ineos companies, controlled by the 73-year-old, hasbeen under financial pressure, in part because of the big increase in energy costs after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Fitch Ratings downgraded Ineos’s credit rating in September, in a sign of increasing concern over its ability to repay its debts. Ratcliffe has also had to spend heavilyon his off-road car venture, the Ineos Grenadier, as well asseeking to turn around Manchester United, in which he holds a minority stake.Most of the previous state aid to Ineos came in the form of tax breaks in return for “voluntary agreements to reduce energy use and carbon dioxide emissions”. The tax breaks for Ineos’s plants in Grangemouth and Hull are reported as ranges, rather than giving precise figures.An Ineos spokesperson said the aid was not “special treatment” for Ineos, but was “awarded against strict criteria, and available to any UK business that qualifies”.Ratcliffe this week welcomed the £50m support for the chemicals business in a statement included in a government press release. However, Ineos issued a separate release that contained much more critical comments, in which the billionaire strongly criticised government policy, including carbon taxes that are paid by industrial users on their energy bills.“The answer is NOT decarbonisation by deindustrialisation,” Ratcliffe wrote. “Without a strong manufacturing base, the economy will continue to decline. High energy costs and punitive carbon charges are driving industry out of the UK at an alarming rate.”In further comments to media outlets this week, Ratcliffe described carbon taxes as “the most idiotic tax in the world”. He argued that the taxes leave UK plants at a disadvantage to foreign rivals, which do not have to pay the extra costs. Most chemicals and plastics arenot part of the UK’s initial carbon border adjustment mechanism, a tax on high-carbon imports such as steel, glass, cement and fertilisers.An Ineos spokesperson said: “Ineos has invested over £400m at Grangemouth in the last five years to keep it one of the most efficient chemical plants in Europe and to protect skilled jobs. UK chemicals have had a brutal year, yet everyone relies on this industry every day. If we don’t make these essential materials in the UK, they are imported instead, often from higher-carbon production abroad.”Colin Pritchard, head of sustainability and external affairs for Ineos’s Olefins & Polymers division, this week said the money for Grangemouth would be devoted to improving energy efficiency, cutting its carbon emissions and improving performance.He said the site, which runs an ethylene cracker that takes North Sea gas and liquified petroleum gas from the US to make its petrochemicals, had been under “extreme pressure” from surging energy costs linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the UK’s carbon taxes.Ineos has previously receivedtax breaks worth hundreds of millions of eurosfrom the EU. Ratcliffe was a prominent backer of the campaign to leave the EU.Explore more on these topicsIneosJim RatcliffenewsShareReuse this content"

A later run also allows more time to save, with many people receiving their monthly pay packet over the next few days.After a muted Black Friday, shoppers have also been holding out for last-minute bargains in the annual game of chicken with retailers for whom Christmas is a vital part of their year when most – if not all – profits are made.After a relatively mild autumn and winter, clothing retailers, such as Primark, New Look and H&M, have already launched discounts in a bid to tempt out cautious shoppers, with retailers such as Currys suggesting last month’s budget has not improved consumer sentiment.On Friday, the toy specialist The Entertainer launched discounts of up to 60% on more than 950 toys and games in stores, also suggesting trade has not been booming.Zoe Morris, a savings expert at VoucherCodes.co.uk, said: “No matter how organised you think you’ve been, there’s always a few Christmas essentials that catch you out and have you dashing to the shops. And this year, Brits are leaving their shopping to the very last second, with an extra 10 million people set to make a purchase this ‘panic weekend’ compared to last year (39.3m) – that’s 26.2% more shoppers.”The later run is expected to benefit high street shops as concerns about online orders arriving on time increase closer to 25 December.Many retailers, such as Next and Currys, cut off next-day deliveries by 22 December, although some such as Marks & Spencer and John Lewis allow shoppers to leave online orders until 23 December if they pick up in stores. Some introduce additional charges for deliveries during this peak period further prompting a shift to high street shopping.This weekend also kicks off the battle for the festive dinner plate. Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl have cut the price of festive veg to just 5p while Sainsbury’s and Tesco were charging 15p. Both Tesco and Morrisons are also giving out free carrots to children next week.The battle to offer the cheapest turkey is also intensifying. Tesco has cut the price of its small, medium and large whole turkeys to £2.50 a kilo for Clubcard members. This is cheaper than the supermarket’s equivalent offers both last year and the year before, with a small bird that serves six costing £7.50. Lidl is matching this deal on its small turkeys.Retailers are hoping spending will come through aftera pre-Christmas interest rate cut from the Bank of Englandon Thursday, despite low consumer confidence and signs thatshoppers have been cutting back.More than a third of shoppers say they will be spending less as a result of the autumn budget, according to a recent survey by advisory firm RSM, with a similar amount saying they will spend the same and 27% expecting to spend more.Jacqui Baker, the head of consumer markets at RSM UK, said: “In the near to medium term caution is king. The budget gave consumers little comfort over the outlook of the UK economy and appears to have exacerbated an already cautious consumer. Households are battening down the hatches on spending.”The advisory firm Accenture said its research suggested a slightly more positive mood with more than half of people in Britain set to keep the Christmas budget steady – turning to budget supermarkets or cutting back on presents to offset inflation. Some are also using AI chatbots to seek out bargains.Matt Jeffers, the retail strategy lead at Accenture’s UK business, said: “After several years of managing a high cost of living, our data suggests that this year we’re seeing some signs of cautious consumer confidence returning, but people are still hovering above the brakes, and fine-tuning their spending to make Christmas work on their terms.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryChristmasnewsShareReuse this content"

The figures from the Cabinet Office also show a cut of £1.15m in “non-ODA” funding for the region.The financial year of 2025-26 is the first in a gradual transition announced by the government towards reducing ODA from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income by 2027.Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee and a former shadow foreign secretary in Starmer’s team before the general election, said: “I visited the western Balkans earlier this month. It is quite clear they are on the frontline of the fight against Russian disinformation and interference, and I am very proud of the work the UK is doing to support them in that fight - for their security and all of Europe’s. More work is needed to support independent media, not less. People are hungry to learn the truth and it’s very difficult to find it.”Dr Kate Ferguson, the co-executive director and head of policy and research at Protection Approaches, an NGO that works in the western Balkans on preventing identity-based violence, said the UK had a good record in the region and it should not be undermined now.“The national security strategy rightly recognises that we are in a period of intensifying strategic competition for the rules and governance of our world; in Europe we see this as Russia diversifies its efforts to undermine our democratic consensus,” she said.“It is essential then that our Foreign Office is properly and appropriately resourced to meet these growing threats to democracy and our collective safety.“In recent years, the UK has distinguished itself in the western Balkans as a trusted and principled leader when others have sometimes faltered. Now, as new forms of Russian aggression and malign influence deepen in the region, this leadership must be bolstered – and not watered down.’This week, the new head of MI6, Blaise Metreweli, said Britain was caught in “a space between peace and war” and described Russia as “aggressive, expansionist and revisionist, seeking to subjugate Ukraine and harass Nato”.Shelagh Daley, the policy team lead at Saferworld, an NGO that runs programmes in the western Balkans, said the cuts appeared to be part of a move by the UK government to deprioritise conflict prevention.“This reflects what we are seeing as a wider trend in ISF and other UK foreign aid spending amid the cuts. It appears to be a deprioritisation of work on conflict prevention and peacebuilding, even as conflict has increased globally, societies have become more divided, and basic freedoms are being curtailed.“It doesn’t seem coherent or strategic to be pulling away from programming that aims to address the causes of conflict and fragility at a time when the risks to global security are so high.”A government spokesperson said: “The figures in the report represent only one part of the UK’s total investment in the western Balkans on issues such as organised crime and hostile state activity.”“The ISF is designed to adapt to the very latest national security priorities and often funds short-term projects, meaning it is natural for spending decisions to evolve over time.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyAidAlbaniaBosnia and HerzegovinaKosovoSerbiaNorth MacedonianewsShareReuse this content"

Roads had turned into rivers and sodden St George’s flags flapped from lamp-posts at half mast.Inside the community centre, the heating was turned up, the bacon butties were on order and the tea was brewing. It was time for some Difficult Conversations. Some of them, it turned out, about those soggy flags.A group of about 15 military veterans were gathered for their weekly natter. One jovial man sported a Christmas jumper that said “When I think about you I touch my elf”. Another, an ex-SAS officer, was in a black polo shirt bearing the insignia “Taliban hunting squad”.The group likes to trade war stories and exchange the sort of near-knuckle banter that, they freely admit, “civilians find offensive”. But recently the group has been working with a charity calledWho Is Your Neighbour?, which facilitates conversations in white working-class communities along the general topic of “things you can’t say any more”.Who Is Your Neighbour? is one of five charities partnering the Guardian in its2025 Hope appeal, which supports grassroots organisations whose work brings communities together through practical projects that create hope and pride and provide an antidote to division and despair.This area of Rotherham is 94% white, a community that sprang up around a mine that closed more than 30 years ago. Grievances run deep. Inside the centre is a wall of black-and-white photos of thebattle of Orgreave, where miners were beaten by police officers. They like things smart here, especially on club nights. A sign on the door reads: “Please note! No one will be allowed into the club as from immediate effect wearing tracksuit bottoms on a Friday/Saturday.”View image in fullscreenThe morning’s discussion covered, what does it mean to you to be British? And what does the union jack or English flag mean to you?Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianTwo miles away is thehotel set alightby protesters in the summer of 2024 when asylum seekers were inside.Brad and Anna, the two facilitators from Who Is Your Neighbour?, announced the morning’s discussion topics: what does it mean to you to be British? And what does the union jack or English flag mean to you?For the next 45 minutes, the group drank tea and shared their thoughts. There were disagreements, one woman, Jane, said afterwards, but no fallings-out. “We’ve disagreed on a little bit, haven’t we?” she said, smiling at Ali, the only Asian person in the group, a veteran who served in Afghanistan.“Do you know the child sexual exploitation that happened inRotherham?” Jane explained. “I was saying, why do Pakistani men and Pakistani boys see white girls as trash?” Ali did not take offence. “The guys who got arrested and all that kind of stuff, they were my generation,” he began. He objected to the labelling of the abusers as Pakistanis. “They say Pakistani boys but they’re born and bred here, most of them. Which is quite scary.”‘People will listen’: turning anger into community pride in North ShieldsRead moreAli told the group how “since the flags went up”, Rotherham feels increasingly hostile to people with brown skin. Just the other week he was in a park and was “told to get out of the country”. He told the person shouting at him that actually he was born in Britain and had served in the army. “When I tell them I’m a veteran then they go: ‘Oh mate, yeah, yeah, brilliant, you did good for the country.’ But that’s too late because they’ve already judged me by my colour and because I’m Muslim and I’ve got a beard.”Who Is Your Neighbour? was formed in South Yorkshire in 2010 after various community activists noticed they were hearing the same thing when they talked to people, particularly in the most deprived neighbourhoods: a complaint that people “weren’t allowed” to say what was on their minds.A lot of it was about immigration. A sense that their community had changed, quickly, and it no longer felt like theirs. The solution? A programme where people could have conversations in a constructive, thoughtful way.Who Is Your Neighbour? works on three principles. One: “Better out than in” – they invite people to say what’s on their mind. Two: “Most people are alright” – they don’t judge and they start from the assumption that nobody in the conversation intends harm. Three: “Curiosity is good” – they don’t aim to preach or push forward an agenda.The group doesn’t let racism go unchallenged, but the facilitators gently prod to find out what might be behind a comment. Very few people are deliberately racist, says the charity’s chief executive, Tariq.He said: “Most people are sincere and good-hearted and well-intentioned and don’t want to set out to cause hurt to other people. But where we are now, this time that we’re living in, the voices of not wanting us to live together are really loud. Social media, media, it’s so loud.“We’re being told everything’s shit: ‘Look at this shoplifting!’ ‘Look at them lot just having a row about nothing on the street!’ ‘Look at that bus stop where people aren’t in a queue.’ And along with ‘we can’t get on together’ is a narrative that’s all about ‘this lot that’s been brought in’.”But wecanget on together, Tariq insisted. “At the end of it and the bottom of it and the top of it is: we all – most of us – want the same thing. I want my family and the people I love to be safe and looked after. And I don’t want harm for other people. A group of people in a room going: ‘We’re really struggling with how everything on our streets changed, but we want to figure out a way to make it work’ is not racism.”What Who Is Your Neighbour? does is simple – and yet rare. “We give people a voice,” says Brad, one of the facilitators. “We give people the chance to speak on subjects many of them feel like they can’t discuss”. And they do it, says participant Sue, “without anyone falling out”.* All names of participants have been changedExplore more on these topicsCharitiesGuardian charity appeal 2025CommunitiesRotherhamRaceEnglandVoluntary sectorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The ban was championed by Vern Buchanan, a Republican congressman from Florida who often focuses on animal rights issues.Buchanan called the change “a major step forward in reducing unnecessary suffering in military practices”.“With today’s advanced simulation technology, we can prepare our medics for the battlefield while reducing harm to animals,” he said in a statement to the Associated Press. “As Co-Chair of the Animal Protection Caucus, I’m proud to continue leading efforts to end outdated and inhumane practices.”US launches airstrikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in SyriaRead moreBuchanan’s office said the defense department will continue to allow training that involves stabbing, burning and using blunt instruments on animals, while also allowing “weapon wounding”, which is when the military tests weapons on animals. Animal rights groups say the animals are supposed to be anesthetized during such training and testing.The Defense Health Agency, which oversees the training, said in a statement on Friday that the defense department “remains committed to replacement of animal models without compromising the quality of medical training”.The agency cited the establishment of its defense medical modeling and simulation office as a testament to those efforts, which include “realistic training scenarios to ensure medical providers are well-prepared to care for the combat-wounded”.Groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment ofAnimalsdeclared victory, saying the change will spare the lives of thousands of animals each year and “marks a historic shift toward state-of-the-art, human-relevant simulation technology”.It’s unclear how often the military uses animals for training. Previous defense bills and other pieces of legislation have sought to reduce their use for trauma training, according toa 2022 report from the Government Accountability Office(GAO), an independent agency that serves Congress.The 2013 defense bill required the Pentagon to submit a report that outlined a strategy for transitioning to human-based training methods, the GAO said. A 2018 statute required the secretary of defense to ensure the military used simulation technology “to the maximum extent practicable” or unless use of animals was deemed necessary by the medical chain of command.The GAO report stated the animals are placed under anesthesia and then euthanized.“Live animals such as pigs and goats are used in trauma training because their organs and tissues are similar to humans, they have biological variation that can complicate treatment and provide opportunities to control medical conditions,” the report stated.But groups such as the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine say anesthetized pigs and goats do little to prepare medics or corpsmen for treating wounded service members. They said the advent of “cut suits” that are worn by people are much better at mimicking an injured human who is moaning and writhing.“The big argument is this is a living, breathing thing that they have to take care of and there’s this level of realism,” said Erin Griffith, a retired navy doctor and member of the physicians committee. “But replicating what it’s like when their buddy is shot and bleeding and awake is very different.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryAnimal welfareAnimalsShareReuse this content"

In May, Thailand’s health ministry recommended doctorsswitch from some biomedicines to traditional remediesfor certain conditions including muscle pain and constipation.View image in fullscreenKratom (Mitragyna speciosa) on sale in Bangkok, Thailand. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for centuries and was legalised in 2021.Photograph: Narong Sangnak/EPAThere have been some concerns that the WHO strategy could create a backdoor for unscientific systems such as homeopathy to enter the mainstream but Kuruvilla points out that homeopathy does not fit the WHO’s definition of traditional medicine – it was only created in the late 18th century – and that there is not strong enough evidence for the practice.But, she says: “With all of these – with biomedicine, homeopathy, traditional medicine – if the evidence changes, I think it’s our responsibility to be open to that.”In some countries homeopathy is used as a complementary medicine “and that’s up to the countries”, Kuruvilla says. “We have to, as WHO, just stick to the evidence.“So I think that’s our bottom line: is this supported by robust reliable evidence, especially on safety and efficacy? And if it’s not, WHO is not supporting it, whether it is biomedicine or traditional medicine.”Not engaging wasn’t an option, because that would mean everything goes on without any safeguardsDr Shyama KuruvillaWHOsurveyssuggest that in most countries, the majority of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine services are not part of the formal health system and are paid for by patients. They are less likely to be subject to official quality checks but are hugely popular.“Not engaging wasn’t an option, because that would mean everything goes on without any safeguards,” Kuruvilla says, pointing to a burgeoning trillion-dollar wellness industry ranging from yoga studios to “nutraceuticals”.View image in fullscreenThe opening ceremony of the second WHO global summit on traditional medicine in New Delhi, India, on 17 December.Photograph: CBAS Films/WHONew methods let scientists study traditional medicine “in a way that wasn’t possible before”, Kuruvilla says. Genomics might prompt new understanding of the properties of a plant, while modern scanning equipment can pick up changes in the brains of people meditating.“Meditation was all this ‘woo-woo stuff’ but now, seeing all these advances in neuroscience and showing changes in brain waves from functional magnetic resonance imaging, which we couldn’t do before – actually being able to trace the pathways that lead to changes in health measurements – I think this is really, really exciting,” she says.A new WHO strategic technical advisory group for traditional medicine was launched this week at a global summit in India. “This is a pivotal moment for traditional medicine. It embodies cultural heritage and national health identities, and increasingly, it constitutes a vital component of primary health care strategies,” Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO’s assistant director-general for health system, access and data, told the summit.The idea, Kuruvilla suggests, is to “build a bridge” between traditional medicine and biomedicine. It is important to “find commonalities”, she says. “Showing that the science can be robust is really, really important, and especially on the patient safety aspect.”Traditional medicine has the potential to be a “treasure trove”, Kuruvilla says. The vast numbers of people working in the field – including university-educated professionals accredited to work in clinics in China and India – could ease global workforce shortages and make a “huge contribution” to universal health coverage, she says.View image in fullscreenStaff prepare traditional herbal medicine at a hospital in Tongren, China.Photograph: CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesIn the context of aid cuts forcing countries to rethink health provision, traditional medicine could be “a way for countries also to be more self-reliant and then share those resources with each other”.The risk of failing to invest, she says, is leaving people unable to access their preferred type of healthcare in a safe way and “the world not being able to use our shared heritage here in a way that allows us to find new holistic solutions for health and wellbeing of people and planet”.Explore more on these topicsGlobal healthHomeopathyAlternative medicineHealth & wellbeingWorld Health OrganizationHealthIndiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bondi became a lobbyist with Ballard Partners in 2019, after her term as Florida attorney general ended. She officially left the firm upon her appointment as attorney general earlier this year.While it’s unclear whether Bondi ever directly worked with UnitedHealth Group as a lobbyist, Mangione’s lawyers are seeking to investigate the attorney general’s ties to Ballard and its relationship with UnitedHealth Group, including Bondi’s compensation with the firm and directions she’s given justice department employees in Mangione’s case.Mangione’s lawyers are arguing that this alleged conflict of interest, along with comments Bondi has made about Mangione that his lawyers described as overtly political,should encourage the court to throw out the possibility of the death penalty, along with removing two federal charges and tossing out certain evidence from the case.A hearing is scheduled for 9 January at the US court for the southern district ofNew Yorkin Manhattan. The justice department and Ballard did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mangione, 27, is accused ofkilling UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompsonoutside a hotel in Manhattan on 4 December 2024. After a five-day manhunt, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Law enforcementsaythey found bullets and a notebook attacking the insurance industry with Mangione when he was arrested.When Bondi stepped in as attorney general, the justice departmentannouncedthat it would seek the death penalty for Mangione, calling the killing “a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America”.“After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,” Bondi said in astatementat the time.A few weeks later, Margaret Garnett, the federal judge overseeing the case,cautionedBondi and other justice department officials against making public commentary on the case, which could bias future jurors.In Friday’s court filing, Mangione’s lawyers said that Bondi’s comments and her seeking the death penalty show that she is acting “based on politics, not merit”.“Any criminal defendant, let alone one whom the government is trying to kill, is due a criminal process that is untainted by the financial interests of his prosecutors,” the lawyers wrote.Mangione is represented by a husband-and-wife team of lawyers, Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo.In court filings in November, federal prosecutorssaidthat the federal case should carry on as usual, noting that “pretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect”.“What the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments,” prosecutors wrote. “None warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.”The court filing comes after a weeks-long pretrialhearingfor the state charges Mangione faces for the killing. After his lawyers were able to get two top state chargesthrown outof the case, for first-degree murder and second-degree murder, his lawyers are now trying to get certain evidence they say was illegally gathered removed from the case. The ruling for this pretrial hearing, where the judge will decide what evidence stays in the case, is expected in May.Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingPam BondiUS justice systemUS crimeGun crimeNew YorkLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Tourists buy mulled wine and churros at the Christmas market outside the Bourse, the old stock exchange, now repurposed as a beer museum. A few people drink coffee on cafe terraces. Up and down the length of the 650-metre-long space, people come and go, bikes and scooters weaving in and out of the crowds.Next year, this scene will look somewhat different: bikes and scooters will be banned from this 18,000-sq-metre pedestrian zone for most of the day. People on two wheels will be allowed to ride only between 4am and 11am. At all other times, they must dismount and push their vehicle up the street, or face a fine.Anaïs Maes, the city counsellor in charge of urban planning and mobility, suggested not all cyclists obeyed the existing 6km speed limit. “In everyday reality, people do not respect that rule or don’t know it, and so it creates conflicts.”Maes, a member of the Dutch-speaking socialist Vooruit party, is aware of “small accidents” and complaints from pedestrians. “I’ve heard multiple persons say, especially older persons or persons with little kids, or persons with reduced mobility, [that] they don’t feel safe, because they live in fear of not being able to step aside quickly enough or being hit.”Brussels officials have not decided exactly when the change will enter into force, as negotiations within the council over implementation are ongoing.In a sense, the Brussels Piétonnier is a victim of its own success. Extended a decade ago to make the city greener, calmer and cleaner, it transformed a swathe of the centre from a traffic-clogged, four-lane road into a place for walkers, strollers and cyclists, revitalising cafe terraces and open-air gatherings. It was a transformative shift for a city that had longsuffered from its mid-20th-century love affair with the car.For instance, the Grand-Place, the magnificent central square, with intricate, gold-leaf-adorned guildhalls and gothic city hall, was effectively a car park until 1972 and traffic was not banned entirely from the square and its cobbled environs until 1991.View image in fullscreenDanielle Peeters: ‘I think it is a little radical.’Photograph: Jennifer Rankin/The GuardianThe decision to extend the pedestrian zone in 2015, by banning cars from a large shopping area around Place de La Bourse was controversial initially. Maes, who was not on the council at the time, said idealistic planners believed that pedestrians and cyclists could share the space. “The city of Brussels had this idea: we were creating a space that’s multimodal and everyone will find their place; I think it is sad but in reality it doesn’t always work and then you have to find solutions.”Danielle Peeters, a cyclist, who works at a Dutch-language association, thinks the ban is a shame. “I think it is a little radical,” she says, having just parked her bike outside a ramen bar. “When there are a lot of people, obviously I slow down, but there are some people who cycle very, very quickly.”“Alex”, a 43-year old mountain climbing guide from Ukraine, who works as a takeaway courier and gave a pseudonym, says it will cause him difficulties because he will not be able to pick up deliveries, although referencing war in Ukraine, he said there were bigger problems. “For me it’s not a big issue, but they could have done a better job painting pathways for bikes.”That is the point for local cycling safety groups. The conflict between cyclists and pedestrians, some say, was a story foretold in the decision not to create a dedicated bike lane.Anopen letterby a dozen cyclist and road-safety groups published in December denounced the ban as “dangerous and absurd”, arguing that the city’s proposed alternative route for cyclists – three streets running parallel to the pedestrian zone – was not safe.On this alternative route, bikes share the busy roads with cars, buses and coaches; cycle groups say there are many blind spots and drivers, who flout the ban on overtaking cyclists.View image in fullscreenCycle groups are worried about safety issues on the proposed alternative route.Photograph: Jennifer Rankin/The GuardianBernards Heymans, the president of Heroes for Zero, a grassroots road safety movement, said the proposed alternative route was “not comfortable” and even dangerous, especially for child cyclists.“If cyclists are banned on the Piétonnier, then we would really like a real second way to access the city centre for cyclists,” he said. “If we find a second way that is totally secure, of course, everybody will go through the second way.”Maes does not think a separate bike lane in the pedestrian zone is the answer. “It doesn’t increase safety, because when every mode has its own designated space [cyclists] go faster,” which can also create conflicts with pedestrians crossing that lane, she said.She was working hard, she said, to create a safe alternative route: “We are trying to solve a mobility-safety issue, but what I do not want to do is to create a bigger problem.”Explore more on these topicsBelgiumEuropeCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this year, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch,officially ditchednet zero by 2050 as a Tory policy. Labour was even forced to defend its net zero policy after anattack by its former leader, Tony Blair.Big players in retail and automotive this week became the latest businesses to weaken pledges – a retreat that threatens devastating consequences for the climate.Running counter to this, many countries –notably China– have continued the march towards renewable power (whichsurpassed coal generationthis year). Investment in clean energy, at $2tn a year, is now double that going into fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency.Here we look at how important industries are treating net zero.Cars and planesFor a few years after the pandemic, carmakers made bold promises that they would switch their factories to electric cars within a few years. Yet that momentum for change petered out by 2024 amid disappointing growth in battery car sales. In the US, EU and UK the lobbying campaign for weaker regulations has been intense – and successful.View image in fullscreenA new electric Leaf car comes off the production line at the Nissan factory at Sunderland.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianTrump has torn up US electric vehicle subsidies – costing carmakers billions of dollars – and eased emissions rules to allow them to sell more cars with polluting petrol and diesel engines. This week, Ford said it would take a $19.5bn write-down and isscrapping several EV models.The UK government said in April it wouldease its zero-emission (ZEV) mandate. The rules still force carmakers to sell more electric cars each year, but new loopholes mean they can sell more hybrids, which combine a smaller battery with an internal combustion engine.And the EU this week said that10% of carmakers’ sales could be petrol or diesel after 2035,in a significant climbdown.Traditional European carmakers were delighted, but manufacturers focused on electric cars said it would benefit Chinese rivals in the long term. Chris Heron, secretary general of E-Mobility Europe, a lobby group representing electric carmakers such as Tesla, Rivian and Polestar, said: “While China accelerates, Europe is hesitating, and hesitation is not a strategy.”If the transition is stalling for ground transport, in the air things have not even started to take off.Airbusand Boeing, the global plane-making duopoly, have both made clear that their next planes will use gas turbine engines running on kerosene.Airbus this year delayed plans to fly a plane using zero-emission “green” hydrogen by 2035, while supplies of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) – the solution of choice for many in aviation – remain nugatory compared with the vast size of global demand.Neither did UK government policy on aviation inspire confidence that net zero remained front and centre. Two London airports, Gatwick and Luton, had significant expansion plans signed off by ministers, meaning tens of thousands of additional flights a year at each.Meanwhile, the chancellor gave resounding backing for Heathrow expansion – despite previous official work making clear that only limited growth, allied with swift progress on decarbonisation, could make a third runway in any way compatible with 2050 targets.EnergyFor now, UK green energy investors remain buoyed up by Labour’s aim to create a virtually carbon-free electricity system by 2030, to stick with the net zero target and its pledge for no new North Sea drilling (withcaveats).However, the government’s green targets weredealt a blowearlier this year when the struggling Danish renewable energy companyØrstedcancelled plans for one of the UK’s largest offshore windfarms, Hornsea 4, off the Yorkshire coast.View image in fullscreenRWE’s Gwynt y Mor, the world’s second-largest offshore windfarm located eight miles offshore in Liverpool Bay, off the coast of north Wales.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAEurope’s oil majors, including BP and Shell, have retreated from their climate commitments in favour of refocusing on oil and gas production. BP’s boss, Murray Auchincloss – who wasdramatically oustedthis week – said the company’s optimism in the energy transition had been “misplaced” and promised the company’s disillusioned shareholders that he would “fundamentally reset” BP’s strategy after its failed attempt to go green. His successorappears unlikelyto change tack. Shell set out plans to pump more oil and gas while halving its green spending.Banks and financial servicesA swathe of financial firms have been watering down climate commitments following Trump’s return.The most public sign of the U-turn has been the collapse of the Net-ZeroBankingAlliance (NZBA) in October, after a wave of departures by US banks including JP Morgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, as well as UK lenders Barclays and HSBC. The UN-backed programme, launched in 2021, had committed firms to achieving net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.View image in fullscreenThe City of London financial district.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersHSBC had months earlier announced it wasdelaying omportant parts of its climate goals by 20 yearsand watering down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year.Large investment houses such as Vanguard and BlackRock have also pulled membership from a sister group known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, as the sector comes under pressure from Republican politicians.Meanwhile, there are fears Labour could water down plans to require FTSE 100 firms and financial services to adopt “credible” climate transition plans, and disclosing their carbon footprints after City lobbying.RetailRetailers and their suppliers are among those taking a hard look at net zero ambitions amid rising costs.Morrisons, the supermarket chain, this weekdelayed its ambition for net zeroby 15 years until 2050, having previously set a deadline of 2035.The British Retail Consortium industry body set out a roadmap to next zero by 2040 but its latest stocktake indicates the industry has only met the 2025 milestone on one measure – data on logistics. Only 38% of top suppliers have committed to meeting net zero.Many retailers have reduced emissions in stores – with renewable energy and technology such as LED bulbs and electric vans – but most of their emissions are generated by their suppliers.View image in fullscreenPeople on a London bus look at the annual Christmas lights on Oxford Street, London’s main shopping street.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesEven within stores the cost and complexity of shifting from gas to low-carbon heating , including the higher price of electricity compared with gas, has held back progress.Local authoritiesIn the public sector, local councils have often taken net zero more seriously than even central government. Bristol was the first to declare a climate emergency in 2018 – a year before the government – and more than 300 other councils followed, with 90% setting net zero targets.But as the political landscape has changed with the rise of Reform, some local authorities, led by those dominated by Farage’s party, are rolling back on net zero commitments. In Reform-led Lincolnshire, mayor Andrea Jenkynshas vowedto block any renewables projects in her jurisdiction (putting 12,000 jobs at risk if she succeeds), while Staffordshire county council, also Reform-controlled, has rescinded its declaration of a climate emergency.Reform-controlled Durham council has scrapped its heat pump and solar panel scheme for government buildings, and energy efficiency upgrades such as insulation have been ditched in Kent, which is also under Reform.Derbyshire county council disbanded its climate change, biodiversity and carbon reduction committee the week after Reform took power, and West Northamptonshire county council abandoned its net zero target.However, the Green partyhas nearlyas many councillors as Reform (893 compared with 940) andleads 14 councilscompared with Reform’s 10; in those authorities the approach has been “go faster and harder wherever possible”.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryGreenhouse gas emissionsCorporate governanceClimate crisisRenewable energyFossil fuelsTransport policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the UK advertising industry voluntarily chose to start adhering to the new rules from October, making this TV’s first-ever low-fat, low-sugar and low-salt Christmas.Gone are shots of Christmas puddings and sweet treats, while healthy products have made a conspicuous appearance. Advertisers have had to cleverly market a wide range of other food to stay within the complex new rules.In the climax of Waitrose’s Christmas romance ad,Keira Knightley receives a home-baked pie, while in Lidl a young girl grabs apples for a last-minute addition to the family festive shop.Meanwhile, Asda used the fresh fruit and vegetable aisle for the Grinch to make his big entry into one of its supermarkets, and Morrisons opted not to show any products at all.Quirks under the regulations rule out showing gravy on the traditional Christmas dinner’s roasted meat centrepiece in festive ads. However, a “marinade, glaze, dressing, seasoning rub or similar accompaniment” will keep the advertising watchdog away,according to the government’s new rules.“Advertisers are having to be very strategic,” said Richard Exon, the co-founder of the ad agency Joint. “There is an upside for creativity here. It’s less about the products and more about brands and messaging and keeping to the spirit and letter of the legislation. Mainstream premium brands will be very careful not to breach regulations. A big dollop of common sense will be needed in the first quarter next year.”While on-screen viewers are enjoying a merry Christmas, off screen the road to the introduction of the rules has been a bitter battle between health campaigners and the food industry.In 2020, Boris Johnson’s governmentpromised to implement a banon products that were high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) online and before 9pm on TVsaying it would come into force in 2023.The ban waspredicted to affect hundreds of millions of pounds of advertising spend. The original proposals meant that healthy foods such as avocados would be banned, but products such as McDonald’s chicken nuggets and some fries passed the HFSS nutrient profile test.In a reworking of the plan, there has been a rebranding of the government’s initiative to tackle soaring childhood obesity to restrictions on “less healthy food”.View image in fullscreenQuirks under the new regulations rule out showing gravy on the traditional Christmas dinner.Photograph: FG Trade/GettyThere are 13 categories of banned products, although these can make it on screen if it is possible for a food company to reformulate ingredients to meet the HFSS test, and there is an extensive list of often incongruous exceptions and caveats.Many items perceived as less healthy are not restricted, such as bacon, cheese, savoury pastries such as sausage rolls, Pot Noodle and Nutella. “Party snacks” are also allowed to be shown, and as such feature heavily in a number of advertisers’ Christmas campaigns this year.A Chocolate Orange has doubled in price – and got smaller. Why?Read moreConversely, items often perceived as healthier are restricted, such as “sandwiches of any kind”, pretzels and “all products predominantly found in the breakfast cereal aisle”, which includes porridge oats and muesli, according to the regulations.Some products that have been reformulated to meet the junk food nutrient rules are still banned as they are perceived to contribute to the obesity issue, such as certain ranges of crisps, chips and pizza.“Are we ready? Yes,” said an executive at one big food retailer. “But it is far too complex. There is going to be a long period where the advertising watchdog has to work through complaints from those looking out for products that may break the rules.”Earlier this year, health campaigners were outraged when the government decided to allow companies that make junk food, such as a McDonald’s or Cadbury, to run brand ads as long as they did not show an “identifiable” product.This followed a threat of legal action against the proposed blanket ban by the food industry. Allowing brand ads would mean that Cadbury could run itsfamous drumming gorilla ad, for example, before the watershed so long as there were no images of chocolate bars.View image in fullscreenCadbury’s Dairy Milk advert features a gorilla playing the drums to Phil Collins’ In the Air Tonight, with no chocolate bar in sight.Photograph: Rex Features“This government pledged to raise the healthiest generation of children ever and yet they’ve ignored the evidence, instead pursuing a policy that essentially enables business as usual,” said Fran Bernhardt of the campaign group Sustain. “Industry will be celebrating another ruined health policy, while the UK’s children have been let down once again.”Earlier this month, the Food Foundation released its annual report, which found that food companies had been shifting their ad spend into other media before the TV and online ad ban.Food companies’ spend on outdoor media such as billboards and poster sites – which are only subject to junk food ad bans if they are located within 100 metres of premises such as schools or leisure centres – rose 28% between 2021 and 2024.The report found that McDonald’s had increased its outdoor advertising spend by the biggest percentage across the three-year period.While viewers are unlikely to have picked up on the trimmer advertising this Christmas, they may well do when Easter rolls around: Shots of chocolate eggs are banned, and so, too, the quintessential hot cross bun, unless food companies can come up with a healthy-eating version.“Advertising agencies are problem-solvers,” said Paul Bainsfair, the director general of the trade body the Institute of Practitioners inAdvertising. “They have just had to adapt and use their ingenuity to find solutions for their clients – something they have always been so good at.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryAdvertisingTelevision industryChristmasSupermarketsRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I put this as tactfully as I can toAlan Hollinghurst, this year’s winner of the David Cohen prize, which has previously recognised the contribution to literature of, among others, VS Naipaul, Doris Lessing and Edna O’Brien. It does have “a certain hint of the obituary about it”, he concedes, laughing. “So I’m very much doing what I can to take it as an incentive rather than a reward.”But there have been plenty of rewards recently. Hollinghurst was knighted in this year’s New Year honours list, a couple of months after the publication of his novelOur Evenings, the story of actor Dave Win’s journey from boarding school to the end of his life, which received rave reviews. In the Guardian, critic Alexandra Harris announced it his finest novel to date, noting that it “forms a deep pattern of connection with its predecessors, while being an entirely distinct and brimming whole”.One of those predecessors isThe Line of Beauty, which won the Booker prize in 2004 and was shortly afterwards adapted for television, providing an early leading role for actor Dan Stevens. This autumn, Hollinghurst’s tour d’horizon of the Thatcher era as seen through the eyes of Nick Guest, a young man taken up by a wealthy and politically powerful family, also became a stage play at London’s Almeida theatre in a version byJack Holden, directed by Michael Grandage. It has been one of the season’s hottest tickets, I remark: “absolutely scorching”, replies Hollinghurst, who is witty and charmingly self-deprecating in conversation, and yet never less than attentive and serious.How has he found the process of watching a novel of more than 500 pages with multiple characters and settings transform into a far less populous and tighter two hours on stage? “It’s been converted into a completely different medium with completely different terms and considerations,” he says. “And I found that rather fascinating. Of course, it’s different. Of course, there are all sorts of things which aren’t in the book, certainly a lot of characters that are not in the play, and a certain amount of amalgamation of characters. Jack Holden has done something very skilful. I think there are six really horrible characters in the book that he’s compressed into one really monstrously horrible character.”View image in fullscreenAlistair Nwachukwu, left, and Jasper Talbot in The Line of Beauty at the Almeida theatre, London.Photograph: Johan PerssonWho does he miss? “Well, I was very sorry to lose Lady Partridge [the grandmother], who’s one of my favourite characters, and also the rather hot waiter from Madeira. But you can’t have everything.” He read successive drafts, he tells me, and gave his feedback, “but I was very wary of giving novelist’s notes: you know, do you think that’s quite consistent? And shouldn’t we say a little bit more about so and so? And why doesn’t he go on to say …? Which is me sort of clinging to my own material. Actually, the priorities of the stage are quite different, and things which I feel might need to be explained can be conveyed by a gifted actor, just in a look or a gesture.”The novel looked back to a time nearly 20 years previously and the play appears nearly another 20 years after that, so there’s an increasing sense of The Line of Beauty as a key to an intense but very different social and political moment. This production, Hollinghurst notes, “involves young actors who were born long after Mrs Thatcher ceased to be a player, and who know nothing about the Aids crisis. So there is partly a kind of educational dimension to something which is set in this specific historical period.”He’s extremely generous about the information deficits of younger generations: “It’s very easy for an old person to bemoan the things that young people don’t know, but of course young people know so many things that I don’t.” But in truth, his novels have been casting a light on the particularities and texture of English life, and of the experiences of gay people, since his electrifying debut, The Swimming-Pool Library, appeared in 1988. The novel started its life, he explains, when he was still on the staff of the Times Literary Supplement, and consequently short of spare time. To impose order on the process, he started it on 1 January 1984, writing in a large-format desk diary. “I just decided I would write a page a day, and at the end of the year I’d have a novel. In the middle of April, I was quite seriously behind: in fact it took me about two and a half years to get to December 31st.”It was worth persisting: the novel won the Somerset Maugham award, and began a publishing career that now extends to seven novels, appearing roughly every half-dozen years and arguably providing this country’s most acute literary representation of gay life to date. Each of Hollinghurst’s books has been eagerly anticipated by his readers, not merely for his grasp of the dynamics of personal and social relationships set against panoramic backdrops, but for the sheer beauty of his prose; close-up observations of the minute-to-minute materiality of life interspersed with journeys through characters’ interior mental and emotional landscapes. They are often elegiac, but also very funny and, as Hollinghurst has often pointed out, are intended to entertain.Both The Swimming-Pool Library and his second novel, The Folding Star (1994), turned on the revelation of a secret – “rather clunky plot structures”, he says now, which “increasingly came to feel not like life to me” – but in his last three novels,The Stranger’s Child,The Sparsholt Affairand Our Evenings, Hollinghurst has moved into the arena of whole-life novels. In each case, the narrative advances by years between discrete sections, leaving the reader to gather what has happened in the intervening periods. Was that a way to convey dramatic changes in society, and especially in gay life – to talk about what alters, and what stays the same?These cycles of racial violence and so forth, we keep thinking that’s in the past, and then they flare up with horrible new intensity“One can take a generally ameliorative view of change,” he says, thoughtfully, “which is something I think has obtained over the period in gay history, for instance, that I’ve written about: moving from severe legal oppression and social difficulties and so on into an unrecognisably changed period of legal and social freedom and acceptance. And then the sense which we have increasingly at the moment, with the rise of the right everywhere, of these freedoms in which I’ve happily lived my adult life becoming vulnerable.” In that context, he thinks, the latest incarnation of The Line of Beauty has “a sort of admonitory quality … And I think that was something I wanted to touch on in Our Evenings, too, that these cycles of racial violence and so forth, we keep thinking that’s in the past, and then they flare up with horrible new intensity.”Dave Win, the protagonist of Our Evenings, is brought up in a small, semi-rural town by a single mother, Avril, a white woman. His father, whom she met during a brief period of working in Burma, is absent, and further details about him are obscured from both his son and the reader. Throughout his life, Dave is thrust into successive situations where his identity – as a scholarship boy at a public boarding school, sponsored by a philanthropic couple; as a young gay man; as an actor searching for roles from which his ethnicity does not exclude him – marginalises him.In that respect, he’s the opposite of The Line of Beauty’s Nick Guest, one of several polished interlopers who have little problem in gaining an entree into elite society and thereafter wreaking havoc. (I ask Hollinghurst whether he felt that the makers of thefilm Saltburnhad taken The Line of Beauty very much to heart and he bursts out laughing: “Well, I’m not sure. I don’t think I’m the only person who’s come up with that scenario.”) Guest’s ambiguity stems from our uncertainty of how intentional his destructiveness is; Win’s from his far less powerful adjacency to privilege.View image in fullscreenHollinghurst at Windsor Castle, after his investiture ceremony.Photograph: WPA/Getty Images“I do think of him as being more unambiguously a sympathetic character,” Hollinghurst says of his latest leading man, “and one that people have liked and sort of gone along with, with a kind of unselfconscious warmth that they don’t necessarily feel towards Nick Guest.” Much of that has to do with the strikingly tender portrayal of the bond between David, his mother and later, her partner, Esme. “Obviously the relationship with his mum was always going to be a central part of it. And just trying to depict the longest, largest relationship in his life, so much of it being made up of things which are never said, and yet its fundamental importance. I’m pleased that people seem to have been touched by that.”Win, like Guest and like Hollinghurst himself, is an only child, and I tell the author that I’m constantly fascinated by how many of his characters don’t have siblings. Does he think it’s significant?“I think perhaps it is, because as an only child you become quite accustomed to your own society, and you become rather imaginatively self-sufficient. But then your life repeatedly puts you in situations where you’re engaging with another family, another social system, whatever it might be, and you have to learn how to do it. I can remember in my life feeling that I’d passed a sort of threshold and I’d learned how to perform. And perhaps all people growing up do this, you know, but suddenly gaining a social confidence, knowing how to behave. It struck me very much, actually, looking at the play, and seeing how Nick in the first half is rather watchfully sort of fitting in with this family, and in the second half, his behaviour has changed, and he’s become a performer among them. He’s become a little star in the world. Of course, it all goes horribly wrong, but that just brought back to me those moments of feeling that I’d sort of mastered the situation, or I was no longer terrified of it.”I’ve always had a book sort of simmering in the background – this other place to go toWinning the David Cohen prize and watching the theatrical release of a work written two decades ago have involved a certain amount of looking back. Of the prize, he recalls going to the awards ceremony as “a young TLS staffer, going along to see Harold Pinter getting it, and seeing Muriel Spark getting it. And since then, it’s been won by all sorts of people who actually have been huge figures in my own mental literary landscape: Seamus Heaney, Thom Gunn, Michael Holroyd, very different writers, but it just seemed to be the supreme kind of accolade. So it’s very astonishing to have got it.”Less immediately tangible are his thoughts about the development of his approach to writing. He’s been wondering, he says, about the connection between the 29-year-old who started writing in pages of a desk diary – all his books until The Stranger’s Child were written in longhand, but then he got “a bit fidgety” and started to play around on screen – and the 71-year-old he is now.Despite the cyclical nature of oppression, the landscape he’s written about has radically changed. In The Sparsholt Affair, a character struggles to get to grips with the new and often app-based world of sexual relationships, although Hollinghurst points out, humorously, that “he does master it and he has a hookup”. A pause. “He comes to feel it’s not really for him.”The Line of Beauty review – Hollinghurst’s Gatsby-esque social satire is a class actRead more“Part of this habitual looking back has involved me in going into times when these things were secret and dangerous, and there were codes of behaviour. I remember, when I was very young, older gay men slightly lamenting that gay lib had taken all the excitement out of it, that the illegality gave it this extraordinary erotic charge. I mean, generally, that’s not my view, I much prefer to be living in the time we’re in now, but I think it’s part of a much larger change, particularly over the last 20 years, in notions of privacy.”On a practical level, he says, the dissolution of privacy is a good thing, meaning that “gay men and women are not living their lives in the shadows, in fear, they’re just living them as anybody else would”. But is it harder to write about people when they are more apparently open, when, as he says, “go on to whichever app you favour, and there turn out to be 80 people ready within a 100-yard radius and you’re immediately confronted with the most intimate aspects of total strangers’ lives”? Or is it fun?Our Evenings by Alan Hollinghurst review – his finest novel yetRead more“There is something sort of exciting about that idea of instant gratification. But I think it goes against my natural temperament as a writer, which is that sense of expectation, anticipation, frustration, actually being much more interesting. And as everybody knows, anticipated excitement or anticipation is often better than the fulfilment. So yes, I think temperamentally, I’m not so interested in writing about the new world of dissolved privacy.”Hollinghurst has often been praised for his ability to conjure social scenes, from grand parties to far smaller-scale encounters. But he is also closely attuned to life’s longueurs, to periods in which little happens beyond waiting for things to get going. Creatively speaking, though, he is not himself suffering from a lack of activity or impetus.“There’s part of me which would quite like to retire. And part of me which, having seen people who retire and are utterly miserable and directionless, knows very well that I don’t want to. I’ve spent my whole adult life with a book sort of simmering in the background and having this other place to go to and mess around in. I always enjoy the period of relief after a book comes out, when I don’t have to think about that for a while, but then I begin to miss it. So I hope soon to get cracking on something else.”Explore more on these topicsAlan HollinghurstFictionLGBTQ+ rightsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In the eyes of my younger self it was a great film – vignettes of love I could only imagine one day feeling, all coloured by the fairy lights of Christmas. And there was even a cameo from Mr Bean himself, Rowan Atkinson. The film captured the romance I craved as a preteen, the idea that maybe a kid I fancied in my class would learn the drums for me and run through airport security to ask me out.I was young enough to think it was sweet for Keira Knightley’s husband’s best friend to turn up on her doorstep declaring his quite obviously unrequited love. I even thought it was adorable that he ruined their wedding video by filming only closeups of her face. Of course, I feel differently now about problematic moments like these – even if I do have the film to thank for introducing me to Joni Mitchell.I’d be happy to never watch it again, but there’s one scene that has always stuck with me and that is whenEmma Thompson’s character finds out her husband (Alan Rickman) is having an affair. She discovers a gift-wrapped necklace in his coat pocket and assumes it will be her Christmas present. Instead, when she opens it, she finds a  CD of Joni Mitchell’s Both Sides Now , and the realisation that he has given the jewellery to another woman. She goes upstairs, puts the album on, and we watch for a few tense minutes as the weight of betrayal and deceit hangs over her. She stands alone in her room only allowing herself a moment to cry silently before she heads back downstairs to her family.It moved me when I first watched it as a 12-year-old, not even really understanding what her husband had done. But there was something in her performance. The silence of it. How she tries desperately to control her emotions in a way that, even as a preteen, I could somehow understand.As I went back to that film for the next few Christmases, I continued to be struck by Thompson’s performance in this small narrative, how much power you can hold by holding back. But also, just how sad she looked. It was this sadness that made me think to myself: if I ever find myself in that situation, I’ll leave. Watching it one Christmas as a teenager, I made a little promise to myself that I’d choose to end a relationship rather than stay and live with that pain. Surely it would be better to finish things than be treated this way.Some years later I was in a long-term relationship. Our agreement had been monogamy, and like most relationships it was fun and good from the start, but it soon became quite obvious that things weren’t right. I see now that I was suffocated and sad for most of it, yet I had been manipulated into believing that my unhappiness was my own doing. I was unable to feel that I deserved better, so I stayed.But one spring morning I found myself sitting in our living room, listening as he admitted to an achingly long series of betrayals. We’d had an argument that had somehow led to this admission that he’d been cheating throughout the relationship. I’d been completely blindsided.I looked around at this small life we’d built together – the messy bookshelves, the guitars hanging on the wall – and only saw the lies that had been its foundations. He wanted me to forgive him and for us to move on, and he genuinely believed I would.But later that day as I sat alone in the bedroom, that scene from Love Actually popped into my mind. I thought of Thompson standing in the corner of her room wiping back her tears listening to Joni Mitchell. Unlike her, I was able to cry loudly, and I did. But these were more tears of sadness for all the time I felt I had lost, even wasted. It was instantly clear to me that this was my way out. That little promise I’d made to myself watching the film one Christmas had provided me with a much-needed boundary – something clear and true when everything else felt so confused.That decision to end the relationship was the easiest I’ve ever made in my life, perhaps because I had made it so many years before. For that, I’ll be eternally grateful to Emma … and Joni.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Fortunately, an industrious first assistant director addressed the crowd in Spanish and they managed to get the shot, with 400 Colombian extras all playing their part. It was a bit of brinkmanship thatle Carré’s own George Smileywould have been proud of.The result was spectacular and typical of the modern era of le Carré adaptations, which began with The Night Manager’s first outing in 2016. Globetrotting, sexy and sleek, it was understandably compared to the Bond franchise. Some said itsurpassed Bondand took le Carré, known on the small screen forbrilliant but bleak70s and 80s adaptations starring Alec Guinness, into new territory.For Charlie Higson, the new version of le Carré was ripped straight from the Bond playbook. “Ian Fleming wasn’t downbeat and grubby and grey; it wasn’t people in cafes with steamy windows and Formica tabletop doing grubby deals over a cup of cold tea,” says Higson, who has written several Bond books.“It’s big and international and glossy and sexy and escapist. I always said that le Carré was a ‘cup of tea writing’ and Bond was ‘cocktail writing’.”View image in fullscreenElizabeth Debicki, Alistair Petrie, Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie in series one.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyMany cocktails are poured in the new world ofThe Night Manageras Pine tries to navigate another complex world of international crime, espionage and double-crossing.There are plenty of glamorous, sun-drenched locations too – this time in Catalonia and Colombia rather than Mallorca, which starred in the first series. The casting is equally starry, with Camila Morrone, Olivia Colman and Indira Varma adding wattage alongside Hiddleston and Calva.It’s not just the spies that take risks in this new world, which is led by le Carré’s sons Stephen and Simon Cornwell via their Ink Factory production company. The second series is the first adaptation not based on a story crafted by the author. David Farr, who adapted the first series, developed the Pine story.Simon Cornwell says their approach to post-le Carré le Carré is relatively simple: “If my dad was alive today, how would the stories look in the contemporary world?”Bond might be the obvious reference people reach for but there’s a much wider palate of influences on display. Banks-Davies, who made her name with the buzzy dramedy I Hate Suzie, compiled a scrapbook of visual references after reading the first two episodes, which are available on New Year’s Day in the UK.View image in fullscreenGeorgi-Banks Davies at The Night Manager series two premiere in London last week.Photograph: David Fisher/ShutterstockFrancis Bacon’s torture portraits feature heavily, and shaped the way Pine’s inner turmoil is visualised. Banks-Davies also found inspiration in the celebrity profiles of Fran Lebowitz, particularly in scenes when Pine starts to craft yet another new persona. Fellini’s 8½ is another touchstone.She won’t be drawn on more of her cinematic influences but the aerial shots of vehicles winding their way towards the action isreminiscent of Sicario, while the global web of conspiracy and crime recalls Roberto Saviano’sGomorrahandZeroZeroZero. There are also hints ofthe Bourne seriesand the dangerous worldsKathryn Bigelowcrafts.When it comes to the question of Bond, Banks-Davies takes the challenge head on. “It’s definitely on the top of my bucket list to be the first woman who directs a Bond movie,” says Banks-Davies, whose predecessor Susanne Bierwas linked to the franchiseafter directing the first series of The Night Manager.Some argued series one was a glorified Bond audition for Hiddleston, but Cornwell agrees with those who said it was the start of a new “radical” reframing of le Carré and he cautions those who think the series is all about glamour.“I don’t think we’re as fanciful as Bond,” says Cornwell, whose father referred to 007 as a “consumer goods hero”. “Underneath that very sexy surface are things that are dark and difficult and painful,” he said. “Our storytelling is very grounded in reality and that brings you very much back to the real world in a way that I think Bond never does.”The Night Manager series two is part of an ever-expanding le Carré universe.The Spy Who Came in from the Coldis currently on in the West End as a stage play, while the classic le Carré novel is also being developed into a BBC series calledLegacy of Spies.Cornwell says the hope is the entire “Smiley sequence” – the novels revolving around the world of the spymaster – are adapted for the small screen over the course of a decade. A third series of The Night Manager has already been commissioned.Whether you like your le Carré served with a cocktail or a cuppa, the espionage writer’s world is here to stay.Explore more on these topicsThe Night ManagerJohn le CarréJames BondDenis VilleneuveTom HiddlestonBBCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its 800 pages, bristling with swords, sorcerers, dragons and damsels, make up the earliest known work by a female Spanish novelist.But while Miguel de Cervantes and his fatal skewering of chivalric romance have long permeated western culture, the life and work ofBeatriz Bernalhave been largely relegated to the sphere of academic research.A new, illustrated adaptation of her novel, calledLas aventuras del caballero Cristalián(The Adventures of Cristalián the Knight), aims to redress the balance and introduce Bernal’s work to younger readers.Its adapter, the children’s author Diego Arboleda, first heard Bernal’s name while studying Spanish literature at university. “She’s one of those writers who are studied a lot but who haven’t managed to break out of the cage of academic studies,” said Arboleda. “It’s ironic because the kind of chivalric romance that Beatriz Bernal wrote did have a big audience back then – even though a lot of people couldn’t read.”Bernal, who was born to a well-to-do family in northern Spain at the beginning of the 16th century, published Cristaliánwhen she was in her early 40s. The first edition did not bear her name and was attributed to“a noble and native lady of the most loyal town of Valladolid”. But the second edition, published posthumously in 1587, named her as the book’s author.Although she is unfamiliar to today’s readers, Bernal made her mark in her own time and her eponymous knight was namechecked in a verse by the Spanish Golden Age poet Luis de Góngora.View image in fullscreenLas aventuras del caballero Cristalián. Beatriz Bernal’s knight was namechecked in a verse by the Spanish Golden Age poet Luis de Góngora.Photograph: AnayaArboleda’s interest in Bernal was rekindled a few years ago and he found himself taking advantage of Spain’s lengthy Covid lockdown to read and transcribe a digital version of Cristaliánthat the University of Valencia’s historical library had uploaded to the web.“I love the text itself but I also love her as an author,” he said. “There was this woman in the 16th century who was writing a book that was full of fantasy and imagination.”Arboleda was so taken with Bernal that he introduced her as a character in his recent book,Una librería en el bosque(A bookshop in the wood). “I saw that a lot of the people who were reading that book couldn’t read Beatriz’s Cristalián … because the transcriptions aren’t accessible.”The writer’s proposal for an adaptation of Cristalián– based on two episodes from the second edition of the novel – was accepted by his publisher, Anaya.Arboleda said he had chosen those particular adventures because of what they reveal about Bernal’s mind and her creations. “She has this female vision within a genre that was very masculine,” he said. “Her female characters aren’t passive, they’re strong and active.”Although female sorcerers abound in chivalric literature, Bernal’s character Membrina is described as being so wise “that she never wanted to take a husband in order that no one should order her about”. Similarly, the female errant knight Minerva is, in Arboleda’s words, “a really good warrior who’s very powerful and very brave”.“Bernal is moving away from these archetypal female characters that are passive,” he said. “And instead of a princess who has to be saved by a knight, you have Minerva the knight saving people.”But, above all, Cristalián is a massively fun read. “There’s this female giant who flies a dragon that you don’t sit on,” said Arboleda. “There’s a door in its side and you open it and get in. It’s like a plane or like the bus from [Hayao] Miyazaki’s My Neighbour Totoro. There are so many details like that.”Donatella Gagliardi, an associate professor of Spanish literature at the Orientale University in Naples and the author of a 2010 work on Bernal, said the writer’s pioneering work had “legitimised the female voice” in a very male literary world.“Beatriz preferred weaving chivalric plots in her Cristalián to weaving wool and linen, and she chose a literary genre against which contemporary moralists and self-righteous individuals constantly launched invectives,” said Gagliardi. “From her pen sprang unforgettable female characters.”For Arboleda, the text is as irresistible as the figure of its half-forgotten author.“Historically speaking, everything was against Beatriz Bernal,” he said. “She was a woman and she was choosing not to write a ‘virtuous’ book about religion or offering advice to other women. Instead, she wrote in this chivalric genre that was so successful but which then disappeared.”He hopes his adaptation, with pictures by Eugenia Ábalos, will end up in the hands of young readers who will discover that it is not so different from more familiar sagas such as the Arthurian legends and The Lord of the Rings.“That makes me smile because now that the book is reaching readers, there’s some small satisfaction there for Beatriz Bernal. It’s not revenge, it’s just seeing that after such a long time, people are enjoying her text, even if they don’t know it was written by a woman.”Explore more on these topicsSpainFictionFiction in translationMiguel de CervantesEuropeWomenIllustrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One is The Strangers, a supernatural tale offering glimpses into the accomplished wordsmith that Williams would become, and published for the first time this week in theliterary magazine Strand.It is a “significant find” according to scholars of Williams’s early days and upbringing in Missouri.“The play incorporates all the theatrical elements of early radio horror,” said Andrew Gulli, the publication’s managing editor.“A storm, howling wind, shadows, a house perched over the sea, flickering candles, mysterious footsteps on the stairs, spectral beings … as well as early hints of the themes and devices Williams would return to in his most famous later works: isolation, fear, the shades of gray between imagination and reality, and a house haunted by memory and the private terrors of those who inhabit it.”The Strangers never made it to Broadway, and is believed to have enjoyed only a single performance on a rural radio station in Iowa as part of a short-lived series called Little Theater of the Air in 1938.But the script’s dark themes, characters and plot twists provide a fascinating, albeit limited glimpse at the style Williams was honing on his way to the big time with plays exploring repression, desire and loneliness. It was written as part of his coursework at the University of Iowa, where he was studying for an undergraduate English degree.“It is unusual as a radio play,” saidTom Mitchell, a Williams biographer and expert who was not connected to Strand’s acquisition of the work from the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.“It is significant as a ‘find’ insofar as it is one of the many examples of Williams’s writing that hasn’t been published yet [and] is among a number of stories that fit into the category of weird tales, ghost stories, exotic mysteries, science fiction, time travel, etc.“It’s a fairly standard scary tale, but it’s fun and spooky, and even more fun when read aloud.”The plot centers on an elderly couple and their spinster houseguest on a stormy night on the New England coast, where the rotating beam from a nearby lighthouse provides sporadic relief from the darkness and the presence of supernatural beings known as “the strangers”.A series of distressing events leaves listeners wondering if the beings are “a materialization of the occult, or projections of the characters’ unravelling minds”, according to John Bak, professor of literature at Wits University and the Université de Lorraine, who wrote an analysis of the play for Strand.At the time he wrote it, Bak said, “Williams was still trying, unsuccessfully, to land work in either federally funded theatre or radio broadcasting, but that failure would prove fortuitous, both for him and for American theater, for Tom Williams was on his way to becoming Tennessee Williams.“Like many of his early experiments, The Strangers, with its portrayal of isolation, fear, psychological ambiguity, and the possible mental unraveling of its characters, does more than reveal an emerging artist: it foreshadows so many of the themes that would define Tennessee Williams’s most enduring works.”In 2021, Gulli uncovered another previously unpublished work by Williams, his 1952 short story The Summer Woman,found in archivesat Harvard University’s Houghton Library.By that time Williams, who died in 1983 aged 71, had found success, writing the story eight years after his breakout play The Glass Menagerie, and almost midway between publication of two of his biggest successes, A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947, and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1955.Explore more on these topicsTennessee WilliamsUS theaterMagazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Now the speculation has been put to bed, with Chalamet jumping on an unexpected remix of EsDeeKid’s track 4 Raws.Chalamet posted a clip of a video for the track to his social media, rapping alongside EsDeeKid in a series of scenes, from a cramped kitchen to a housing estate.“Got model bitches in Peckham / I’m Ryan Reynolds in Wrexham,” Chalamet raps in lyrics designed to court a UK fanbase before the Boxing Day release of his new movie, Marty Supreme, which also gets numerous shoutouts.He also makes reference to his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, with the lyrics: “It’sTimothée Chalametchilling, trying to stack 100 million, girl got a billion,” before adding: “I’m having fun, just sexting / my dick is young and restless.”He continues: “My life is an opera, look at the Oscars / look at the groupies, look at the movies / look at the triple-A girl gon’ choose me / look at my haters man they want to sue me,” rapping quickly over the song’s distorted beat, with the track being shared tens of thousands of times in just a few hours of being posted.pic.twitter.com/c6c5pSzGgR— Timothée Chalamet (@RealChalamet)December 19, 2025If a full version of the track were released, it would likely send 4 Raws back up the UK charts. The track rose as high as No 27 before being overtaken by Christmas songs, but it’s only one hit track from EsDeeKid, who has gone from relative unknown to the UK’s most popular rapper in just a few months.His track Century broke into the top 10, while his album Rebel was the most-streamed rap album in the world on Spotify in November, and is still in the top 20.‘Constant stimulation, dopamine overload’: how EsDeeKid and UK underground rap exploded on a global scaleRead moreHe has never given an interview and keeps his face hidden from the public, aside from the occasional glimpse of his eyes, leading to speculation that he was actually Chalamet in disguise. Asked by BBC Radio One DJ Greg James earlier this month about the supposed connection, Chalamet replied: “All will be revealed in due time.”Chalamet performed his versions of Bob Dylan songs for biopic A Complete Unknown, for which he was Oscar-nominated. He also says he is an admirer of the UK underground rap scene, this week naming rapper Fakemink alongside Susan Boyle as the Britons he admires the most.Chalamet is tipped for a potential Oscar win for Marty Supreme, after losing this year to Adrien Brody’s turn in The Brutalist.The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw wrote ina five-star review of Marty Supreme: “By the end of this movie my head was oscillating from side to side as if it had been hit with cymbals.” It was voted thefifth best film of the yearby Guardian critics before even going on release.This article was updated on 20 December to correct a lyric.Explore more on these topicsTimothée ChalametRapnewsShareReuse this content"

They arrived, eventually, at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, where Harold Offeh’s exhibitionThe Mothership Collective 2.0was showing (it’s on until 18 January).The show is described as a “sci-fi playscape for collaborative encounters” and made up of different zones. The two bubble-like objects Phoebe is reaching for are, in fact, inflatable plastic balls. Rayner used her phone to capture the little girl in action, noting that the “geometric lines, strong colours and shadows created a striking image”.Rayner says of the artist behind the balls, “His ambition was encouraging joy through play, and he achieved that.” She adds that Phoebe “rolled, threw and kicked each and every one, and after lunch in the cafe even asked to go back a second time. At bedtime she excitedly relayed her day, and the exhibition, to her parents and little brothers, captured perfectly by this photo.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereGwilym MumfordSat 20 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 20 Dec 2025 02.02 ESTShareIt’s time to look back on a year of Traitors and Sinners, of Bad Bunnies and Such Brave Girls, with the Guide’s now annual roundup of the year’s best culture. As ever, the Guardian is already knee-deep in lists – of films (UKandUS), albums (acrossrock and pop, andclassical),TV shows,booksandgames, andtheatre, comedy and dance. Some of those have already counted down to No 1, others will reach their respective summits in the coming days, so keep an eye on the homepage.Our list meanwhile is entirely, unapologetically partial, and definitely not as comprehensive as The Guardian’s many top 50s: there are numerous albums we never got around to hearing, and TV shows we’re still only halfway through. (Pluribus, Dope Thief and Blue Lights, I will return to you, I promise!) But hopefully it should give a flavour of a year that, despite so many headwinds, was a pretty strong one for culture. On with the show!TVWhen it wasn’t plotting to end the cinema-going experience, Netflix waschurning out TV seriesat the usual rapid clip. Much of its programming vanished from our collective memory within days of hitting the homepage – did Tina Fey, Steve Carell, Colman Domingo and Will Fortereally make a TV showin 2025, or was that just a fever dream you had after taking too much Night Nurse? Still, Netflix’sAdolescencefelt indelible, a remarkably well-conceived and acted drama, not to mention a national conversation-starter. My Netflix series of the year though wasThe Eternaut(Netflix), anArgentinian end-of-the-world dramathat depicted the apocalypse with startling clarity, all while contending with the country’s unstable political past. Do catch up on it over Christmas if you can; it’s only six episodes. Another international series that wowed me wasMussolini: Son of the Century(Sky Atlantic), Joe Wright’sdarkly compelling account of Il Duce’s rise, which sought to “seduce” the audience into understanding Mussolini’s appeal, before making them feel awkwardly complicit when his grip tightened.It was a strong year for TV comedy. WithHow Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge)(BBC iPlayer), Steve Coogan and his writers, the Gibbons brothers, managed to find yet another fertile avenue for Norfolk’s finest to furrow, as Alan got stuck into “men’s mental health” and much more besides. In its second series,Such Brave Girls(BBC iPlayer) solidified its status as the most daringly ugly comedy around, and I laughed like a jackal at much of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s industry satireThe Studio(Apple TV+), which has also felt more and more relevant with every real-world Hollywood merger and worrying AI “innovation” that has arrived in its wake. Comeback show of the year, meanwhile, was surelySouth Park(Paramount+)which, in its 27th and 28th seasons, no less, went on a hilarious scorched-earth assault of the Trump administration. No one was spared, not least the president, recast as a micro-appendaged, Satan-impregnating, Saddam-a-like.Alien: Earth(FX) featured its own unlikely breakout star – a sheep with a gruesome little octopoid creature embedded in its eye. Not everyone vibed with Noah Hawley’s offbeat take on the franchise, but it certainly creeped me out like no other series this year. Though there were moments that came close in Adam Curtis’ latest mammoth video essayShifty(BBC iPlayer), a haunting and sometimes very funny account of the fracturing of our shared reality, from Thatcherism onwards. Finally, it’s hard to argue for anything other thanTheCelebrity Traitors(BBC iPlayer) being the biggest show of the year, in the UK at least. It could have gone so badly wrong – overly chummy or stage-managed – but it felt as addictive as any of the civilian series.And here are five great TV episodesto check out:LOL Last One Laughing UK(Amazon Prime, s1, ep3);Louis Theroux: The Settlers(BBC iPlayer) standalone documentary);Pluribus– WeIs Us (Apple TV+, s1, ep1);Severance– Cold Harbour (Apple TV+, s2, ep10);Slow Horses– Tall Tales (Apple TV+, s5, ep3)MusicTwo long-term Guide faves released much-anticipated new albums in 2025, and they were both as good as we’d hoped. Cotton Crown by theTubsbuilt on the brilliant, withering jangle of the four-piece’s debut with moments of tender reflection by vocalist Owen Williams about his late mother. And the wonderfully freewheeling Getting Killed, by ascendant New York bandGeesewas nothing less than a sensation, earning the band fans from Cillian Murphy to Patti Smith overnight. (Side note: ineligible for this list, as it was released right at the final knockings of 2024, is Geese frontmanCameron Winter’s solo record, the beguiling chamber-folky Heavy Metal – but it definitely feels spiritually 2025 and deserves a mention.)Meanwhile, an album no one expected to ever see the light of day – Let God Sort Em Out by long-dormant rap duoClipse– did magically arrive and was maybe even better than hoped, full of deliciously cutting lines and featuring some of Pharrell Williams’s best production in yonks. If that album felt like a welcome throwback, the glitchy, frenetic Stardust by Detroit’s finest,Danny Brown, sounded beamed in from some strange future, thanks to the rapper cannily collaborating with some of the most adventurous producers working in hyperpop. Yorkshire producerBlawan’s SickElixir was even more bracing, a collection of garage, bass and dubstep tracks that sounded as if they had been fed into a wood chipper and reassembled – but, in a good way, obviously.There were tons of great albums for those of us who like things on the crunchier end of the spectrum.Deftonesare probably as big as they’ve ever been, thanks to being discovered by gen Z in recent years, and their 10th LP, Private Music, was as pleasingly pummelling as anything in their back catalogue. I really enjoyed Last Leg of the Human Table, the new album by Indiana four-pieceCloakroom, which was described by most reviewers as shoegaze, but sounded more like Teenage Fanclub or Weezer backed by a doom-metal rhythm section. And Chrome Dipped, by AussiesCivic, pushed garage rock to its gnarliest, noisiest extremes. On It’s a Beautiful Place, Chicago duoWater From Your Eyesspiked their art-pop with 90s alt-rock and techno, a mixture that shouldn’t have worked but really, really did. AndWolf Alice, now probably Britain’s biggest guitar band without the numbers 1, 9, 7 and 5 in their name, also evolved on the 70s soft rock-tinged The Clearing – an album that felt stadium-sized.And here are five great songsto listen to:Bad Bunny– Nuevayol(music video of the year, for sure!);Bar Italia– Fundraiser;Model/Actriz– Cinderella;Turnstile– Birds;Underscores– MusicFilmIt feels like several years ago now, but January and February brought some great, late-arriving Oscar contenders to UK cinemas, in particular two films that contended with the complexities of the Jewish experience in wildly different ways: Brady Corbet’s heftyThe Brutalist, about a Holocaust survivor’s difficult encounter with mid-century America; and Jesse Eisenberg’s funny, causticA Real Pain, where he and Kieran Culkin played mismatched cousins embarking on a heritage tour around Poland. Rounding out the year (and the triumvirate) is Josh Safdie’sMarty Supreme, starring Timothée Chalamet as a wayward ping-pong prodigy. A berserk joyride through mid-century Jewish New York, it doubles up as the best sports movie of the year and will be a major Oscars contender come March. Catch it when it hits cinemas on Boxing Day.Britain’s film industry often feels like little more than a place where Hollywood studios can make their blockbusters on the cheap (for the time being at least). Despite this, some excellent British films snuck through this year.28 Years Laterwas a zombie film like no other: a gory, kaleidoscopic Brexit parable replete with references to The Wicker Man, Teletubbies and Jimmy Savile.Pillion, about a blossoming BDSM dom-sub romance between Alexander Skarsgård’s biker adonis and Harry Melling’s wide-eyed homebody, managed to be warming without ever vanilla-ising the scene it was portraying. AndI Swear, Kirk Jones’s triumphant biopic of Tourette’s campaigner John Davidson, was the sort of adeptly put-together, mainstream British drama there are far too few of these days. Catch it on streaming over Christmas: you won’t regret it.In the comedy stakes, Eva Victor marked herself out as a distinctive new voice with her sterling comedy dramaSorry, Baby, about the aftershocks of a sexual assault, while the relentlessly funny/cringe-inducingFriendshipmanaged to capture the distinctive voice of I Think You Should Leave’s Tim Robinson in full feature-film form without the joke ever wearing thin (see also, Robinson’s great, goofy conspiracy series The Chair Company). Two films though were more audacious than anything else I saw this year: Jafar Panahi’sIt Was Just an Accident, a white-knuckle revenge thriller filmed entirely on the sly, behind the backs of the same oppressive state it was critiquing; and Paul Thomas Anderson’sOne Battle After Another, a thrillingly of-the-moment American epic that will be discussed and debated long after it dominates next year’s awards season.And here are five great performancesto catch:Miles Caton(Sinners);Ethan Hawke(Blue Moon);Jesse Plemons(Bugonia);Renate Reinsve(Sentimental Value);Renée Zellweger(Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy)PodcastsThe most talked-about podcast of the year is surelyWisecrack, which started by telling the story of standup Edd Hedges’ close encounter with his childhood bully turned murderer, before evolving into something knottier and more poignant. If it doesn’t get a Baby Reindeer-style TV adaptation in the next 12 months, I’ll be amazed. The other narrative podcast that truly wowed me in 2025 wasFela Kuti: Fear No Man, a history of the Afrobeat pioneer that combined great talking heads, meticulously researched archive material and, at its centre, a simply remarkable life story.The series I turned to when I most needed a break from doom-laden current affairs podcasts wasElis JamesandJohn Robins, which remained remarkably consistent in its ability to whip up entertaining waffle. (John’s meltdown – threatening to sack everyone in the studio afterlearning that his credit score was worse than Elis’s– was probably my favourite podcast moment of the year.) Elsewhere,The Big Picture, a favourite of the Guide’s, outdid itself this year. Along with the usual insightful industry chat, movie drafts and rankings of filmographies, there was its year-long 25 for 25 season, which selected the 25 greatest films of the century so far. We’ll find out No 1 on New Year’s Eve. David Runciman’s history of ideas podcastPast Present Futurewas also strong in 2025, with seasons on the history of revolutionary ideas (from the Magna Carta to Darwinism) and Politics on Trial, which went from Socrates all the way to Lady Chatterley’s Lover. And inCannonball With Wesley Morris, one of the most engaging cultural commentators around served up his always-opinionated, always-surprising takes on the latest goings-on in pop culture (his episode on whymusic criticism has lost its biteis a must-listen).Lastly, please do check out the Guardian’s great investigative pods from this year:Missing in the Amazon, which told the story of the 2022 disappearances of journalist Dom Phillips and defender of Indigenous rights Bruno Pereira while reporting from a remote corner of the rainforest; andThe Birth Keepers, a year-long investigation into the highly controversial Free Birth Society. That’s not to forget Guardian regulars like daily news podToday in Focus, weekly analysis podsPolitics Weekly,Politics Weekly AmericaandScience Weekly, foodie chat podComfort Eating With Grace Dent, andFootball WeeklyandWomen’s Football Weekly, which have been joined in the sports podcast stable, for the next weeks, byAshes Weekly.GamesEarly in the year I spent a full month exploring the ranging puzzle-palace ofBlue Prince, an extraordinarily intelligent, sedately paced game in which you search for the 46th room of a shape-shifting mansion. Every day, you decide what’s behind the next door, selecting from a small range of blueprints (get it?) to create your own meandering path through the family pile; when you hit a dead end, you go to sleep and start again in the morning. And I’ve spent the last few months of the year bashing my head againstHollow Knight: Silksong, an exquisite yet harshly punishing game about a quasi-magical spider on a pilgrimage through a decaying religious capital. After three months I have only just reached the final boss; rarely has a game made me despair as much, and yet I kept going back to it. Between these two extremes – one a challenge for the intellect, the other a challenge for the reflexes – liesClair Obscur: Expedition 33, a surreal and extravagantly French game about a small group of explorers trying to kill death. (This is a reductive explanation but look, if I tried to explain Clair Obscur in full, we’d be here all day.) It is a game for people who enjoy sumptuous belle epoque-inspired artistic direction and a decent story.Those games are all fairly huge, but for the time-poor,Despeloteis a micro-marvel: a quasi-autobiographical game about family and fandom, played from the point of view of an Ecuadorian child during the country’s 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign. And another autobiographical game is the comedic-looking but heartfeltConsume Me, a game about being a teenage girl immersed in diet culture in the 00s, managing school life and trying not to disappoint your parents. Lastly: you can’t go wrong withMario Kart World. It has provided my whole family and every visitor to my household with uncomplicated fun since the summer.Keza MacDonaldBooksMy book of the year isThe Loneliness of Sonia and Sunnyby Kiran Desai. She spent 20 years on it, and it shows – her sentences are immaculate (I don’t think I’ve ever underlined a book so much). It’s a love story, but it’s also a book about migration, friendship, loss and family. It completely broke me – totally worth the nearly 700 pages. Desai narrowly missed out on a second Booker after another of my favourites,Fleshby David Szalay, took it home. His novel, following his protagonist István from teenage life on a housing estate in Hungary to elite circles in the UK, is bold, refreshingly spare and moreish despite its unrelenting bleakness.Several of my favourite recent novels came out in paperback this year. I’ve been pushingMy Friendsby Hisham Matar – about three Libyan exiles living in London – into the hands of allmyfriends. Then there’sThe Coinby Yasmin Zaher – a decidedly weird but brilliant tale of a Palestinian-American woman living in New York who gets involved in a Birkin bag reselling operation. And I lovedCreation Lake, Rachel Kushner’s spy caper, following morally dubious agent Sadie Smith as she infiltrates an eco-commune in France. Finally, the book that took me by surprise this year wasStrange Picturesby Uketsu, a clever mystery slowly resolved through several creepy drawings.Ella CreamerIf you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterPodcastsPop and rocknewslettersShareReuse this content"

For younger TikTokers, that means the 90s.More than 8,000 videos have been posted under the hashtag #90sChristmas, celebrating a look that includes multicoloured tree lights, homemade felt ornaments and –in a post with nearly 4m views– VHS tapes of Christmas classics such as the Macaulay Culkin caper.View image in fullscreenMacaulay Culkin and Joe Pesci in Home Alone (1990).Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Kobal/ShutterstockTikTok said Christmas decor videos had increased by 100% over the past 12 months, with commentators saying the emphasis on nostalgia reflects a need for stability in uncertain times.“There is a sense of inherent nostalgia in these trends,” says Hugh Metcalf, editor of the interior decor website Livingetc.com. “These are not super-contemporary looks. It’s a search for comfort from yesteryear when things right now are a bit more uncertain.”The Christmas vibe shift: forget beige – the Home Alone look is all the rageRead moreWGSN, a consumer trend forecasting firm, says the 90s Christmas trend indicates a general rising nostalgia for that decade, which also came across during Halloween as an embrace of “tacky decor” pushed at notions of what constitutes good taste.Metcalf says TikTok is “super influential” for Christmas aesthetics across all generations, with online influencers having greater sway over festive aesthetics than they do over interior decor trends across the rest of the year, which tend to be the province of design professionals.“These Christmas trends are for things people have seen and experienced before,” Metcalf adds. “It’s appealing to personal histories and our sense of emotion, a bit of relief from trying to get the newest, most interesting interior design idea.”View image in fullscreenA Christmas tree outside the Ralph Lauren store in New Bond Street, London.Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/ShutterstockEven more popular than the 90s take this year is Ralph Lauren Christmas, riffing on theAmerican designer’s signature lookswith deep colours, rich wooden panelling and green tartan prints. TikTokers has also offered tips on how to afford a festive take on the luxury brand ifyou’re on a budget.WGSN says the Ralph Lauren yuletide aesthetic represents a broader push for “new classic iterations and traditional vibes” over the Christmas season. Describing the trend as “cross-generational nostalgia”, WGSM says it is manifesting itself in looks like cosy knits, windowsill candles and bannister garlands.“Explorations of these classic looks are gaining strength even among younger consumers,” says Cassandra Gagnon, a WGSN strategist.If the late 20th century isn’t distant enough as we peer through the retro tinsel from our 2025 vantage point, then WGSN also reports interest in “opulent antiquity”, including velvet Christmas stockings andtree skirts. It means terms such as “Little Women Christmas” – inspired by the Louisa May Alcott classic – arealso trending on the platform.View image in fullscreenThe Holiday (2006) has also become a decor influence.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyTime has also been kinder to The Holiday, a romantic comedy film which received some negative reviews on its releasenearly two decades agobut has become a decorinfluence on TikTokthis year as well.

Unsurprisingly, then, ourChristmaslunch was more than a bit diverse: my father always insisted on some British and Lebanese elements, while my mother contributed French dishes and technique; west African produce was also a must, because the house would be full of all nationalities, including our African family. Not only that, but our Christmas would invariably start with a guest list of about 20, and another 20 or so waifs and strays would always then turn up in need of feeding and watering. Today’s dishes were part of our regular seasonal festivities, as good in the sunshine as they are robust enough for a chilly British winter.Mackerel sambousekView image in fullscreenPacked with flavour: Stosi Madi’s mackerelsambousek.Lebanese feasts always feature some form of pie, andsambouseksare tiny little ones with various fillings. Smoked fish is very popular in west Africa, and these smoked mackerel pielets make a delicious nibble. They can also be made in advance, frozen and baked straight from the freezer on the day. If you can’t get hold of fresh horseradish, use 150g hot horseradish sauce, perhaps pepped up with a dollop of dijon mustard to taste, instead of the fresh horseradish and creme fraiche.Prep15 minProve40 min+Cook40 minServes8For the dough (or use 500g shop-bought pizza dough)1 tbsp instant yeast375g plain flour1 tsp salt80ml olive oilFor the filling4 peppered smoked mackerel fillets, skinned1 large red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, finely choppedFinely grated zest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon1tbsp grated fresh horseradish(see recipe introduction)150gcreme fraiche(see recipe introduction)Salt, to tasteMelted butter, for brushingPut yeast, flour and salt in a mixer fitted with a dough hook and work gently for about 30 seconds, just to combine. Add 100ml lukewarm water, work again gently to form a dough, then turn up the speed to medium and add up to another 100ml lukewarm water as needed, until the dough comes together into a smooth ball – be careful not to add so much water that you end up with a sticky dough. Put the dough in a large bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm and leave to prove for about 40 minutes, until doubled in size.While the dough is proving, flake the fish into small pieces and put in a bowl with the onion, parsley, lemon zest and juice, and the horseradish. Mix to combine and bind, then work in half the creme fraiche and mix again to bind. Add the rest of the creme fraiche a little at a time (you may not need it all), until the mixture has a dropping consistency (you don’t want it too thin, or the filling will run). Season with salt to taste.On a well-floured surface, roll out the risen dough as thinly as you dare – aim for about 2mm thick – then use a round 10cm cutter to cut out as many circles as the pastry will yield: you should easily get 16-20. Put a heaped teaspoon of the fishy filling in the centre of each pastry circle, fold over into half-moons, then crimp the edges with the back of a fork. Brush evenly with melted butter, then refrigerate (or freeze) until ready to bake.To bake the pies, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. Put the pies on the tray, taking care not to overcrowd them (if need be, use a second lined tray), then bake for 12-15 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot or at room temperature.French-Caribbean-style crab gratinView image in fullscreenDressed to impress: Stosie Madi’s French-Caribbean-style crab gratin.You’ll need four dressed crabs in their shells (ideally, ones made with no breadcrumbs added) and four empty crab shells (ask the fishmonger for those – they ought happily to give them away for free); alternatively, bake these in little individual gratin dishes.Prep15 minCook55 minServes84 dressed crabs in the shell, plus 4 empty crab shells50ml vegetable oil1 white onion, peeled and diced3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 largered chillies, stalks, pith and seeds discarded, flesh finely diced1 small fennel, trimmed and finely grated1thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated1 tsp cayenne pepper1 small glass white wine(about 125ml)400g tin chopped tomatoes1 tsp chopped fresh thyme leaves1 tsp sugarJuice of ½ lime100g breadcrumbs1 small bunchfresh coriander, roughly chopped, to garnishCrusty bread, to serveSpoon the white meat out of the dressed crabs and set aside – you’ll use this as garnish later.Put the oil in a heavy-based pan on a moderate heat, then saute the onion, garlic, chilli, fennel and ginger for about eight minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the cayenne pepper, cook, stirring, for another five minutes, then stir in the brown crab meat. Tip in the wine and cook until almost all the liquid evaporates. Add the tomatoes, thyme, sugar and lime juice, then cover, turn down the heat and leave to simmer very gently for 15 minutes.Divide the sauce evenly between the eight crab shells (or gratin dishes). Top with the white crab meat, breadcrumbs and chopped coriander, then leave to cool. Refrigerate until you’re ready to serve – the crabs can be prepared up to this stage three days ahead.To cook the gratins, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, then bake for 12-15 minutes, until bubbling. Serve hot with crusty bread.Slow-roasted spiced lamb shoulderView image in fullscreenTime is on your side: Stosi Madi’s slow-roasted spiced lamb shoulder.Lamb, mutton and goat are the proteins of choice in the Middle East and most of Africa, especially at big celebrations. You can’t really go wrong with a slow roast, because it gives you plenty of time to spend with your guests.Prep10 minCook3 hr 15 minServes81 large boned shoulder of lamb(roughly 2½-3kg with bone in) – ask the butcher to bone it for you. If you’re making your own stock for the rice, keep the bones and trimmings, ideally chopped into smallish pieces500ml hot lamb stockFor the paste3 tbsp pomegranatemolasses4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated100ml olive oil2 tbsp ground cumin1 tbsp ground fennel1 tsp ground cinnamon1tbsp black pepperFirst make the spice paste. Put the molasses, garlic and olive oil in a bowl, mix to combine, then stir in the ground cumin, fennel, cinnamon and black pepper. Rub the lamb shoulder all over with the paste mix, then roll and tie it to make a joint. (Alternatively, ask the butcher to roll and tie it for you; if he’sreallyfriendly, give him the paste and ask him to rub it over the meat first.)Put the joint in an earthenware roasting pot for which you have a lid, then roast uncovered at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 15 minutes. Turn the joint, roast still uncovered for another 15 minutes, then pour in the lamb stock and cover the pot. Turn down the oven to 140C (120C fan/275F/gas 1, roast for another hour, then turn over the joint and roast for a further hour and a half. So long as it’s rolled properly, the joint should hold its shape, and the meat should by now be so soft that you can push the handle of a wooden spoon right through without any resistance.Serve right away with the pan juices, the jewelled rice and yoghurt below (the meat doesn’t need to rest because it’s been cooked slowly for a long time at a low temperature).Jewelled riceView image in fullscreenFestive dazzle: Stosie Madi’s jewelled rice.This isthecore of this whole meal, because rice is the celebratory carbohydrate at many a Middle Eastern and west African table. The onions are probably the most important element, and they need a lot of oil, but, on the bright side, you’ll be left with a load of onion-infused oil to use in all sorts of ways. As for the nuts, if, like me, you love them, add more and as many varieties as you like, though the pine nuts and almonds are essential; unfortunately, they all have to be peeled, too. If you don’t want to make your own stock, use ready-made lamb stock or lamb stock cubes dissolved in water. All the elements can be made well ahead, leaving you just the rice to cook on the day.Prep20 minStock6 hrCook1 hr 15 minServes8For the stock (optional)Bones from 1 large lamb shoulder1 small garlic bulb, unpeeled and cut in half horizontally1 white onion, unpeeled and cut in half1 large carrot, cut in half lengthways1 bay leaf5 black peppercorns1 cinnamon stick1 tsp cuminseedsFor the crispy onions500mlneutral oil– I use cold pressed rapeseed oil3 large white onions, peeled and thinly slicedFor the nuts100g blanched peeled almonds100g pine nuts50g shelled and peeled pistachios50g shelled and peeled walnuts4 tbsp reserved crispy onion oil(see above and method)For the rice50ml reserved crispy onion oil25g clarified butter, or lamb fat50g vermicelli, broken up into 2½cm lengths, if need be(some brands come already broken up; optional)250g long-grain rice(yes, that’s a lot, but it keeps well)20g crispy onions(see above and method)375ml hot lamb stock2tsp salt, or to tasteSeeds from 1 pomegranate, or 1 tub shop-bought pomegranate seedsIf you’re making your own stock (and I highly recommend it), put the shoulder bones in a roasting tin with the halved garlic bulb, onion and carrot, then roast in a very hot oven – 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9 – for about 20 minutes, until nicely browned. Add two litres of water to the tin, stir to deglaze, then tip the lot into a very large saucepan or stock pot and add the bay leaf, peppercorns, cinnamon and cumin.Bring to a boil, then turn down to a low simmer and cook for up to six hours, skimming off and discarding any foam and impurities that bubble to the surface along the way. After six hours, strain, cool and refrigerate overnight. Before using, skim any fat off the surface, and discard or save for another use – I’d use it in the rice.First, make the onions. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pan to 180C, add the sliced onions and fry, turning constantly, for 10-15 minutes, until they turn a uniform golden brown– be careful, though, because with onions there’s a very fine line between golden and burned! Take off the heat and keep stirring until the oil stops bubbling.Set a metal sieve or colander over a second large saucepan, then drain the onions into the sieve – again, take great care, because the oil will be very hot. Reserve the oil. Spread the drained onions over a large baking tray lined with kitchen towel, then leave to cool and crisp up. Once cooled, store in an airtight container. (NB: crisp onions are fundamental to this recipe, but if you find deep-frying them daunting, you can instead shallow-fry and brown them slowly in a frying pan for about 30 minutes – they won’t be as crisp, but they will be sweet.)The onions can be made up to a week ahead.Now for the nuts, which each need to be roasted separately, because they all cook at different speeds. Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3, put each type of nut in a separate bowl and stir a tablespoon of the reserved onion oil into each bowl. One by one, spread the nuts on a lined oven tray and roast until golden and browned – depending on the type of nut, they’ll take anywhere between five and 15 minutes each, so keep checking and take great care they don’t burn. Drain each batch of toasted nuts on kitchen towel, leave to cool, then store in an airtight tin. The nuts can also be made up to a week ahead.Now for the rice. Put the reserved onion oil and clarified butter (or reserved lamb fat) in a heavy-based pan on a moderate heat, until the butter starts foaming gently. Add the vermicelli, if using, and cook, stirring, until the pasta turns golden brown. Add the rice, stir until well coated in the fat, then stir in 20g of the crispy onions. Pour in the hot stock, season with salt and keep stirring until it starts bubbling. Part cover with a lid and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring every five minutes, until most of the stock is absorbed. Turn the heat right down, cover with a clean tea towel and then a lid, then leave to steam, still on the heat, for a further 15 minutes. Keep warm on the lowest possible heat until ready to serve.To serve, fluff up the rice with a fork, then turn it out on to a platter. Scatter the onions, nuts and pomegranate seeds all over the top, and serve.Yoghurt and cucumber saladView image in fullscreenGoes with all sorts: Stosi Madi’s yoghurt and cucumber salad.Yoghurt is a stalwart of the Mediterranean table. Paired with refreshing cucumbers, it makes a great accompaniment for any lamb dish and is also delicious with rice.SteepUp to 2 hrPrep20 minServes84 firm smallLebanese cucumbers, or 1 large regular cucumber (although that will usually have far less flavour)2 tsp salt350g thick Greek-style set yoghurt, strained1 tbsp dried mint1 tbsp chopped fresh mint1 tsp sugar1 small garlic clove, peeled and finely gratedPeel the cucumbers, cut them in half lengthways, then scoop out the seeds. Cut each cucumber half in half again lengthways, then cut the flesh into cubes. Put these in a colander, add the salt, toss, then leave to drain for up to two hours, until you’re ready to use.Put the yoghurt in a bowl with the herbs, sugar and garlic, stir well, then cover and put in the fridgeuntil needed.To assemble the salad, rinse the salted cucumber, pat it dry with a clean tea towel, then stir it into the yoghurt mix. Taste, adjust the seasoning if need be, and serve.Rum and pineapple cakeView image in fullscreenA Christmas fruit cake with a difference: Stosie Madi’s rum and pineapple cake.Pudding is essential to any celebration, and this one is a lovely variation on a traditional Christmas fruit cake influenced by the west African Creoles who brought back rum from the West Indies. You’ll need a 23cm loose-bottomed nonstick cake tin and, ideally, abaking belt, to ensure an evenly cooked cake.Prep15 minCook1 hr 30 minServes8-10250g self-raising flour10g ground cinnamon10g ground black pepper10g ground ginger15g sea salt½ whole nutmeg, finely grated10g baking powder200g soft brown sugar125g unsalted butter125g vegetable oil50g full-fat Greek yoghurt2 tsp vanilla extract4 large eggs(250g)200g raisins, soaked in 75ml dark spiced rum for at least 24 hours75ml dark spiced rum, for flambeeing the cake on the dayCreme fraiche, to serveFor the syrup1 vanilla pod, split open, seeds scraped out and empty pod reserved for the pineapple75g sugar75ml fresh pineapple juice, or water50ml rumFinely grated zest and juice of 1 limeFor the pineapple1 spent vanilla pod, left over from making the syrup50g caster sugar50g softened butter1pineapple, peeled, cored and eyes removedPut the first seven dry ingredients in a large bowl. Put the soft brown sugar and butter in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, then beat until creamed and smooth. Beat in the oil, yoghurt and vanilla, then work in the eggs. Mix in the rum-soaked raisins, then turn down the speed to low, tip in the contents of the bowl of dry ingredients and gently bring together for a few seconds. Do not overmix the cake batter.Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/385F/gas 5½.Remove the paddle, then, with a spatula, gently stir and fold the batter to make sure the flour is fully incorporated. Pour the mix into the lined tin, then wrap the tin with a baking belt and cover the top with a circle of buttered greaseproof paper.Bake the cake for 55-60 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean, then transfer the cake tin to a rack and leave to cool completely. The cake can be baked up to two weeks ahead (or even longer if you want to feed it some extra rum).While the cake is baking, prepare the syrup and fruit. Put all the syrup ingredients in a medium saucepan, heat gently, stirring occasionally, just until all the sugar dissolves, then take off the heat.Now for the pineapple. Put the reserved empty vanilla pod and sugar in a blender or food processor, blitz on a high speed, then beat in the butter. Tip the butter mix into a large ovenproof saucepan, set it over a medium heat and, the moment the butter starts to foam, add the whole peeled pineapple. Turn to coat, then pan-roast, turning constantly, for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.Transfer the pineapple pan to the hot oven and roast for 20 minutes, turning once halfway. Remove from the oven and leave the pan to cool completely.Once cool, lift out the pineapple, cut it in half lengthways, then cut each half lengthways into four long pieces.Put the pineapple pieces in a suitable container, pour all thesyrup over the top, cover and keep in the fridge until ready to use, turning the fruit as often as you remember. You can make the pineapple up to a week ahead.To serve, turn out the cake from its tin and transfer it to a platter. Gently warm the pineapple and syrup a little (a little turn in a microwave would do the trick), and gently warm the rum in a small saucepan.Arrange the pineapple batons on top of the cake, pour most of the syrup over the top and take to the table, along with the pan of warm rum. Carefully set the rum on fire, pour it all over the cake and serve with plenty of creme fraiche and the rest of the syrup drizzled all over the top.Stosie Madi is chef/co-patron ofThe Parkers Armsin Newton in Bowland, near Clitheroe, LancashireExplore more on these topicsFoodChristmas food and drinkChristmasStarterSnacksMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Mum brandished a knife … would whole-family therapy save our Christmas?Eight years ago, after yet another disastrous festive get-together, my mother decided we needed professional help. Which is how a new festive tradition beganKitty DrakeSat 20 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareIt is early December, and I am sitting in a psychoanalyst’s office in central London, about to do 60 minutes of pre-Christmas family therapy. Outside, theChristmaslights are twinkling. I can hear a drunk person literally shouting for joy on the street beneath the window. But inside the consulting room, it is eerily silent. My mother, my sister and I sit in squishy armchairs and pretend to admire the art, but really we are eyeballing one another like prizefighters, looking for weak spots. My father is just a tiny, flickering face on an iPhone, propped up next to my mother on a cushion. My father doesn’t really believe in therapy, but he’s compromised by dialling in via Zoom. He keeps falling off his cushion and on to the floor.View image in fullscreenKitty Drake (left) aged 14 with her sisterOur therapist peers benevolently at us over her spectacles. She is in her 80s and has a world-weary look about her. Like she has seen all manner of dysfunction before. She lets the silence hang for a moment, and then she clears her throat: “Shall we begin with presents? Or the meal?”My family started doing “Christmas therapy” eight years ago, after a holiday so bad my mother decided we needed professional help. The exact details are hazy but I do remember wrestling with my mother over a dish of roast potatoes. I also remember throwing a potato. Then my mother brandished a carving knife at me and said: “I would like to run you through with this knife.” We didn’t eat Christmas dinner at all that year. My mother wandered the streets alone, smoking fags, while the rest of us sat on the sofa and watched Elf.When we started therapy, the dream was that we would be able to Christmas-proof our family dynamic. The idea was to air grievances in advance, in the presence of a mental health professional, in order to avoid future unhappiness. But the way this plays out in practice is that once a year in December my family spend an hour in a room together, assigning “Christmas roles”, while delivering awful truths about one another’s personalities. My mother looks at me and says things like: “You do the turkey, Kitty, because you want to control everything.” Then I look at my mother and say: “I don’t think you should do anything at all this year, Mum, because you can’t cope.”I think we do all genuinely want to organise a happy Christmas, but we also want to win at therapy – which means gaining the tacit approval of our therapist. In the immediate aftermath of what happened with the potato, winning at therapy meant pretending to be saner than you were. In the early years, we sat quietly in our armchairs and made sensible suggestions about the chore rota. But more recently we’ve worked out that we can get more sympathy by hamming up our personal struggles, and talking about the fact that my mum and I are on antidepressants. So my sister talks about her anxiety and I talk about my rage, and it feels quite exciting to talk about ourselves in this way. Like we are really up against it. Sometimes we take it too far and our therapist interrupts us and says: “Remember, it is your mother who is not always mentally well”, and my mother smiles slyly. “Yes, I can’t cope because I’m not well.”View image in fullscreen… and in 2023. Photographs: Courtesy of Kitty DrakeThe strange thing is, when it’s not Christmas, we have a nice time together. I lived with my parents until I was 29, and not just because I couldn’t afford to leave. I liked living with them. For 11 months of the year, we don’t point score with each other. We speak on the phone a lot, and post funny things on the family WhatsApp group. I even appreciate the fact that we are sometimes bad-tempered and sad when we get together, because it feels honest. There’s no pressure to perform. But then December rolls around and we suddenly start trying to sand off each other’s hard edges all over again, and craft some impossibly smooth, picture-perfect family portrait.In the last couple of years, though, something has shifted. My mother used to be the one who organised our annual session of Christmas therapy, and panicked about potential tensions – but lately she seems less invested in the whole thing. My sister and I are in our early 30s now, and in the absence of any children of our own, we have become more controlling of the family we do have – while our parents seem increasingly relaxed. They both recently discovered Instagram, and last year they spent a lot of time playing on their phones. They didn’t always come to the table when we called them. My mum was in her room a lot, not wrapping presents but napping. She didn’t even seem that bothered by the arguments. When I shouted at her she didn’t shout back.We addressed some of this last week, in therapy. We are going to implement a new rule this Christmas: everyone has to turn off their phone and put it in a bowl in the kitchen. Our therapist also suggested closing our eyes and counting to 10 before we shout. But I could tell that my mother’s heart wasn’t really in it. She had tasted freedom, and now she just wanted to nap and play on her phone.For me, Christmas still feels like a litmus test for the state of my whole life. The degree of happiness and calm I feel on the day seems like an awful premonition of the amount of happiness and calm I can expect from the future. The more I try to bend my family to my will, the more disappointed I feel, and so the cycle continues – I can’t seem to let go. But my parents have let go. My mother has suggested that next year, my sister and I go to therapy on our own.Explore more on these topicsChristmasFamilyParents and parentingSiblingsHealth & wellbeingMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How to give virtual cash to gamersWeighing up a last-minute present but perplexed by in-game currencies? Here’s how to give gifts for Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite and moreShane HickeySat 20 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTShareWhile cash or a voucher to spend at a local shop used to be a welcome gift, nowadays many young gamers would rather receive virtual currencies under the tree.V-Bucks, Minecoins, Robux and FC Points are some of the most popular in-game currencies that players use to unlock different features within popular titles – from “skins” to personalise your player to new buildings to style your online world.ThisChristmasweek, retailers expect to see many shoppers pick up cards loaded with virtual currencies as last-minute gifts and stocking fillers for kids.Yet in-game currencies can be perplexing to the parents and relatives being asked for them.So if your child is asking Santa for Robux, or a gift card loaded with FC Points, here is what you need to know.The basicsIn order to keep players engaged, developers introduce new items, features or power-ups that personalise a player’s game, and they can be bought using the in-game currency.Gems, tokens, points … the currencies have different names but most work in a similar way. They are typically available to earn within the game but can also be bought.It will usually take a significant period of time to build up the amount that you can buy instantly with a few clicks. With most games, you don’t get a competitive advantage by spending more – instead, money is usually spent on what your avatar looks like.Andy Robertson, the founder of Family Gaming Database, a site that aims to help parents understand gaming, says: “Like the desire for the latest trainers when I was at school, having new outfits or appearances for your character in online games is a popular driver of purchases.”As with real-world currencies, how much you get for £1 varies depending on the game and sometimes on how you buy it.While you can buy 1,000 V-Bucks for £6.99 for Fortnite, for roughly the same price, you get 1,720 Minecoins forMinecraft. And a fiver will buy you 500 Robux for Roblox.View image in fullscreenA fiver will buy you 500 Robux for Roblox.Photograph: RobloxCurrency values can fluctuate, so an add-on or an item in a game may increase in cost or the currency may become more expensive over time, says George Osborn, a consultant in the gaming industry.Buying currencyThere are two main ways to buy currency: on the device you are playing the game on or via gift cards sold in high street shops.These cards, virtual and physical, are sold by the sterling amount – for example, £10 or £20 – or by the amount of in-game currency they give you.It is worth shopping around, as prices can vary a lot. For example, when we looked, a digital gift card of 1,720 Minecoins cost £8.49 at Argos but £5.99 at the online gaming store Loaded.If you are playing the game on a console, you will be able to buy currency through the “storefront” or the digital market on the machine – for example, the Nintendo eShop or the PlayStation Store. Often you can buy through the game itself. Payment will be taken via the method (such as debit or credit card) that is connected to the account.Some games platforms, as well as consoles, have settings that can be changed to ensure that children cannot do this without the cardholder’s permission. The not-for-profitInternet Matterssite has a directory of how to limit controls on whatever way your child games.Buying the currency on a gift card is an easy way to limit how much your child can spend. An Argos spokesperson says interest in the gift cards peaks during the week of Christmas.ProblemsThere has been concern that the differing values of each currency can create confusion about the real-world value for children, and for parents. Vicki Shotbolt, the founder of the parenting group Parent Zone, says: “It’s impossible for parents to quickly understand how much something costs when the price is presented in a virtual currency.”Campaigners say that the value of the unregulated in-game currencies can change at any time, so one item may increase in cost, or you may get fewer coins for your pound.Shotbolt says distancing real money from payments in a game is a way to make it easier for people to spend more. “Using virtual currencies is a classic way to obfuscate value, and it’s done deliberately to encourage spending that feels like gameplay,” she says.The currencies are particular to the game that a child is playing and can’t be transferred between titlesAdam Jerrett, a lecturer in games design at the University of Portsmouth, says the bundles that currencies are sold in mean that kids can often struggle to understand the real cost of them when they are bought.He adds that the amount of currency you buy often does not align neatly with the price of items available for purchase, so players can end up with “stranded currency”.The currencies are particular to the game that a child is playing and can’t be transferred between titles. And they can’t be transferred from one player to another.However, Robertson says buying the currencies can be an opportunity to learn financial literacy. “My kids have sometimes been desperate to buy something in a game that I don’t think is good value,” he says. “Letting them spend some pocket money in this way enables them to learn about value, particularly if spending here means they can’t buy other things they want this week.”Game options and exchange ratesFortniteView image in fullscreenFortnite is developed by Epic Games.Photograph: Epic GamesFortnite is free to play but players buy “skins” and various other items to personalise the game. The currency used is called V-Bucks.Exchange rateBuying them through the store of the developer EpicGameswill get you 1,000 V-Bucks for £6.99 (which is 143 V-Bucks for £1). Economies of scale kick in with the more you buy, so £17.49 will get you 2,800, £27.99 will get you 5,000, and £69.99 will buy 13,500 (193 for £1). Fortnite gift cards in sterling denominations (£10, £20, etc) can be bought online and in shops.What you can buyV-Bucks can buy you “skins” to personalise your in-game persona, “emotes” (a dance move your character makes) and other cosmetic items. A new skin for your character comes in at between 800 and 2,000 V-Bucks.MinecraftView image in fullscreenMinecraft’s in-game currency is the Minecoin.Photograph: Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/Rex/ShutterstockMinecraft allows players to explore and build in its apparently infinite terrains. Its in-game currency is the Minecoin.Exchange rateMinecoins can be bought for £7.99 for 1,720 units (215 Minecoins for £1) via the PlayStation store. Gift card prices vary – for the same amount of coins, Asda is charging £8.39 (205 for £1). Coins can be sold in greater numbers: 3,500 are priced at £16.74 at the toy retailer Smyths (209 for £1), while Amazon has 8,800 for £41.74 (211 for £1).What you can buyIt costs 310 coins to give your character blue jeans and 490 to buy 12 goth skins, giving your character a “unique style”. For 490 coins, you can buy a “Cherry Bonsai Treehouse” to defend yourself from enemies on the ground.RobloxView image in fullscreenMost of the Roblox games are free.Photograph: Ramil Sitdikov/ReutersRoblox is a constantly changing world of online games, mostly free and often made by users and amateur developers. While most of the games are free, users can buy extras within games using Robux.Exchange rateBuying Robux from the Roblox online store will get you 500 for £4.99 (100 Robux for £1). You can spend up to £199.99, which will get you 24,000 (120 for £1). Gift cards are available in rounded amounts such as £10 and £20.What you can buyBlack messy hair with a Santa hat will cost 60 Robux, while a “Sword of the Lands”, which promises to do significant damage when used, costs 1,000 Robux.FC 26View image in fullscreenFC 26 is a football simulation video game.Photograph: Electronic ArtsThe latest title in the hugely popular football series uses FC Points as its in-game currency.Exchange ratePrices start at 99p for 100 points. You can pay £8.99 for 1,050 (117 for £1); £21.99 for 2,800, right up to £129.99 for 18,500 (142 for £1) on the PlayStation store.What you can buyThe points can be used to buy packs, which are virtual bundles of players for your team, and other add-ons. A premium gold pack, which gives a mixture of players and other features, costs 150 FC Points.All prices and details correct at time of writingExplore more on these topicsChristmasConsumer affairsFortniteGamesMinecraftRobloxChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A cold front had brought abundant snow and inhaling was rather painful at -8C, but nothing could still the tremble of excitement.Along with my husband and two young daughters, I was here to take theSanta Claus Expressto the northern city of Rovaniemi, the heart of Finnish Lapland – and the “official” home of Father Christmas. A regular commuter train for the rest of the year, come late November the Santa Claus Express is Finnish Railways’ flagship service, offering the ultimate sleeper-train adventure. As I checked my watch and announced it was finally time to make our way to Helsinki central station, the girls were pink in the cheeks, eyes sparkling from all the surrounding golden lights.View image in fullscreenInaugurated in 1919, the edifice of the majestic art nouveau station swept over us as our footsteps echoed beneath its arches, the ceiling hung with neoclassical chandeliers.Our train was almost 20 minutes late and the anticipation was palpable as passengers shifted from one fur-trimmed boot to the other, a mass of parkas and puffer jackets milling around. Bobble-hatted children glanced hopefully at every train entering the station, their breath twisting up on the air. This is a bucket-list trip filled with snowscapes, perky elves, reindeer rides, husky sledding and northern lights, but I was quietly terrified that something might go wrong: a cancellation perhaps or a lengthy weather delay.View image in fullscreenHelsinki central railway station.Photograph: Ryhor Bruyeu/AlamyThen, at 7.45pm precisely, the Santa Claus Express appeared, red tail lamps blazing as it reversed in through the darkness, and my fears were allayed.As a child, this train would have fulfilled my every dream. But who was I kidding? As an adult it still did. The green and white doubledecker, with Santa’s jolly face painted on the side, came to a standstill, the doors hissed open and we tumbled on board, clambering upstairs to our compartment. On one side were bunks and on the other an en suite toilet that converted to a shower area. With hot water, underfloor heating and a window seat to watch nature’s slideshow playing outside, it was perfect.Up to the age of 10, children travel for free as long as they share a berth with another passenger, and the berths were wide enough for my husband and me to top and tail with the girls. I’ve travelled on more than 100 sleeper trains over the last 15 years, and this was the finest I’d yet found.It was a moment I’d been dreading – how to explain they were wolfing down the protagonist of their favourite Christmas song?To hoots of delight and feet thumping along the corridors, we stashed bags and headed for the restaurant car, where a large family was already crammed into one booth, watchingthe movie Elf dubbed into Portuguese. Tinsel was wound up the brass bars, mistletoe peeked out from the backs of banquettes and the windows were sprayed with snow, the glass already steamed up. The aroma of home-cooking filled the car and a waitress soon arrived with a bowl of reindeer stew and two dishes of meatballs and mash (80,000 portions of which are sold every year according to the railways’ website).View image in fullscreenThe writer and her family on the Santa Claus Express“What meat is this?” my elder daughter asked, dangling a piece of smoked reindeer into her mouth like a Roman ruler. It was a moment I’d been dreading. How could I tell her they were wolfing down the protagonist of their favourite Christmas song?“Well,” I said, “in Finland they eat lots of different things depending on what they can grow and farm, and this is … reindeer.”She shrugged and finished the bowl just as I noticed the train was on the move, the twinkle of the city already giving way to woods, branches sagging under the weight of snow.Aware that other families were waiting to dine, we grudgingly gave up our booth and squeezed through what was starting to feel like a pub on New Year’s Eve, beer spilling on to tables amid the warmth and cheer of strangers exchanging stories and jokes.Back in our compartment, the girls were soon tucked in. The train was strikingly smooth, barely a hum detectable over the sounds of parents yelling at their kids through the air vents. As the girls slept soundly, and my husband read, I sat at the window searching the darkness. Black lakes flashed under street lamps, sheets of ice dusty between skinny branches. From the little pull-down seat I could see how fragmented Finland’s landscape was: a mass of islands, lakes and forests locked together.View image in fullscreenCabins with igloo roofs at the Apukka resort beneath the northern lightsIt was a worthwhile venture scouring the scene, watching walkers with their dogs, locking eyes with late-night smokers on their balconies, and spotting wreaths hanging on doorways. A single fox darted across a car park and I wondered what it might feel like to travel into the polar darkness. Tomorrow there would be no sunrise, so I left the blind up and climbed into bed.The train drew into Rovaniemi just after 7am and we were soon at theApukka resort, a collection of igloo-style cabins built around a lake. While husky rides and petting reindeer were high on the list,Santa Claus Village, which is on the Arctic Circle line, was our first port of call and we were soon in a queue curling up and around a staircase towards the magical wooden grotto.I’d dreamed about this since becoming a parent. Bringing my children to meet the big manI’d dreamed about this moment since becoming a parent. Bringing my children to meet the big man, watching their mouths fall open with joy. In reality, the girls had spent the last half hour grumbling about being bored and pinching each other, and I was now gripping their wrists and mouthing threats through gritted teeth. My elder daughter was also unconvinced about Santa’s identity. “It was Sophie’s dad, Steve,” she had said after the previous year’s school winter fair. How could they not see how special this moment was? On the verge of tears, I pulled the girls apart and eventually we made it to the front of the queue.View image in fullscreenThe writer’s daughters meet a man with an unfeasibly large beard in the Santa Claus VillageInside, two elves were setting up their camera and I looked across to where Santa was sitting in a chair, knee-length beard and giant felt boots in place. He smiled over pince-nez and beckoned the girls, who had fallen silent. Exchanging looks, they shyly sat down. This was a Santa who was authentic enough to make me a believer again. He asked if he could visit in a few days, and they nodded, accepting two gift bags and waving. Outside, they pulled out two plush reindeer toys and beamed. “He was definitely the real Santa,” said my elder daughter, and I breathed a sigh of relief. “His beard was real.”Making our way back outside, I barely noticed the chill. Flushed with warmth I looked down at the smiling faces and gave silent thanks for what had finally turned out to be our family Christmas miracle.A two-person cabin on the Santa Claus Express from Helsinki to Rovaniemi starts from €239one way onVR railways(travel time 11¾ hours)Monisha Rajesh is the author of Moonlight Express: Around the World by Night Train, published by Bloomsbury (£22).

According to the dogThe dog used to be dependent on us for everything. But since graduating from dog school the tables have started to turnTim DowlingSat 20 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 20 Dec 2025 10.56 ESTShareIt’s a cold winter night, and my wife and I are alone in the house, binge-watching some new series. I was transfixed by episode one, and gripped by episode two, but midway through episode three I have started to look at my phone, and as a consequence I’ve lost track of the plot. I have an idea what’s going on, but it’s not the right idea.“So hang on,” my wife says. “Was that just the dead guy? Meaning he’s not dead?”“Um, sure, yeah,” I say.“You’re not even watching,” she says.“He’s the dead guy,” I say, “now back alive for some reason.”“On your phone, as usual,” she says, “looking yourself up.”“I’m not looking myself up,” I say. “I’m actually responding to an urgent text from last week.”The dog walks into the room, sits down in front of my wife and stares up at her with a baleful, pleading expression.“But you’re missing all the important bits,” my wife says.“I don’t care what happens any more,” I say. “I just need to know how it ends.”The dog reaches out and places a paw on my wife’s knee. My wife looks down to find the dog’s eyes locked on hers.“What do you want?” she says. The dog stares.“Do you need to go out?” my wife says.“I let her out, like, 15 minutes ago,” I say. The dog lifts its paw from my wife’s knee and, a few seconds later, replaces it, this time more insistently.“I don’t know what you want,” my wife says. “You’ve been out, you’ve been fed.”“I think she’s trying to tell you it’s bedtime,” I say. My wife looks down at the dog.“So go to bed,” she says.“No,” I say. “She’s telling you it’s your bedtime.” The dog stares.“It’s not my bedtime,” my wife says, pointing at the telly. “I’m watching this.” The dog yawns theatrically. The paw remains in place.I consider the newly intense bond between the dog and my wife, and whether I feel left out of the equation“I think you’ve already lost this one,” I say.“No I haven’t,” my wife says, removing the dog’s paw from her knee. “A dog doesn’t get to tell me when to go to bed.”“This is what comes of going to dog school,” I say. The week before the dog received a certificate marking the satisfactory completion of Being a Good Dog 101, but as a result of the training she has developed a deep fixation with my wife’s every move.“This has nothing to do with anything we learned in dog school,” my wife says, prodding the dog with her toe. “If you’re tired, you can go to bed without me.”“I don’t think that is going to happen,” I say, as the dog moves its paw to my wife’s other knee.“You take her to bed, then,” my wife says.“It’s not my bedtime,” I say.“It’s not my bedtime!” she says.“Anyway, I’ve got to watch the rest of this,” I say.“There are three more episodes!” my wife says. “You can’t watch it without me!”The dog turns to look at me.“She gets like this when she’s tired,” I say.“I’m not going to bed!” my wife says, standing up. She leaves the room, and the dog follows. A minute later, my wife leans back in through the door.“I’m going to bed,” she says.I try to watch the rest of the episode alone, but I can’t follow it. When it finishes I’m as bewildered as if I had never watched any of it.As I’m turning off the downstairs lights I consider the newly intense bond between the dog and my wife, and whether I feel left out of the equation. On the one hand, I sometimes struggle to get the dog to obey my commands. On the other hand, I am not subject to constant scrutiny, or any kind of curfew. I go to bed when I want. I decide that, on balance, I’m glad I never set foot in dog school.I go upstairs, where my wife is asleep under the glow of her bedside lamp, book in hand. On my side of the bed, the dog is lying stretched out under the duvet, with its head on my pillow.“What are you doing?” I whisper. “You can’t be there.” The dog opens its eyes, staring straight ahead.“Look at me,” I say. The dog looks past me for another moment, before closing its eyes again.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I ended up with drenched hair and no sunglasses or bikini topSikisaSat 20 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareChristmas in Barbados is different. Forget snow and scarves – we doChristmasin flip-flops, sweating through church services and pretending to feel festive because there’s tinsel on a palm tree. Everyone’s singing Mary’s Boy Child as if they’re auditioning for Caribbean Idol, and someone’s auntie is halfway through a bottle of Mount Gay before 11am.But my weirdest Christmas was when I was about 19 – that magical age when you’re convinced you’re grown, but you still have braces. My mum had taken me “back home” to spend the holidays with family. I was excited because 1) I needed a break from university, 2) I could finally escape the British winter, and 3) I was ready to find a husband.Enter Dwayne, my grandad’s neighbour’s grandson. He had the kind of Bajan confidence that comes from growing up near a beach and being told since birth that you’re handsome. He wore his flip-flops as if they were designer shoes. He was 24, shirtless, and could open a coconut with a machete.We were all at the Christmas beach picnic, the air smelling like ham, pepperpot and sea salt. My auntie was blasting Soca Santa from her car speakers. My plan was simple: swim, eat, and act like I wasn’t bothered that Dwayne’s abs had their own postcode.I saw he was cooking flying fish on the barbecue and figured it was the perfect time to flirt. I offered to “help” – and, within seconds, managed to drop an entire tray of raw fish into the sand. Dwayne tried to save them but people were still like: “Who put the beach in the food?”I knew I needed a new tactic to impress him, and so I decided to play it cool – the casual kind of cool you see in music videos. I strutted into the sea like Rihanna in slow motion … or so I thought. The water was crystal clear, glittering under the sun, and I was convinced this was my time to shine – a proper island-girl goddess moment. I even threw a little glance over my shoulder at Dwayne, just to make sure he was watching. He was. Unfortunately, so was everyone else.Here’s the thing: theBarbadossea doesn’t care about your confidence. It’s not the peaceful, flirty waves you see on postcards – it’s full of power.The first wave hit my knees. Fine. I smiled. The second hit my hips – dramatic but manageable. The third, though? The third was a full-on attack. It came out of nowhere, slapped me across the chest, and sent me somersaulting like a Christmas turkey in a washing machine. That wave was disrespectful.When I finally resurfaced, my sunglasses were gone, my hair was drenched, and my bikini top had clocked out for the day. I emerged from the water gasping, hair in my mouth, one boob out. I looked less like a sexy beach goddess and more like a drowned rat.And just when I thought maybe,maybe, no one had noticed, Dwayne started to clap. Slowly. Like I’d just performed an interpretive dance titled Girl v Nature: The Struggle.My mum shouted from under the beach umbrella, “You good, baby?” – which is Caribbean for: “You’ve embarrassed the whole family, but we still love you.” I gave a thumbs-up, tried to laugh it off, and pretended the seawater running down my face was tears of festive joy.For the rest of the day, Dwayne kept calling me “Baywatch” – I might have been flattered if he hadn’t laughed a little every time he said it. I learned one big lesson that Christmas: flirting is a little like swimming in the sea – best attempted when you’re prepared, sober and fully strapped in.Explore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasBarbadosBarbados holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both vessels were headed to Asia.The British maritime risk management company Vanguard told Reuters that the vessel was believed to be the Panama-flagged Centuries and was intercepted east of Barbados in the Caribbean Sea.The vessel does not appear to be on the list of US-sanctioned vessels, according to multiple reports, which would represent an escalation in American enforcement of its blockade.In a post onXSaturday afternoon, the US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the US Coast Guard and the defense department had stopped the tanker early Saturday morning in “pre-dawn action”.“The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco-terrorism in the region,” Noem said. “We will find you, and we will stop you.”The administration hassuggestedthat any vessel carrying Venezuelan oil could be subject to the US blockade and has been working to expand its list of sanctioned vessels.The first oil tanker that the US seized earlier in the month was on the sanctions list and was what the White Housecalleda “sanctioned shadow vessel known for carrying black-market sanctioned oil”.The development comes as Trump and his advisers haverefused to rule outthe potential for open conflict withVenezuelaas its country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, has urged his navy to escort oil tankers, defying the largest US fleet deployed in the region in decades.After the first oil tanker was seized, the Venezuelan government said in a statement that the US had committed “blatant theft” and described the action as “an act of international piracy”.In an interview broadcast on Friday morning,Trumptold NBC News that going to war with Maduro’s regime remains on the table. “I don’t rule it out, no,” he said in a phone interview with the network.The US further ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela this week, accusing the country of taking US oil and saying the US lost out on investments in the country. “You remember they took all of our energy rights,” Trump said. “They took all of our oil not that long ago. And we want it back. They took it – they illegally took it.” On Tuesday,the US president ordereda “total and complete” blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.View image in fullscreenThe Centuries crude oil tanker, last docked in Venezuela, as it is apprehended by the US Coast Guard.Photograph: US secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem’s X account/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Thursday, theUS militarycarried out its latest lethal strike on a vessel it said was engaged in drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific, killing four people, and bringing the death toll to 99 in its campaign of striking alleged drug-trafficking boats since September.Maduro claims the US seeks regime change instead of its stated goal of stopping drug trafficking.The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum,waded into the dispute on Wednesday, declaring that the United Nations was “nowhere to be seen” and asked that it step up to “prevent any bloodshed”.Jeremy Paner, former US sanctions investigator, told Reuters the seizure of the vessel Saturday “marks a further increase in Trump’s pressure on Venezuela”.“It also runs counter to Trump’s statement that the US would impose a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers,” he said.Since the first seizure, Venezuelan crude exports have fallen sharply. While many vessels picking up oil in Venezuela are under sanctions, others transporting the country’s oil and crude from Iran and Russia have not been sanctioned, and some companies, particularly Chevron in the US, transport Venezuelan oil in their own authorized ships.China is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, which accounts for roughly 4% of its imports, with shipments in December on track to average more than 600,000 barrels per day, analysts have said.For now, the oil market is well-supplied and there are millions of barrels of oil on tankers off the coast of China waiting to offload. If the embargo stays in place for some time, then the loss of nearly a million barrels a day of crude supply is likely to push oil prices higher.Since the US imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela in 2019, traders and refiners buying Venezuelan oil have resorted to a “shadow fleet” of tankers that disguise their location and to vessels sanctioned for transporting Iranian or Russian oil.The dark or shadow fleet is considered exposed to possible punitive measures from the US, shipping analysts have said. Centuries, which loaded in Venezuela under the false name “Crag” and is part of the dark fleet, was carrying some 1.8m barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude oil bound for China, according to internal documents from state oil company PDVSA, the oil’s seller.The vessel departed Venezuelan waters on Wednesday after being briefly escorted by the Venezuelan navy, according to company sources and satellite images obtained by TankerTrackers.com.The crude was bought by Satau Tijana Oil Trading, one of many intermediaries involved in PDVSA’s sales to Chinese independent refiners, the documents showed.As of this week, of more than 70 oil tankers in Venezuelan waters that are part of the shadow fleet, around 38 are under sanctions by the US treasury, according to data from TankerTrackers.com. Of those, at least 15 are loaded with crude and fuel, it added.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryVenezuelaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the ACT, for example, the register is still paper-based. Queensland licensing also remains largely on paper, although a digital transition is in the works.4:12Bondi beach terror attack: how Australia's gun laws have eroded – videoAfter the attack in Bondi, Albanese said that work would be “accelerating”.Speaking on the ABC on Tuesday, the prime minister outlinedthe challenges. “Some state governments still have paper processes for the registration of firearms, so it’s impossible to check if you don’t have a digitised system,” he said.“More than $100m has been provided to states and territories, which is where guns are registered, to enable them to digitise their system.”The Victorian police minister, Anthony Carbines, said the government would do “everything we can to meet earlier timelines”.“Different states and territories have different arrangements and also have different levels of capacity,” he said. “But the goal here is to have a coordinated, harmonised register.”After a national cabinet meeting on Monday, the government detailed a range of potential changes to gun laws. Options included limiting the number of firearms that individuals can own and issuing licences only to citizens. On Friday, the prime minister announced a national gun buyback scheme – the largest since the one initiated by the Howard government in 1996.Q&AHow did Australia change its gun laws after the Port Arthur massacre?ShowAfter the 1996 mass shooting in Port Arthur that killed 35 people, the Australian government enacted thenational firearms agreement.The deal between the federal and state governments aimed to make gun laws broadly uniform across states and territories. It introduced mandatory licensing, rules for secure storage and use, and restrictions on semiautomatic rifles and pump action shotguns.There was a buyback scheme for guns that were now classed as illegal. Australians could voluntarily give up weapons in exchange for financial compensation – leading to the surrender of more than 600,000 firearms.Owners would also need a “genuine reason” for having guns, such as hunting or sports shooting, and personal protection was not a valid reason. The agreement specifically states that firearm possession is a privilege, not a right.This sets Australia apart from other countries, most notably the United States, where a right to bear arms is included in its constitution. US Congress and state legislatures have passed some gun control measures, including mandated background checks but, unlike Australia, most states have not banned assault weapons.Gun ownership in the UK is also considered a privilege, not a right, and new laws have similarly responded to mass shootings, including the 1987 Hungerford massacre. Certain semiautomatic rifles were banned and police must consider reasons for ownership before issuing a licence.The effectiveness of Australia’s gun control measures remain a matter of debate, and some elements are yet to be fully enacted almost 30 years later, including the nationwide firearms register.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Appeal rights removedOne federal law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the current licensing laws made it difficult to rely on Asio intelligence as the basis for refusing a person’s application for a firearm.That was partly because there are not adequate protections to keep such intelligence safe from disclosure, should the applicant turn to state tribunals to challenge a decision to deny them a gun.On Wednesday, the NSW premier, Chris Minns, proposed that the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (Ncat) would be removed as an appeal mechanism as part of gun reforms in that state.“New South Wales police routinely yank licences from gun holders and licence holders they suspect or fear are a threat to the community, those appeals are heard in Ncat, and often police’s objections are overturned,” he said. “We’ll extinguish that appeal pathway.”View image in fullscreenChris Minns (right) lays flowers at a memorial at Bondi Pavilion.Photograph: George Chan/Getty Images“There needs to be changes to legislation to allow for licensing decisions to be made on non-disclosable information,” the source said. “This incident should be a catalyst for that to occur.”On Tuesday, police disclosed that Sajid Akram was granted a licence in 2023 – after Asio became aware of his son – raising questions about whether there was a failure of information sharing between intelligence services and NSW police.It is “essential” for police to use criminal intelligence, not just a criminal record, in determining gun licences, Minns said earlier this week.Calls for NSW government to remove recreational hunting as a reason to own firearms after Bondi massacreRead more“That is the kind of legislation we want to see in New South Wales,” he said.Minns announced on Friday that his government would introduce a bill “to impose a cap of four firearms per individual with strict exemptions for primary producers and sporting shooters”.NSW will have “toughest gun laws in the country”, he said.Explore more on these topicsGun controlBondi beach terror attackAustralian politicsNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Fire and Rescue warned disruption was likely to last a number of days and advised travellers to delay any plans to move through the area.‘Jet-like flames’: exploding lithium-ion batteries pose an increasingly lethal danger, inquiry toldRead moreFirefighters were likely to let the fire burn out, Jay said, as there was insufficient water to extinguish the blaze. He also said it would be difficult to capture any contaminated runoff that flowed into nearby waterways.No confirmed injuries were reported. NSW Police said the fire was not being treated as suspicious.Exploding batteries have been linked to three fatal incidents and countless fires in NSW. Lithium ion batteries are used in e-bikes, e-scooters and a range of electric household appliances.Overheating and physical damage areamong the main causes of battery failure.Since 2024, Fire and Rescue NSW has referred to lithium ion batteries as the “fastest-growing fire risk” in the state, and the government has taken increasing action to regulate theirhandling and disposal.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

If we’re not going to have a royal commission into this, when would you use the powers of that extraordinary provision in our act?”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAnthony Albanese, who met with members of the national security committee on Saturday, said he would “support whatever action the NSW government takes”.“We are working in lockstep,” he told reporters.Minns did not provide details about the timing of a potential royal commission. Minns said he was confident the government could appoint a senior judicial officer to navigate the complexities of an inquiry running parallel to the criminal investigation.“As soon as we can get a comprehensive understanding, an independent investigation into what happened, we can begin the process of bringing in change to ensure that we do everything possible so that it doesn’t happen again,” he said.A swim for unity at Bondi beach, the scene of Sydney’s darkest day. But on land tensions frayRead moreThe opposition had called on Albanese to launch a commonwealth royal commission, with leader Sussan Ley calling on Albanese to recall parliament on Monday to immediately legislate a response.“Millions of Australians, particularly those of Jewish faith, want, need and deserve a commonwealth royal commission into the Bondi massacre terrorist attack,” Ley said.She invited Albanese to “sit down with me and Jewish community leaders as soon as Shabbat ends tonight, so that we can draft the terms of reference on a bipartisan basis”.Former Liberal treasurer Josh Frydenberg this week called for a royal commission into antisemitism and the Bondi attack. But treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said he did not want to be “delayed or deterred” by a royal commission as they investigated the attack.Albanese said he would attend a memorial service at Bondi beach on Sunday, which he has labelled a national day of reflection to honour the 15 victims a week on from the attack.Flags will be flown at half mast, and Albanese has asked Australians to light a candle and put it in their front window and to observe a minute’s silence at 6.47pm.Albanese on Saturday also commendedUS airstrikes on Islamic State targetsin Syria, saying Sunday’s attack was inspired by the “evil ideology”.New hate speech laws cracking down on ‘dehumanising’ rhetoric will go to constitutional limit, Tony Burke saysRead moreThe Australian federal police (AFP) commissioner, Krissy Barrett, told reporters the surviving accused Bondi beach shooter, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, remained in custody in a NSW hospital on Saturday afternoon. He has been charged with 59 offences.Barrett said police would leave “no stone unturned”.She said the federal government’s announcement this week to lower the threshold for hate speech would give the AFP “greater scope to deter and charge individuals who are injecting and directing poisonous language towards the Jewish community”.The NSW Labor government on Saturday announced it would outlaw the display of terrorist symbols, such as Islamic State and Hamas flags, and clamp down on hate speech, including banning the pro-Palestine phrase “globalise the intifada”.Josh Lees, a spokesperson for the Palestine Action Group, said on Friday he did not recall the group ever chanting “globalise the intifada”, but thatlabelling the phrase as hate speech was “ignorant”.The proposed crackdown on hate speech and hate symbols will be considered when NSW parliament sits on Monday.It comes as NSW Health confirmed a patient at Royal North Shore Hospital, injured in the attack, had been discharged on Saturday afternoon. There are 14 others who remain in hospital.NSW state parliament will also consider tougher gun and protest laws.In Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, andGrieflineon 1300 845 745.

The figures from the Cabinet Office also show a cut of £1.15m in “non-ODA” funding for the region.The financial year of 2025-26 is the first in a gradual transition announced by the government towards reducing ODA from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income by 2027.Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee and a former shadow foreign secretary in Starmer’s team before the general election, said: “I visited the western Balkans earlier this month. It is quite clear they are on the frontline of the fight against Russian disinformation and interference, and I am very proud of the work the UK is doing to support them in that fight - for their security and all of Europe’s. More work is needed to support independent media, not less. People are hungry to learn the truth and it’s very difficult to find it.”Dr Kate Ferguson, the co-executive director and head of policy and research at Protection Approaches, an NGO that works in the western Balkans on preventing identity-based violence, said the UK had a good record in the region and it should not be undermined now.“The national security strategy rightly recognises that we are in a period of intensifying strategic competition for the rules and governance of our world; in Europe we see this as Russia diversifies its efforts to undermine our democratic consensus,” she said.“It is essential then that our Foreign Office is properly and appropriately resourced to meet these growing threats to democracy and our collective safety.“In recent years, the UK has distinguished itself in the western Balkans as a trusted and principled leader when others have sometimes faltered. Now, as new forms of Russian aggression and malign influence deepen in the region, this leadership must be bolstered – and not watered down.’This week, the new head of MI6, Blaise Metreweli, said Britain was caught in “a space between peace and war” and described Russia as “aggressive, expansionist and revisionist, seeking to subjugate Ukraine and harass Nato”.Shelagh Daley, the policy team lead at Saferworld, an NGO that runs programmes in the western Balkans, said the cuts appeared to be part of a move by the UK government to deprioritise conflict prevention.“This reflects what we are seeing as a wider trend in ISF and other UK foreign aid spending amid the cuts. It appears to be a deprioritisation of work on conflict prevention and peacebuilding, even as conflict has increased globally, societies have become more divided, and basic freedoms are being curtailed.“It doesn’t seem coherent or strategic to be pulling away from programming that aims to address the causes of conflict and fragility at a time when the risks to global security are so high.”A government spokesperson said: “The figures in the report represent only one part of the UK’s total investment in the western Balkans on issues such as organised crime and hostile state activity.”“The ISF is designed to adapt to the very latest national security priorities and often funds short-term projects, meaning it is natural for spending decisions to evolve over time.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyAidAlbaniaBosnia and HerzegovinaKosovoSerbiaNorth MacedonianewsShareReuse this content"

Tourists buy mulled wine and churros at the Christmas market outside the Bourse, the old stock exchange, now repurposed as a beer museum. A few people drink coffee on cafe terraces. Up and down the length of the 650-metre-long space, people come and go, bikes and scooters weaving in and out of the crowds.Next year, this scene will look somewhat different: bikes and scooters will be banned from this 18,000-sq-metre pedestrian zone for most of the day. People on two wheels will be allowed to ride only between 4am and 11am. At all other times, they must dismount and push their vehicle up the street, or face a fine.Anaïs Maes, the city counsellor in charge of urban planning and mobility, suggested not all cyclists obeyed the existing 6km speed limit. “In everyday reality, people do not respect that rule or don’t know it, and so it creates conflicts.”Maes, a member of the Dutch-speaking socialist Vooruit party, is aware of “small accidents” and complaints from pedestrians. “I’ve heard multiple persons say, especially older persons or persons with little kids, or persons with reduced mobility, [that] they don’t feel safe, because they live in fear of not being able to step aside quickly enough or being hit.”Brussels officials have not decided exactly when the change will enter into force, as negotiations within the council over implementation are ongoing.In a sense, the Brussels Piétonnier is a victim of its own success. Extended a decade ago to make the city greener, calmer and cleaner, it transformed a swathe of the centre from a traffic-clogged, four-lane road into a place for walkers, strollers and cyclists, revitalising cafe terraces and open-air gatherings. It was a transformative shift for a city that had longsuffered from its mid-20th-century love affair with the car.For instance, the Grand-Place, the magnificent central square, with intricate, gold-leaf-adorned guildhalls and gothic city hall, was effectively a car park until 1972 and traffic was not banned entirely from the square and its cobbled environs until 1991.View image in fullscreenDanielle Peeters: ‘I think it is a little radical.’Photograph: Jennifer Rankin/The GuardianThe decision to extend the pedestrian zone in 2015, by banning cars from a large shopping area around Place de La Bourse was controversial initially. Maes, who was not on the council at the time, said idealistic planners believed that pedestrians and cyclists could share the space. “The city of Brussels had this idea: we were creating a space that’s multimodal and everyone will find their place; I think it is sad but in reality it doesn’t always work and then you have to find solutions.”Danielle Peeters, a cyclist, who works at a Dutch-language association, thinks the ban is a shame. “I think it is a little radical,” she says, having just parked her bike outside a ramen bar. “When there are a lot of people, obviously I slow down, but there are some people who cycle very, very quickly.”“Alex”, a 43-year old mountain climbing guide from Ukraine, who works as a takeaway courier and gave a pseudonym, says it will cause him difficulties because he will not be able to pick up deliveries, although referencing war in Ukraine, he said there were bigger problems. “For me it’s not a big issue, but they could have done a better job painting pathways for bikes.”That is the point for local cycling safety groups. The conflict between cyclists and pedestrians, some say, was a story foretold in the decision not to create a dedicated bike lane.Anopen letterby a dozen cyclist and road-safety groups published in December denounced the ban as “dangerous and absurd”, arguing that the city’s proposed alternative route for cyclists – three streets running parallel to the pedestrian zone – was not safe.On this alternative route, bikes share the busy roads with cars, buses and coaches; cycle groups say there are many blind spots and drivers, who flout the ban on overtaking cyclists.View image in fullscreenCycle groups are worried about safety issues on the proposed alternative route.Photograph: Jennifer Rankin/The GuardianBernards Heymans, the president of Heroes for Zero, a grassroots road safety movement, said the proposed alternative route was “not comfortable” and even dangerous, especially for child cyclists.“If cyclists are banned on the Piétonnier, then we would really like a real second way to access the city centre for cyclists,” he said. “If we find a second way that is totally secure, of course, everybody will go through the second way.”Maes does not think a separate bike lane in the pedestrian zone is the answer. “It doesn’t increase safety, because when every mode has its own designated space [cyclists] go faster,” which can also create conflicts with pedestrians crossing that lane, she said.She was working hard, she said, to create a safe alternative route: “We are trying to solve a mobility-safety issue, but what I do not want to do is to create a bigger problem.”Explore more on these topicsBelgiumEuropeCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

The attack brings the number of Palestinians killed byIsraelto 401 since the October ceasefire took effect.Israeli troops fired over the ceasefire line which they have withdrawn to, killing the Palestinians and wounding a number more, the Palestinian civil defence said in a statement. It added that it was only able to recover the bodies after coordinating with the UN, to ensure they did not also come under Israeli fire.Dozens gathered atGazaCity hospital to mourn those killed, with five body bags placed outside the hospital and a man cradling an infant wrapped in a white shroud.“This is not a truce, it is a bloodbath,” said Nafiz al-Nader, who witnessed the attack, telling Agence France-Presse he wanted the bloodshed to stop. Another witness said shelling erupted without warning on Friday night, hitting the school.The ceasefire line refers to where Israeli troops have pulled back to under the terms of the October ceasefire deal, denoted by a long yellow line on maps and physically demarcated by yellow concrete markers on the ground. Israeli troops remain in control of about 53% of the territory and regularly conduct airstrikes in the areas it does not occupy.Gaza no longer in famine but hunger levels remain critical, UN saysRead moreFriday’s killings are the latest in a series of challenges to the ceasefire, now in its third month, which mediators are trying to push towards a second phase. The first phase of the ceasefire called for an end to hostilities between Hamas and Israel, the withdrawal of Israeli troops to the yellow line, and the increase of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which had slipped into famine earlier this yeardue to Israeli aid restrictions.The second phase of the ceasefire is meant to lead to a permanent peace in Gaza, but mediators must first settle differences between Hamas and Israel on thornier issues. Israel stipulates that Hamas give up its arms and surrender power to a civilian transitional authority, while an international stabilisation force is deployed in Gaza, and Israel is meant to fully withdraw from Gaza.View image in fullscreenRelatives of the Palestinians who died mourn as bodies are brought to the al-Shifa hospital for burial in Gaza City on 20 December.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyThere is no clear agreement between the parties on how to bridge the gaps between Hamas and Israel on those points. On Friday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the mandate of the international stabilisation force – a key part of the ceasefire plan – would need to be clarified before foreign countries make troop commitments.At a press conference, Rubio said: “In fairness to all the countries we’ve talked to about having a presence on the ground, I think they want to know specifically what the mandate will be and what the funding mechanism looks like,” adding that there were a “number of nations states acceptable to all sides” willing to participate in the international force.The ceasefire, which has prevented the resumption of all-out funding, has grown increasingly shaky as momentum for a permanent end to the two-year Gaza war stalls.Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, warned on Thursday that further delays in moving to the second phase of the deal “endangers the entire process”.The war in Gaza started after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage on 7 October 2023. All but one of the hostages and their remains have been returned to Israel in exchange for Palestinian detainees and prisoners under the ceasefire deal.More than 70,925 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s war on the territory, around half of whom were women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. The death toll is expected to rise as more bodies are found under the rubble.Much of the strip’s civilian infrastructure and homes were levelled by Israeli bombing.A UN commission, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip – a claim that Israel has denied.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

In May, Thailand’s health ministry recommended doctorsswitch from some biomedicines to traditional remediesfor certain conditions including muscle pain and constipation.View image in fullscreenKratom (Mitragyna speciosa) on sale in Bangkok, Thailand. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for centuries and was legalised in 2021.Photograph: Narong Sangnak/EPAThere have been some concerns that the WHO strategy could create a backdoor for unscientific systems such as homeopathy to enter the mainstream but Kuruvilla points out that homeopathy does not fit the WHO’s definition of traditional medicine – it was only created in the late 18th century – and that there is not strong enough evidence for the practice.But, she says: “With all of these – with biomedicine, homeopathy, traditional medicine – if the evidence changes, I think it’s our responsibility to be open to that.”In some countries homeopathy is used as a complementary medicine “and that’s up to the countries”, Kuruvilla says. “We have to, as WHO, just stick to the evidence.“So I think that’s our bottom line: is this supported by robust reliable evidence, especially on safety and efficacy? And if it’s not, WHO is not supporting it, whether it is biomedicine or traditional medicine.”Not engaging wasn’t an option, because that would mean everything goes on without any safeguardsDr Shyama KuruvillaWHOsurveyssuggest that in most countries, the majority of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine services are not part of the formal health system and are paid for by patients. They are less likely to be subject to official quality checks but are hugely popular.“Not engaging wasn’t an option, because that would mean everything goes on without any safeguards,” Kuruvilla says, pointing to a burgeoning trillion-dollar wellness industry ranging from yoga studios to “nutraceuticals”.View image in fullscreenThe opening ceremony of the second WHO global summit on traditional medicine in New Delhi, India, on 17 December.Photograph: CBAS Films/WHONew methods let scientists study traditional medicine “in a way that wasn’t possible before”, Kuruvilla says. Genomics might prompt new understanding of the properties of a plant, while modern scanning equipment can pick up changes in the brains of people meditating.“Meditation was all this ‘woo-woo stuff’ but now, seeing all these advances in neuroscience and showing changes in brain waves from functional magnetic resonance imaging, which we couldn’t do before – actually being able to trace the pathways that lead to changes in health measurements – I think this is really, really exciting,” she says.A new WHO strategic technical advisory group for traditional medicine was launched this week at a global summit in India. “This is a pivotal moment for traditional medicine. It embodies cultural heritage and national health identities, and increasingly, it constitutes a vital component of primary health care strategies,” Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO’s assistant director-general for health system, access and data, told the summit.The idea, Kuruvilla suggests, is to “build a bridge” between traditional medicine and biomedicine. It is important to “find commonalities”, she says. “Showing that the science can be robust is really, really important, and especially on the patient safety aspect.”Traditional medicine has the potential to be a “treasure trove”, Kuruvilla says. The vast numbers of people working in the field – including university-educated professionals accredited to work in clinics in China and India – could ease global workforce shortages and make a “huge contribution” to universal health coverage, she says.View image in fullscreenStaff prepare traditional herbal medicine at a hospital in Tongren, China.Photograph: CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesIn the context of aid cuts forcing countries to rethink health provision, traditional medicine could be “a way for countries also to be more self-reliant and then share those resources with each other”.The risk of failing to invest, she says, is leaving people unable to access their preferred type of healthcare in a safe way and “the world not being able to use our shared heritage here in a way that allows us to find new holistic solutions for health and wellbeing of people and planet”.Explore more on these topicsGlobal healthHomeopathyAlternative medicineHealth & wellbeingWorld Health OrganizationHealthIndiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The corporation has denied the allegations.A BBC spokesperson said on Saturday: “Strictly Come Dancing’s public vote is independently overseen and verified to ensure complete accuracy every week.“Any claims to the contrary are entirely without foundation. Unfortunately, despite requests for it, Mr Skinner is yet to share the email he references with anyone from the BBC so we are unable to comment on it.”‘Strictly, babe, this is a mistake’: are the BBC dance show’s fans fed up with the constant scandal?Read moreIt comes after newspaper reports said the social media personality is planning to sue the BBC over his early elimination from the programme.The BBC is not aware of any legal complaint over the matter, the Guardian understands.PromoVeritas, the company which independently verifies the Strictly public vote, said: “All votes are independently and comprehensively verified by two auditors.“We can confirm that all votes received are validated. This has been the case every week and we have reported no issues with the public vote or how it is being represented in the final results.”Skinner, 34, also claimed he had the authenticity of the alleged email from a BBC executive “independently verified”. However, it is unclear how he did so.He added there were “smaller things” that added to the feeling of “how unfair it all was”, such as his welcome gift to the show being the only one that “got stolen apparently”.In response, a BBC spokesperson said: “The Strictly Come Dancing production team categorically did not supply ‘welcome gifts’ to any of the cast.”Skinner announced he would not be attending Saturday’s Strictly final – which sees former contestants return.He is back on the BBC for Celebrity Apprentice on 29 and 30 December,and was present at the BBC’s press launch for the programme last month, the Guardian understands.Explore more on these topicsUK newsTelevision industryStrictly Come DancingBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

Its scale and the devastation caused to so many families cannot be over-estimated, as was laid bare in Liz Sayce’s report. Any suggestion that this is anything other than a systemic failure over a number of years is unacceptable.”Yeandle, who sat on the advisory panel for the government-commissioned Sayce review, said that while ministers initially claimed to have accepted “the vast majority” of the report’s 40 recommendations, 13 had been only partially accepted and two were rejected.“Sayce calls for swift action on longstanding issues, some of which the DWP should have resolved long ago,” Yeandle said, adding that she was speaking in a personal capacity.She said: “The official response and internal DWP memo published last weekend don’t give me much confidence that senior officials will now address these with the urgency and commitment needed.”Ministers last monthvowed to fixthe systemic failings after a Guardian investigation exposed how scores of vulnerable families had been left with huge debts and hundreds with criminal convictions for fraud.Peter Schofield, the DWP’s most senior civil servant, is facing scrutiny for in effect overseeing the crisis despite promising MPs in 2019 that it would be fixed. He told MPs on the public accounts committee earlier this month: “I am sorry for all of those who are affected by this, but I am going to sort it out.”Those who care for loved ones for at least 35 hours a week are entitled to £83.30 a week in carer’s allowance, provided their weekly earnings do not exceed £196. But if carers exceed this limit, even by as little as 1p, they must repay the entire week’s allowance.The draconian nature of the rules is compounded by the DWP’s failure to alert unpaid carers when they have overstepped the earnings limit, despite the department having access to near real-time data.As a result, hundreds of thousands of peopleunwittingly built up huge debts– sometimes of more than £20,000 – which the DWP often seeks to recover years later, threatening carers with criminal prosecution if they do not pay.Ministers last month pledged about £75m to fix the scandal and ordered about 200,000 historical cases to be reassessed. The DWP says about 26,000 carers are likely to have debts cancelled or reduced, although experts believe this figure should be far higher.Yeandle said the failures had put vulnerable families under “intolerable strain”.She said: “To rebuild trust, government and the DWP should issue an unreserved apology for this. It’s left a terrible enduring legacy for some carers, and in these cases I think government should consider compensation. Some debts built up over long periods, with carers not made aware of this by the DWP until years had passed.”Yeandle, the former director of the Centre for Care at the University of Sheffield, said the government’s initial response to the Sayce review “looked promising”, but she had lost confidence in the department’s commitment following the Couling controversy and its refusal to fully accept several key recommendations.One recommendation only partially accepted by the DWP was to issue clearer guidance on what expenses carers can be allowed under the rules.Katy Styles, of We Care Campaign, said she believed Couling should resign and said it was difficult to have confidence in Schofield, the DWP’s permanent secretary.“Systemic failings aren’t abstract policy problems,” she said. “They translate into stress and financial insecurity. It’s a constant battle to be believed by a department that holds immense power over people’s lives.”The DWP’s response to the failings was crucial, she said, because for carers it was about “really being listened to and protected from further failure”.She added: “Ministers need to ask whether a culture that has repeatedly minimised these concerns can change itself, or whether clear political leadership is required to impose the cultural and leadership change that the victims of this scandal so deserve.”Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, told the BBC’s Laura Kuennsberg programme earlier this month that Couling’s comments were “not the position” of the DWP and said the carer’s allowance issue was a”longstanding problem that was ignored by the previous government”.A DWP spokesperson said: “We inherited a system that let carers down – but we’re taking decisive action to put things right and rebuild trust, accepting the vast majority of the Sayce’s review recommendations.“We’re already making changes, hiring extra staff to stop carers building up large debts, updating internal guidance, and making sure letters clearly explain what changes carers need to report.“And we will continue putting things right by reassessing affected cases, and potentially reducing, cancelling or refunding debts for tens of thousands of carers, as well as working to modernise the benefit so this doesn’t happen again.”Explore more on these topicsCarersCarer's allowance crisisCivil serviceBenefitsSocial careWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn’t aboutBill Clinton. Never has, never will be,” the statement added.Epstein files: which royals, politicians, musicians and actors are in the photos?Read moreIt continued: “Even Susie Wiles saidDonald Trumpwas wrong about Bill Clinton,” it said, referring to comments made by White House chief of staff to Vanity Fair in which Wiles acknowledged that Clinton had not been on Epstein’s Caribbean island despite repeated claims by Trump to the contrary.Clinton has long maintained that he cut ties with Epstein around 2005, before the disgraced financier plead guilty to solicitation of a minor in Florida.In the statement, Clinton’s spokesperson Angel Ureña said: “There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that. Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.”The photographs released on Friday show Clinton in an underground swimming pool with Maxwell and a woman whose facial features have been redacted, as well as at a dinner with Mick Jagger, Epstein and other public figures.The picture of Clinton in a swimming pool was laterposted on Xby the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, with the caption “Oh my!” and a red-faced emoji.“Slick Willy! @BillClinton just chillin, without a care in the world. Little did he know… ,” Steven Cheung, the White House communications director,posted to X.Epstein visited the White House at least 17 times during the early years of Clinton’s presidency, according to White House visitor records cited in news reports. He later travelled with Epstein on the financier’s private jet in the years after he left office in 2001, including to Asia and Africa, on trips related the Clinton Global Initiative. Clinton has never been formally accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.But Trump has repeatedly made insinuations about the relationship between Clinton and Epstein. Last month, he called for the justice department and the FBI to “investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton”, part of a long-running campaign to characterize the Epstein scandal as an issue uniquely connected to Democrats.The justice department photo dump comes as both Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and presidential candidate, are scheduled to give depositions to the House oversight committee over their ties to Epstein.The depositions, originally scheduled for last week, have been pushed to 13 and 14 January. The committee’s chair, James Comer, has threatened to hold contempt proceedings if the couple do not sit for depositions on those dates,Politico reported.Explore more on these topicsBill ClintonJeffrey EpsteinTrump administrationDonald TrumpRepublicansDemocratsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She was accompanied by a retired SpaceX executive also born in Germany, Hans Koenigsmann, who helped organize and, along with Blue Origin, sponsored her trip. Their ticket prices were not divulged.An ecstatic Benthaus said she laughed all the way up – the capsule soared more than 65 miles (105km) – and tried to turn upside down once in space.Nasa loses contact with spacecraft orbiting Mars for more than a decadeRead more“It was the coolest experience,” she said shortly after landing.The 10-minute space-skimming flight required only minor adjustments to accommodate Benthaus, according to the company. That’s because the autonomous New Shepard capsule was designed with accessibility in mind, “making it more accessible to a wider range of people than traditional spaceflight”, said Blue Origin’s Jake Mills, an engineer who trained the crew and assisted them on launch day.Among Blue Origin’s previous space tourists: those with limited mobility and impaired sight or hearing, and a pair of 90-year-olds.For Benthaus, Blue Origin added a patient transfer board so she could scoot between the capsule’s hatch and her seat. The recovery team also unrolled a carpet on the desert floor after touchdown, providing immediate access to her wheelchair, which she left behind at liftoff. She practiced in advance, with Koenigsmann taking part with the design and testing. An elevator was already in place at the launch pad to ascend the seven stories to the capsule perched atop the rocket.Benthaus, 33, part of the EuropeanSpaceAgency’s graduate trainee program in the Netherlands, experienced snippets of weightlessness during a parabolic airplane flight out of Houston in 2022. Less than two years later, she took part in a two-week simulated space mission in Poland.“I never really thought that going on a spaceflight would be a real option for me because even as like a super healthy person, it’s like so competitive, right?” she told the Associated Press ahead of the flight.Her accident dashed whatever hope she had. “There is like no history of people with disabilities flying to space,” she said.When Koenigsmann approached her last year about the possibility of flying on Blue Origin and experiencing more than three minutes of weightlessness on a space hop, Benthaus thought there might be a misunderstanding. But there wasn’t, and she immediately signed on.It’s a private mission for Benthaus with no involvement by the European Space Agency (ESA),which this year clearedreserve astronaut John McFall, an amputee, for a future flight to the International Space Station. The former British Paralympian lost his right leg in a motorcycle accident when he was a teenager.An injured spinal cord means Benthaus can’t walk at all, unlike McFall, who uses a prosthetic leg and could evacuate a space capsule in an emergency at touchdown by himself. Koenigsmann was designated before flight as her emergency helper; he and Mills lifted her out of the capsule and down the short flight of steps at flight’s end.“You should never give up on your dreams, right?” Benthaus urged after touchdown.Benthaus was adamant about doing as much as she could by herself. Her goal is to make not only space accessible to disabled people, but to improve accessibility on Earth too.While getting lots of positive feedback within “my space bubble”, she said outsiders aren’t always as inclusive.“I really hope it’s opening up for people like me, like I hope I’m only the start,” she said.Besides Koenigsmann, Benthaus shared the ride with business executives and investors, and a computer scientist. They raised Blue Origin’s list of space travelers to 86.Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, created Blue Origin in 2000 and launched its first passenger spaceflight in 2021. The company has since delivered spacecraft to orbit from Cape Canaveral, Florida, using the bigger and more powerful New Glenn rocket, and is working to send landers to the moon.Explore more on these topicsSpaceBlue OriginDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

SomeRepublicansimmediately called for more transparency.Rightwing Georgia representativeMarjorie Taylor Greene– who has recently fallen out with Trump - criticized the release, describing “the heavily redacted Epstein files”, the “failure to release them all by today’s lawful deadline” and the redaction of “politically exposed individuals and government officials” as “NOT MAGA”.“People are raging and walking away,” she wrote.In asocial media post, the Republican Kentucky representative Thomas Massie said the redactions violate the law, and suggested that a future Congress may impeach the attorney general,Pam Bondi, for that violation. “Unfortunately, today’s document release by@AGPamBondiand@DAGToddBlanchegrossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that@realDonaldTrumpsigned just 30 days ago.”But some rightwing commentators and Trump loyalists swung firmly behind the administration.The release – from a justice department run by close Trump ally Bondi – has hundreds of pages of case material that are completely redacted and many of the men depicted in photographs have their faces redacted.But some do not, including high-profile figures like Clinton, pop singer Michael Jackson and academic Noam Chomsky. The presence of Clinton, especially, allowed some rightwing figures to go on the attack.“It’s pretty rich how the Democrats falsely accused President Trump of being a pedophile, only for the Trump DOJ to release Epstein files that show Bill Clinton skinny dipping with a pedophile in the pedo’s pool,” write conservative commentator Laura Loomer. “Maybe now the media will stop obsessing over these files.”“New Epstein Files show Bill Clinton shirtless in a hot tub with a female that is not his wife Hillary Clinton,” wrote Rogan O’Handley, an attorney whose dc_draino account on Instagram has more than 3 million followers. “There’s only 1 reason Epstein would photograph a US President with a girl in a hot tub: Blackmail.”Clinton has repeatedly said he knew of no criminal actions by Epstein and has never been alleged to have engaged in any wrongdoing. “The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” Clinton’s spokesperson Angel Ureñasaid in a statement on X.“This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn’t aboutBill Clinton. Never has, never will be,” the statement added.However, overall comment on the right was relatively muted on Saturday, especially when compared with the loud demands for action that preceded the congressional vote to pass a law requiring the document’s release.Loomer, who recently accepted press credentials at the Pentagon after a revolt by conventional newsrooms against reporting restrictions adopted by the administration, had been among the loudest advocates for a release.In February, Loomer chastised the administration broadly and Bondi specifically after a group of rightwing influencers were given physical binders of files earlier this year that contained no new information.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinRepublicansUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re putting up a mirror to what is happening.”More than65,000immigrants across the US are confined in federal detention, a two-thirds increase since January, and recent data shows that 74% of those in custody have no criminal convictions.View image in fullscreen‘The photos draw contrast to the cowardice of the masked men who hide their faces because they know what they’re doing is wrong.’Photograph: Courtesy of the California Community FoundationA few of the faces in Am I Next? are familiar: the veteran actors and activists Edward James Olmos and George Takei, who was incarcerated as a five-year-old boy during the second world war, and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass. The dozens of others are LA residents who Pulitzer-winning photographerBarbara Davidsonmet throughout city neighborhoods such as East LA, Venice and Echo Park.“Some were too nervous to participate because they, or a family member, were in the process of becoming citizens and didn’t want to risk jeopardizing their application,” said Davidson. “Others were eager to take a stand against the ICE raids.”A dedicatedwebsiteallows people to submit their own photos in a show of solidarity.“The photos draw contrast to the cowardice of the masked men who hide their faces because they know what they’re doing is wrong,” said Santana, whose own portrait appears on CalFund’s building, which is visible from City Hall and walking distance from ICE’s downtown LA detention center. “Courage is the best antidote to authoritarianism.”For the Japanese Americancommunity, the use of force, dehumanization tactics, lack of due process and the racist targeting of immigrants feels all too familiar.The Japanese American National Museum, or JANM, in historic Little Tokyo is not only a nightly canvas for protest art, but was where more than 37,000 Japanese Americans from Los Angeles boarded buses for American concentration camps in 1942. It’s also where about 75 armed federal agents conducted an immigrationraidin August, during a news conference event with Gavin Newsom, a sight that caused widespreadoutrage.“What’s at the heart of this campaign is a reminder to people that when we protect the rights of anyone in our community, we are really protecting the rights for everyone, including ourselves,” said James Herr, director of the Democracy Center at JANM. “The same kind of xenophobia, fear, prejudice and racism that Japanese Americans faced during world war two is what our current immigrant populations are facing.”View image in fullscreenProjections on a building as part of We Belong Here, a public art installation project, in Los Angeles on 16 October 2025.Photograph: LA Plaza de Cultura y ArtesJANM’s evening projections also incorporate images of former incarcerated people with Angelenos standing against ICE raids.At the nearby LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, over 30 large-scale digital images and neon from 10 LA-based artists, including Brandy González, Lalo Alcaráz and Patrick Martinez are on view in addition to images from Am I Next? The bold and colorful works, entitledWe Belong Here, reflect the immigrant experience and call for justice with messages such as “Invest in the oppressed“ and “It is the weak who are cruel”.More institutions in Los Angeles and Long Beach plan to host Am I Next? on their walls, and Santana said he’s heard from colleagues in San Francisco and New York who are looking to project similar images to bring awareness.“The violent way in which [immigration enforcement] is happening really needs to be exposed and not normalized,” said Santana, who said the project will run indefinitely. “We will keep it going until we can all sleep at night knowing that our core American constitutional rights are not going to be violated.

Where is it?Most Americans have yet to see this boom – but they’ve certainly heard a lot about it from the presidentCallum Jones,Andrew WitherspoonandAliya Uteuovain New YorkSat 20 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 20 Dec 2025 05.01 ESTShareMoments into his second term, opening hisinaugural address, Donald Trump was unequivocal. “The golden age of America begins right now,” he declared.At a White House reception last weekend, a little over 10 months later, the US president appeared to acknowledge just how far his timeline had shifted.“We’re going to have … I say it’s the golden age of America,” Trump told his audience. “We have an age that’s coming up, the likes of which … this country has never seen. And I just look so forward to the results. You’re going to see results in six months to a year.”TheUS economyhas come under pressure in 2025. A golden age did not promptly take hold, as Trump initially claimed, upon his return to office in January.On two areas the president pledged to rapidly improve – jobs and prices – the results have so far been lackluster.Chart of unemploymentThe labor market started the year steady. It had slowed, but still managed to expand by an average of 168,000 jobs each month, in 2024.During his joint address to Congress in March, however, Trump claimed to have inherited an “economic catastrophe” from Joe Biden’s administration, and vowed to create jobs “like we have never seen before”.A new ‘golden age’Jobs growth has, in fact, stalled in 2025 – with an average of 55,000 jobs added each month, according to official data for the first 11 months of the year, down 67% on 2024.US lost 105,000 jobs in October and added 64,000 in November, according to delayed dataRead moreThe headline unemployment rate, which fluctuated between 3.9% and 4.2% in the last year of Biden’s presidency, has climbed under Trump to 4.6% – its highest level in more than four years – in November.On the campaign trail last year, Trumppromiseda “new American industrialism” on his watch, through which the US would become a “manufacturing powerhouse” once again, with a resurgence in factory jobs.Chart of US manufacturing jobsIn reality, manufacturing employment has not increased this year. The US economy has so far added factory jobs in just two of 10 months after Trump’s return to office.Realizing this distant dream of an industrial renaissance, according to the White House, will require ramping up the president’s flagship economic policy: tariffs.And Trump has moved to do just that, hiking the overall average effective US tariff rate from 2.4% to 16.8%, the highest level since 1935, according to analysis bythe Budget Labat Yale.The rollout of higher tariffs has been erratic and marred by uncertain deadlines, delays and reversals. The process has been “more painful than I expected”, Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wilesconcededto Vanity Fair.‘Nobody can believe what’s going on’For all the pain this agenda has caused inside the White House, economists have repeatedly warned of a potentially stark impact on millions of Americans. Tariffs on goods from overseas, often passed along by the businesses that pay them, can lead to higher prices on store shelves.Officials and policymakers inside the Federal Reserve have spent months considering whether the ultimate effect of Trump’s tariffs will be a one-time jolt to prices, or something more lasting.Chart of US inflationInflation surged to its highest level in a generation in 2022 as the Covid-19 pandemic unleashed a series of supply and demand shocks on the world economy. By last year, however, the US consumer price index (CPI) was falling back down towards typical levels – and continued to do so during the early months of 2025.By Trump’s telling, though, his administration inherited an “inflation nightmare” from Biden, which he vowed to turn around. In aprimetime TV addresson Wednesday, he declared: “I am bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast.”US prices continued to rise despite Trump claims they are ‘rapidly’ fallingRead moreBut CPI has held firm since the spring. In November, itrose by an annual rate of 2.7%, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday.The president has repeatedly denied responsibility for inflation this year, and dismissed concerns about prices as a “con job”. Asked by Politico this month how he would grade himself on the economy, hereplied: “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus”.During his TV address this week, Trump insisted he was “solving” grocery prices, claiming that turkey and egg prices were down sharply. “Everything else is falling rapidly,” he claimed. “And it’s not done yet, but boy, are we making progress. Nobody can believe what’s going on.”‘Hard to see how 2026 will be better’There have been signs, however, that the administration is moving to reduce pressure in an economy rated so highly by the president.Trumpmoved to lower tariffson some imports, including beef, tomatoes, coffee and bananas, last month. The administration has also unveiled$12bn in economic assistancefor farmers, andrepeatedly mooted stimulus checksfor Americans, funded by tariffs.Kicking off a nationwide tour designed to build the narrative of a “remarkable turnaround”, Trump appeared at a rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last week in front of a vast sign that read: “LOWER PRICES BIGGER PAYCHECKS”.Is a golden age really about to take hold? Trump and his officials have an almost messianic belief the economy will step up a gear in the first quarter of next year, Axiosreportedearlier this week, citing advisers to the administration.This confidence is said to be driven by projections that stimulus from Trump’smassive One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax-and-spending legislationwill deliver a significant boost to household finances, and spur business investment.Outside the administration, economists are skeptical.“Most lower income Americans will be hurt (net) by these policies. And you need to add the increase inhealthcare premiumson top of this,” said Simon Johnson, a Nobel prize-winning economist and professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management. “Hard to see how 2026 will be better for most people.”The US economy isforecastto grow by 2% this year, down from 2.8% in 2024. Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, expects only a “pretty small fiscal boost” from Trump’s policies next year.“In addition, households’ relatively low confidence suggests many of them will save the windfall from larger-than-usual tax refunds in the spring,” said Tombs. “Accordingly, we expect GDP growth of about 2% again next year, well short of the administration’s hopes.”Trump remains bullish. “We’re poised for an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen,” he assured the nation this week.Most Americans have yet to see this boom.

Putting aside the breathtaking exhibitions of physical and psychological intensity it can produce, the sport has long been a refuge of the underclass, credited with changing the lives of the disenfranchised and impoverished. There are no barriers to entry. In that sense, it has always sold a democratic dream.But boxing is, and has always been, the red-light district of professional sports, its flimsy guardrails making it a longtime haven for brazen criminals and the kind of grift and corruption that strains credulity. Thereareno barriers to entry. The idea that a sport which gave the world Don King, Frank “Blinky” Palermo andPark Si-hun v Roy Jones Jrcould somehow be further debased is almost laughable.Anthony Joshua calls out Tyson Fury after sending Jake Paul to hospital with broken jawRead moreYet in the hours after Anthony Joshuameted out the reality check of a lifetimeto Jake Paul on the neon edge of south-east Florida, the instinctive grappling with What It All Means has left us staring at some uncomfortable questions. Not so much about boxing’s future, but about the world now consuming it – and the environment that enabled Friday night’s artless, cynical spectacle to generate a reported purse of $138m (£103m) to be divided between its participants.Paul is not an aberration within boxing so much as a stress test of its contradictions. His five-year foray into professional fighting, oncederided as vapid cosplayin this space, has been legitimately impressive in a sport where countless celebrity interlopers have failed miserably down the decades and vanishingly few who start past their teenage years make any mark at all. Speed-running a credible fistic education is easier with Paul’s limitless time, money and resources, but the Ohioan has plainly given himself over to the discipline. He has built a profile on a procession of faded mixed martial arts fighters, fellow YouTubers, a retired basketball player anda 58-year-old Mike Tyson. But when Paul says boxing has helped him as a person, as he didthrough a broken jawduring Friday’s aftermath, it’s not hard to believe him.3:32Anthony Joshua calls out Tyson Fury after knockout victory over Jake Paul – videoHe is a better boxer than his critics allow, but he is a genuinely brilliant businessman, even if he’s preying on our baser instincts. Paul rattles off his many jobs easily: venture capitalist, chief executive, boxer, entrepreneur. At heart, though, he remains a YouTuber, unafraid of looking stupid on camera in pursuit of views and clout. He has found a lane that uses spectacle to turn notoriety into capital, and boxing, ruthless about exposing frauds, has offered just enough legitimacy to make the enterprise scalable.What’s funny is that Paul chose a trade that he knew would inevitably find him out. For all his bluster and force of will, he knew this night would come. He had simply made peace with it. In the end, Paul gave the worldwide audience afforded by Netflix’s roughly 300 million subscribers exactly the Christmas present it wanted: to see him knocked out brutally. The clip of Joshua fracturing Paul’s jaw in two places during the final assault will almost certainly be the most-viewed piece of boxing content on YouTube before the new year.The event nearly sold out the 20,000-seat home of the NBA’s Miami Heat, helped by ticket prices that fell as low as $31 by fight night. The atmosphere felt less like that of a boxing crowd than a content farm: phones everywhere, people filming one another in the concourses, strangers wandering into streams and dapping each other up for the camera. Paul’stheatrical ringwalkalongside the widely despised SoundCloud rapperTekashi 6ix9inewas a calculated provocation, a reminder that outrage still converts. Then came the fight itself. Paul’s gameplan – circling endlessly in a 22-foot ring, avoiding engagement – drew boos within 45 seconds. He was obviously gassed after nine minutes, throwing fewer than 10 punches in each round. Afterwards, Joshua said the right things, but looked almost sad and embarrassed by it all.Baumgardner and Dubois win as women’s champions shine on Paul v Joshua undercardRead moreSo why has it left such a sour taste? Perhaps because sport has always reflected society – boxing most of all – and we probably didn’t like what we saw in the mirror on Friday night. Certainly not at the nadir of the farce, as a pathetic Paul repeatedly threw himself to the canvas without so much as a point deduction, so physically spent from his perpetual retreat that a stiff breeze might have felled him.Some argue Netflix should be embarrassed for endorsing a fight that may not have been sanctioned in Las Vegas, let alone by the British Boxing Board of Control. But the streaming company didn’t stumble into this moment; it merely identified it early. In an era when the Oscarsare decamping from network televisionto YouTube and live sports have become the last reliably communal media experience, this was a proof of concept in a crucial theatre of the streaming wars. It is no longer unthinkable that the Super Bowl will be off broadcast within a decade. From that perspective, Friday night was less a money-burning sideshow than a strategic investment.Paul’s entry into boxing may be a net positive. Consider Amanda Serrano, the first fighter he signed to his promotional company. An eight-division champion unknown to all but hardcore boxing fans for most of her career owing to a lack of investment in female fighters, she went from getting paid $1,500 for a world title defence to earning multiple seven-figure purses by riding the slipstream of Paul’s fame. Attention, unevenly distributed, can still redistribute money to the deserving. Thefour women’s title fights on Friday’s cardwere the highlight of the show by some distance.View image in fullscreenAmanda Serrano, seen here in 2022, signed to Jake Paul’s boxing promotion company in March 2025.Photograph: Ian Hodgson/PAOverall, things are going well in the world of Jake Paul Inc. He will reportedly earn at least $70m for Friday’s proceedings, possibly more. His fiancee, the Dutch speedskating star Jutta Leerdam, is favoured to pick up a medal in the Olympic 1,000m in two months’ time; together they are in effectthat sport’s Travis and Taylor. He is a very good talker, he’s corporate-approved and can do pretty much whatever he wants. I’ll be shocked if he’s not a major-party US presidential candidate in the next 20 years.Boxing will emerge from the Jake Paul era intact – even improved in places – because it still demands something real: preparation, pain, consequence. What should trouble us more is the world that allowed a 13-fight novice to become a face of a sport built on merit. Paul’s popularity tells us plenty about where we are heading, and it is not to higher ground.Explore more on these topicsBoxingAnthony JoshuafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Behind the headline positivity, however, must be a realisation that more convincing performances are required to hold on until the final reckoning.Viktor Gyökeres’ emphatic first-half penalty sealed a slender yet merited win over an Everton team missing several important components.Arsenalwere more efficient than impressive and rarely troubled throughout a scrappy contest. But this was a test of title-winning character as much as quality after three away games without a win in the league and having lost top spot for the first time since mid-October before kick-off. In that respect Arteta can be encouraged by a reaction that ensured Manchester City’s stay in first place would be brief and Arsenal would be top at Christmas for the third time in four years.Everton v Arsenal: Premier League – liveRead more“It gives me belief and confidence, the level of performance and the consistency of that,” said the Arsenal manager. “It is very difficult to do that in this league. We are going to have to go to difficult places but we have to enjoy the process of winning.”There was nothing to report from a tedious opening aside from the pathetic and frequent poverty chanting by the Arsenal away support. Fair play to theEvertonemployee who decided to display an advertisement for ‘Fans Supporting Foodbanks’ on the giant stadium screens in response.Finally, and inexplicably, Jake O’Brien enlivened proceedings with a chaotic cameo. The Everton defender nudged Gyökeres over when the Arsenal striker appeared certain to convert a deflected Jurriën Timber cross almost on the goalline. Gyökeres appealed for a penalty that the video assistant referee checked and rejected on the basis there was no foul. The striker had to be stronger when challenging for the cross.No matter. From the corner that resulted from Vitalii Mykolenko getting the final touch on Timber’s delivery O’Brien blatantly handled under pressure from Riccardo Calafiori and Piero Hincapié. The referee, Sam Barrott, having missed the offence, was sent to the pitchside monitor where the sight of the Republic of Ireland international raising both hands to the ball gave him no alternative but to award a spot-kick. The Arsenal captain, Martin Ødegaard, insisted Gyökeres take it. The power and pace of the forward’s penalty gave Jordan Pickford no chance despite the fact he dived the right way.The remainder of the first half reverted to type. Dull. With Declan Rice and Martín Zubimendi controlling proceedings in midfield Arsenal performed with greater composure although the visitors, and Everton, created little. William Saliba slipped in Gyökeres shortly before the interval but the forward shot over under pressure from James Tarkowski.View image in fullscreenJake O’Brien handles the ball to concede the decisive penalty.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersEverton’s lack of threat came as no surprise. Without Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Iliman Ndiaye, injured and away at the Africa Cup of Nations respectively, David Moyes was missing two of his best and most creative talents of the season. The drop in quality from the absent duo to their replacements, Carlos Alcaraz and Dwight McNeil, was steep and inevitably felt by the home side.A more open and intense second half brought welcome improvement. Arsenal were close to doubling their advantage when Bukayo Saka and Timber combined brilliantly down the Everton left. Having released his overlapping full-back inside the box, Saka followed in for a perfectly weighted return ball. Saka’s low shot beat England colleague Pickford but was blocked in front of the line by Tarkowski.The visitors also struck the woodwork twice in four minutes. Leandro Trossard curled a first-time shot around Pickford and against the far post after Rice unselfishly laid the ball into his path. Trossard should have scored. Zubimendi then swept an effort against the base of the same post from Ødegaard’s fine cut-back from the byline.Everton’s performance improved too although their best hopes of an equaliser centred on penalty claims. The first was optimistic and ignored when Thierno Barry tumbled under a challenge from Zubimendi after a careless pass out of defence by Saliba. The hosts’ second shout looked stronger when Saliba and Barry challenged for a loose ball inside the box and the Arsenal defender kicked the Everton striker’s foot after the latter had played the ball. VAR deemed there was insufficient contact to award a penalty. “It could have been given,” said Moyes.The Everton manager added: “Arsenal give up very few chances but, even so, we didn’t create as many as we’d have liked. We started better than Arsenal but the penalty turned things. We gave away a stupid penalty kick.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueEvertonArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Certainly not Tottenham, even if they ended the game bellowing, blustering and battering at the door with nine men. The fact they went down fighting in those circumstances, clawing back into contention after controversially going two goals behind, will buoy up theembattled Thomas Frankbut that would be to overlook elements of a performance whose discipline deteriorated to their cost.It may not have been a moment of lift-off forLiverpool, either, although they did eventually wobble to three points. The scales had tipped in their favour when Xavi Simons, with one of those very modern and exasperating video review red cards, was dismissed in the 33rd minute but they looked blunt until the half-time substitute Alexander Isak sent them on their way. As soon as he had done so, the striker departed with a nasty-looking injury. The legacy could be costly regardless of the fact that, almost undetected, Arne Slot’s side have edged themselves back up to fifth, at least until Manchester United visit Aston Villa on Sunday.‘The game is gone’: Thomas Frank fumes over VAR decisions in latest lossRead moreThe touchpaper on what had been a circumspect affair, initially light years from the6-3 rampage Liverpool delivered a year agoto the weekend, was set ablaze when Simons caught Virgil van Dijk after the ball had long gone. In one sense the flashpoint had been coming: Simons had been haring around off the ball, pleasing the crowd with one sliding intervention near his own corner flag. In another it felt rather overblown, the offence not seeming sufficient to rob the evening of its standard proportions.View image in fullscreenJohn Brooks shows Xavi Simons a red card for raking his studs down Virgil van Dijk’s calf, causing the hole in his sock (inset).Composite: Shutterstock, GettyVan Dijk had passed the ball backwards when Simons, failing to put the brakes on when pressing, raked his studs down the defender’s lower left leg. He had been a little off balance when contact was made. The referee, John Brooks, showed a yellow card and that seemed a reasonable end to the matter.But Simons was clearly in trouble once the video assistant referee called for a review, events running their inevitable course after the slow-motion replays invited a different conclusion. Presented at a fraction of the speed his challenge did look dangerous; ultimately, though, it reeked of the kind of dismissal that rarely occurred before micromanagement by technology was railroaded through to become an integral part of football. Simons should have cooled the jets but he had been rash rather than malicious.There was no suggestion Van Dijk would need replacing and indeed it was he, in a late example of Liverpool’s enduring skittishness, who would air kick and allow the substitute Richarlison to drill Spurs back into the game. By then it seemed to have been won, the visitors drawing blood from their two moments of genuine threat.Liverpool had not exceeded room temperature in the first half so it was little surprise Isak was called to enhance their threat even if the player he replaced, Conor Bradley, was injured. With his fourth touch, Isak clipped in his secondPremier Leaguegoal of the campaign after Dominik Szoboszlai and Florian Wirtz had made the most of a sloppy pass from Romero. It was Wirtz’s first top-flight assist in England but the good news ended there.Quick GuideKey factsShow• Tottenham have lost 11 home league games in 2025, their most ever in a single calendar year across club history.• Alexander Isak became just the second player to be subbed on, score and then be subbed off for Liverpool in a Premier League game after Yossi Benayoun vs Manchester City in November 2009.OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Isak was taken out by a scissor-like challenge by Micky van de Ven as he scored, the tackle worse than anything Simons had produced but perhaps diminished by the move’s outcome, and had to be helped from the field after lengthy treatment. The problem appeared to be with his ankle and Slot will hope his prize asset, finally getting up to speed, is not sidelined for long.Spurs’ main threat with 11 men had come through Randal Kolo Muani, who could not get enough power on a free header soon before Simons departed. He gamely ploughed a lone furrow when they had 10 and almost equalised when, after a show of strength and speed, his angled shot snicked off Milos Kerkez and dropped down on to the bar. It was the first of two deflections that would have a significant influence on the outcome of the match.The second followed quickly. Jeremie Frimpong, who had replaced Isak for his own return from injury, twisted Djed Spence inside out before delivering a cross that clipped the left-back on its way. Hugo Ekitiké, hanging in the air while taking what seemed an illegal liftoff atop Romero, met the ball with a looping header and Spurs had further cause to rage.Tottenham v Liverpool: Premier League – liveRead moreView image in fullscreenCristian Romero lashes out at Ibrahima Konaté resulting in a second yellow card.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesThey finished with five yellow cards including the two shown to Romero, the second awarded three minutes into an epic period of added time after he kicked out at Ibrahima Konaté. Spurs may have been fuelled by righteous anger but the last thing Frank needs is to lose both Simons and his captain. They kept balls flashing across the Liverpool box until the last despite such depleted numbers, Wilson Odobert requiring Alisson to claw one away at the very end.Liverpool clung on, their game management a mess but a six-game unbeaten run suggesting the darkest hour has passed.

But after a small mistake on the lower section of the course cost her valuable time, Vonn left the finish area convinced she had let a potential win slip away.Austria’s Cornelia Huetter produced the cleanest run of the day to claim her first World Cup victory of the season, clocking 1:41.54 on the Oreiller-Killy course. Germany’s Kira Weidle-Winkelmann finished second, 0.26sec back, while Vonn crossed the line 0.35sec behind the winner.Racing in challenging, flat-light conditions, Vonn briefly lost her balance after misjudging the terrain near the bottom of the course, a moment she estimated cost her roughly half a second. Moments earlier, she had thrown her arms wide in disbelief when her split time fell behind Weidle-Winkelmann’s early benchmark.“If you had asked me last year if I’d be happy with a podium, I would have said absolutely,” Vonn said afterward. “But now I know I’m fast. When you make little mistakes, that’s the difference between winning and not.”The result still marked Vonn’s third podium in four World Cup races this winter and the 141st of her career, an astonishing tally for an athlete who returned to competition last season after nearly six years of retirement. One year ago, she failed to reach the podium in her first 12 races back on tour; now she leads the season-long downhill standings with 240 points.View image in fullscreenAustria's Cornelia Huetter celebrates on the podium after winning the women's downhill with second-placed Germany's Kira Weidle-Winkelmann and third-placed Lindsey Vonn.Photograph: Christian Hartmann/ReutersHuetter, the defending downhill crystal globe winner, was consistently quicker than Vonn after the opening split and reached speeds of 126kph (78mph) as she secured the 10th World Cup win of her career. The 33-year-old Austrian now owns five downhill victories and is emerging as a leading contender for the Olympic downhill title in Cortina d’Ampezzo, scheduled for 8 February.Italy’s Sofia Goggia, widely viewed as Huetter’s biggest threat, endured a costly error. Fastest at the halfway mark,the 2018 Olympic championwas forced nearly upright while correcting her balance exiting a turn and skidded into rough snow, finishing eighth, 0.62sec off the lead.For Vonn, the broader picture remains overwhelmingly positive. Since fitting a titanium implant in her right knee, she has rediscovered both speed and belief, capped by her first World Cup win in seven years last weekend at St Moritz. With fewer than seven weeks until the Milan-Cortina Winter Games begin on 6 February, she believes her trajectory is exactly where it needs to be.“I’m looking forward to recharging a bit,” Vonn said. “I know I’ll be ready.”Val d’Isère concludes its women’s program on Sunday with a super-G before the World Cup circuit pauses for the holidays, with the next speed races scheduled for January in Altenmarkt, Austria.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

This question has been occupying me since 2014, when the Guardian first asked me to contribute to itsinaugural Next Generation feature. My job was to look for a France-based talent born in 1997 who could go on to have a stellar career.After a great deal of research, I narrowed it down from my shortlist of five by asking questions not about the players’ football ability, but about other attributes: resilience, adaptability, decision-making, creativity, work ethic, response to feedback and willingness to learn. Qualities we cannot see, and are harder to measure.The Premier League dominates Guardian’s top 100 male footballers again – can anyone catch up?Read moreBased on those answers, one player stood out above all the others: a kid called Ousmane Dembélé, then a youth player yet to make a first-team appearance at Rennes. Eleven years after appearing in these pages as one to watch, Dembélé has been voted thebest male player in the worldby the Guardian’s 219-strong voting panel.Those intangible qualities were in full effect on the night Dembélé made good on his years of promise. The defining image ofParis Saint-Germain’s 5-0 win over Interin the 2025 Champions League final was not the trophy lift, or any one of the goal celebrations, but Dembélé, poised on the edge of the opposition penalty area, with hunched demeanour and furrowed brow, his face a picture of focus, ready to press. Just how did he get to this point?One lesson to learn from the Dembélé story: the path to greatness is not always linear. He started off like a train, winning France’s young player of the year award in his first season as a professional. The following season, he helped Borussia Dortmund win the German Cup.View image in fullscreenParis Saint-Germain’s Achraf Hakimi (top) and Ousmane Dembélé celebrate with the Champions League trophy in May.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersAround that time, in the course of research for my book, Edge, I spoke to Thomas Tuchel, his coach at Dortmund. Tuchel told me that Dembélé’s talent came with an obligation and responsibility to improve. He bracketed his players into one of three “ABC” categories, depending on their dominant motivation, and would change his man-management style accordingly.The A category stood for “aggressive-motivated”, and referred to players motivated by individual glory and awards (in Tuchel’s eyes, this was not necessarily a negative: think Neymar at Paris).B stood for “binding-motivated”, those players who love being part of the group and bringing people together (often captains, such as César Azpilicueta at Chelsea).C stood for “curious-motivated”. These were the players capable of greatness, who needed to be trained in a slightly different way. Their talent could take them far; and on a good day, they were capable of anything. Tuchel loved coaching these players. Dembélé, he felt, was a C.But the journey was not always smooth. In 2017,he moved to Barcelona, who were flush with money from selling Neymar for €222m (£194m). It was a sliding doors moment. That same summer, Barcelona changed coach:in came Ernesto Valverde; out went Luis Enrique. In six injury-laden years at Barcelona, Dembélé started only a third of the league games. He scored a total of 24 league goals. His most memorable moment might have been missing a last-minute one-on-one in the2019 Champions League semi-final against Liverpool, when Barcelona were already 3-0 up (remember what happened next?They lost the second leg 4-0). When he did leave, amid mutterings of wasted talent andblackmail, it felt like a relief for all parties.View image in fullscreenDembélé in action for Borussia Dortmund in 2016.Photograph: TF-Images/Getty ImagesThere is some symmetry to Dembélé’s exceptional 2025. Of the 30 goals he has scored this calendar year at the time of writing, the most decisive and emblematic was probably against Liverpool in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. With PSG 1-0 down from the first leg, Dembélé drifted into his own half, losing his markers who didn’t want to follow him that far. He picked up the ball and spread it wide to the right-winger Bradley Barcola, then sprinted into the box and made it to the cross to score. (He also scored a penalty inPSG’s successful shootout after they won 1-0 at Anfieldthat night). Dembélé did something similar against Arsenal in the semi-final, dropping deep early in the game, switching the play to the left-sided Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and receiving the return ball, unmarked, on the edge of the area, before scoring. Even when teams knew it was coming, they couldn’t stop him.At the start of last season, Luis Enrique’s plan was for the whole team to replace the goals of Kylian Mbappé, who had joined Real Madrid. After all, Dembélé had not scored more than 10 league goals in a season since his debut campaign at Rennes. Luis Enrique wanted the team to be the star. And so, with no star player to serve, Dembélé was liberated. This curious-motivated talent who once scored penalties with either foot, and even took corners with either foot, quietly became the main man. He starts the press; his vision, movement, pace, control and positioning set the tone; and his finishing, once considered wasteful, is ruthless.I still don’t know exactly what makes a good player great but I am closer to an answer. Part of the equation remains what we cannot see: the chemistry within a team, the relationship with a specific coach, playing in a system that brings out the best in every player. Butalsothose other qualities that Dembélé had at 17, and still has now. This well-deserved prize is as much for those attributes as it is for his goals and the trophies he helped Paris Saint-Germain win.Explore more on these topicsFootballThe 100 best footballers in the worldfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mark Viduka achieved the same feat in 2003, helping secure his side’s top-flight status with his instinctive finishing, another achievement the latest Elland Road No 9 is aiming to replicate.The former Everton striker cannot have imagined almost 40,000 singing his name at Christmas when he was unemployed for much of the summer, reminding everyone that sometimes the best gifts are free. It took until mid-August for newly promoted Leeds to convince Calvert-Lewin this was the right place to rebuild his career and they are proving one another right, helped by the scorer of the third goal Ethan Ampadu’s long-throws.Erling Haaland double sinks West Ham as Manchester City put heat on ArsenalRead more“The numbers don’t lie, he’s in red-hot form at the moment,” Daniel Farke said of Calvert-Lewin. “[He is] one of the best English strikers in this league. He has proved it before, whenever he was fit, he has shown his quality. Right now he’s on a path to be a top, top-class player forLeeds United. I don’t like to speak about quality and top-class player just after a few weeks. You have to show this with consistency over the whole season.”Palace spent the opening stages trying to dictate the tempo, helping them manage the workload of nine games in 26 days, partially explaining why they failed to make this competitive by being unable to match Leeds physically and deal with set pieces. There were 11 changes from Thursday’s draw against KuPS, and Oliver Glasner might have feared another was required when Marc Guéhi and Calvert-Lewin clashed heads but both were able to continue, ensuring the game played out in Leeds’s favour.The plan to bombard the Palace box with set pieces was apparent from the start; a long throw-in belatedly fell to Joe Rodon on the edge of the box but his shot was deflected wide and from the resulting corner, the Welsh centre-back headed wide. Palace could not cope and did not learn from their mistakes, as they were punished by four.A clumsy challenge by Tyrick Mitchell on Brenden Aaronson caused greater ire among the home supporters. Even more so when the referee, Thomas Bramall, and VAR deemed the left-back had got the slightest of touches on the ball prior to clearing out the American.The anger was replaced with euphoria soon after when an Ampadu missile was flicked on to Calvert-Lewin in space at the back post. The striker was thwarted by Henderson the first time but not the second as a weary Palace slept. The goalkeeper’s complaints about poor marking made the moment even sweeter in Yorkshire.View image in fullscreenEthan Ampadu scored Leeds’s third goal after a corner, having helped set up the first two with long throws.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAChants of “England’s number nine” rang around the stadium for a striker whose previous five goals required 40 appearances to amass. It was a boisterous atmosphere; if the Palace fans were upset by a difficult journey after an 8pm kick-off on a Saturday five days before Christmas, the Leeds brethren had embraced the opportunity.Another throw, another Calvert-Lewin goal thanks to him once again being the first to react at the back post after a flick. This time it was a first-time header before he wheeled away but the feeling was the same for the striker and the majority inside Elland Road.Calvert-Lewin began his Leeds career with one goal in 13 prior to this run of six in five. Few had belief in a 28-year-old who had suffered numerous injuries in recent seasons but Leeds are reaping the rewards. He is looking sharper and more confident as each game passes, and with a dearth of English No 9s around, maybe Thomas Tuchel will hear choruses. “In the six yard box is where I need to be,” Calvert-Lewin said. “When you’re in a good moment the ball starts dropping for you and that’s where I’m at.”Ampadu got his reward as Palace once again struggled to clear their lines from a set piece. This time it was a corner which Aaronson headed back into the danger zone, made even more precarious by no one tracking the Leeds captain, who jabbed home. “We were bullied from every single set play, we could have conceded two or three more from set plays.” Glasner said. “ Conceding four set-play goals is also a bit embarrassing.”Calvert-Lewin and Ampadu were given standing ovations when taken off late on, before Justin Devenny pulled one back from the spot, only for Anton Stach to restore the three-goal advantage in the 101st minute from a free-kick.Leeds can enjoy Christmas relieved by being two wins clear of 18th-placed West Ham. There is no rest for the very wicked, as Palace face Arsenal in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, where they will be desperately hoping to rediscover the energy they forgot to bring to Yorkshire.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

While this became a four when attacking, as Amad Diallo pushed into midfield from right-back, Amorim has faced scrutiny for lacking the flexibility to change formation.Semenyo a January target for Manchester United as well as Liverpool and CityRead moreYet with Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui, who also operates at wing-back, with Côte d’Ivoire and Morocco respectively at theAfrica Cup of Nations, Amorim stated he is ready to field a four-man backline when asked if Tyrell Malacia may be selected in the position.“It will depend on the way we are playing that particular week. But if we have to change to a back four, we change to a back four,” said Amorim, who joked in recognition of what he admitted. “I was saving this one for the last [comment].”Amorim hopes to sign Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyoin the January window. While the 25-year-old has a release clause for slightly less than £65m and currently prefers to join Liverpool, Amorim is also targeting Rúben Neves, Conor Gallagher and Tyler Adams to strengthen the No 6 position. The head coach stated there is finance to add to the squad.“We’ll see,” Amorim said. “The only thing that we know is that we will only try to bring players that we think are going to be for the future. It’s not going to be to save something at this moment, to cope with the losses of three players for Afcon [Bryan Mbeumo is also at the tournament].View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo scored for Bournemouth against United in the 4-4 draw on Monday and is a transfer target for the Old Trafford club.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock“It’s not going to be like that. We will try to bring now – and at the end of the season – players that are perfect for our future. So I don’t know what is going to happen, but it’s possible that we can do something. Even if we try to bring one player, maybe it’s not the position that is [the one] that we need [even] more.”The last comment may refer to Amorim wishing to add a holding midfielder but not being able to sign the requisite one next month. Al-Hilal’s Neves, who is out of contract in the summer, would cost about £20m, though he may sign a fresh deal with the Saudi Arabia club and his salary of £350,000 per week is another potential stumbling block. Atlético Madrid’s Gallagher would cost in the region of €40m-€50m (£29m-£37m) but while the Spanish club want a sale, United’s preference is for a loan.Any transfer of Bournemouth’s Adams, who suffered a knee injury inMonday’s draw with United, would be for about £40m and is almost certain to happen in the summer.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

Otherwise, it will not be enough to arrive in March and April in contention to win titles.“We did not do the right process to do what we have to do. There were many good things – I always have to thank Erling for the goals but thanks to him and Phil [Foden] and Nico O’Reilly – they helped us to do this type of game. Defensively, we are improving. We are visualising it with the ball.“If they follow me, we will be there, but they have to improve. I know the level in Europe, I know Arsenal and other teams. The spirit is there – we didn’t have that last season – aggression, hunger, all the attributes that they need that are not about highlights. Hopefully Rodri is back [soon] but we cannot forget Jérémy [Doku] is not here, [Mateo] Kovacic, Omar Marmoush, Rayan [Aït-Nouri].”There was also rare criticism for Bernardo Silva. Guardiola said: “Bernie is my weakness. He’s top, but today Bernie had to play better. Today I’m not happy with Bernie. He’s my weakness, my favourite one, but today I’m not happy with him. He knows exactly what we need to play better.”View image in fullscreenErling Haaland scores Manchester City’s first goal, putting it past Alphonse Areola.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersSix straight wins in all competitions faced off against zero in five in the league. Factor in West Ham’s previous victory over the hosts beingin September 2015 (2-1)and Nuno Espírito Santo’s team were seeking to bridge a 21-game gap to the club’s last triumph over City.Inside five minutes, the task became harder. The constant passing of those in sky blue can be a torment, hammering away constantly before a knockout blow. This is how Haaland opened festivities. Constant possession wore down those in claret. Then Foden swapped passes with Nico González on the left and rolled the ball to the striker, who unloaded. Alphonse Areola beat the ball back to him and a thunderous right boot made no mistake.Quick GuideKey statsShow• Manchester City’s Erling Haaland has scored 19 Premier League goals this season; it’s the joint-most by a player in a campaign before Christmas along with Andy Cole (1993-94), Kevin Phillips (1999-00) and Luis Suárez (2013-14).• West Ham have lost 10 of their 17 Premier League games this season (W3 D4); only in 2002-03, 2006-07 and 2022-23 have they reached 10 losses in fewer games in the competition (all 16th game).OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.West Ham were confined to an approach City often enforce on opponents: playing chase-ball and hoping to prosper from a counterattack. A Lucas Paquetá free-kick intended for Jarrod Bowen was misdirected, so Josko Gvardiol headed back toward Gianluigi Donnarumma, but it drew a clap from the forward for being the right idea.So, too, was Rayan Cherki’s contribution for Reijnders goal. With John Travolta-esque feet he prised the Hammers apart and tapped the ball to Haaland in the area. He did the same to Reijnders a foot away and the Dutchman’s shot bulged the roof of the net.Here was the sort of playmaking from Cherki that has impressed Guardiola of late, following the manager’s mix of praise and criticism earlier in the season.View image in fullscreenWest Ham fans protest against Karren Brady and David Sullivan.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAn easy period for City ended with Guardiola putting his arms between his assistant, Pep Lijnders, and the officials, for who knows what reason. The manager was displeased, too, at the space allowed Mateus Fernandes to shoot from long range as the second half began, though he blazed high.Guardiola’s unit slackening off led to a rollicking for Foden. Cut to Bowen rounding Donnarumma on the left and hitting the side-netting, then rolling wide, seconds after, from the other side, and the manager was vindicated.On 65 minutes, a triple change that reaped an instant dividend. Cherki, González and Reijnders went off for Rico Lewis, Abdukodir Khusanov and Savinho. Done to jolt City, it worked – one more illustration of Guardiola’s cunning.Savinho fed Lewis, who tapped the ball towards Haaland. After a mix-up involving Jean-Clair Todibo and Kyle Walker-Peters, he rifled his second home.Crysencio Summerville forced a Donnarumma save and that was it for West Ham. There was still time for Haaland to narrowly miss a chance for the hat-trick. The contest ended with a third clean sheet in three league matches for City and the Hammers sitting third-bottom on 13 points.“Of course, I’m concerned,” said Nuno. Asked how he would turn things round, he replied: “By insisting, by believing, and by working really hard on the training ground. Everybody has to be committed. The only way I know is to work harder and commit more.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityWest Ham UnitedErling Haalandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was really out of order but I wouldn’t have had as long in this game if I wasn’t sometimes emotional on the pitch, and not a bad bloke off it.“I was very proud of the players and then it got a bit heated. Not every game can we shake hands and smile. I have no problem with their players or fans, this is a very good football club and I have always liked it.

Newcastle have now dropped 13 points from winning positions this season, but their manager blamed the match officials rather than lax defending for this latest setback.With the score 2-1, Trevoh Chalobah’s 54th-minute challenge on Anthony Gordon propelled the Newcastle player into the hoardings, but Madley declined to award a penalty, a decision endorsed by the video assistant referee.João Pedro rescues Chelsea draw as Newcastle squander two-goal leadRead more“It was a clear error and a clear penalty,” said Howe, who is normally reluctant to criticise referees. “Anywhere else on the pitch that is a blatant free-kick. I thought it would be overturned.“The defender only focuses on Anthony. [VAR] said it was shielding. I don’t agree with that. I think the player has gone into Anthony aggressively, too aggressively, so I think it’s a stonewall. The defender’s only looking at Anthony, not the ball. It was the wrong decision.”Howe was “devastated” that Newcastle, who led through two early Nick Woltemade goals, had not won. “It’s difficult because we played so well,” he said. “It was an outstanding performance, especially in the first half. It was a reminder of how good we can be. It’s further evidence that we’re improving.

But overall, a draw is correct.“It’s not easy to come back from 2-0 down here. Not many teams can do that. It’s an important result.

But it was the red card handed to Xavi Simons in the first half, upgraded from a yellow after the VAR had slowed down his late challenge on Virgil van Dijk, that infuriated Frank the most. He cut an animated figure on the touchline as Simons departed, and said later that John Brooks’s original decision should have stood.“I don’t like those types of red card because I think the game is gone if that’s a red card,” he told the BBC soon after the game finished. “I don’t think it’s a reckless tackle. I don’t think it’s exceptional force. We have the referee’s call and that was a yellow, so that’s why I don’t think that’s a red.”View image in fullscreenJohn Brooks sent off Xavi Simons for serious foul play after consulting the pitchside monitor.Photograph: Chris Foxwell/ProSports/ShutterstockLater on, in his press conference, he rowed back slightly on his suggestion the game had gone, saying that statement was “probably too big”. But his annoyance was clear, as was his sense that the three-match ban Simons now faces would be exorbitant. “If it was an intentional or very stupid tackle then it’s one thing,” he said. “I just think it’s too harsh that a tackle like that can be three games.”Angry Eddie Howe claims officials denied Newcastle a ‘stonewall’ penaltyRead moreFrank was also incredulous that VAR did not intervene to rule Hugo Ekitiké had pushed Romero in scoring Liverpool’s ultimately decisive second goal. “A big mistake,” he said. “Two hands in the back from the striker: as far as I know the laws of football you are not allowed to do that. That’s fine to happen on the pitch, the referees are only human but then the VAR bails you out, which they didn’t do.”Romero received a second yellow card after kicking out in a tangle with Ibrahima Konaté and Frank also believed the incident could have been handled more sensibly. “I don’t think it’s a second yellow when you feel the game,” he said.Tottenham sit 13th and have lost 11 times at home in the league in 2025, a club record. Frank, though, saw green shoots in the form of their resilience. “I’m extremely proud of the players and the team,” he said. “I think they gave everything, showed unbelievable mentality and worked very hard on how to deal with setbacks.”ForArne Slot, the satisfaction of seeing Liverpool move level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea was tempered by concern over Alexander Isak’s departure. The Sweden striker came on at half-time but was on the pitch for only 11 eventful minutes, sustaining an injury after being heavily tackled by Micky van de Ven in the process of scoring the opening goal.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak, Liverpool’s record signing, had to be taken off shortly after coming on.Photograph: Visionhaus/Getty Images“I don’t have any news on him but if a player scores, gets injured and doesn’t try to come back on then that’s not usually a good thing,” Slot said. “I can’t say any more than that, it’s my gut feeling, not medical. I haven’t spoken to him about it yet.”The champions are probably out of title contention but have taken 11 points from their last five league games. “It wasn’t perfect, especially in the last 10 minutes, but we’re picking up points,” Slot said. “I think it’s never been as bad as people said but it’s also true that we are definitely not perfect yet.

Bristol, on the other hand, continue to dazzle in the way their hosts have recently struggled to.These two are probably the Premiership teams most renowned for dazzling. Indeed, they both enjoyed 60-point wins last weekend against lacklustre visitors from the deep south-west of France. But only one side brought it to the big, wide stage of Twickenham.Greg Fisilau double edges Exeter to comeback victory at SaracensRead moreMuch has been made of the way Pat Lam has his players making a thousand touches a week in training, but he does seem to be on to something. During Bristol’s utterly dominant first 50 minutes, front-five forwards put each other through gaps as if they were Fijians. One of Bristol’s team actually is, but Kalaveti Ravouvou, though brilliant, was no more light of touch than Ellis Genge or Joe Batley and their mates in the boiler room.We still talk about thePremiership semi-final of 2021, Bristanbul as it is known, so jaw-dropping was the comeback Harlequins summoned from somewhere, 28-0 down after half an hour of unplayable Bristolian genius, yet prevailing in extra-time. It was probably the greatest match in Premiership history, and there were high hopes for this one, but it takes two to tango. Alas, there was only one team here.Quick GuideHarlequins 14-40 Bristol teams and scorersShowHarlequinsDavid; Cleaves (Isgro 52), Beard, Northmore (Waghorn 52), Murley (capt); Smith, Porter (Friday 65); Hobson (Wenger 65), Walker (Riley 65), Williams (Delgado 54), Petti, Treadwell (Launchbury 65), Carr (Evans ht), Kenningham, Cunningham-SouthYellow cardWalker 43TriesIsgro, SmithConsSmtih 2BristolRees-Zammit; Boshoff (Heward 65), Van Rensburg, Williams, Ravouvou (Worsley 71); Jordan, Marmion (Randall 61); Genge (Woolmore 52; Genge 59), Oghre (Thacker 52), Chawatama (Kloska 52), Rubiolo, Batley, Owen (B Grondona 57), S Grondona, Harding (capt)Yellow cardJordan 58, Williams 71TriesRavouvou, Batley, Oghre, Rees-Zammit, S Grondona, GengeConsJordan 4, WilliamsRefereeAnthony WoodthorpeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bristol had their bonus point by half-time again, but no repeat of that extraordinary playoff. How far away such heroics must seem to Harlequins, how far away the form of the champions they went on to become four years ago.“People always talk about Bristanbul and all that,” said Lam. “We’ve worked hard to make sure that doesn’t happen to us again. The type of rugby we played – and on free-to-air TV too – was pleasing. That was something we did talk about. Let’s show young people that if you’re going to watch rugby, this is what it is.”If the difference between good and great rugby is precision, the Bears were the embodiment of that in the first half. Bristol had four visits to the Harlequins 22 in the first half and scored from each. They scored from their fifth visit too, at the start of the second half to open a 33-0 lead.Harlequins were the opposite. They had nearly all the ball in that period and could not score a point, their efforts foundering time and again on a solid Bristol defence and their own loose handling. They spilled passes and balls in the tackle, right, left and centre.View image in fullscreenKalaveti Ravouvou scores Bristol’s first try.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty ImagesBristol scored from their first attack, in the eighth minute. A thing of beauty it was too. Genge put Batley through, Tom Jordan sent a fabulous pass out wide, where Ravouvou finished with power and precision. Batley scored himself early in the second quarter, collecting Ravouvou’s offload for Bristol’s second. Their third came five minutes later, Genge this time putting Gabriel Oghre through a hole to the line. And then it was Ravouvou’s turn again to dazzle with his hands, sending Louis Rees-Zammit, enjoying his first start at full-back, away on the overlap. He chipped Nick David, his opposite number, who didn’t stand a chance, for the bonus-point try.Quick GuidePrem roundup: Hendy double helps Northampton overwhelm SaleShowGeorge Hendy (pictured) scored two tries asNorthamptonproduced an impressive display to defeatSale47-21 at Franklin’s Gardens. The thumping victory was enough to lift Saints up to second in the table, with just points difference separating them and the new leaders, Exeter, after they ran in seven tries, some of which were spectacular.Northampton began with tries from Henry Pollock, Hendy and Toby Thame and after Tom O’Flaherty struck for Sale, Kemeny’s sensational individual score put the hosts 26-7 ahead. Hendy scored his second before O’Flaherty and Arron Reed pulled back tries for the Sharks, with George Furbank and Tom Pearson then rounding things off for Saints.One score stood out for Phil Dowson, Northampton's director of rugby. He said: “Josh Kemeny’s try had me off my seat, I thought it was exceptional and I think the athleticism Josh has is sometimes underestimated. He is very fast, he is very athletic and I think he has been one of our best signings.”Geoff Parling was pleased with how hisLeicesterplayers kept up the pressure againstGloucesteron Friday despite the game being won with something to spare. The Tigers scored seven tries at Welford Road to move level on points with the pre-weekend leaders, Bath, who visit Newcastle tomorrow.A 20-minute red card for the replacement hooker, Charlie Clare, was their only negative, but there were welcome returns from injury for Ollie Chessum and Jack van Poortvliet in a 45-14 win.Parling said: “We did plenty of good stuff and worked hard for each other. I’m really pleased to get not just the outcome, but to see lads still kick balls into the corner late in the second half, lads still working for each other. We were still hustling, we were still trying to get more points.\"Scores by James Thompson and Solomone Kata eased Leicester ahead before a penalty try on the stroke of half-time gave them a 19-0 lead. A comfortable night was completed by second-half tries by Tom Whiteley, Tommy Reffell, Billy Searle and Chessum, with Josh Hathaway and Jack Clement scoring for Gloucester.Gloucester's director of rugby, George Skivington, said: “I didn’t see that coming.

The first one is the first red, which I think ... I’ve seen it given before but I don’t like it. I don’t like those types of red cards because I think the game is gone if that’s a red card. I don’t think it’s a reckless tackle. I don’t think it’s exceptional force. We have the referee call and that was a yellow so that’s why I don’t think that’s a red.“We dealt well with that. The players stayed in the game, defended well, kept going. Then we concede the first goal, and then the second one is a big mistake. Two hands in the back from the striker - as far as I know the laws of football you are not allowed to do that. That’s fine to happen on the pitch, the referees are only human but then the VAR bails you out, which they didn’t do.“We stayed in the game, kept going, scored a very good goal for 2-1 and keep fighting. Then I think the second yellow to Cuti [Romero], you have a little feel of the game. Two big boys fighting, Konate is going through him and his foot lands on his head, no yellow. Then there’s a little movement from Cuti but I don’t think it’s a second yellow when you feel the game. We stayed there and did well in terms of dealing with it.”Share"

I dreamed about this as a boy and now it came true. I’ve survived until Christmas and it’s such a good feeling.”Dobey, the eighth seed, was beaten by an inspired performance from the 55-year-old Andrew Gilding, who averaged 99.01 and hit a 10-dart leg in a 3-1 victory. “How do I feel? Amazing,” said Gilding. “I don’t know what happened. I felt really bad in practice, but that’s usually a good sign.”Chisnall was dumped out by the German Ricardo Pietreczko despite hitting 11 maximums.

I think he wasn’t as he was in the first game on the stage. It’s a great feeling. I didn’t play my best, but nor did he.

Afterwards, the former two-time unified champion was blunt in his assessment of his performance and what should come next.“It wasn’t the best performance,” Joshua said. “The end goal was to get Jake Paul, pin him down and hurt him. That has been the request leading up, and that’s what was on my mind. It took a bit longer than expected, but the right hand finally found the destination.”View image in fullscreenAnthony Joshua lands a ferocious right on Jake Paul.Photograph: Dax Tamargo/ShutterstockJoshua acknowledged Paul’s resilience after a fight in which the American was repeatedly floored but kept rising. “Jake Paul, he’s done really well tonight,” Joshua said. “I want to give him his props. He got up time and time again. It was difficult in there for him, but he kept on trying to find a way. It takes a real man to do that. Anyone who laces up these gloves, we always say we give them our respect. We have to give Jake his respect for trying and trying and trying. Well done.”But Joshua was unequivocal about the hierarchy the fight reinforced. “He came up against a real fighter tonight that’s had a 15-month layoff,” he said. “We shook off the cobwebs, and I can’t wait to roll into 2026.”That forward-looking focus quickly sharpened into a challenge aimed directly at Fury, with whom Joshua has long been linked in talks over a blockbuster heavyweight clash. “IfTyson Furyis as serious as he thinks he is, and he wants to put down his Twitter fingers and put on some gloves and come and fight one of the realest fighters out there that will take on any challenge, step into the ring with me next if you’re a real bad boy,” Joshua said. “Don’t do all that talking: ‘AJ this, AJ that’. Let’s see you in the ring and talk with your fists.”View image in fullscreenAnthony Joshua dropped Jake Paul four times in Friday’s fight.Photograph: JC Ruiz/PAPaul, meanwhile, struck a notably upbeat tone despite the punishment he absorbed and his admission that he had suffered a serious injury. “I’m feeling good. That was fun,” Paul said. “I love this sport. I gave it my all. It’s fucking crazy. I had a blast. Anthony’s a great fighter. I got my ass beat, but that’s what this sport’s about.”Paul revealed during his post-fight comments that he believed his jaw had been broken, after spitting blood during an interview. (He’d latershare an X-ray from hospitalthat showed it broken in two places.) “I think my jaw is broken, by the way,” he said. “It’s definitely broke. A nice little ass-whipping from one of the best to ever do it. I love this shit and I’m going to come back and keep on winning.”View image in fullscreenAnthony Joshua.Photograph: Dax Tamargo/ShutterstockNakisa Bidarian, Paul’s co-founder at Most Valuable Promotions, confirmed at the post-fight press conference the injury was being assessed but played down long-term concerns. “We think he broke his jaw. He’s fine,” Bidarian said. “We met with Netflix afterwards. He took a shower, he drove himself to the hospital. A broken jaw is very common in sports, particularly in boxing and MMA, and I think the recovery time from the doctors and surgeons we already talked to is four to six weeks.”Baumgardner and Dubois win as women’s champions shine on Paul v Joshua undercardRead moreDespite the defeat, Paul framed the night as another step in a longer journey. “Man, I’ve already won in every single way in life,” he said. “My family, my beautiful fiancée [Dutch speedskating star Jutta Leerdam]. This sport has helped me so much in my life. I’m going to come back and get a world championship belt at some point.”For Joshua, however, the message was simpler.

Joshua’s triumph, on a night purpose-built as much for memes as for punches, served as a reminder that boxing still adheres to its elemental laws and that power and pedigree eventually reassert themselves.Anthony Joshua calls out Tyson Fury after sending Jake Paul to hospital with broken jawRead moreFrom the opening bell, the shape of the fight was unmistakable. Joshua took the centre of the ring uncontested while Paul circled him, moving laterally from left to right and back again. The first round was extremely low volume, punctuated by a smattering of boos from the audience. Paul landed a brief double jab to the body before darting back to safety. Joshua threw an overhand right that appeared to glance off a retreating target making full use of the 22ft ring. It was tentative, but Joshua’s control of space earned him the round.The second followed a similar pattern. Joshua swung and missed early as Paul continued to run, using lateral movement to frustrate the bigger man. Joshua began to cut off the ring more effectively, but Paul clinched whenever distance closed, drawing louder boos from the near-capacity crowd. A brief clash of heads halted momentum, and though Joshua hinted at body work, he continued to headhunt. It was a round defined by inertia: Joshua doing little, Paul doing less.By the third, Joshua’s patience began to pay off. Paul briefly stepped into the pocket and attempted an uppercut, catching only leather. Joshua responded by throwing more power shots, narrowly missing but drawing audible gasps from the crowd. Late in the round, a right hand to the ribs appeared to buckle Paul, the first clear sign of damage. Again, Joshua didn’t land much cleanly, but he was the only fighter attempting to win rather than merely survive.The fight deteriorated toward farce in the fourth. Paul went into full retreat as Joshua struggled to corner him, wrapping up at every opportunity. The crowd grew increasingly hostile. Matters continued southward when Paul went down claiming a low blow, prompting a prolonged stoppage by the referee Chris Young that gave him valuable recovery time. It did little to help. Paul went down again, then again, clearly exhausted and buying time. Despite the repeated delays, the referee issued no point deduction, drawing sustained jeers from the stands.By the fifth, the contest had crossed from mismatch into embarrassment. Paul flopped once more before finally being dropped by a clean right hand. He beat the count but looked close to collapsing. A second knockdown followed moments later, again from a right, and Joshua closed the round trapping Paul in the corner and unloading unanswered shots. Somehow Paul survived to the bell, though the proceedings had ceased to resemble a competitive sporting event.The end came early in the sixth. Paul went down almost immediately, dragged himself upright, then fell again under sustained pressure. This time he could not beat the count. Young waved it off at the 1:31 mark, finally ending a bout that had long outlived its threadbare justification.View image in fullscreenAnthony Joshua knocks down Jake Paul during their heavyweight bout at the Kaseya Center.Photograph: JC Ruiz/PAThe bout arrived with the kind of surreal symmetry boxing can’t resist. Miami is where Cassius Clayonce made Sonny Liston quit on his stoolin 1964, an epochal upset that detonated the sport’s assumptions. This was different: a modern spectacle borrowing the old setting but none of the competitive integrity. Paul, 28, went off as an 5-1 longshot thanks to a deluge of late money against a 36-year-old Olympic gold medallist with an 89% knockout rate. The mania surrounding the fight extended to Air Force One, where the US president Donald Trump said he tuned in.“On the plane I just got to watch the Jake Paul Fight, and he did really well, especially as a display of GREAT Courage against a very talented and large Anthony Joshua,” Trumpwrote on Truth Social. “Fantastic Entertainment, but Kudos to Jake for his Stamina, and frankly, Ability, against a much bigger man!”Joshua, returningafter a fifth-round knockout loss to Daniel Duboisin September 2024, treated the bout as both restart and referendum. There has been mounting chatter of a long-awaited Tyson Fury fight next year, and there was talk, too, of Joshua as boxing’s reluctant bouncer: the “real” fighter tasked with ending the interloper’s show. He leaned into it in the buildup, describing the dark reality of the sport and hinting at the violence it can contain. On fight night, he fought with the gravity he promised.“It wasn’t the best performance,” Joshua said. “The end goal was to get Jake Paul, pin him down and hurt him. That’s what was on my mind. It took a bit longer than expected, but the right hand finally found the destination.”That immediate aftermath only underlined what the fight itself made unavoidable. Paul can sell boxing, stage boxing and sustain attention around boxing in ways few modern figures can. The money does talk: Paul and Joshua will each reportedly clear a minimum of $50m (£37.3m) for their efforts. But inside the ring, against a full-sized heavyweight with championship pedigree, the limits of manifested realities were thrown into harsh relief.Explore more on these topicsBoxingAnthony JoshuaUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It’s a search for comfort from yesteryear when things right now are a bit more uncertain.”The Christmas vibe shift: forget beige – the Home Alone look is all the rageRead moreWGSN, a consumer trend forecasting firm, says the 90s Christmas trend indicates a general rising nostalgia for that decade, which also came across during Halloween as an embrace of “tacky decor” pushed at notions of what constitutes good taste.Metcalf says TikTok is “super influential” for Christmas aesthetics across all generations, with online influencers having greater sway over festive aesthetics than they do over interior decor trends across the rest of the year, which tend to be the province of design professionals.“These Christmas trends are for things people have seen and experienced before,” Metcalf adds. “It’s appealing to personal histories and our sense of emotion, a bit of relief from trying to get the newest, most interesting interior design idea.”View image in fullscreenA Christmas tree outside the Ralph Lauren store in New Bond Street, London.Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/ShutterstockEven more popular than the 90s take this year is Ralph Lauren Christmas, riffing on theAmerican designer’s signature lookswith deep colours, rich wooden panelling and green tartan prints.

Describing the trend as “cross-generational nostalgia”, WGSM says it is manifesting itself in looks like cosy knits, windowsill candles and bannister garlands.“Explorations of these classic looks are gaining strength even among younger consumers,” says Cassandra Gagnon, a WGSN strategist.If the late 20th century isn’t distant enough as we peer through the retro tinsel from our 2025 vantage point, then WGSN also reports interest in “opulent antiquity”, including velvet Christmas stockings andtree skirts.

I know that may seem like a silly question to ask when women’s rights are declining around the world thanks torightwing authoritarian politics, but trust me, OK? The problems with feminism are what we really need to be focusing on right now.Or rather, don’t trust me. Trust the millennial media mogul Bari Weiss (and Bank of America). Starting in 2026, CBS News and Weiss’s media startup, the Free Press, are kicking off a debate series called Things That Matter, looking at questions like ‘Has feminism failed women?’, ‘Does America need God?’ and ‘Should gen Z believe in the American Dream?’ All of which issponsoredby the Bank of America.Weiss is positioning Things That Matter as a way to bring together polarized America and get people talking about important issues. Zoom out, however, and this new series looks rather more like a vehicle to amplify the Things That Matter to Donald Trump’s Billionaire Friends, and Bari Weiss.As you may have noticed, rightwing Trump allies are rapidlytaking over the US media ecosystemand reshaping it to reflect the Maga worldview. Earlier this year, for example, CBS’s owner, Paramount reached a$16m settlement with Trumpover an interview on 60 Minutes and axed Stephen Colbert’s Late Show. Many commentators saw these moves as a way to butter up Trump before a potential $8bn Paramount sale to Hollywood studio Skydance Media, owned by David Ellison. Lo and behold, the mega-merger went ahead and the centi-billionaire Larry Ellison, and his son David, became two of the mostinfluential people inmedia. Daddy Ellison is also one of the most powerful people in Washington; the Trump donor has been described by Wired as a “shadow president”.The Ellisons have been busy. In October, Paramountbought Weiss’s the Free Pressfor $150m and installed Weiss as CBS News editor-in-chief. It’s not her editorial experience that seems to have landed her the role; rather, it’s her pro-Israel views and obsession with criticizing “wokeness” andprogressive causes: the Financial Timesreported in Octoberthat David Ellison courted Weiss for months “as part of an effort to reset CBS’s editorial direction” and “Weiss’s vocally pro-Israel stance was among the factors that appealed to Ellison.”Weiss isn’t content with just staying behind the scenes at CBS News. Last Saturday, she appeared on camera for a massively hyped town hall with Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk. It was a very weird piece of content for a supposedly objective news channel: Kirk talked about the importance of “God’s word” a lot, in what the New Republic described as a “sermon on Christian Zionism”. Numerous media commentators were concerned about how heavily the softball interview leaned into a religious framework, leading some to question whetherthis was advocacyor journalism.Whatever it was meant to be, the town hall was aratings flop, drawing 1.9 million viewers, according to Nielsen data. That’s an 11% decline for the year-to-date average for the 8pm EST time slot and a 41% decline in the key 25-54 demographic. Big advertisersalso stayed awayand airtime was bought by companies like the dietary supplement SuperBeets.The great thing about data, however, is that you can often find a way to get it to tell the story you want. In apress release, CBS said that the town hall broadcast outpaced the network’s season-to-date performance in the time slot by 32% in total viewership and 19% in the key demo. CBS clearly thinks the snooze-fest was successful enough to replicate, anyway, because the conversation with Erika Kirk was positioned in the first part of the Things That Matter series. According to promotional material for the new series, we’re now going to be treated to exciting guests like JD Vance (whom Erika Kirkendorsedfor president in 2028 on Thursday night) and Ross Douthat (the conservative columnist who recently asked if liberal feminismruinedthe workplace.)I can’t imagine any of these town halls becoming ratings bonanzas but it doesn’t really matter. If the Ellisons aren’t happy with the way CBS is going, they have plenty of other ways of reaching Americans. “The Ellison family is cornering the market on attention and data the same way the Vanderbilts did railroads and the Rockefellers did oil,” Wirednoted ina September piece. That market now includes TikTok; on Friday the social media app signed a deal to hand control of a portion of its US business to a group including the software giant Oracle, founded by Larry Ellison. The Guardian reportsthat Oracle“will license a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm as part of the deal, in a partnership that will expand on Oracle’s existing management of TikTok’s trove of data collected about its US users.”I’m sure I don’t need to spell out why Ellison has been so keen on acquiring TikTok. “Think of TikTok as video data – unstructured data that fits into another slice of that Oracle matrix,” a former Oracle executive told the New York Timesearlier this year. “Whoever has the data has the power.”Now if Weiss conducted a town hall about that, instead of all the problems with feminism, I’d tune in! I’m fairly sure that the ultra-richaround the worldusingmedia ownershipfor political ends counts as a Thing That Matters.US funding cuts have caused 1,394 family planning clinics to shut down.Millions of people have been leftwithout access to contraceptives or care as part of a “radical shift towards conservative ideologies that deliberately block human rights”, according to the International Planned Parenthood Federation. But make sure you tune into CBS to hear if feminism is bad for women!Texas is collecting a list of transgender people who request gender marker changesThe state has created a list of more than100 trans peoplewithout explainingwhy it’s collectingthis data. And that’s not all Texas is doing: the state attorney general, Ken Paxton, is encouraging the public tohelp enforce the state’s“bathroom bill” via a tip line for suspected violations of the new law, which restricts which toilets transgender people can use.Elon Musk tweeted about Sydney Sweeney’s breastsThe tech billionairecontinuesto be one of the creepiest people on Earth.Ultra-conservative José Antonio Kast elected Chile’s next presidentHe’s the son of a Nazi party member,opposes abortionand same-sex marriage, and wants to deport undocumented migrants.Brigitte Macron faces lawsuit after being filmed using sexist slurThe French first lady was documented calling feminist protesters at a theatre show in Paris “sales connes” – which roughly translates to “stupid bitches”.

The network is one of the outlets where you can find reality-based and largely dependable reporting – especially in breaking news situations like the one that wasdevelopingnear a New Hampshire storage facility.ButCNN, now 45 years old, is in a precarious situation as two huge media conglomerates vie for ownership of its parent company, Warner Bros Discovery.Whatever the outcome, the fate of CNN has become part of a high-stakes game of corporate ownership, not as a question of what benefits the information-seeking public.America’s media system isn’t set up for that lofty goal. It’s set up for corporate profitability, for shareholder gain, for ever-increasing size and ever-decreasing competition.It’s time to accept that the US supreme court is illegitimate and must be replaced | Ryan Doerfler and Samuel MoynRead more“This is yet another example of the deep structural problems with roots in decades of policy decisions,” said Victor Pickard, author ofDemocracy Without Journalism?and a University of Pennsylvania media policy professor.The speculation about who will own Warner Bros Discovery – will it beNetflixorParamount Skydance? – misses a larger point.“It gets presented as a business story with powerful individuals as the protagonists, but there is very little discussion of the public interest,” Pickard said. He, along with two other scholars, is the author of a sweepingnew Roosevelt Institute reportabout media consolidation and its dire effects, addressing how we got here and pointing a better way forward.The CNN scenario is complicated byDonald Trump’s views about a network he has long portrayed as perhaps his primary “fake news”antagonist. Recallthechantsof “CNN sucks!” at the president’s rallies, or his administration’s punitivewithdrawalof Jim Acosta’s press credentials, or hissparringwith Collins in press briefings.Trump now says thatCNN needs new ownership. You can read that as ownership that will protect him from criticism and scrutiny. That is part of why he seems to come down on the side of Paramount Skydance, which has madea hostile bidintended to overcome an earlier accepted deal by Netflix. The Warner Brothers Discoveryboard rejectedthe Paramount bid this week, but there are still plenty of regulatory battles ahead, and the Trump administration may well involve itself.Trump has reason to like that suitor more. For one thing, it is controlled by David Ellison, son of the Trump-friendlyLarry Ellison, one of the world’s richest people.Paramount, parent of CBS News, also recently installed the right-leaningBari Weiss, known for her “anti-woke” beliefs, as the top editor of that storied news network. Trump haspraised Weiss publicly,and as an example of her news judgment, she recentlyconducteda “town hall” interview with Erika Kirk, the widow of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk.Notably, ifNetflixprevails, CNN and other cable outlets would first be spun off into a separate entity, and they would not be part of the Warner Bros Discovery acquisition. That would be a relief to many at the network, but it’s hardly a safe harbor. That arrangement could set up CNN and the others for another sale. It never ends.If you ask Timothy Wu, much of this is illegal, anyway. The prominent critic of big tech’s dominance of major media platforms wrote recently that anti-trust laws should prohibit both deals.“Either merger would be bad for the country, and both should be challenged by anti-trust authorities,” Wu recentlywrotein the New York Times.Trump’s crackdown on factchecker visas won’t protect free speech | Margaret SullivanRead moreWhatever happens in this situation, the bigger problem remains. And Pickard, for one, is not ready to throw up his hands and say nothing can be done to reverse what has happened.“What we have now is a very anti-democratic system, but we shouldn’t give in to learned helplessness,” he said. Policy decisions – dating back to the 1930s and 1940s in the heyday of radio – helped to create this hyper-commercialized monster, and new policy decisions can address it.Will that happen in the Trump era in which Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carrwon’t even affirmthat the agency is independent? Reform is very unlikely now, but that doesn’t mean it will never happen – or that it should be regarded as impossible.Policies that strengthen independent news organizations, bolster local journalism, fund public media, and prohibit the concentration of media power in too few hands are not only possible – they are necessary for a functioning democracy.In the world of media ownership, bigger isn’t better. And news organizations including CNN shouldn’t be pawns in the latest merger game.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsCNNOpinionTelevision industryTV newsUS television industryNetflixNews agenciesNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

It has always returned from its darkest daysBrigid DelaneyBondi has long been a stage for some of Australia’s best – and worst – moments. As it continues to reel from the Hanukah mass shooting, it’ll always be a place for everyoneSat 20 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 20 Dec 2025 14.02 ESTShareBondi exerts a strange gravitational force on the city ofSydney, disproportionate to its 1.2 sq km crescent of sand. It’s a brand name. It’s a dream. It’s a pilgrimage. It’s a church. It’s the gym. It’s a community. It’s a gateway. It’s a baptism. For international tourists coming in, it’s the name they know, where they take off their shoes, walk down to the water and take their first swim in Australian waters.And how about that swim? After the discomfort of a long-haul flight, to take your weary body down to Bondi and jump into the glistening surf, then dry out in the sun while drinking a flat white is to have arrived in Australia not just physically, but also spiritually.There are better beaches in Sydney, but none have the charisma of Bondi, the whole “Take me, I’m yours!” swagger.The aftermath of the Bondi terror attack is not a time to blame, politicise or dilute democracy | David HeilpernRead morePart of its alchemy is that the beach never looks, or even feels, the same. It’s constantly changing depending on the light, the tides, the seasons, the weather.Golden hour is my favourite time down at Bondi, when the sun hits Ben Buckler Point and the cliffs briefly glow a deep buttery yellow. To be in the water then, up the north side, becoming part of the golden hour tableau is to enter, however momentary, a state of grace.View image in fullscreen‘[Bondi beach is] constantly changing depending on the light, the tides, the seasons, the weather.’Photograph: Audrey Richardson/Getty ImagesThe other part of the magic is the people. Come down to Bondi any day of the week and you will see just about every type of person imaginable.Busloads of tourists by the Bondi Pavilion, new and very tired parents at the playground, off-duty models at the north end, surfers at the south end, elderly dawn swimmers, Orthodox Jews, the muscle crowd at the jungle gym near the surf club, the fit jogging, and those trying to get fit.The suburb’s housing prices are increasingly homogenising the suburb and making it a place of extreme wealth, but down at the beach, none of it matters and everyone is welcome.I remember telling a friend visiting from Melbourne and feeling body-conscious among all the strutting bronzed models, “Don’t worry – it’s Bondi, no one is looking at you, they’re all just looking at themselves.”And it’s true. It’s full of the vain and the beautiful, and the rest of us, all sharing the great freedom of Bondi – “You do you.” No judgment.View image in fullscreenShoes are placed along the promenade on Thursday at Bondi beach to memorialise the victims of the mass shooting that took place at a Hanukah celebration on Sunday.Photograph: Audrey Richardson/Getty ImagesOn Monday night, I was in an Uber heading back to Bondi. My driver had been there when the shooting started and was shaken. He wondered if there’d be race riots at the beach like there had been20 years ago in Cronulla.I bet against it. The Cronulla riots were, in part, about turf and race. Locals versus outsiders, white versus brown.But Bondi is so much more porous than that. You can claim it as your own if you’ve been a backpacker staying up the road for a day, or someone who grew up in the back streets of North Bondi.As part of the area’s stable population, Jewish life has thrived in Bondi, with aroundtwo-thirds of Sydney’s Jewish populationliving in the eastern suburbs.Beachside hedonism and international tourism has long coexisted with observant Jewish life and the Jewish schools, synagogues and cultural facilities that make Bondi a hub for religious expression.View image in fullscreenA Star of David is seen at a makeshift memorial to the victims of the Bondi terror attack.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/EPAPart of Bondi’s charisma is that somehow it all works – and there’s room for everyone.Since the mass shooting on Sunday, there have been a few pieces published saying things won’t be the same in Australia again. While politics and questions about policing, immigration and weapons will dominate the news agenda for months to come, there is something curiously impervious aboutBondi beach.There’s Indigenous rock art at Ben Buckler that’s thousands of years old. Discoveries of shell middens and stone tools mark it as a gathering place since ancient times. It’s forever been a theatre, a stage for some of our best days, and some of our worst.Police shot mentally ill French photographer Roni Levi on the beach in June 1997 in a dramatic and controversial standoff that changed policing in this state.And on the south side in Marks Park,gay men were hunted and killed in the 1980s and 90s, their bodies thrown off cliffs.View image in fullscreenBondi beach lies empty on 22 April 2020 as part of Australia’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesMore recently, I remember in the dark days of Sydney’s coronavirus lockdown, seeing the beach empty, except for people walking around in full PPE – working in the area behind the Pavilion that had been turned into a mobile Covid testing facility – and thinking things won’t be the same.But Bondi comes back. It always comes back. We just can’t stay away.View image in fullscreenSwimmers embrace before heading into the ocean on Wednesday to commemorate those who died in the Bondi beach terror attack.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianBrigid Delaney is the author of the philosophical novel The Seeker and the Sage (Allen and Unwin), out nowExplore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackOpinionBondi beachSydneyAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

It is a sword that fell on the necks of two sets of Australians. Yet again, young Australian Jews will be asking parents why they are hated, and that is heartbreaking. In a different sense, so will young Muslims.During their apparent sojourn in a Campsie B&B, the alleged terrorists could not have been confident of their own survival, but they must have been confident in producing a reaction. It is a matter of civic pride that a Muslim man accosted one of the gunmen and took a weapon from him; a matter of a small yelp of praise and gratitude amid the cruelty.In all this, there is a tendency to decide politicians are to blame. But the truth is that in cases of such egregious savagery as this, our democracy feels inadequate – that’s why the events are so scary. And there are good grounds to wonder why the father had so many legal firearms to call on. Yes, that should have rung a preventive bell. The reasonable Australian equation is that we can march for a general cause, we can argue for it, but we cannot physically punish those who oppose us.The immediate shock and terror of the Bondi shooting is giving way to anger and division. We must look for the light | Paul DaleyRead moreNetanyahu, a man of politics I cannot agree with, blames the PM for backing a two-state solution. But when has a one-state solution ever worked, except by obliteration or disappearance of the second group? I find it hard to believe that two-state appeasement motivated the killers one way or another, and if I am wrong, then I apologise. We trip ourselves up in these situations. Events like Bondi are designed to do that. Pluralism does not countenance or condone spilled blood; it is far more along the lines of what Syrian Muslim Ahmed al Ahmed did in disarming one of the shooters for a time.By the way, wasn’t it sinisterly interesting that one of the alleged shooters appeared to signal some people away, as if saying that he did not want to kill non-Jews? This was just another dubious and sinister aspect of the attack. Among the people killed was a former cop with an Irish name, Meagher. For the truth is, none of us can be fully shielded once terror speaks. We have to trust our neighbours. There is no peace by setting one group of society against another.The aftermath of the Bondi terror attack is not a time to blame, politicise or dilute democracy | David HeilpernRead moreSo, if the desperate opposition stoops low enough, they will now masquerade as the best hope of the Jewish community. But it will also be the grossest form of opportunism, for the awful truth is that the very multiplicity of our causes means we would prefer a society where police are not armed with rifles at every event of joy and camaraderie. That is the unspeakable irony.Attacks such as these are designed to shut up debate; to drive one side to a rancour, and serve to make government more radical, while encouraging acts of radicalism from one’s own side so that the cauldron boils over, stoked from every side.At the end of the day, would more police have been a remedy on the terrible evening? If a relative of mine had been threatened, I might say yes. Terror begs these questions as it does of so much of what we do. But after experiencing that extra protection, I might find them an excessive presence.Thomas Keneally is a novelist.

No, it’s not just a biting crossword clue for “millennial”: they have all previouslybeen crownedword of the year. Admittedly, there are now so many “words of the year” that, if they were physical objects, they could make a decent-sized museum collection. Which, as it happens, is exactly how I like to imagine them – artefacts of their time, telling a story of a changing society.This year’s winners – from “parasocial” (Cambridge Dictionary’s choice) to “rage bait” (Oxford English Dictionary), “67 (six-seven)” (Dictionary.com) and “slop” (Merriam-Webster) – will join the group, though where in the “museum” remains to be seen. Will they sit in the permanent collection, along with 2005’s “podcast” and 2015’s “binge-watch”? Or the archive, where irrelevances such as 2007’s “w00t” are packed off to, to see out their days alongside David Cameron’s lesser-remembered very bad idea: not Brexit (Collins, 2016), but “big society” (Oxford, 2010).Play curator with me, and let’s take a tour.To look back at the winning words from the past 20 years is to look back at life through rose-tinted glasses. Seriously, people bang on about the hope and optimism of the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, but how about a 2006 Britain seemingly so untroubled that its Oxford word of the year was “bovvered”? Or a country where, in contrast to 2024’s shared cultural experience of “enshittification”, it was “sudoku” (Oxford, 2005)? Were these times really much simpler – sorry, “simples” (a 2009 winner)? Surely not, given some words feel like prophecy. Indeed, when in 2009 I graduated into a recession, blissfully unaware of how it would define my generation, I’d have done well to have registered 2008’s “credit crunch” and “bailout”. Still, earlier winners feel almost innocent: Merriam-Webster’s 2013 “science” (that’s right, no particular field, just science) or Dictionary.com’s “change” (2010). See also: “youthquake” (Oxford, 2017), “occupy” (American Dialect Society,2011) and “feminism” (Merriam-Webster, 2017). These words speak to a hunger for progress, even as darker terms such as “fake news” (Collins, 2017) or “post-truth” (Oxford, 2016) emerged.But it’s 2018 where it gets really bleak. Words that would suit an apocalyptic horseman dominate (“climate emergency”, “permacrisis”, “toxic”, “gaslighting”, “polarisation”), before giving way to the language of fleeting tech crazes (“NFT”, “homer”) and variations on the theme of ennui (“quiet quitting”, “existential”). Which I suppose will at least give future visitors to the museum an understanding of not only what burned Rome, but the soundtrack coming from the metaphorical fiddle (Charli xcx, duh: “brat” was Collins’ winner last year).As for this year’s words, many fit right in. “Rage bait” surely belongs in the central gallery, given it’s a now-permanent fixture of online life, and a neat summary of how algorithms reward emotional manipulation. Meanwhile, I only hope “slop” – the grim churn of mind-numbing AI video – goes the way of “metaverse”(Oxford runner-up, 2021) as another bit of overhyped ephemera, quietly scrubbed from our lives once we all realise how rubbish it is. To the basement with thee!What about “parasocial”, this year’sdarkest winner? It may need a room of its own. It gained relevance amid stories of users bonding with AI and peak fan moments such as Taylor Swift’s engagement dominating the internet. Personally, it is not the “fan” element that gives me the chills, but rather how parasocial is replacing real human connection, as we continue to retreat from lives lived with one another to something far lonelier.Which brings me to “six-seven”. Where to place a “word” such as that? Dictionary.com’s 2025 choice, it’s the first ever word of the year that is near-exclusively used by teenagers. Meaning “so-so” but mainly deployed at random to annoy adults, it is a joke without a punchline. So there’s only one place for it: the Mona Lisa spot.Hear me out. You see, there’s one other trend that has emerged from word of the year recently, and it’s one I can get behind: the fun words. “Goblin mode”, a term for slobbing out (Oxford, 2022)? A truly poetic self-effacement. How about “rizz” (2023)? One could argue it shouldn’t be included given it’s just an abbreviation of another word (charisma), but what could be morenowthan a word that works quickly, flexibly (“rizz” is also a verb, dontcha know) and I’m sure from home too, if it could.Some might regard this slang as “brain rot” (Oxford, 2024). But humour is precious. It’s human, even if distilled through tech. And crucially, it’s full of potential. Because if you can share a joke, you can truly connect. And if you can connect, you can rebuild.And so we return to “six-seven”. How does this sound for its exhibition placard? “This form of ‘anti-humour’, though it appears senseless and even nihilistic, is in fact a piece of guerilla performance art exposing the meaninglessness of our times.” OK, OK, maybe I’ve taken this curator thing a bit too far. Because it’s actually quite simple: saying “six-seven” at random is just a very, very teenage thing to do. And that is great.I say this as someone who was at school during the height of the Budweiser advert frenzy, in which schoolkids would burst into “wassupppp” at quite literally any time. Yes, it was random – that was the point, as was the fact no one else was laughing bar the perpetrator and their friends. With “six-seven”, we see the hallmarks of this same daft, kind of annoying and quintessentially teenage energy. It may be internet slang, but its power is in real life – forging social bonds with other teens, and creating a shared identity. And given everything we hear about teens being worryingly self-conscious, lacking friendship and paralysed by anxiety, this harmless bit of fun heartens me. Maybe the kids really are alright. Could it be the most hopeful word of 2025? The one that symbolised the beginning of something beautiful again, a triumph of human nature as we start to rebuild a new world? We shall see. For now, we shall consider it on display, pending further review.Coco Khan is a freelance writer and co-host of the politics podcast Pod Save the UKExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionLinguisticscommentShareReuse this content"

The residents of the housing estates surrounding Battersea power station in London, including the Patmore where I was raised, faced that prospect when, in 2012, a consortium ofMalaysian investorsbought the derelict power station, decommissioned since 1983, for £400m.Two years earlier, David Cameron had launched the Conservative manifesto in the ruined power station. He promised to increase foreign investment into the UK, and so the international investors came and bought the thing and much more. Over the years, Battersea and the adjacent Nine Elms area was refashioned as a playground for oligarchs and other international elites. The US embassy arrived, aworld-first glass sky poolwas commissioned, and whenBattersea power stationshopping centre opened in 2022, it came with Rolex and Cartier stores, luxury private members’ clubs and apartments with multimillion-pound price tags.The whole assembly looks like a Dubai waterfront, and forlong-term localsa fear emerged of being forcibly displaced as occurred inElephant and CastleandStratford. In these areas of London, regeneration had become a byword for the social cleansing of working-class communities and their replacement by affluent residents.Yet a quiet victory has occurred that shows how communities can bargain with developers. Last month, Battersea power stationannouncedthat it would be working in partnership with Wandsworth council to build 203 council homes as part of the development’s 17-hectare (42-acre) master plan.This win is a genuinely radical vision of what local government can achieve. And it matters because it is a radical assertion that mixed-income communities should continue to exist, and be actively facilitated, in the centre of London. Mixed communities have increasingly come under attack as ire against the housing crisis is directed at social housing tenants occupying central London locations, particularly if the household is born overseas. As Henry Hillwrote in UnHerd: “Even without the immigration angle, it was only a matter of time before voters noticed that broad swathes of central London and other prime locations are currently used to house others at taxpayers’ expense.”This is a particularly personal grievance for me. I grew up in this patch of Battersea when it was seen as a relic of industrial decline, a sad and neglected avatar of inner-city roughness. Yet now that it’s been put on the map, neoliberals and cynics of state support would have it that these communities and families should uproot their foundations to make way for those with deeper pockets.It is worth considering how Wandsworth council fought back against this tide. In 2017, the then Conservative-run council approved areductionin the provision of “affordable” homes to be built on the site from its own 33% target at the time of the 2010 planning application to only 9%.View image in fullscreenShae Clarke, left, of Patmore youth group, with the council development team. Aydin Dikerdem, cabinet member for housing, is in the centre.In 2022, Labour ended the 44-year Conservative-majority control of Wandsworth. With this came the appointment of the socialist councillor Aydin Dikerdem. “As a local representative, I thought the local government should be acting almost like a trade unionist on behalf of the residents,” Dikerdem tells me. Developers went from playing on easy mode with neoliberal conservatives to having to wrangle with municipal socialism. Shunning champagne and freebies, Wandsworth Labour councillors controversiallyboycotted the Battersea power station launchover the low levels of social housing.The council housing agreement was won after robust negotiations, aided by the Greater London authority, which included the council ending all collaborations until the housing question was addressed. Eventually a deal was brokered, because even if the primary pursuit is profit, developers still want to be seen to be building and facilitating “a vibrant and friendly community”, as is said in one of thebrochures.The neighbouring Embassy Gardens in Nine Elms, with itssky pool and “poor doors”, had already been viewed as an almost dystopian symbol of the UK’s grossest inequalities and prioritisation of global elites, and example of how not to do a local development.Community simply cannot exist without the presence of existing long-term residents. I am reminded of that whenever I pass the roadside memorial for Patmore estate legend and footballing talent Theo Porteous, who wasstabbed to death in 2023in an unprovoked and senseless attack by a man not from the area. When he died, my entire estate poured out to pay tribute, light candles and lay flowers. There was a strong sense that the community had lost someone precious. It was an expression of familiarity and local love that is built up over years and generations, and cannot be replicated by brownfield developments.A leaked memo, a Maga-style hat and a trail of broken pledges – it’s Labour’s great housing betrayal | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreThe council’s efforts go further than the power station. This year, it has built 57 new council homes for rent on the Patmore, an estate not far from the power station. There are also new outdoor play spaces, including a multi-games area named in honour of Theo. It has been beautiful seeing new families and children move to the estate and have a better start in life, as had been the case for mine 27 years ago.I hope that future residents of the power station development will be able to enjoy their new homes, playground and all the other amenities that will surely come. If you have lived in an area all your life, through its roughest periods, why should you not feel the benefits when development turns up at your door?I wish this could be rolled out across London, but the unilateralslashing of affordable housing quotasfrom 35% to 20% in the capital proposed by the housing secretary, Steve Reed, could scupper any future wins for local councils. The policy has been proposed as a way to get shovels in the ground and stimulate the economy. However, this is short-termist. As Dikerdem tells me, “when the market slows down (as the housing market has) and building costs go up and developers are struggling, it’s precisely the moment when the state should step in”. That could allow local government to stimulate housing demand, provide workers and cover construction costs, so long as certain social obligations are met or increased.If government could take a leaf out of Wandsworth’s book and stand up to developers, rather than rolling out the red carpet, then perhaps local communities would be all the richer for it.Jason Okundaye is an assistant opinion editor at the Guardian and the author ofRevolutionary ActsExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionHousingLocal governmentLondonSteve ReedLabourCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

Ask the meat lobbyGeorge MonbiotEuropean legislators may ban plant-based products from using the name to prevent ‘confusion’. Just don’t mention beef tomatoes or buffalo wingsSat 20 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 20 Dec 2025 12.45 ESTShareMost of what you eat is sausages. I mean, if we’re going to get literal about it. Sausage derives from the Latinsalsicus, which means “seasoned with salt”. You might think of a sausage as a simple thing, but on this reading it is everything and nothing, a Borgesian meta-concept that retreats as you approach it.From another perspective, a sausage is an offal-filled intestine, or the macerated parts of an electrocuted or asphyxiated pig or other animal – generally parts that you wouldn’t knowingly eat – mixed with other ingredients that, in isolation, you might consider inedible. For some reason, it is seldom marketed as such.But to the legislators of the EU, a sausage can now have only one meaning: a cylindrical objectcontaining meat. Never mind that cylindrical objects containing no meat have been marketed under names such as “Glamorgan sausage” (selsig Morgannwg) for at least 150 years. Never mind that even Germans once felt the need to call animal sausagesmettwurst, to distinguish them from other kinds. Never mind that almost everyone knows what “veggie sausage”, “vegan sausage” or “plant-based sausage” mean. Arecent surveyof 20,000 Dutch people found that 96% are not confused by such terms, which is probably a higher percentage than those who can readily distinguish left from right. The consumer must at all costs be protected from an imaginary threat.For the same reason, members of the European parliament decided,burgers must also contain meat. It happens that no one is sure why a burger is called a burger. They were once called “Hamburg steaks”, but no clear link to Hamburg has been established.Nevertheless, before the term was abbreviated, meat patties were widely known as hamburgers, whose literal meaning is an inhabitant of Hamburg. If “veggie burgers” are misleadingly marketed, so is any burger not made from the minced inhabitants of a north German city.Last week, the European Council and European Commissiontried and failedto make sense of all this. They were unable to agree a common position with the European parliament, and bumped the decision to January, when a new council presidency will have to deal with it. I can’t blame them. You cannot make sense of a senseless policy.The parliament’s food literalism is remarkably selective. Given the time of year, perhaps I should point out that there is no meat in mincemeat, which is used to fill mince pies. Many years ago there was, but the meat component fell out of fashion. Minced meat, by contrast,ismeat – I’m sure that’s not confusing. Similarly, sweetbreads are meat, but sweetmeats are not. None of these terms appear to cause any problems for legislators, though they have insisted that the onlypermissible definitionof meat is “edible parts of the animals referred to in points 1.2 to 1.8 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004”, which is, let’s face it, how it’s commonly understood by shoppers across the EU.If a vegetarian hotdog is to be ruled out, as the parliamentarians demand, on the grounds that it contains no meat, the meat version should be ruled out on the grounds that it contains no dog (hothorse should in some cases be permissible). They might also be shocked to discover that there is no beef in beef tomatoes, butterfly in butterfly cakes, cottage in cottage pie, baby in jelly babies or finger (mostly) in chocolate fingers. And don’t get me started on buffalo wings.All this must be deeply confusing to shoppers. Like Wednesday Addams, who, whenoffered girl scout cookies, asked whether they contain real girl scouts, we puzzle every day over what such names really mean. Human beings are entirely incapable of pattern recognition, derived and secondary meanings, metaphor or conceptualisation. Language never evolves, and nor does food. This is why, when confronted with “pigs in blankets”, “toad in the hole” or “spotted dick”, people curl up on the floor, banging their heads and moaning weakly (OK, there might be other reasons). Everything can have only one meaning, and this meaning must be what legislators say it is.If you are thinking “benefit of Brexit”, I’m sorry to disabuse you. If the European Council and Commission eventually decide that terms such as veggie burgers and vegan sausages are to be banned in the EU, they arelikely to be banned in the UKas well, for fear of jeopardising trade agreements. Already, after acourt interpretationof a previous European decision, terms such as oat milk, soy butter and vegan cheese areprohibited on UK labels, but not – because consistency is for suckers – coconut milk or peanut butter.View image in fullscreen‘From another perspective, a sausage is an offal-filled intestine.’Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesSo what explains the selectivity?Lobbying. The decision in the European parliament is a response topressure from the meat and dairy industries, which have long been seeking tostamp out competition. It has no more to do with preventing confusion than aRocky Mountain oysterhas to do with a marine bivalve. It’s about protectionism. This is why peanut butter and coconut milk are still legal: they seldom compete directly with animal products.‘Veggie burgers’ could be off EU menu as MEPs back renaming plant-based foodsRead moreThese anti-competitive practices have a long history. In the 19th century, the US dairy industry managed first to get margarine declared a “harmful drug”, then had its sale restricted under the 1886 Oleomargarine Act. It’s reassuring to know that legislators made just as good use of their time then as they do now.The livestock lobby isimmensely powerful. Its campaigns are reinforced by rightwing influencers, whowage waragainst a wide variety of plant products (vegetable oil, soya, almonds, avocados,any plant-based meat substitute), often on entirely spurious health or environmental grounds, while conveniently ignoring the far greaterimpacts of animal productsonhuman bodiesandthe living planet.The food industry knows that words are a powerful weapon. If Moses had promised the Israelites a land of mammary secretions and insect vomit, I doubt many would have followed him to Canaan, though these are accurate descriptions of milk and honey. It knows that if plant-based foods have to be marketed under alien and alienating names, this will depress their market share.The livestock lobby seeks to normalise and naturalise the cruel, grotesque, planet-wrecking realities of its industry, while casting plant-based foods as unnatural and wrong. As usual, it has made minced meat of European legislators.

Now the speculation has been put to bed, with Chalamet jumping on an unexpected remix of EsDeeKid’s track 4 Raws.Chalamet posted a clip of a video for the track to his social media, rapping alongside EsDeeKid in a series of scenes, from a cramped kitchen to a housing estate.“Got model bitches in Peckham / I’m Ryan Reynolds in Wrexham,” Chalamet raps in lyrics designed to court a UK fanbase before the Boxing Day release of his new movie, Marty Supreme, which also gets numerous shoutouts.He also makes reference to his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, with the lyrics: “It’sTimothée Chalametchilling, trying to stack 100 million, girl got a billion,” before adding: “I’m having fun, just sexting / my dick is young and restless.”He continues: “My life is an opera, look at the Oscars / look at the groupies, look at the movies / look at the triple-A girl gon’ choose me / look at my haters man they want to sue me,” rapping quickly over the song’s distorted beat, with the track being shared tens of thousands of times in just a few hours of being posted.pic.twitter.com/c6c5pSzGgR— Timothée Chalamet (@RealChalamet)December 19, 2025If a full version of the track were released, it would likely send 4 Raws back up the UK charts. The track rose as high as No 27 before being overtaken by Christmas songs, but it’s only one hit track from EsDeeKid, who has gone from relative unknown to the UK’s most popular rapper in just a few months.His track Century broke into the top 10, while his album Rebel was the most-streamed rap album in the world on Spotify in November, and is still in the top 20.‘Constant stimulation, dopamine overload’: how EsDeeKid and UK underground rap exploded on a global scaleRead moreHe has never given an interview and keeps his face hidden from the public, aside from the occasional glimpse of his eyes, leading to speculation that he was actually Chalamet in disguise. Asked by BBC Radio One DJ Greg James earlier this month about the supposed connection, Chalamet replied: “All will be revealed in due time.”Chalamet performed his versions of Bob Dylan songs for biopic A Complete Unknown, for which he was Oscar-nominated. He also says he is an admirer of the UK underground rap scene, this week naming rapper Fakemink alongside Susan Boyle as the Britons he admires the most.Chalamet is tipped for a potential Oscar win for Marty Supreme, after losing this year to Adrien Brody’s turn in The Brutalist.The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw wrote ina five-star review of Marty Supreme: “By the end of this movie my head was oscillating from side to side as if it had been hit with cymbals.” It was voted thefifth best film of the yearby Guardian critics before even going on release.This article was updated on 20 December to correct a lyric.Explore more on these topicsTimothée ChalametRapnewsShareReuse this content"

There are reports that she is in advanced talks to host her own chatshow.At least there’s one thing we can all agree on: three cheers for Claudia Winkleman | Polly HudsonRead moreThere have been many runners and riders.Holly Willoughby, Fleur East and Emma Willis are among names who have been floated since the news was announced but, earlier this week, Ladbrokes suspended betting on replacements after Zoe Ball announced she was stepping down from her BBC Radio 2 show. Industry experts are also considering her as the new host, with Boyd Hilton, the entertainment director at Heat magazine, calling her a “good bet”.The broadcaster is probably looking for another duo to take the mantle, with the Sun reporting those in the running are being put through an in-studio chemistry test. So, who could take the Strictly helm?View image in fullscreenSpeculation around Zoe Ball’s possible takeover rose after she announced she was leaving her Radio 2 role.Photograph: Ian West/PAZoe BallBall, 55, is hardly a Strictly novice. She competed in the show in 2005, coming third with her dancing partner, Ian Waite. In 2011, she replaced Winkleman as the host of Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two, presenting the companion show until 2021. “She has been connected to the show before and is clearly a fan of it. She is just a brilliant presenter,” said Hilton, adding that he could see Rylan Clark “alongside her, doing the Claudia job”.Speculation that Ball could take on the Strictly mantle intensified last week after she announced live on air that she would step down from her BBC Radio 2 Saturday show. While the news has led to some theorising about a Strictly takeover, Ball, who is one of the BBC’s highest-paid stars, might just want some downtime. Last year, she announced that she was stepping down from her BBC Radio 2 breakfast show after six years to “focus on family”.View image in fullscreenAlan Carr’s star rose after his The Celebrity Traitors victory. But does he have the time?Photograph: Ian West/PAAlan CarrThe Chatty Man made the nation laugh and, in the end, cry with his plodding double-bluffs on Celebrity Traitors. After Carr, 49, managed to outwit Stephen Fry, David Olusoga and Nick Mohammed, he now finds himself a sudden and unexpected frontrunner for one of TV’s most prestigious hosting gigs. He addressed the mounting speculation earlier this week. “I know my name’s been bandied about,” he told the Daily Mail. “It’s nice to be in the running, but no one approached me.” Hilton said Carr would “be amazing but I just don’t think he needs it right now” because, after his Celebrity Traitors win, “he’s almost too big for it now, he could do anything he wants. Does he really need a weekly live TV gig. It’s a stressful thing.”Carr also announced a 2027 tour on Wednesday, which could knock him out of the running because, as one Strictly insider told the Daily Mail: “Saturdays are sacrosanct to the Strictly team, and as brilliant as Alan is, they won’t be able to accommodate a change.”View image in fullscreenAlison Hammond has become one of the country’s most beloved TV presenters.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/ShutterstockAlison HammondHammond, 50, who has had an astonishing rise from Big Brother contestant to one of the nation’s most widely known and well-regarded presenters, is in pole position to step into one of TV’s top jobs. Hammond is no stranger to the ballroom herself, having competed in the 10th series in 2014. ITV may be catching wind of the growing momentum behind one of its star presenters. Hammond signed a new contract with the broadcaster this week, where she will continue her hosting duties on This Morning – though, in theory, she could still present the Saturday primetime hit as This Morning does not air at weekends.Hilton said Hammond “would be amazing and also someone who I think the BBC would be thrilled to get”, but questioned whether she could fit the show into her schedule. Alongside This Morning, Hammond co-hosts The Great British Bake Off and Alison Hammond: For the Love of Dogs. “I just wonder whether she would have the time,” he said.View image in fullscreenBradley Walsh presents the daytime TV hit gameshow The Chase.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockBradley WalshWalsh, 65, has been mooted as a potential Strictly successor. He is a studio formats veteran who has presented several gameshows, including the ITV daytime hit The Chase. That show is filmed next door to Strictly, so Walsh has probably already rubbed shoulders with the dancing show’s crew. The Sunreportedthat Walsh had done a chemistry test with Alex Jones. He was pressed about this on Friday by Denise Welch on The Scott Mills Breakfast Show. When Welch asked Walsh if this was true, he dodged the question, saying: “I think it’s a big old commitment. I really do. It’s a great gig. It’s a great show.”Hilton said Walsh was “the closest to Bruce Forsyth in the sense of an old-school comedian doing it”, but questioned whether he really wanted the job. “He’s very busy. It doesn’t feel like it’s the kind of show that he would immediately go: ‘Yeah, I definitely want to do that.’ But I may be wrong,” said Hilton.View image in fullscreenHolly Willoughby is one TV’s best-known presenters.Photograph: Kieron McCarron/ITV/Rex/ShutterstockHolly WilloughbyWilloughby, 44, was one of TV’s best-known presenters, dominating ITV’s schedule for the past two decades. But the former This Morning host took astep backfrom the limelight in 2023 after a former security guard was arrested over a foiled plot to kidnap, rape and murder her.She has made a slow return to our TV screens but landing the Strictly job would plant her back in the big league. Hilton said: “The BBC would be quite excited about her. She’s probably the biggest name who could do a great job.” He added that she was “such box office because she’s a big star.

In the eyes of my younger self it was a great film – vignettes of love I could only imagine one day feeling, all coloured by the fairy lights of Christmas. And there was even a cameo from Mr Bean himself, Rowan Atkinson. The film captured the romance I craved as a preteen, the idea that maybe a kid I fancied in my class would learn the drums for me and run through airport security to ask me out.I was young enough to think it was sweet for Keira Knightley’s husband’s best friend to turn up on her doorstep declaring his quite obviously unrequited love. I even thought it was adorable that he ruined their wedding video by filming only closeups of her face. Of course, I feel differently now about problematic moments like these – even if I do have the film to thank for introducing me to Joni Mitchell.I’d be happy to never watch it again, but there’s one scene that has always stuck with me and that is whenEmma Thompson’s character finds out her husband (Alan Rickman) is having an affair. She discovers a gift-wrapped necklace in his coat pocket and assumes it will be her Christmas present. Instead, when she opens it, she finds a  CD of Joni Mitchell’s Both Sides Now , and the realisation that he has given the jewellery to another woman. She goes upstairs, puts the album on, and we watch for a few tense minutes as the weight of betrayal and deceit hangs over her. She stands alone in her room only allowing herself a moment to cry silently before she heads back downstairs to her family.It moved me when I first watched it as a 12-year-old, not even really understanding what her husband had done. But there was something in her performance. The silence of it. How she tries desperately to control her emotions in a way that, even as a preteen, I could somehow understand.As I went back to that film for the next few Christmases, I continued to be struck by Thompson’s performance in this small narrative, how much power you can hold by holding back. But also, just how sad she looked. It was this sadness that made me think to myself: if I ever find myself in that situation, I’ll leave. Watching it one Christmas as a teenager, I made a little promise to myself that I’d choose to end a relationship rather than stay and live with that pain. Surely it would be better to finish things than be treated this way.Some years later I was in a long-term relationship. Our agreement had been monogamy, and like most relationships it was fun and good from the start, but it soon became quite obvious that things weren’t right. I see now that I was suffocated and sad for most of it, yet I had been manipulated into believing that my unhappiness was my own doing. I was unable to feel that I deserved better, so I stayed.But one spring morning I found myself sitting in our living room, listening as he admitted to an achingly long series of betrayals. We’d had an argument that had somehow led to this admission that he’d been cheating throughout the relationship. I’d been completely blindsided.I looked around at this small life we’d built together – the messy bookshelves, the guitars hanging on the wall – and only saw the lies that had been its foundations. He wanted me to forgive him and for us to move on, and he genuinely believed I would.But later that day as I sat alone in the bedroom, that scene from Love Actually popped into my mind. I thought of Thompson standing in the corner of her room wiping back her tears listening to Joni Mitchell. Unlike her, I was able to cry loudly, and I did. But these were more tears of sadness for all the time I felt I had lost, even wasted. It was instantly clear to me that this was my way out. That little promise I’d made to myself watching the film one Christmas had provided me with a much-needed boundary – something clear and true when everything else felt so confused.That decision to end the relationship was the easiest I’ve ever made in my life, perhaps because I had made it so many years before. For that, I’ll be eternally grateful to Emma … and Joni.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Ryan Coogler, the acclaimed director who rose to prominence steering Marvel’s colossal Black Panther franchise, was thought to be out of his depth for trying to midwife a script he himself said he cobbled together in two months. Warner Bros, the studio fronting the film’s near $100m budget, was supposedly out of its mind for not only throwing that much money behind the project, but further agreeing to singularly favorable authorship deal terms that gave him control over the film’ final cut and full rights over the film after 25 years. Hollywood machers were convinced the film would never make money and that Warner Bros’ big gamble “could be the end of the studio system”. But Sinners never let that cynicism in.Sinners is a horror film about the highs and lows of the Black experience | Andrew LawrenceRead moreSinners landed in theaters on Easter weekend and delivered its own miracle resurrection, racing to a $368m gate on the way to becoming the highest grossing original film in the past 15 years, and the 10th-highest domestic-grossing R-rated film of all time. (That’s right: higher than Terminator 2 and the Hangovers.) At a time when Black heritage and culture are once again under intense political assault,Sinnersprovoked zeitgeist-y discourse around Black history, cultural erasure and entertainment industry politics. And the online memes poking fun at juke-joint scenes hit as hard as the thinkpieces unpacking the venue’s under-appreciated contributions to the American musical canon.For Sinners to resoundingly beat the odds and become the year’s most defining film, one that is already being hyped as a heavy awards favorite, is just yet another testament to Coogler’s singular Midas touch. His script may have taken two months to write, but it was informed by years of research into Mississippi Delta folklore, antebellum cultural motifs and blues history – a deep dive that started with Coogler’s late uncle introducing him to the genre through his record collection as a kid. Coogler lost himself in 1930s photography and Native American mythos; he drew on the expertise of university history professors and the experiences of Chinese immigrants – oft-forgotten figures in the history of the American south, fictional or otherwise. “We were both happy that we could portray Asians speaking English without a stereotypical accent,” the Malaysian actor Yaosaid in an interviewwith Sinners co-star Li Jun Li; they play married grocers in the film. “We’re also sexy as fuck.”View image in fullscreenMichael B Jordan and Ryan Coogler.Photograph: Lee Watt/AFF-USA/ShutterstockAnd as ever Coogler manages to fold those thick layers of context and the corresponding religious overtones into the film – with major assists from costume designer Ruth E Carter, set decorator Monique Champagne and his wife and producing partner, Zinzi – without weighing down Sinners’ nighttime survival narrative or holding up his exquisitely capable cast. Hailee Steinfeld was a revelation as Mary, a character so well drawn it apparently had her making discoveries abouther own ethnic background. Delroy Lindo, who plays the wino blues man Delta Slim with trademark dignity,saidthat Sinners reckons with the past in a way that makes private investigators out of the cast “because one is uncovering aspects of history that heretofore had been either expurgated, entirely erased, or diminished”.‘A safe haven from racial violence’: Sinners shows the importance of juke jointsRead moreThose history lessons would culminate in broader takeaways that challenged Hollywood orthodoxy. Wunmi Mosaku – a full-figured, dark-skinned mature woman – disproved industry conventional wisdom that sexy female leads only come young, skeletal and fair-skinned – and hammered that point home with a recentNew York magazine cover. All the while Michael B Jordan showed himself to be more than a pretty-boy leading man.It feels weird touting his star turn in Sinners as his arrival given his quarter-century long run as a prestige entertainer, and that Sinners was his third collaboration with Coogler. But Jordan delivered the performance of his career while breathing humor, headache and heroism into the double-minded Smokestack twins bootleggers – training his body and his voice to draw nuanced distinctions between the brothers. “The way he was able to create the characters individually made it easy for me to establish my relationship with both of them,”saidMiles Caton – the baritone guitar man who imbues Sinners, his feature film debut, with song and soul. And that’s as Jack O’Connell – who gamely plays the foil as Remmick, the culture-vulturing nightwalker – connects Coogler’s early grounding in the blues to his sincere curiosity in Irish folk music.Whether experienced in the theater as intended or enjoyed via streaming, where it proved a hit for HBO Max, Sinners got people talking – about how it moved them, about how it explains these troubled times, about all the potential in this cinematic universe despite Coogler calling Sinners a standalone project. (As if that’ll stop visions of a Smokestack twins prequel that has them ripping and running with Al Capone’s Chicago Outfit … ) And after all the second-guessing Coogler endured while releasing the film, which turned out not to bethestudio extinction-level event involving Warner Bros, there’s sweet poetic justice in seeing the critics who onceasterisked the film’s successnow ask, with overdue flattery:what’s next? “I believe in cinema,” Coogler wrote ina thank-you letterto Sinners-goers. “I believe in the theatrical experience. I believe it is a necessary pillar of society. To see your response to the film has reinvigorated me and many others who believe in this art form.”Explore more on these topicsSinners2025 in cultureRyan CooglerMichael B JordanHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One is The Strangers, a supernatural tale offering glimpses into the accomplished wordsmith that Williams would become, and published for the first time this week in theliterary magazine Strand.It is a “significant find” according to scholars of Williams’s early days and upbringing in Missouri.“The play incorporates all the theatrical elements of early radio horror,” said Andrew Gulli, the publication’s managing editor.“A storm, howling wind, shadows, a house perched over the sea, flickering candles, mysterious footsteps on the stairs, spectral beings … as well as early hints of the themes and devices Williams would return to in his most famous later works: isolation, fear, the shades of gray between imagination and reality, and a house haunted by memory and the private terrors of those who inhabit it.”The Strangers never made it to Broadway, and is believed to have enjoyed only a single performance on a rural radio station in Iowa as part of a short-lived series called Little Theater of the Air in 1938.But the script’s dark themes, characters and plot twists provide a fascinating, albeit limited glimpse at the style Williams was honing on his way to the big time with plays exploring repression, desire and loneliness. It was written as part of his coursework at the University of Iowa, where he was studying for an undergraduate English degree.“It is unusual as a radio play,” saidTom Mitchell, a Williams biographer and expert who was not connected to Strand’s acquisition of the work from the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.“It is significant as a ‘find’ insofar as it is one of the many examples of Williams’s writing that hasn’t been published yet [and] is among a number of stories that fit into the category of weird tales, ghost stories, exotic mysteries, science fiction, time travel, etc.“It’s a fairly standard scary tale, but it’s fun and spooky, and even more fun when read aloud.”The plot centers on an elderly couple and their spinster houseguest on a stormy night on the New England coast, where the rotating beam from a nearby lighthouse provides sporadic relief from the darkness and the presence of supernatural beings known as “the strangers”.A series of distressing events leaves listeners wondering if the beings are “a materialization of the occult, or projections of the characters’ unravelling minds”, according to John Bak, professor of literature at Wits University and the Université de Lorraine, who wrote an analysis of the play for Strand.At the time he wrote it, Bak said, “Williams was still trying, unsuccessfully, to land work in either federally funded theatre or radio broadcasting, but that failure would prove fortuitous, both for him and for American theater, for Tom Williams was on his way to becoming Tennessee Williams.“Like many of his early experiments, The Strangers, with its portrayal of isolation, fear, psychological ambiguity, and the possible mental unraveling of its characters, does more than reveal an emerging artist: it foreshadows so many of the themes that would define Tennessee Williams’s most enduring works.”In 2021, Gulli uncovered another previously unpublished work by Williams, his 1952 short story The Summer Woman,found in archivesat Harvard University’s Houghton Library.By that time Williams, who died in 1983 aged 71, had found success, writing the story eight years after his breakout play The Glass Menagerie, and almost midway between publication of two of his biggest successes, A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947, and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1955.Explore more on these topicsTennessee WilliamsUS theaterMagazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

A cold front had brought abundant snow and inhaling was rather painful at -8C, but nothing could still the tremble of excitement.Along with my husband and two young daughters, I was here to take theSanta Claus Expressto the northern city of Rovaniemi, the heart of Finnish Lapland – and the “official” home of Father Christmas. A regular commuter train for the rest of the year, come late November the Santa Claus Express is Finnish Railways’ flagship service, offering the ultimate sleeper-train adventure. As I checked my watch and announced it was finally time to make our way to Helsinki central station, the girls were pink in the cheeks, eyes sparkling from all the surrounding golden lights.View image in fullscreenInaugurated in 1919, the edifice of the majestic art nouveau station swept over us as our footsteps echoed beneath its arches, the ceiling hung with neoclassical chandeliers.Our train was almost 20 minutes late and the anticipation was palpable as passengers shifted from one fur-trimmed boot to the other, a mass of parkas and puffer jackets milling around. Bobble-hatted children glanced hopefully at every train entering the station, their breath twisting up on the air. This is a bucket-list trip filled with snowscapes, perky elves, reindeer rides, husky sledding and northern lights, but I was quietly terrified that something might go wrong: a cancellation perhaps or a lengthy weather delay.View image in fullscreenHelsinki central railway station.Photograph: Ryhor Bruyeu/AlamyThen, at 7.45pm precisely, the Santa Claus Express appeared, red tail lamps blazing as it reversed in through the darkness, and my fears were allayed.As a child, this train would have fulfilled my every dream. But who was I kidding? As an adult it still did. The green and white doubledecker, with Santa’s jolly face painted on the side, came to a standstill, the doors hissed open and we tumbled on board, clambering upstairs to our compartment. On one side were bunks and on the other an en suite toilet that converted to a shower area. With hot water, underfloor heating and a window seat to watch nature’s slideshow playing outside, it was perfect.Up to the age of 10, children travel for free as long as they share a berth with another passenger, and the berths were wide enough for my husband and me to top and tail with the girls. I’ve travelled on more than 100 sleeper trains over the last 15 years, and this was the finest I’d yet found.It was a moment I’d been dreading – how to explain they were wolfing down the protagonist of their favourite Christmas song?To hoots of delight and feet thumping along the corridors, we stashed bags and headed for the restaurant car, where a large family was already crammed into one booth, watchingthe movie Elf dubbed into Portuguese. Tinsel was wound up the brass bars, mistletoe peeked out from the backs of banquettes and the windows were sprayed with snow, the glass already steamed up. The aroma of home-cooking filled the car and a waitress soon arrived with a bowl of reindeer stew and two dishes of meatballs and mash (80,000 portions of which are sold every year according to the railways’ website).View image in fullscreenThe writer and her family on the Santa Claus Express“What meat is this?” my elder daughter asked, dangling a piece of smoked reindeer into her mouth like a Roman ruler. It was a moment I’d been dreading. How could I tell her they were wolfing down the protagonist of their favourite Christmas song?“Well,” I said, “in Finland they eat lots of different things depending on what they can grow and farm, and this is … reindeer.”She shrugged and finished the bowl just as I noticed the train was on the move, the twinkle of the city already giving way to woods, branches sagging under the weight of snow.Aware that other families were waiting to dine, we grudgingly gave up our booth and squeezed through what was starting to feel like a pub on New Year’s Eve, beer spilling on to tables amid the warmth and cheer of strangers exchanging stories and jokes.Back in our compartment, the girls were soon tucked in. The train was strikingly smooth, barely a hum detectable over the sounds of parents yelling at their kids through the air vents. As the girls slept soundly, and my husband read, I sat at the window searching the darkness. Black lakes flashed under street lamps, sheets of ice dusty between skinny branches. From the little pull-down seat I could see how fragmented Finland’s landscape was: a mass of islands, lakes and forests locked together.View image in fullscreenCabins with igloo roofs at the Apukka resort beneath the northern lightsIt was a worthwhile venture scouring the scene, watching walkers with their dogs, locking eyes with late-night smokers on their balconies, and spotting wreaths hanging on doorways. A single fox darted across a car park and I wondered what it might feel like to travel into the polar darkness. Tomorrow there would be no sunrise, so I left the blind up and climbed into bed.The train drew into Rovaniemi just after 7am and we were soon at theApukka resort, a collection of igloo-style cabins built around a lake. While husky rides and petting reindeer were high on the list,Santa Claus Village, which is on the Arctic Circle line, was our first port of call and we were soon in a queue curling up and around a staircase towards the magical wooden grotto.I’d dreamed about this since becoming a parent. Bringing my children to meet the big manI’d dreamed about this moment since becoming a parent. Bringing my children to meet the big man, watching their mouths fall open with joy. In reality, the girls had spent the last half hour grumbling about being bored and pinching each other, and I was now gripping their wrists and mouthing threats through gritted teeth. My elder daughter was also unconvinced about Santa’s identity. “It was Sophie’s dad, Steve,” she had said after the previous year’s school winter fair. How could they not see how special this moment was? On the verge of tears, I pulled the girls apart and eventually we made it to the front of the queue.View image in fullscreenThe writer’s daughters meet a man with an unfeasibly large beard in the Santa Claus VillageInside, two elves were setting up their camera and I looked across to where Santa was sitting in a chair, knee-length beard and giant felt boots in place. He smiled over pince-nez and beckoned the girls, who had fallen silent. Exchanging looks, they shyly sat down. This was a Santa who was authentic enough to make me a believer again. He asked if he could visit in a few days, and they nodded, accepting two gift bags and waving. Outside, they pulled out two plush reindeer toys and beamed. “He was definitely the real Santa,” said my elder daughter, and I breathed a sigh of relief. “His beard was real.”Making our way back outside, I barely noticed the chill. Flushed with warmth I looked down at the smiling faces and gave silent thanks for what had finally turned out to be our family Christmas miracle.A two-person cabin on the Santa Claus Express from Helsinki to Rovaniemi starts from €239one way onVR railways(travel time 11¾ hours)Monisha Rajesh is the author of Moonlight Express: Around the World by Night Train, published by Bloomsbury (£22).

Unsurprisingly, then, ourChristmaslunch was more than a bit diverse: my father always insisted on some British and Lebanese elements, while my mother contributed French dishes and technique; west African produce was also a must, because the house would be full of all nationalities, including our African family. Not only that, but our Christmas would invariably start with a guest list of about 20, and another 20 or so waifs and strays would always then turn up in need of feeding and watering. Today’s dishes were part of our regular seasonal festivities, as good in the sunshine as they are robust enough for a chilly British winter.Mackerel sambousekView image in fullscreenPacked with flavour: Stosi Madi’s mackerelsambousek.Lebanese feasts always feature some form of pie, andsambouseksare tiny little ones with various fillings. Smoked fish is very popular in west Africa, and these smoked mackerel pielets make a delicious nibble. They can also be made in advance, frozen and baked straight from the freezer on the day. If you can’t get hold of fresh horseradish, use 150g hot horseradish sauce, perhaps pepped up with a dollop of dijon mustard to taste, instead of the fresh horseradish and creme fraiche.Prep15 minProve40 min+Cook40 minServes8For the dough (or use 500g shop-bought pizza dough)1 tbsp instant yeast375g plain flour1 tsp salt80ml olive oilFor the filling4 peppered smoked mackerel fillets, skinned1 large red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, finely choppedFinely grated zest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon1tbsp grated fresh horseradish(see recipe introduction)150gcreme fraiche(see recipe introduction)Salt, to tasteMelted butter, for brushingPut yeast, flour and salt in a mixer fitted with a dough hook and work gently for about 30 seconds, just to combine. Add 100ml lukewarm water, work again gently to form a dough, then turn up the speed to medium and add up to another 100ml lukewarm water as needed, until the dough comes together into a smooth ball – be careful not to add so much water that you end up with a sticky dough. Put the dough in a large bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm and leave to prove for about 40 minutes, until doubled in size.While the dough is proving, flake the fish into small pieces and put in a bowl with the onion, parsley, lemon zest and juice, and the horseradish. Mix to combine and bind, then work in half the creme fraiche and mix again to bind. Add the rest of the creme fraiche a little at a time (you may not need it all), until the mixture has a dropping consistency (you don’t want it too thin, or the filling will run). Season with salt to taste.On a well-floured surface, roll out the risen dough as thinly as you dare – aim for about 2mm thick – then use a round 10cm cutter to cut out as many circles as the pastry will yield: you should easily get 16-20. Put a heaped teaspoon of the fishy filling in the centre of each pastry circle, fold over into half-moons, then crimp the edges with the back of a fork. Brush evenly with melted butter, then refrigerate (or freeze) until ready to bake.To bake the pies, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line a large baking tray with greaseproof paper. Put the pies on the tray, taking care not to overcrowd them (if need be, use a second lined tray), then bake for 12-15 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot or at room temperature.French-Caribbean-style crab gratinView image in fullscreenDressed to impress: Stosie Madi’s French-Caribbean-style crab gratin.You’ll need four dressed crabs in their shells (ideally, ones made with no breadcrumbs added) and four empty crab shells (ask the fishmonger for those – they ought happily to give them away for free); alternatively, bake these in little individual gratin dishes.Prep15 minCook55 minServes84 dressed crabs in the shell, plus 4 empty crab shells50ml vegetable oil1 white onion, peeled and diced3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 largered chillies, stalks, pith and seeds discarded, flesh finely diced1 small fennel, trimmed and finely grated1thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated1 tsp cayenne pepper1 small glass white wine(about 125ml)400g tin chopped tomatoes1 tsp chopped fresh thyme leaves1 tsp sugarJuice of ½ lime100g breadcrumbs1 small bunchfresh coriander, roughly chopped, to garnishCrusty bread, to serveSpoon the white meat out of the dressed crabs and set aside – you’ll use this as garnish later.Put the oil in a heavy-based pan on a moderate heat, then saute the onion, garlic, chilli, fennel and ginger for about eight minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the cayenne pepper, cook, stirring, for another five minutes, then stir in the brown crab meat. Tip in the wine and cook until almost all the liquid evaporates. Add the tomatoes, thyme, sugar and lime juice, then cover, turn down the heat and leave to simmer very gently for 15 minutes.Divide the sauce evenly between the eight crab shells (or gratin dishes). Top with the white crab meat, breadcrumbs and chopped coriander, then leave to cool. Refrigerate until you’re ready to serve – the crabs can be prepared up to this stage three days ahead.To cook the gratins, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, then bake for 12-15 minutes, until bubbling. Serve hot with crusty bread.Slow-roasted spiced lamb shoulderView image in fullscreenTime is on your side: Stosi Madi’s slow-roasted spiced lamb shoulder.Lamb, mutton and goat are the proteins of choice in the Middle East and most of Africa, especially at big celebrations. You can’t really go wrong with a slow roast, because it gives you plenty of time to spend with your guests.Prep10 minCook3 hr 15 minServes81 large boned shoulder of lamb(roughly 2½-3kg with bone in) – ask the butcher to bone it for you. If you’re making your own stock for the rice, keep the bones and trimmings, ideally chopped into smallish pieces500ml hot lamb stockFor the paste3 tbsp pomegranatemolasses4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated100ml olive oil2 tbsp ground cumin1 tbsp ground fennel1 tsp ground cinnamon1tbsp black pepperFirst make the spice paste. Put the molasses, garlic and olive oil in a bowl, mix to combine, then stir in the ground cumin, fennel, cinnamon and black pepper. Rub the lamb shoulder all over with the paste mix, then roll and tie it to make a joint. (Alternatively, ask the butcher to roll and tie it for you; if he’sreallyfriendly, give him the paste and ask him to rub it over the meat first.)Put the joint in an earthenware roasting pot for which you have a lid, then roast uncovered at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 15 minutes. Turn the joint, roast still uncovered for another 15 minutes, then pour in the lamb stock and cover the pot. Turn down the oven to 140C (120C fan/275F/gas 1, roast for another hour, then turn over the joint and roast for a further hour and a half. So long as it’s rolled properly, the joint should hold its shape, and the meat should by now be so soft that you can push the handle of a wooden spoon right through without any resistance.Serve right away with the pan juices, the jewelled rice and yoghurt below (the meat doesn’t need to rest because it’s been cooked slowly for a long time at a low temperature).Jewelled riceView image in fullscreenFestive dazzle: Stosie Madi’s jewelled rice.This isthecore of this whole meal, because rice is the celebratory carbohydrate at many a Middle Eastern and west African table. The onions are probably the most important element, and they need a lot of oil, but, on the bright side, you’ll be left with a load of onion-infused oil to use in all sorts of ways. As for the nuts, if, like me, you love them, add more and as many varieties as you like, though the pine nuts and almonds are essential; unfortunately, they all have to be peeled, too. If you don’t want to make your own stock, use ready-made lamb stock or lamb stock cubes dissolved in water. All the elements can be made well ahead, leaving you just the rice to cook on the day.Prep20 minStock6 hrCook1 hr 15 minServes8For the stock (optional)Bones from 1 large lamb shoulder1 small garlic bulb, unpeeled and cut in half horizontally1 white onion, unpeeled and cut in half1 large carrot, cut in half lengthways1 bay leaf5 black peppercorns1 cinnamon stick1 tsp cuminseedsFor the crispy onions500mlneutral oil– I use cold pressed rapeseed oil3 large white onions, peeled and thinly slicedFor the nuts100g blanched peeled almonds100g pine nuts50g shelled and peeled pistachios50g shelled and peeled walnuts4 tbsp reserved crispy onion oil(see above and method)For the rice50ml reserved crispy onion oil25g clarified butter, or lamb fat50g vermicelli, broken up into 2½cm lengths, if need be(some brands come already broken up; optional)250g long-grain rice(yes, that’s a lot, but it keeps well)20g crispy onions(see above and method)375ml hot lamb stock2tsp salt, or to tasteSeeds from 1 pomegranate, or 1 tub shop-bought pomegranate seedsIf you’re making your own stock (and I highly recommend it), put the shoulder bones in a roasting tin with the halved garlic bulb, onion and carrot, then roast in a very hot oven – 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9 – for about 20 minutes, until nicely browned. Add two litres of water to the tin, stir to deglaze, then tip the lot into a very large saucepan or stock pot and add the bay leaf, peppercorns, cinnamon and cumin.Bring to a boil, then turn down to a low simmer and cook for up to six hours, skimming off and discarding any foam and impurities that bubble to the surface along the way. After six hours, strain, cool and refrigerate overnight. Before using, skim any fat off the surface, and discard or save for another use – I’d use it in the rice.First, make the onions. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pan to 180C, add the sliced onions and fry, turning constantly, for 10-15 minutes, until they turn a uniform golden brown– be careful, though, because with onions there’s a very fine line between golden and burned! Take off the heat and keep stirring until the oil stops bubbling.Set a metal sieve or colander over a second large saucepan, then drain the onions into the sieve – again, take great care, because the oil will be very hot. Reserve the oil. Spread the drained onions over a large baking tray lined with kitchen towel, then leave to cool and crisp up. Once cooled, store in an airtight container. (NB: crisp onions are fundamental to this recipe, but if you find deep-frying them daunting, you can instead shallow-fry and brown them slowly in a frying pan for about 30 minutes – they won’t be as crisp, but they will be sweet.)The onions can be made up to a week ahead.Now for the nuts, which each need to be roasted separately, because they all cook at different speeds. Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)/325F/gas 3, put each type of nut in a separate bowl and stir a tablespoon of the reserved onion oil into each bowl. One by one, spread the nuts on a lined oven tray and roast until golden and browned – depending on the type of nut, they’ll take anywhere between five and 15 minutes each, so keep checking and take great care they don’t burn. Drain each batch of toasted nuts on kitchen towel, leave to cool, then store in an airtight tin. The nuts can also be made up to a week ahead.Now for the rice. Put the reserved onion oil and clarified butter (or reserved lamb fat) in a heavy-based pan on a moderate heat, until the butter starts foaming gently. Add the vermicelli, if using, and cook, stirring, until the pasta turns golden brown. Add the rice, stir until well coated in the fat, then stir in 20g of the crispy onions. Pour in the hot stock, season with salt and keep stirring until it starts bubbling. Part cover with a lid and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring every five minutes, until most of the stock is absorbed. Turn the heat right down, cover with a clean tea towel and then a lid, then leave to steam, still on the heat, for a further 15 minutes. Keep warm on the lowest possible heat until ready to serve.To serve, fluff up the rice with a fork, then turn it out on to a platter. Scatter the onions, nuts and pomegranate seeds all over the top, and serve.Yoghurt and cucumber saladView image in fullscreenGoes with all sorts: Stosi Madi’s yoghurt and cucumber salad.Yoghurt is a stalwart of the Mediterranean table. Paired with refreshing cucumbers, it makes a great accompaniment for any lamb dish and is also delicious with rice.SteepUp to 2 hrPrep20 minServes84 firm smallLebanese cucumbers, or 1 large regular cucumber (although that will usually have far less flavour)2 tsp salt350g thick Greek-style set yoghurt, strained1 tbsp dried mint1 tbsp chopped fresh mint1 tsp sugar1 small garlic clove, peeled and finely gratedPeel the cucumbers, cut them in half lengthways, then scoop out the seeds. Cut each cucumber half in half again lengthways, then cut the flesh into cubes. Put these in a colander, add the salt, toss, then leave to drain for up to two hours, until you’re ready to use.Put the yoghurt in a bowl with the herbs, sugar and garlic, stir well, then cover and put in the fridgeuntil needed.To assemble the salad, rinse the salted cucumber, pat it dry with a clean tea towel, then stir it into the yoghurt mix. Taste, adjust the seasoning if need be, and serve.Rum and pineapple cakeView image in fullscreenA Christmas fruit cake with a difference: Stosie Madi’s rum and pineapple cake.Pudding is essential to any celebration, and this one is a lovely variation on a traditional Christmas fruit cake influenced by the west African Creoles who brought back rum from the West Indies. You’ll need a 23cm loose-bottomed nonstick cake tin and, ideally, abaking belt, to ensure an evenly cooked cake.Prep15 minCook1 hr 30 minServes8-10250g self-raising flour10g ground cinnamon10g ground black pepper10g ground ginger15g sea salt½ whole nutmeg, finely grated10g baking powder200g soft brown sugar125g unsalted butter125g vegetable oil50g full-fat Greek yoghurt2 tsp vanilla extract4 large eggs(250g)200g raisins, soaked in 75ml dark spiced rum for at least 24 hours75ml dark spiced rum, for flambeeing the cake on the dayCreme fraiche, to serveFor the syrup1 vanilla pod, split open, seeds scraped out and empty pod reserved for the pineapple75g sugar75ml fresh pineapple juice, or water50ml rumFinely grated zest and juice of 1 limeFor the pineapple1 spent vanilla pod, left over from making the syrup50g caster sugar50g softened butter1pineapple, peeled, cored and eyes removedPut the first seven dry ingredients in a large bowl. Put the soft brown sugar and butter in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, then beat until creamed and smooth. Beat in the oil, yoghurt and vanilla, then work in the eggs. Mix in the rum-soaked raisins, then turn down the speed to low, tip in the contents of the bowl of dry ingredients and gently bring together for a few seconds. Do not overmix the cake batter.Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/385F/gas 5½.Remove the paddle, then, with a spatula, gently stir and fold the batter to make sure the flour is fully incorporated. Pour the mix into the lined tin, then wrap the tin with a baking belt and cover the top with a circle of buttered greaseproof paper.Bake the cake for 55-60 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean, then transfer the cake tin to a rack and leave to cool completely. The cake can be baked up to two weeks ahead (or even longer if you want to feed it some extra rum).While the cake is baking, prepare the syrup and fruit. Put all the syrup ingredients in a medium saucepan, heat gently, stirring occasionally, just until all the sugar dissolves, then take off the heat.Now for the pineapple. Put the reserved empty vanilla pod and sugar in a blender or food processor, blitz on a high speed, then beat in the butter. Tip the butter mix into a large ovenproof saucepan, set it over a medium heat and, the moment the butter starts to foam, add the whole peeled pineapple. Turn to coat, then pan-roast, turning constantly, for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.Transfer the pineapple pan to the hot oven and roast for 20 minutes, turning once halfway. Remove from the oven and leave the pan to cool completely.Once cool, lift out the pineapple, cut it in half lengthways, then cut each half lengthways into four long pieces.Put the pineapple pieces in a suitable container, pour all thesyrup over the top, cover and keep in the fridge until ready to use, turning the fruit as often as you remember. You can make the pineapple up to a week ahead.To serve, turn out the cake from its tin and transfer it to a platter. Gently warm the pineapple and syrup a little (a little turn in a microwave would do the trick), and gently warm the rum in a small saucepan.Arrange the pineapple batons on top of the cake, pour most of the syrup over the top and take to the table, along with the pan of warm rum. Carefully set the rum on fire, pour it all over the cake and serve with plenty of creme fraiche and the rest of the syrup drizzled all over the top.Stosie Madi is chef/co-patron ofThe Parkers Armsin Newton in Bowland, near Clitheroe, LancashireExplore more on these topicsFoodChristmas food and drinkChristmasStarterSnacksMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

There’s nothing wrong with a bit of comfort eating, especially atChristmas, but both are also symbols of our industrial food culture: bland, beige and unadventurous.
