He’s my best friend – and he’s our security detail these days.”The couple were sitting on black leather furniture around a coffee table. Apart from a sneezing fit that took her husband by surprise, Omar had an unusual Zen-like calm for someone who receivesfrequent death threatsand is the subject of a vendetta from the most powerful man in the world.Speaking at arally-style event in Pennsylvanialast week, Donald Trump mocked her hijab and alleged that the Somali-born Omar married her own brother to gain US citizenship. “Therefore she’s here illegally,” he said. “She should get the hell out. Throw her the hell out! She does nothing but complain.”The president’s supporters broke into a gleeful chant of: “Send her back! Send her back!”What did Omar herself make of the comments? “They’re vile and it is, I believe, a really unhealthy and creepy obsession that he has with me,” the 43-year-old, wearing a green, white and pink banded sweater, told the Guardian on Friday as Teddy frolicked nearby. “Everybody knows I came to the United States at the age of 12 on a refugee status and became a citizen when I was 17 and obviously I’m a duly elected member of Congress and so my status is not in question in any kind of way.”Trump was supposed to be talking about the cost of living in Pennsylvania on Tuesday but soon defaulted to boilerplate xenophobia. The Minnesota Democrat added: “He likes to deflect when things aren’t going well for him and there is a clear failure so far in his presidency. He hasn’t been able to address the affordability issues that the American people are still feeling … Cue the bigotry. It’s the same playbook and he just goes back to it; he doesn’t know anything else.”The walls of Omar’s office were adorned with African-themed art: a stylised depiction of a woman wearing a head wrap painted with swirls of blue, red, yellow and orange; a square canvas entitled Djibouti depicting a tall wooden drum, a mortar and pestle and a woven basket. There was also a Jet magazine picture ofShirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, and an Essence magazine profile of Omar and others members of the progressive “squad”.Born in Somalia, Omar and her family fled the country’s civil war when she was eight. The family spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the US in the 1990s. In 1997, she moved to Minneapolis with her family, and in 2000 she became a US citizen. Trump’s malign fixation with her goes back years. In 2019he tweetedthat Omar and the other members of the squad should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came”.View image in fullscreenIlhan Omar and her husband, Tim Mynett, in Omar’s office in Washington DC on 12 December.Photograph: Caroline Gutman/The GuardianHe has also repeatedly pushed the allegation that she married her brother, a rumour thatstarted in 2016when she ran for election to the state house of representatives in Minnesota. She described it as “absolutely false and ridiculous” and released a timeline of her marital and divorce history. The claim has persisted in rightwing media butno proof has emergedto substantiate it.She draws comparisons with other conspiracy theories from the rightwing fever swamps. “This was a story that was put in a blog that shouldn’t have had any normal-thinking person looking into it,” Omar said. “But there is, I believe, this sort of severe desire on the right to find extreme ways to other people that they don’t think should be humanised.“They’ve always had these fascinating accusations of trying to prove a negative so that this story continues to exist. We had the ‘birther’ story when [Barack] Obama was clearly born here and even when birth certificates were made available. There’s the Hillary Clinton keeping babies at a basement in a facility that doesn’t even have a basement. This is their way of trying to make me sound like something I’m not.”Omar married Mynett, a political consultant, in 2020 on the day the US went into pandemic lockdown. He is sadly unsurprised by Trump’s latest verbal abuse. Wearing a beard and grey jersey, the 44-year-old commented: “This isn’t our first rodeo. During Trump’s first term he demonised my wife to the point where the United States government demanded that we have a full six-person security detail.“They identified a plot to attack her and frankly it was a very patriotic moment for me to learn that there are white men on racist message boards online posing as racists themselves to suss out truly evil people and then go out and protect my wife, an immigrant member of Congress.”He added: “That is to me one of the essences of what America is. Yeah, sure, it’s nothing new, but it’s upsetting to see that this is where the leader of our country wants to draw the national attention. It is just shocking and very upsetting.”Security is now a paramount concern for every politician. In 2024, the US Capitol policeinvestigated 9,474 concerning statements and direct threatsagainst members of Congress, including their families and staff, more than double the 2017 total of 3,939. Reminders of the US’s surging culture of political violence are everywhere. In the corridors outside Omar’s office on Capitol Hill, some of her Republican colleagues have erected tributes to Charlie Kirk, the rightwing youth activist assassinated in September.Omar’s friend Melissa Hortman, the former Minnesota house speaker, and her husbandwere shot deadat their home in June by a man disguised as a member of law enforcement. “In many ways you think, where can you be safe?” she said. “When you have the president using dehumanising language every single day, we know that message gets to the worst humans possible in this country and that they then take action.“We’ve had people incarcerated for threatening to kill me. We have people that are being prosecuted right now for threatening to kill me and so it is something that does stay in the back of our minds. But I also worry about those people finding someone who looks like me in Minneapolis or across the country and thinking it is me and harming them.”Omar recalled that, when in 2019 she became the first woman of colour to represent Minnesota, and one of the first two Muslim American women elected to the House of Representatives, Trump’s attacks led to her having the highest level of death threats of any member of Congress.View image in fullscreenOmar at an election night party on  6 November 2018 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images“Now, in the four years when [Joe] Biden was president, my death rates went to almost zero,” she said. “Now they are back up and so there is a clear correlation between his presidency and the political violence that we see and the political danger that a lot of members of Congress and electeds feel across the country.”She is determined not to let Trump’s “deranged attacks” undermine her day job in Congress, taking votes and providing constituent services for the people who elected her. Her priorities this year have included trying to safeguard healthcare, climate regulations and democracy while fighting back against Trump’s draconian immigration policies.That includes her home patch. Trump last week labelledMinnesota Somalis as “garbage”and said he did not want them in the US. He has linked his administration’s immigration crackdown against the Somali community to a series of fraud cases involving government programmes in which many defendants have roots in the east African country.Omar said: “He is clearly scapegoating the Somali community. The folks who committed the fraud have been prosecuted, many have already been sentenced, and there’s more investigation and prosecutions to come. I don’t believe a majority of Americans agree just because one person who shares an ethnicity with you does something that you then be held accountable for their misdeeds.”About 84,000 of the 260,000 Somalis in the US live in the Minneapolis-St Paul area. The overwhelming majority are American citizens. Almost 58% were born in the US and 87% of the foreign-born Somalis are naturalised citizens.But in a year that has seenImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)raids strike terror into communities across the country, and masked agents snatch people off the streets, no one is safe. This week the homeland security department announced that its enforcement operations have resulted in more than 605,000 deportations since 20 January while 1.9 million “illegal aliens” have voluntarily self-deported.Omar said of Minnesota: “We’re seeing people being slammed to the ground, handcuffed, detained for hours. We are seeing people being told that their documents are not real. We are seeing people being tear-gassed. We saw one that was run over on the road, all of it being captured on camera. But again what he wants and what he was hoping for was to find a community that was undocumented.“We’ve been here over 30 years. Nearly 60% of Somalis in Minnesota are born in the United States and these are people who have been mobilising themselves and preparing for his presidency and understanding that we have dealt with authoritarianism, we have dealt with dictatorship, and so we are vigilant about what that looks like and the community is showing just how resilient it is.”Trump also used his speech in Pennsylvania to describeSomaliaas “the worst country in the world”,stating: “They have no military. They have no nothing. They have no parliament. They don’t know what the hell the word parliament means. They have nothing. They have no police. They police themselves. They kill each other all the time.”View image in fullscreenOmar in her office in Washington DC, on 12 December 2025.Photograph: Caroline Gutman/The GuardianAfter years of denials, the president alsoadmitted that a reportfrom his first term was true: he did indeed refer to African nations as “shithole countries” and yearned for “nice” immigrants from Norway, Sweden and Denmark (all of which have predominantly white populations) instead of“filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime” Somalia.When the rest of the world watches these performances, what can it be thinking? Omar replied: “I believe it denigrates our standing as Americans that we could elect somebody who presents not only as a national embarrassment but as an international embarrassment.“There isn’t a train of thought that the president ever puts out that is dignified and I believe as Americans we want to see ourselves as dignified people and would like to be represented by a person who carries themselves with dignity. I just cannot believe that we have a president that not only denigrates Americans but also denigrates different parts of America on a national and international stage every single day.”The international community has also watched the US’sdrift towards authoritarianismwith consternation and alarm. Democracy will survive, Omar insisted, “but in a very fragile way. His presidency has exposed some weaknesses that exist and it has certainly taught us that, while our institutions are strong, they are fragile to a dictatorship-like ruler. We must do more to create stronger guardrails to make sure that the independence of our institutions remains.”For all his strongman posturing, opinion polls show thatTrump is now deeply unpopular, especially for failing to keep his promise to fix American’s affordability crisis. Republicans suffered a wipeout in last month’s elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York, where democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani stormed to victory in the mayoral race.Omar believes that Democrats can learn fromMamdanias they approach next year’s midterm elections for Congress. She said: “The biggest lesson from that election is how desperately the American electorate needs their candidates to be authentic, to be themselves and to talk about what really has impact on their lives.“His focus on creating a more affordable New York, his focus on meeting people where they were at, his focus on not talking down at people but being in real conversation with them I think is what won him the election and what people need to do in order to be successful.”Mynett added: “I’m no politician but I’d also add that young man’s fearlessness was incredibly contagious and inspiring and I think it’s another big piece of how he ended up where he did.”Speaking of fearlessness, Mynett admires no one more than his wife. As he contemplated Omar’s courage under fire, he instinctively reached out and touched her arm. “The congresswoman’s always exhibiting grace under pressure,” he said. “For any human being in the universe to be targeted this way, I’ve never met one that could handle it better than my wife.“A lot of times I think back to all of the trials and tribulations of her life – a child war refugee, there’s so much – but I don’t even think it’s that. I don’t think it’s her experience. I think it’s the core of who she is. She knows why she’s here and she’ll never be deterred by somebody doing racist, bigoted things towards her.”"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.On 19 December 1974, the writerLinda Rosenkrantzwent round to her friendPeter Hujar’s apartment in New York, and asked the photographer to describe exactly what he had done the day before. He talked in great detail about taking Allen Ginsberg’s portrait for the New York Times (it didn’t go well – Ginsberg was too performative for the kind of intimacy Hujar craved). He also described the Chinese takeaway he ate and how his pal Vince Aletti came round to have a shower. And he fretted about not being paid by Elle magazine.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So what did Ben Whishaw, who plays him in the new filmPeter Hujar’s Day, do himself the day before? The actor, on a video call from his home in London, rubbing his hands through his hair in a worried manner, says he could probably describe it in “about five sentences”, but after some persuasion attempts to give a flavour. “I got home from filming and I got the chicken that I’d cooked the previous day and eaten half of and I finished it. Well, not finished it but continued eating it and then had a glass of wine and fell asleep at half past nine. Boring. But, um, maybe there’s no such thing as boring.”Hujar was also acutely attuned to details, from light on the Hudson River to the hair on a drag queen’s shinsThis is a thesis the film tests to the limit. Directed by Ira Sachs, Peter Hujar’s Day consists entirely of 70 minutes of chat between Hujar and Rosenkrantz, played byRebecca Hall. The script is taken from Rosenkrantz’s transcript, which was rediscovered in 2019, when Hujar’s papers were donated to New York’s Morgan Library (Rosenkrantz is now 91, while the photographer died of Aids in 1987, aged 53). Hujar and Rosenkratz talk in his flat, lounging on the sofa and reclining on the bed, her reel-to-reel tape machine clanking and whirring as the sun goes down in what feels like real time.As you’d expect from actors of Hall and Whishaw’s calibre, the accents are impeccable and the intimacy of Hujar and Rosenkrantz is conveyed through the tiniest details: a look, a touch, a comfortable silence. Whishaw describes it as “a portrait of a friendship, almost a love story”. Some critics have acclaimed the film as a masterpiece.Lindsay Lohan recently praisedits “quiet beauty”. Others, however, may find it challenging to view in its entirety – although Whishaw says it can be watched like a video work in an art exhibition, with the viewer dropping in and out. “That would feel equally valid.”Usually Whishaw hates watching his own work, as his memories of making it overwhelm any enjoyment. However, he says, “I really love this kind of film. You can relax into it and there’s space for the viewer to drift. All the people he’s talking about we researched very meticulously, but I imagine that most people will be like, ‘Who the fuck is he talking about?’ So at a certain point, people probably go, ‘I’m just going to let this wash over me.’ It’s a different way of engaging the viewer.”View image in fullscreenIntimate … with Rebecca Hall as Linda Rosenkrantz in Peter Hujar’s Day.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyPeter Hujar’s Day was filmed at Westbeth, an artists’ community on the western edge of Manhattan where Hujar took pictures. Whishaw loves being in New York. “You feel like there’s a lot of libido,” he says. “There’s an energy that feels sexual – it’s something to do with the climate, that island, the people and the way it’s all laid out.” When he’s in the city, he likes to go to concerts, or to Julius, the city’s oldest gay bar. “You can always get a chair at Julius,” he says. “If that existed in London, it would just be rammed the whole time, wouldn’t it?”Sachs told Whishaw not to divulge exactly how long Peter Hujar’s Day took to film, as it was so brief – somewhere between a week and a month. Nonetheless, Whishaw certainly put a shift in. He had 55 pages of painstakingly recreated mundane chat to memorise, while Hall had a mere three. “I really enjoy that in art,” Whishaw says of this focus on the small stuff. “I’m reading these diaries by this brilliant Australian writer calledHelen Garner” – recent winner of the Baillie Gifford prize – “and they’re all tiny observations. But it changes your perception of life, because they point you to how life is really made up of tiny moments, even when enormous events are going on.”Hujar, whose pictures were barely noticed in his lifetime, was also acutely attuned to details, from fragments of light on the Hudson River to the hair on a drag queen’s shins. “I first saw his work on the cover of the Anohni and the Johnsons albumI Am a Bird Now,” Whishaw says. “And I had postcards of his pictures of men in drag. But around the pandemic I started to go, ‘Oh, all these images are by the same guy.’ There wasan exhibition at Maureen Paleyaround the same time, to do with performers backstage, and it was very beautiful.” So much so that Whishaw bought one of the works from the London gallery. “It’s him naked in a chair,” he says. “It’s quite unusual, because he usually stood when he did self-portraits, and he has a thread around his neck. I think he was starting to get into sort of witchy things for his health.”View image in fullscreen‘You could feel how extraordinarily intimate he was with his subjects’ … Hujar in 1986.Photograph: Bob Berg/Getty ImagesWhishaw loves Hujar’s work for the way it captures a long-lost queer New York bohemia destroyed by Aids (“like a portal into a time that might not have been remembered”); for his mastery of monochrome (“he talks about that in the film – the blacks and the greys, and the sorrow in them is beautiful”); and for the psychological insight in his portraits. Earlier this year, Whishaw went toa comprehensive show of Hujar’s work at Raven Row in London. “You could really feel how extraordinarily intimate he was able to be with his subjects,” he says. “I think that’s very moving.”He admires, too, Hujar’s refusal to compromise. “He was always trying to preserve the purity of his work. In the film, he talks about how someone likes something when it looks ‘real arty’, and he hates that – something obviously palatable that will look pretty on your wall.”View image in fullscreenLove triangle … Whishaw with Franz Rogowski in the 2023 film Passages.Photograph: Courtesy of SBS ProductionsWhishaw was working on Sachs’s previous filmPassages, about a man who cheats on his husband with a woman, when the director asked him to play Hujar. He agreed immediately. “I wanted to work with Ira again. I wanted just tobewith Ira again,” he says. “He’s someone whose company I enjoy. We share interests and we like talking to each other. So it just came about that way. And yeah, to work with a gay person is really nice.”Is it different from working with a straight director? “It definitely feels different if you’re making a project that’s about gayness or queerness,” Whishaw says. “And there are lots of beautiful gay directors – but notthatmany. I think it’s hard for them to make films. So it’s precious when you get to be involved with one.”‘He was a born member of the underground’: how Peter Hujar captured the New York demimondeRead moreThere aren’t that many out gay actors either, especially ones at Whishaw’s level of success. “No, not very many,” he says. “It’s complicated and probably different for every individual, but I think it’s still something to do with the fact that if you want to be really successful, you have to conform to what is deemed to be heterosexual taste, or something. Or be sexy in a heterosexual way. I’m always amazed by how much sex is underneath everything, actually. Or desire. There’s still a lot of homophobia and hatred. I mean, it’s better, but it’s still true. Also, who knows what journey people are on with these things? I don’t blame people for being private.”Whishaw is 45. Like a lot of queer people his age, he is somewhat haunted by the absence of the generation of gay men above him, many of whom died of Aids when they still had so much to contribute as mentors, teachers or father figures, and through work they never got to make. “I feel the lack of elders,” Whishaw says. “It’s like this massive gap, which is still so sad and shocking.” Hujar never took a picture again after finding out he had Aids. “He literally stopped the minute he got the diagnosis. Everything in the darkroom was left exactly as it was. It gives me chills to think about what would be behind that.”Peter Hujar’s Day review – Ben Whishaw goes low-key in snapshot of the photographer’s remarkable lifeRead moreIt’s especially sad, Whishaw says, because most artists keep working for as long as they can. The actor is certainly no exception. Next he’s doing a TV series, then a film, then perhaps some theatre, before possibly making something himself. “A dancer can’t keep going, can they? I mean, some people do and that’s extraordinary. But actors and photographers can keep going. And I think you can get better because you have more to offer about what it is to be human.”Peter Hujar’s Day is out in the US.

And for once he sounded almost genuine.Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesThe politics sketchRichard TicePenitent Tice tussles with The Unbearable Lightness of His BeingJohn CraceAnother day, another Reform UK press conference: this time the deputy leader’s turn to apologise for his Send remarksTue 16 Dec 2025 12.38 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 17.45 ESTShareCall it a Christmas miracle. For this was the day when Richard Tice sent in his application to become a fully paid-up member of Woke. The day the Reform deputy leader tried to break free from his role as the perennial sidekick. An insignificant blot on theNigel Faragelandscape. When he tried to show he was able to think his own thoughts. Be his own man. Release the closet liberal inside. No longer have to apologise for his existence at the posh dinners he enjoys so much.Yet Dicky will always be Dicky. Unable to escape The Unbearable Lightness of His Being. When he looks in the mirror, even he has to agree there is less than meets the eye. So it was inevitable he crashed and burned as usual. There are just too many contradictions that he can’t reconcile. A lifetime of trying to be loved has left him unsure of who he really is. A neurotic narcissist with a large ego and next to no self-worth.But in this festive season, we should try to be charitable. Give Dicky some credit for trying to be his better self. He can’t help it if he’s not very bright.This was the second Reform press conference in as many days. Perhaps they will be having one every day throughout the festive season. Our cup overfloweth. On Monday we had Danny Kruger announcing he welcomed in a non-judgmental way the support of the pornography star Bonnie Blue.It didn’t seem entirely probable that Danny the Blunder Dog, a devout Christian who despairs of the country’s cultural and moral decline, should welcome a womanwho is best known for having sex with more than 1,000 men in a day. I guess he couldn’t fault her commitment to a one-in, one-out immigration policy. An example to us all.Come Tuesday, the law of diminishing returns inevitably kicked in. Reform had hired a large room in Church House, only a tiny bit of which was used. There were just three rows of chairs laid out, and even then, not all the seats were taken. Dicky’s reputation precedes him. In the front row sat a stony-facedLee Anderson. He was clearly there under duress. Or maybe he owes Tice £50 and was hoping to get the debt cancelled. He would look even more miserable by the end. He hadn’t joined Reform to be nice to children with special educational needs.“I want to begin with an apology,” said Dicky. And for once he sounded almost genuine. Sure, he wanted to gloss over things a bit but this wasn’t one of those “sorry, not sorry” apologies we often hear from politicians.For the last two weeks, Reform have kept Tice locked up for saying that disabled children wearing ear defenders in classrooms was insanity. It turned out that some Reform supporters also have children with special educational needs and were unimpressed that the party leadership could have so little understanding of what was required.Tice wanted to make amends. When he had said disabilities were being overdiagnosed, what he had really meant was he was pleased that children were getting the help they needed. Most of all, he wanted to be loved. This wasn’t so much a press conference as a vibes conference. He needed the two dozen or so people in the room to know that he cared. That he was on their side.At times he went so far as to make you wonder if he was actually in a hostage video. Was being forced to say stuff against his will. But you must never underestimate the power of Dicky’s neediness. For him, it’s so much more than merely being noticed on TV. It’s the approval he really craves. Something he is unable to give himself.“We need to stop thinking of children as disabled,” he said. “We need to think of them as differently abled.” Dicky paused to let that sink in. Hoping for some applause from Lee that never came. The rest of the room just cringed.This was so on-brand from Tice. Desperate to say the right thing but getting it helplessly wrong. His bid for Wokedom in tatters. Because if he had known the first thing about special educational needs, he would have known the words “differently abled” were considered patronising and condescending.Tice continued. He was going to turn every church into a special school and there would be Send provision in every village. It was time to end the era of private-equity-funded schools. Things would cost less and a whole lot more. Profit was both very bad and very good.By the end, Dicky had descended into total incoherence. It was almost as if he was ad-libbing the whole speech and had no idea what he wanted to say next. As so often, he wanted to have it every which way. Woke and Anti-Woke. Not all his listeners were impressed. In the YouTube comments, one person wrote: “Eugenics will sort out Send.” Charming.The inconsistencies carried on mounting when Dicky invited questions from the media. The previous night, he had attended a vigil for the victims of the Bondi terrorist attack but now he was unwilling to retract his comments that those who hadheard Farage make racist and antisemitic remarks were liars.“That’s old news,” he said. As if there were a statute of limitations on such matters. That antisemitism by the teenage Farage was somehow acceptable. Not worthy of further comment. If Nige was not going to apologise, then why should he?Dicky couldn’t even bring himself to condemn Chris Parry, the Reform mayoral candidate who hadsaid David Lammy should “go home to the Caribbean”where his “loyalties lie”. That was just part of the rough and tumble of daily politics, he insisted. Just a way of holding the government to account.Sure it is. There’s nothing like a racist insult to kick the day off with. Presumably, disabled children are also there to be both helped and abused. Give with the one hand; take with the other. A way of keeping everyone on their toes.Come the end, Dicky looked like a man collapsing in on himself. Entropy in action. Crushed by the weight of his own contradictions. The BBC was both brilliant and useless, fit only to be destroyed by the Trump juggernaut. It was as though he had no idea what he really thought. Just a desire to please. It could just be that he’s merely another chancer who doesn’t really believe in anything but himself.The Bonfire of the Insanities by John Crace (Guardian Faber Publishing, £16.99).

We are back in the sleazy, glossy world of Curtis Hanson’s The Hand That Rocks the Cradle or Joe Eszterhas’s Basic Instinct, but skating quite close, though not too close, to satire.The scene is a bizarrely opulent mansion somewhere in upstate New York, splendidly isolated among a sea of bland suburban housing; it is approached by a drive, once you have got past the electronic gates. And it is down this avenue that Millie (Sydney Sweeney) nervously drives, wearing fake glasses to make herself look more mature, to apply for the job of live-in housemaid to the wealthy couple that lives there; she is hoping her prospective employers will not notice the worrying inconsistencies in her CV. She is greeted with smiley, Stepford-blond blandness by Nina Winchester (Amanda Seyfried), who appears to adore Millie, and explains that the job entails cooking, cleaning and looking after her young daughter, Cece (Indiana Elle).But on her very first day on the job, poor Millie discovers that the house, a perfect Martha Stewart show home when she first saw it, is now squalid chaos, and Nina is screaming with spiteful rage, blaming Millie for everything, the result of apparently having missed her meds. Her husband, Andrew (Brandon Sklenar), as handsome as a young Alec Baldwin, reassures Millie that all is well; Millie finds herself fatally attracted to him, as well as grateful for his kindly interventions to prevent her from being fired from a job she badly needs. The sexual tension is unbearable. But what is going on? Is the behaviour of either what it seems? Is Millie being groomed for something?We get some tastily over-the-top acting and some huge rewind POV shifts to explain what has really been going on – and, of course, the heady whiff of gaslight as Millie can’t quite be sure she really understands anything that’s happening. Silly it may be, but Feig and his cast deliver it with terrific gusto; this is an innocent holiday treat.The Housemaid is out on 19 December in the US, 25 December in Australia and 26 December in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersSydney SweeneyPaul FeigAmanda SeyfriedFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then her daughter did, tooA breast cancer diagnosis is hard enough – what happens when a mother and daughter go through it at the same time?Holly BurnsTue 16 Dec 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 12.01 ESTShareGenna Freed should have been in the mood to celebrate. On a cloudy November day in 2022, her mother, Julie Newman, was about to complete her final round of radiation, after being diagnosed with breast cancer in September. The whole family, a close-knit bunch, was gathering with balloons and signs.But Freed, then a few weeks shy of her 31st birthday, was carrying a secret. Spurred by her mother’s diagnosis, she had her first mammogram a couple days earlier, and it had turned up a suspicious spot. Now she needed a second, diagnostic mammogram, and likely a biopsy. She found herself walking a surreal sort of tightrope, caught between relief that her mother’s treatment was over and fear that she might soon be starting her own.“I went to the radiation center that morning, celebrated my mom having her last radiation treatment, had breakfast with everyone,” she recalls. “And then quietly went back to the medical campus, to the building across the street, to have my next set of scans and imagery done.”Two weeks later, on 9 December 2022, Freed learned she had an early form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Telling her mom, she says, was excruciating: “I just remember being like, I don’t want to give her this news, but I also cannot keep this from her.” Just three months out from her own diagnosis, Newman, now 68, was shocked. “It was like a kick in the stomach,” she says. “I couldn’t believe it.”How double diagnoses can affect familiesNewman pivoted from patient to caregiver, helping Freed’s husband with the couple’s two-year-old daughter while Freed recovered from her double mastectomy. Then Newman learned she needed a second lumpectomy, and Freed checked on her frequently; Newman set up a meal train for Freed from her recovery chair. It was a relentless rush of role-switching, says Freed, based on who was feeling better that day: “It felt like we were living through hell.”Back-to-back cancer diagnoses can have a profound psychological impact, unearthing sadness, helplessness and fear, says Dr Neha Goyal, a clinical psychologist at the University of California at San Francisco’s Helen Diller Family ComprehensiveCancerCenter.View image in fullscreenJulie Newman and her daughter, Genna Newman Freed, at Julie’s home in Findlay, Ohio, on 17 November.Photograph: Amy Lynn Powell/The GuardianWhen someone – let alone two members of the same family – is navigating a cancer diagnosis, “there’s such a sense of loss of control”, she says. The people rallying around them may grapple with their own anxiety, grief and exhaustion. “It affected the whole family,” agrees Newman. “It was a very trying time.”Feeling powerless to protectLast January, three weeks into recovery from her own double mastectomy, Janet Parks, 62, found out that her 36-year-old daughter had breast cancer. “That was harder than my own diagnosis,” she says. “As a mother, your job is to protect your child at all costs, and I couldn’t do that.”While themajorityof breast cancers occur in women with no family history, “we know that women who have breast cancer in their family have an elevated risk”, says Dr Nan Chen, a breast medical oncologist at the University of Chicago. In fact, having a first-degree relative like a mother, daughter or sister who develops breast canceralmost doublesyour risk.Only5% to 10%of breast cancers are totally hereditary in that they result directly from a mutated gene – likeBRCA1, BRCA2orothers– passed down from parent to child, says Chen. About15% to 20%are considered “familial”, she says, meaning that while no specific gene mutation has been identified, there is still a family link.View image in fullscreenJanet Parks and her daughter, Alicia Schlossberg.A woman with a BRCA mutation facesa 45% to 85% riskof developing breast cancer by age 70, compared with theaverage lifetime riskof about 13%. Parks’s daughter, Alicia Schlossberg, inherited the BRCA-2 mutation from her mother; her chance of passing it down to her own daughters, aged 2 and 5, is50%. “I’m obviously very nervous that this is going to be their reality someday,” she says.Freed too is concerned about her daughter’s future. She inherited a BRCA-2 mutation from her father’s side, and wants to give her five-year-old daughter the choice to be tested for it when she’s older. The weight of the genetic gamble keeps her up at night, she says: “Am I borrowing all of this worry from tomorrow for nothing?”Same diagnosis, different experiencesThe median age of diagnosis is 62, but breast cancer rates in younger women aresteadily rising; about10%of new breast cancer cases in the United States occur in women under the age of 45.Younger womentend to be diagnosedwhen their breast cancer has progressed to a later stage, and with more aggressive subtypes that require chemotherapy. But beyond the practical disparities, getting breast cancer in your 30s versus your 60s is “emotionally and psychosocially a completely different experience”, Chen says.Lindsey Baker was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer in December 2020 at the age of 35. The week of Baker’s double mastectomy in 2021, her mother, Shelley Pozez, learned she had breast cancer, too.“It felt like a similar experience, but on a very different path,” says Baker. She was single, lived alone and dreaded the intricacies of dating after cancer treatment; her mother had a supportive long-term partner. Pozez, then 66, already had children; Baker – who inherited the BRCA-1 mutation, which alsoraises the riskof ovarian cancer, from her father’s side – made the tough decision to remove her ovaries, surrendering her fertility and plunging prematurely into menopause. Pozez was retired at diagnosis; Baker, who was the chief operating officer of two non-profits, worked throughout treatment, bringing her laptop to all 16 rounds of chemo.View image in fullscreenLindsey Baker and Shelley Pozez in August 2025 at a family reunion in Atlanta.Risk of recurrence is nuanced and depends on various factors. But Baker’s cancer, caught later than Pozez’s, was also growing more aggressively. “I think the chances of mine coming back are higher,” she says. “That still weighs on me differently.”Baker and Pozez diverged when it came to discussing what they were going through, too. While Baker drew solace from hearing other women’s experiences and sharing her own, her mom “was just a lot more private about it”, she says.Similarly, Freed is more candid about her cancer journey than her mother. After her mastectomy, she opted for a form of breast reconstruction calledaesthetic flat closure. “If somebody’s like: ‘Hey, what does a flat closure look like?’, I’m like: ‘Do you want me to take off my shirt?’” she says. “If my mom were in that boat, she’d be like: ‘You want me to do what now?’”Sylvia Morrison, 61, handled her breast cancer diagnosis in 2011 the way she’d seen her mother handle one several years before. “She didn’t really talk about it,” she says. “She showed no fear, no concern.” It was only when Morrison’s daughter, Monisha Parker, was diagnosed three years later at age 28 that she recognized that there might be another way.View image in fullscreenMonisha Parker and her mother, Sylvia Morrison.“I was a lot more open and willing to share my story,” says Parker, who started a blog,Purpose Painted Pink, about her experience as a young cancer patient. “I definitely think it’s a generational thing.”Morrison, whose cancer recurred in 2019, has regrets about her prior stoicism. “I’m still dealing with the mental part of breast cancer,” she says. “I’m over the physical part of it, but the mental part of it I didn’t deal with.”Watching her daughter’s response to cancer has encouraged Morrison to voice her emotions more often, in all aspects of life: “Monisha dealt with both sides of it, which I applaud her for, because she did something I didn’t do.”The benefits of mutual supportMorrison worried, would her cancer experience scare her daughter? “But I think it had the opposite effect,” she says. “Once she got over the initial shock, she was able to draw strength because I went through it.”In the spring of 2022, Allison Mertzman, now 40, was recovering from chemo and undergoing radiation for breast cancer, when she learned that her mother, Susan Pearlman, now 66, had the disease, too. “I was in such survival mode at that point that I was like: ‘Alright, hop on my boat, we’ve got to survive this together,’” she says. “We almost became teammates.”Already close, the two traded advice, words of encouragement and even post-mastectomy garments. Now that they’re both cancer-free, Pearlman says, she worries every time Mertzman goes in for a scan. “But I also know what that’s like. I feel the same thing,” she says.View image in fullscreenAllison Mertzman and her mom, Susan Pearlman.Weathering a life-changing illness alongside a loved one can often be “a source of even stronger connection”, says Goyal. At the same time, she cautions, it can also further any existing schism. “It doesn’t take away any underlying issues that may be present, and in fact can amplify them,” she says. “It depends on the dynamic.”Balancing grief and gratitudeFor Freed, facing diagnosis, treatment and survivorship alongside her mother has yielded conflicting emotions. She’s grateful that her cancer was caught early, and that she and Newman are both still here. But she grieves all the losses: her breasts, time with her daughter and a sense of normalcy she’ll never entirely get back. “It’s two very diverging feelings,” she says.Parks too understands this dichotomy; after all, her diagnosis was devastating, but it also prompted her daughter to visit an oncologist and schedule an MRI, which detected cancer that likely wouldn’t have been seen on an ultrasound or mammogram until much later.“I see it as a blessing, honestly,” she says.For Schlossberg, it’s bittersweet that something monstrous had to happen to her mother for something miraculous to happen to her.“I hate that my mom had to go through this, and I hate that we even see her cancer that way,” she says. “But it really did save my life.”Holly Burns is a writer based in the San Francisco Bay Area"

It is understood that the corporation is likely to argue that it did not have the rights to air the documentary in the US, and that the case should therefore be dismissed.The move is an attempt to see the lawsuit off before litigation costs mount. It will be greeted with relief by supporters of the BBC who have argued that its editorial independence would be called into question if it sought to settle.The Panorama programme, Trump: A Second Chance?, was broadcast before the 2024 US presidential election. It spliced together two parts of the January 6 speech he gave before the attack on the US Capitol that day.Trump’s complaint argues both that the programme defamed him and that it violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. It says the broadcast caused Trump “massive economic damage to his brand value and significant damage and injury to his future financial prospects”.The BBC will note that audiences in the US were unable to access the show via iPlayer, the BBC’s streaming platform.The corporation is also arguing that Trump could not have suffered serious reputational harm from the programme because he won the presidential election. In Florida, Trump actually increased his vote share from his previous campaigns.The lawsuit alleges that Florida residents may have been able to watch the programme using a virtual private network (VPN) or via the international streaming service, BritBox. The BBC has not responded directly to those claims.The BBC board and lawyers are still working closely on the issue. The BBC’s legal department is guiding the discussions, but the board, together with the BBC chair, Samir Shah, are understood to be closely involved.The suit also claims the documentary was distributed in the US through a company called Blue Ant Media Corporation. The company is not a defendant in the case.However, a spokesperson for Blue Ant Media said none of its buyers had aired the Panorama episode in the US, while the version it was distributing did not include the infamous edit, which had been cut out to make the programme shorter.The timing could scarcely be worse for the BBC, as it searches for a new director general. It comes after the resignation ofcurrent director general Tim Davie and head of BBC News, Deborah Turness, following the fallout from the Panorama edit.It also comes with the government officially launching the process of renewing the BBC’s charter, which will see it fundamentally re-examine whether the corporation should be part-funded by advertising or subscriptions.The spliced clips in the edition of Panoramasuggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.Shah has already personally apologised to Trump and the BBC has said it gave “the mistaken impression” that the president had “made a direct call for violent action”. However, its lawyers have argued it did not defame him.While there were no complaints about the documentary at the time it was broadcast, the edit came to light in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the BBC. His memo was sent to the BBC board earlier this year and subsequently leaked to the Daily Telegraph.At one point, Trump’s lawsuit cites former prime minister Liz Truss in support of its allegation that the BBC is “institutionally biased against President Trump”.“No less an authority than the United Kingdom’s former prime minister, Liz Truss, discussed this bias, the need to hold the BBC accountable, and the BBC’s pattern of actual malice,” it states.Keir Starmer has come under pressure to back up the BBC. Both the shadow culture secretary, Nigel Huddleston, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, urged the prime minister to use his relationship with Trump to persuade him not to pursue the legal action.Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, said it was “right that the BBC stand firm” against Trump’s claims of defamation and that he hoped “they will continue to do so”.Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally who founded the Newsmax platform, said it would prove cheaper for the BBC to settle the case.However, figures close to the BBC have urged it to fight the legal action. Former BBC Radio controller Mark Damazer said it would be “extremely damaging” to the BBC’s reputation to offer a settlement.Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer at the firm Howard Kennedy, said he believed the claim was “meritless”, but that Trump was seeking political, rather than financial, gain.“[The BBC] will plead substantial truth, no damage to [Trump’s] reputation – but it will also, at that time, file the motions to dismiss [the lawsuit],” he predicted. “There are lots of legal defects in the complaint.”Explore more on these topicsBBCDonald TrumpFloridaFactual TVTelevision industryDocumentarynewsShareReuse this content"

They would be eligible for a grant to help with the additional costs of living abroad.Any Britons studying in the EU outside the scheme would pay higher international rates, while European students at UK universities would pay fees of up to £38,000 a year.The EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds and his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, met in Brussels last Wednesday to take stock of the negotiations to date – and are believed to have got Erasmus over the line.The UK quit Erasmus afterBrexit, when Boris Johnson claimed the programme did not offer value for money. The Labour government agreed to reopen negotiations at the UK-EU summit last May, and has been seeking to bring down the cost of UK participation.Before Brexit the UK was a net contributor to the scheme, with more European students coming to Britain than UK students studying abroad.The Erasmus scheme started in 1987 as a university exchange programme but has expanded over the past decade to include work and training placements, and is regarded as an important tool of soft power and research cooperation.The UK rejoining the £23bn Erasmus scheme has been a key demand from EU capitals as part of “reset” talks, alongsidea mobility dealthat would grant young Europeans the right to live and work in the UK for several years, and for Britons to do the same in Europe.Alex Stanley, the National Union ofStudents(NUS) vice-president for higher education, said: “If the rumours are true, it is fantastic that another generation of students will be able to be part of the Erasmus programme. Students have been campaigning to rejoin Erasmus from the day we left, so if announced tomorrow, it will represent a huge win for the student movement.”The Erasmus announcement will be a boost for the government, after talks to join the bloc’s £131bn defence fundbroke down last monthwhen France demanded that the UK contribute £5.7bn to EU budgets in order for British defence firms to bid for contracts.Negotiations on food exports, energy markets and the youth mobility scheme also appeared to be stuck – but sources on both sides said they were confident that all elements of the “reset” deal would get over the line.With the public mood on the EU shifting, Keir Starmer said at a press conference in London two weeks ago that “we do need to get closer” to the EU, arguing that people would “have to be grownup” about this and to accept that it would require “trade-offs”.Government sources have told the Guardian that the prime minister is pursuing an “iterative” process with the EU – and that at the next annual reset summit, expected in the spring, there will be fresh issues on the table.Separately, the UK is negotiating ayouth mobility schemewith the EU. Tens of thousands of young British and European citizens would be given the right to live and work in each other’s countries under plans that ministers are aiming to finalise within the next year.Ministers want to secure a youth mobility scheme with the EU by the end of 2026 as part of the broader reset. Labour strategists believe there is a growing political benefit to ministers stepping up their criticism of Brexit and arguing more openly for a closer relationship with Europe.Both the Cabinet Office and the European Commission declined to comment ahead of Thomas-Symonds’ announcement on Erasmus to MPs, but Brussels sources said that the bloc was pleased to get the deal over the line.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionStudentsHigher educationBrexitnewsShareReuse this content"

Schlanger worked at the Chabad of Bondi, which hosted Sunday’s Chanukah by the Sea event, and his funeral was to be held at the centre just 1km from the site of the attack.Twenty-two people wounded in the attack remained in hospitals acrossSydney, three in a critical condition, five in a critical but stable condition, and the remainder in a stable condition.In a statement providing more details about one of the men alleged to have carried out the attack, police in the southern Indian state of Telangana said Sajid Akram, 50, attained a degree in commerce in Hyderabad, the large and bustling tech and pharma hub that is the state capital.Akram then moved to Australia in November 1998 to find work and married a woman described as of European origin, with whom he had a son and a daughter.He went back to India six times for family-related reasons, such as property matters and to visit his parents, but did not return when his father died, the police statement said.It said Akram’s family seemed unaware of any alleged “radicalisation” and local police had no “adverse record” of him before he left in 1998.“The family members have expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalisation,” the statement said.“The factors that led to the radicalisation of Sajid Akram … appear to have no connection with India or any local influence in Telangana.”Australian police said Sajid Akram and his son, Naveed, hadtravelled to the Philippines last month.The father travelled on an Indian passport, and the son on an Australian one, and the purpose of the trip was under investigation, officials said, adding that it was not conclusive whether they were linked to any terrorist group or whether they received training in that country.Reasons for Bondi suspects’ Philippines trip remain unclear, but Islamic State is active thereRead moreMeanwhile, the devastated parents of the youngest victim of the terror attacktold a memorial at Bondi beach on Tuesday eveningthat they named her Matilda because she was their firstborn in Australia.“And I thought that Matilda was the most Australian name that could ever exist,” the 10-year-old’s father, Michael, told the crowd.Michael and his wife Valentya, who requested their surnames be withheld, immigrated to Australia from Ukraine. They broke down as they addressed the crowd.“I couldn’t imagine I would lose my daughter here,” Valentyna said.Other victims of the attackinclude Holocaust survivor Alexander Kleytman, 87; dedicated and much-loved community volunteer Marika Pogany, 82, whodied “on her favourite Bondi beach”; and three people who tried to stop the shooting:Boris Gurman, 69 and wife Sofia Gurman, 61, who were shot after trying to disarm one of the alleged gunmen; andReuven Morrison, who threw bricks at Sajid Akram.– with Reuters and Australian Associated PressExplore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackAustralian police and policingAntisemitismBondi beachSydneyIndianewsShareReuse this content"

He had been living in sheltered accommodation inPeterboroughafter his release on licence in 2014, after serving 48 years in prison for the killings.The case shaped public debate on sentencing, parole and the protection of police officers.Roberts’ murders took place on 12 August 1966 in Shepherd’s Bush, west London. DS Christopher Head, 30, DC David Wombwell, 25, and PC Geoffrey Fox, 41, had stopped a van containing Roberts and his associates John Duddy and John Witney.The officers were carrying out a routine check when Roberts opened fire without warning, killing Wombwell at the scene and shooting Head in the back. Fox, who was seated in an unmarked police car, was shot through the windscreen.The brutality of the attack caused nationwide shock at a time when armed violence against police was exceptionally rare.The killings led to a 96-day search, one of the most extensive in British policing history. Roberts used his former military training to evade capture before he was eventually found sleeping rough in Hertfordshire. All three men were convicted at the Old Bailey.Capital punishment had been abolished the previous year, but the judge described the murders as “the most heinous crime for a generation or more” and imposed a life sentence with a minimum tariff of 30 years.Roberts became one of Britain’s most notorious inmates and was repeatedly refused parole amid concerns about his behaviour and associations. His eventual release in 2014 prompted anger within policing, and news of his death has renewed longstanding criticism.Matt Cane, general secretary of the Metropolitan police federation, said: “The three officers murdered by Roberts never got a chance to grow old. The life sentence for their loved ones still continues. Life should mean life if you murder a police officer in the course of their duties – Roberts should never have been freed.”Duddy and Witney both died years earlier. The case remains a defining reference point in discussions about sentencing, policing and public protection in the UK.Explore more on these topicsCrimePolicePeterboroughnewsShareReuse this content"

This is her story of multiple displacements, injury and devastation over the last two yearsAshley Kirk,Manisha Ganguly,Ed Gargan,Antonio Voce,Prina ShahandLaure BoulinierTue 16 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 02.02 ESTShareWhen 26-year-old Nour AbuShammala stepped back into her family’s apartment inGazaCity in October the rooms were gutted, the walls were damaged by bombing, and there was no water or electricity, but it was still home.Since the outbreak of war in October 2023 she has been forced to flee six times. This is her story of relentless displacement, survival and loss, told using photography and videos provided by AbuShammala and satellite imagery of a ruined Gaza.Loading...undefinedAbuShammala was a rising star in international law. A graduate of Al-Azhar\n  University and the Palestinian Bar Association, she had been selected for the\n  prestigious Bertha Justice Fellowship to document Israeli violations for the\n  international criminal Court and had enrolled for a master’s at the University\n  of Jordan.Born in Khan Younis, she grew up in a wealthy suburb of Gaza City. Her home\n  was a fourth-floor, three-bedroom, 180-square-metre apartment with a sea view.\n  She lived there with her parents, Khalil and Sahar, sister Nesma, and brother\n  Muhammad.They are a close-knit, educated family deeply involved in civic and\n  human-rights work. By Gaza’s standards, they had a privileged life.undefinedundefinedundefinedKhalilonce led a human rights associationand Sahar chairs the Palestinian Development and Women Studies Association. Nesma\n  recently graduated in computer systems engineering, and Muhammad worked with displaced\n  people until he was injured in an airstrike.undefined“I’ve lived in Sheikh Ajleen – Al-Quds Street, southwest Gaza City – since I\n  was six,” she said. “It was quiet, away from the city’s noise, with only a few\n  homes nearby.”That neighbourhood is now rubble. The grocery store she visited with her\n  sister, her school, university and mosque – a lifetime of memories – lie\n  destroyed.undefinedundefinedAbuShammala was at home in Gaza City, getting ready to meet friends for a\n  birthday celebration, when Israel invaded after theHamas attackson 7 October 2023.“I had no idea what was happening. It was a shock for all of us,” she\n  recalled, remembering waking up to the sound of rockets.Days later, Israel issued evacuation orders. On 13 October, the AbuShammala\n  family packed what clothes they could and fled south to Khan Younis, to the\n  home of her late grandfather. The car journey took around 40 minutes.AbuShammala had always loved Khan Younis, her father’s hometown. It was a\n  place of family gatherings and childhood memories. War changed that: once a\n  refuge, Khan Younis came to symbolise loss. “I am someone who has no place.\n  Someone lost from their home, knowing the way but not knowing how to return.”undefinedShe stayed mostly indoors, unable to face the destruction. “I would tell\n  myself [the IDF] were posting [photos of the destruction] only to scare us. The thought was terrifying,” she said.undefinedundefinedTwo months later, in late December 2023, AbuShammala was on the move again. After evacuation leaflets fell over Khan Younis, \nher family travelled 10 minutes by truck to a patch of land their relatives owned in al-Mawasi. Soon after, \nthey learned that her grandfather’s house in Khan Younis had been destroyed, along with much of the wider neighbourhood.It was the middle of winter, and they left in a hurry. “Later, we had to buy\n  new essentials like clothes, carpets, kitchen appliances and other basics,”\n  AbuShammala said.Five of them slept in a single 6×4-metre tent. Later, they acquired a storage\n  tent to free a little space.undefinedWinterin the tent was “unbearable”, though AbuShammala felt luckier than families with\n  small children facing the same conditions.\"We had set up a kind of kitchen made of tarps with all our kitchen items.\n  Then for about two months the gas completely ran out and we had to cook over\n  fire. It was very difficult, especially in winter, having to go outside to\n  cook or even to use the bathroom in the cold.\"There was barely any signal, so AbuShammala spent most of her time in the tent\n  reading books on her phone. She especially enjoyed Guillaume Musso novels.When her family first arrived, few others were there. But once the IDF entered\n  Khan Younis, the area filled with tents.The experience carried an echo of her family’s past. Her grandparents had fled\n  militia attacks decades earlier, surviving only because of UN tents and aid.undefinedundefinedBy 21 July 2024, the family had rented an apartment in Nuseirat, in central Gaza. \nThey moved there in a shared car, and stayed there nearly a year until thesecond trucein 2025.The neighbourhood was quieter and less damaged than most, but tents surrounded\n  their building, a reminder of how few had shelter.undefinedundefinedThere was water and electricity, so “mentally it felt easier, and even though\n  it wasn’t like being in our home, at least we felt a bit of normal life”.Yet Gaza City – normally a ten-minute drive away – felt impossibly far. “We\n  weren’t able to go to Gaza because the army initially restricted movement from\n  the south to the north,” AbuShammala recalled.Video recorded by Nour showing the family apartment in Gaza City after the warThen came thefamine, after all border crossings into Gaza were closed. “Imagine not even being\n  able to find flour to make bread. You’re forced to live on whatever type of\n  food is available, and even that is sold at unbelievable prices.“We mostly ate hummus and fava beans, and we tried to ration how much bread we\n  had so it would last as long as possible.”For AbuShammala, life in Nuseirat was survival in exile.“My love for Gaza cannot be described in words. Any destruction here feels\n  like something inside me is destroyed too. They are stealing our years, our\n  lives, our dreams and our memories”.undefinedundefinedOn 8 April 2025, AbuShammala returned to her family’s home in Gaza City to\n  find it in ruins. An airstrike had flattened part of the building. Their home\n  was burned and hollowed out.The return meant more than the destruction. She walked through the blackened\n  rooms, recalling where everything once stood – sometimes reaching for a\n  vanished bookshelf or mirror.“Even though our apartment was burned and everything inside was gone, the\n  moment I stepped back, I felt I was truly home, in my neighborhood, my city,\n  among my people. It felt like my soul had come back to me.”undefinedInside, they found bullet casings and alcohol bottles. A neighbour said\n  Israeli soldiers had stayed there, and stickers on the door appeared to\n  confirm it.The area, just north of theNetzarim corridor, had been under tight military control for months.undefinedundefinedStill, the family began rebuilding with whatever materials they could find:\n  repairing walls, covering damage and laying new pipes. They cooked over open\n  fires when gas ran out.undefinedThen, on 30 June, Muhammad was at al-Baqa café when an Israeli airstrike hit.\n  A 500lb (230kg) bomb killed 24 Palestinians.Muhammad survived, shielding his friend, journalist Bayan Abusultan, but\n  shrapnel shattered his legs, leaving him permanently disabled and unable to\n  work.The Israeli military said the strike was under review, claiming it targeted\n  Hamas operatives. Legal expertssaidthe use of such a large bomb in a civilian area likely constituted a war crime.undefinedTheir return home was disrupted after renewed evacuation orders in September. The family fled once more to Nuseirat – paying $1,600 (£1,200) to hire a truck for a two-hour journey that should have taken 20 minutes.They returned to the same apartment they’d kept paying rent for “in case\n  things got worse – which they did.”undefinedThat month was a fragile pause. AbuShammala described life as “on hold,” the\n  sound of explosions shaking the house each night. She worked when she could,\n  commuting to Deir al-Balah for her job with the Stars of Hope Society, helping\n  women with disabilities through a UN Women-funded programme.“I do feel grateful for what I still have, and I know that compared to others,\n  my family and I are considered lucky. But we still live with fear and anxiety.\n  There’s also the sense of loss that isn’t always visible, the time and years\n  slipping away.”Eleven days after theceasefire was announced on 10 October, the family returned once again to Gaza. The walls they rebuilt in summer\n  were already cracking from fresh bombings. Water and gas were scarce.Videos recorded by Nour as she walked around her Gaza City neighbourhood on her return in October 2025. Video: Nour AbuShammala“My neighborhood still needs time to heal. My school still needs time before\n  it can reopen its doors to students. And even when that time comes, nothing\n  will ever be the same again. No one can erase the memories.”Yet Gaza City still feels like home. Now, each morning, the family returns to\n  work. “We all try in our own ways, to contribute to our country and remain\n  active members of our community despite everything we’re living through.”undefinedAbuShammala and her sister walked through what was left of their\n  neighbourhood. The mosque and shop were gone; the Bar Association building was\n  badly damaged.“Every beautiful place I once knew has turned into ashes. The suffering hasn’t\n  ended. The wounds of this city are still open.”undefinedAbuShammala speaks of both hope and caution when looking to the future: “There’s a sense of relief, that the killing has stopped, the displacement has stopped, the destruction has stopped, and that there’s finally a chance to return home.“But at the same time, things are still very hard. Gaza needs a lot of time to recover, life hasn’t really come back yet. The pain and the scars are still there. There’s sadness despite everything. And Israel isn’t making things any easier, there’s always this fear that we’ll wake up one morning and the war will start again, that our home will be gone, that our dreams will be stolen once more.”Still determined to return to her career in international law, AbuShammala remembers the advice her mentor gave her when she first began: “The road to justice is long.”UN experts have concluded that Israel’s actions in Gazaamount to genocide– a charge Israel rejects.As those investigations unfold, AbuShammala’s life remains suspended, balancing daily survival and the struggle to rebuild with her hopes for education and a career beyond the war.AbuShammala is waiting for a border crossing to open so she can begin her master’s degree in Jordan – the path she set out on before the war.“Gaza is not just a place or walls for me,” she said. “It’s something alive inside me. Sometimes I wish we never woke up on October 7, that our lives hadn’t turned upside down like this. Or I wish I could forget everything that’s happened, as if I never lived through it.”For now, she remains in a broken city, with her family, trying to rebuild what’s left of their home.AbuShammala is currently writing a book about her experiences during the war.MethodologyThis project draws on multiple sources to trace where the AbuShammala family have lived over the past two years and how each neighbourhood has changed through the war.The Guardian was in regular contact with Nour and Khalil AbuShammala over a two-month period to document their story, gather imagery and verify events.Satellite imagery fromPlanetandVantorwas used to assess damage and movement across time. Images are dated within the piece and span periods before and during the conflict, with additional imagery used for verification.Reported damage was verified against satellite analysis, user-generated footage, news reports and official IDF updates. Footage provided by Nour was geolocated using identifiable landmarks and compared with satellite images. Using a combination of these visuals and archive pictures, the Guardian verified footage showing buildings before and after they were destroyed by Israeli strikes."

History suggests this will go on and onDenis CampbellHealth policy editorThe health secretary is winning the battle of public opinion but has not convinced those who matter most in this disputeTue 16 Dec 2025 14.48 ESTFirst published on Tue 16 Dec 2025 14.40 ESTShareThere are an array of numbers relating to theNHSthat, it’s safe to assume, make Wes Streeting wince.Take, for example, the number of hospital tests and treatments people inEnglandare waiting for – 7.42 million – and the number of people who need them – 6.24 million. Both have come down since Labour took power 17 months ago but still remain near worst-ever highs.There is also the proportion of A&E patients across the UK who areroutinely cared for in corridors, waiting rooms or backs of ambulancesbecause hospitals are so overcrowded: 18%. There is also the estimated number of very unwell people in England who die every year because it takes too long to find them a bed:16,600, according to the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. All very worrying statistics.Wednesday brings another set of sobering statistics for the health secretary. It will be day one of the 14th strike that resident doctors in England have staged over the last 33 months in an effort to win what is now a 26% pay rise. The five days involved will be the 55th, 56th, 57th, 58th and 59th days of what NHS bosses privately fear could, without a dramatic change, become a “never-ending” dispute.In September last year Streeting recalled to the New Statesman how he had managed to end the strikes by those who were then called junior doctors, courtesy of a 22.3% pay rise over two years. “I managed to do within three weeks what they [the Conservatives] had failed to do over more than a year, which was to agree a deal with the junior doctors.”So he thought. However, the peace – and the pause in the doctors’ campaign of industrial action – proved short-lived.A year on from that false dawn, the medics now known as resident doctors went on strike again, in July this year, for the first time under Labour. That was in pursuit of their new goal – a further 26% pay rise, albeit staged over several years. Thousands of doctors below the level of consultant went on strike for five days then and another five days last month and are now withdrawing their labour for another five days. Streeting says the British Medical Association is being unreasonable; the BMA, the doctors union,blames him for not rewarding medics properlyfor their vital work.After eight strikes under the Tories and now three under Labour, the prospects of a settlement look as distant as at any point in the last 33 months. “At this rate, this is going to drag on and on and on all next year unless something changes. It’s never-ending,” said one NHS official. His comments reflect the beleaguered mood in a service that yet again has had to cancel tens of thousands of appointments and operations, ask senior doctors to cover more junior colleagues’ shifts and plead with the public to come to A&E over the next five days only if absolutely necessary.Streeting, a politician with a talent for pithy phrase-making, has deployed a lexicon of outrage when describing the strikes. This latest stoppage could prove to be“the Jenga piece” that leads to the NHS collapsing, given the intense pressure that winter diseases are putting on it, he said. The parlous state of the public finances mean he cannot give the residents the 26% they are seeking, he has explained repeatedly. He has made three offers to expand the number of training places for resident doctors to pursue their chosen medical specialty and avoid them being left jobless. They have rejected all three, the latest by 83% to 17%in a survey this week. Progress towards a settlement seems elusive.Streeting is winning the PR battle. During the Tories’ time in office a clear majority of voters backed the pay demands. But after their 22.3% rise, the worm of public opinion has turned: YouGov reported last week that 33% support the strikes and 58% oppose them. However, he is not winning the hearts and minds of those who matter most – the doctors.BMA sources say Streeting’s increasingly dramatic comments, as residents voted on his latest offer, hardened attitudes and made it more likely to produce a no vote.One BMA source said: “There’s a determination that they don’t want to be pushed around by the government or told what to do. For some time the [government’s] thinking appears to have been that the BMA is out of step with doctors. This [83% v 17%] result means they will have to reassess that and in the new year open the door to a discussion on a multi-year pay deal.”Their 13 strikes so far have pushed two governments to give them pay rises well above inflation. They have also led Streeting to double, then double again – from 1,000 to 2,000, then 4,000 – the number of specialist training places for doctors to apply for. But the resident doctors remain immoveable, especially on the 26%.The BMA’s legal mandate to strike runs out on 6 January. Streeting and NHS chiefs hope that when they then seek members’ approval for a further six-month campaign of strikes, that enough doctors – strike-weary and tired of losing money when they refuse to work – say no. The history of this long, increasingly fractious dispute suggests they should hope but not expect that to happen.Explore more on these topicsNHSDoctorsHealthIndustrial actionEnglandanalysisShareReuse this content"

Mohammed said he discovered his nephew’s bravery through social media, coming across the video on his feed.On Sunday, two gunmen, alleged to be 50-year-old Sajid Akram and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram,attackeda Hanukah celebration on the Sydney beach, killing 15 people. One of the alleged gunmen also died.Ahmed was in Bondi on Sunday – the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he “was trying to get a cup of coffee, simple as that, and found himself at a moment where people were being shot in front of him”. Ahmed crept closer using cars for cover, before launching himself at one of two gunmen. Ahmed disarmed the attacker, pulling the rifle out of his hands and pointing it at the gunman, before laying the weapon against a tree.Ahmed received two gunshot wounds during the attack, and has been in hospital since Sunday.The act of heroism has made him famous in Australia and in Syria, where Syrians have been widely sharing the video of him disarming the gunman with pride.In Nayrab, Ahmed is the talk of the town. The small village was under the control of Syrian rebels during the country’s civil war and much of it is destroyed. Ahmed’s own home is ruined, with the roof still patchy from bombs and no windows or doors surviving.“This incident caused a global sensation. He is from Syria and he is a Muslim, and he had no motivation for doing this other than heroism and bravery,” Mohammed said.1:14Ahmed al-Ahmed, who risked his life wrestling alleged Bondi shooter, speaks in hospital – videoAnother relative recalled Ahmed as a heroic man and praised him for saving “innocent lives.”“We are proud of what Ahmed, the son of our village did … his act was heroic and no one else could have done it,” Abdul Rahman al-Mohammed, a 30-year-old resident of Nayrab, told AFP.In avideorecorded while he was being wheeled in a bed through hospital corridors, Ahmed greets his Syrian relatives in Arabic.“What can I say? I have passed through a very difficult phase, but thank God for everything,” Ahmed says while wishing specific family members well.Albanese, visited Ahmed in the hospital, shaking his hand and telling him that his “bravery is an inspiration for all Australians”. An online fundraiser to pay for his medical bills has received more than $2.3m (£1.1m) in donations, with the GoFundMe being shared around the world.0:47Alleged gunman tackled during Bondi beach shooting – videoThe attack on Bondi beach was allegedly carried out by a father and son whoreportedly underwent military trainingin an Islamist militant hotbed in the southern Philippines.The PM said Ahmed’s heroism proved that coexistence, not extremism, was the essence of Australian society.“At the best of times, what we see is Australians coming together. And what I want is for Australians to come together, for this to be reinforcing the need for us to promote national unity, and that is critical. There is no place in Australia for anti-semitism. There is no place for hatred,” Albanese said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaBondi beach terror attackMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a gritty and grounded addiction movie with a few comic elements, less ebullient than many of the movies Reiner was famous for, as well as the others he was making in the 2010s. It features then-up-and-coming stars, rather than more established figures, and way more sex and nudity than usual. And it’s the only movie co-written by Reiner’s son, Nick, whose experiences formed the basis for the screenplay, and who is nowexpected to be chargedin the murder of both his parents.Those horrific circumstances transform Being Charlie from one of Reiner’s more interesting late-period efforts into the subject of unavoidable rubbernecking. Here is a film Reiner made in collaboration with his son, in part as an obvious act of hope that the worst of his struggles would prove to be behind him. Real life was not quite so cooperative as the open-ended but vaguely optimistic resolution of a well-intentioned indie drama.Following an astonishing initial run of classics in the first decade of his directing career and some less widely beloved films in the years since, by the 2010s Reiner had seemingly settled into a groove making vehicles for ageing Hollywood stars like Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman, and Diane Keaton, presumably inspired by the commercial success of his 2007 drama The Bucket List, starring Freeman and Jack Nicholson. Being Charlie departed from those narratives, as well as from his 80s classics. Rather than welcoming identification with old timers proving they weren’t quite done living their lives, the film’s point of entry is college-aged Charlie (Nick Robinson), a kid who’s been in and out of rehab programs as his famous father David (Cary Elwes, Reiner’s leading man from The Princess Bride) looks on disapprovingly.Nick Reiner: what do we know about Rob Reiner’s son who was arrested?Read moreIn a weird and sometimes distracting tweak from real life – the kind of adjustment that calls as much attention to itself as more directly biographical details might – David isn’t a former actor and current director with an interest in politics, like Reiner was. Instead, he’s a former actor, famous for playing a pirate, played by an actor who played a pirate in one of Reiner’s movies, actually running for governor of California. (This was something Reiner himself did consider, but ultimately decided against.) It’s just referential enough to feel more like an in-joke than an analog. The elder Reiner’s abiding interest in comedy – he grew up as the son of famous comedy performer and film-maker Carl Reiner – is transposed to Charlie, depicted as having an interest in and talent for standup.That’s not to say Nick Reiner couldn’t have been interested in comedy, too, or that making up that interest couldn’t be a valid way into the story for him or his co-writer Matt Elisofon. But rewatching the film in the wake of this family tragedy, it’s queasily interesting to locate what feels most authentic, even within the confines of the movie. It’s not the family melodrama between Robinson and Elwes, nor is it the grittiest consequences-of-addiction sequences that sometimes feel tacked-on and histrionic. It’s the material occupying that uneasy middle ground, where Charlie is in rehab but itching to leave, or staying sober at a halfway house while pining for a girl he met in rehab. The other material feels like an intrusion, and in retrospect, it’s hard not to wonder whether it’s a product of Reiner prodding the movie toward a family project. Given that, it’s impressively self-lacerating – the humorless Elwes character isn’t at all flattering to the lovable-goof persona Reiner often assumed in his acting work – while still re-orienting an addict’s story into father-son redemption.‘I could watch the final 30 minutes on a loop till the end of time’: Guardian writers’ favourite Rob Reiner momentsRead moreTechnically speaking, Being Charlie does stand out from Reiner’s later-period work. It’s attentive to its young actors, just as his classics are, and its visual shades and textures are distinct from those, too (as well as from his lesser films). He was always a capable craftsman, which sometimes left him subject to the quality of the screenplays he worked with, even as he had a hand in shaping them. With writers (whether of the scripts or the source materials) as varied as William Goldman, Aaron Sorkin, Stephen King, and Nora Ephron, Reiner could preserve their voices and bring out their best. All four of those writers have countless other projects where they were not so lucky. His attempt to lavish the same sort of attention on his son is touching.And also, now, harrowing. As much as Charlie remains the center of the film, he’s imperfect not just as a person but as an attempt to understand Nick Reiner’s demons. There’s no hint of violence to Charlie, or even much emotional instability; his problems with his family and with substance abuse are familiar, empathetic, understandable.Rob Reinerhad a clear interest in the mechanics of storytelling; so many of his movies hinge on narration, stories within stories, and the narratives we use as building blocks in our lives. That story was missing something crucial here, for heartbreaking understandable reasons leading to unfathomable off-screen horror. Being Charlie once felt vaguely as if it might be eliding some greater pain. Now that pain has found it.Being Charlie is available on Tubi in the US, Amazon Prime in the UK and Plex in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsRob ReinerDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rae’s vocals are fluttery and sugar-sweet, making her an odd fit for such an abrasive song. But there was symbolic significance to Rae’s presence in a track about sticking it to the haters.“Got a lot to say about my debut,” Rae trills, “while you’re sitting in your dad’s basement!” The 25-year-old star was referring to the backlash that followed her first single, 2021’s generic Obsessed. Back then, she was widely known as one of TikTok’s original young stars, famous for her viral choreography. Her attempts to translate that fame off-platform – that much-maligned single, a role in a dud Netflix film – had only led to widespread derision. But this time, things seemed different. Her proximity to xcx and her alt-pop cool swiftly washed away the sticky juvenilia of Rae’s TikTok fame.Then came a stream of Rae’s own distinct new singles, each a delight. They recalled the glamour of Ray of Light-era Madonna, the insouciance of Britney, the misty nostalgia of Lana Del Rey; Diet Pepsi sounded like a true Lana homage, a breathy synth-pop track about lost innocence, fast cars, and the cherry-cola romance of being an American girl. Aquamarine turned up the tempo in a Europop-style banger straight out of a glitter-strewn 90s nightclub, while still infused with Rae’s girlish effervescence – a quality that was swiftly becoming her brand. Fame Is a Gun was another statement of purpose from someone intent on becoming a bona fide star: “When you shame me, it makes me want it more,” Rae sang. “I got a taste for the glamorous life!”Addison Rae: Fame Is a Gun – videoHer debut album, Addison, was co-produced and co-written by Max Martin proteges Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser – also twentysomethings who grew up with a love for 2000s pop. (To have a major-label pop debut helmed by three women is pretty much unheard of.) It was a culmination of all that the singles had teased: dreamy synth-pop that was weirder and more interesting than expected. Opener New York begins sounding floaty and fizzy, but ends in a pummelling explosion of chaos; High Fashion and Times Like These were an experimental hallucination of trip-hop and R&B. The fact that Arca remixed Aquamarine says it all.From awol to A-lister: how pop stars from Charli xcx to Addison Rae found the fun in fame againRead moreThe pleasures Rae sang about, however, were far simpler. The gauzy, romantic Summer Forever distils the vibe: how fun it is, to be “young, dumb and cute / Nothing to lose”; elsewhere, she sings about the frothy delights of materialism and the sugar rush of love. In the Rain gives a brief glimpse of what lies under the mask (“I cry only in the rain”) before she shrugs it off with a savvy ingenue’s smile: “Turning my tears into gold.” The record’s mix of hedonism and nostalgia, its proud anti-lore depthlessness and hunger for sensation, feel like very 2025 techniques for survival via distraction. Rae takes up the showgirl’s allergy to dwelling on sadness in favour of, as she put it in her album’s mood board, delivering “glitter”, “intensity”, “dance”. (The year’sother banner showgirl albumis absent from our Top 50, its more conventional sound and embittered axe-grinding failing to draw a single vote.)Rarely has a rebrand been so swift and so successful; Rae’s debut tour this year sold out in seconds. As an opener to Lana Del Rey’s show at Wembley stadium this summer, she seemed stunned to be performing to such a vast crowd: I’ve never seen a stadium so full for a support act so early, nor heard screeching as loud as when Del Rey welcomed Rae on to perform Diet Pepsi with her. Few would have seen this coming. And yet Addison has emerged as a rare bright spot in a long year, delivering a much-needed cavalcade of glitter and glamour.Explore more on these topicsCultureBest music of 2025Pop and rockAddison RaefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Amateur TikTok edits resurrect forgotten gems and turn obscure starlets into sensations; home producers fabricate entire albums if their favourite rapper doesn’t release enough. Such is the case with Doom Xmas, the brainchild of Grammy-winning Spanish producer Cookin’ Soul, which refashions the work of late cult rapper MF Doom intoChristmasmusic. There are filthy Grinch soundtrack flips, hectic Latin Christmas skits and a chopped-and-screwed Nat King Cole that’ll change the way you hear The Christmas Song.It’s an internet cult classic. Every Christmas, a carolling cohort of underground rap fans make their way to the comment sections to write something like: “They playin’ Mariah already, I’m blastin’ Doom!” And although it’s bootlegged, the tape has a strangely festive air: it’s a hit of humanity in the wake of an AI music slopticon, and a reminder that community clings on, especially at Christmas.Archie FordeMF Doom: MF Grinch (Doom Xmas) – videoMariah CareyThe one constant in all my core Christmas memories is Mariah Carey. The earliest is from when we were stuck in traffic, and I was too tiny to see anything through the car windows except kaleidoscopic lights above. Through the radio, Carey is belting out Santa Claus Is Coming to Town – far more exciting than my nursery’s version of Away in a Manger. Years later, I’m back in a car – this time with a friend who’s just passed his driving test. We spend lunchtime cruising around the residential streets near our sixth form, windows down, blasting All I Want for Christmas Is You. That evening, his mum receives an email from school warning that her son “should stop trying to impress girls”. (He’s gay.) And then there’s decorating the Christmas tree with my now-husband for the first time. Carey’s hip-hop-ified version Here Comes Santa Claus was playing; he teased me for only listening to “funky” Christmas songs. What did he expect, the Pogues? It’s been my go-to ever since.Olive PometseyVarious artists – Chante, C’est NoëlVarious artists: Chante, C’est Noël – videoIn 2003, I was 14, my middle brother 12 and my youngest five. That Christmas, we took the latter’s first trip to Disneyland Paris. I remember it being so freezing that returning home with fewer toes seemed like a genuine possibility, the Indiana Jones rollercoaster being so dead that my middle brother and I went on it twice in a row – and this infernal song.There is a daily parade in the park, and from early November, it is Christmas-themed. That year, its soundtrack was the aggressively rousing, major-chord nightmare that is Chante, C’est Noël, which I now recognise to be a sort of schlager-adjacent choral toothache. It became a running joke how much my brothers and I hated the song, one my dad capitalised on by secretly buying the CD and repeatedly,gleefullyblasting it on the long drive home as well as many subsequent car trips, despite our shrieks of objection. To this day, the intro’s jingling bells and rhapsodic cry of “CHANTE!” can still make us significantly bigger kids recoil in horror.Laura SnapesEl Vez – Feliz NavidadMove over, Mariah! The cheesiest, weepiest, silliest, booziest European Christmas bangersRead moreThanks to its prominent placement in numerous Christmas playlists on streaming services, José Feliciano’s Feliz Navidad has become a festive staple in the UK, despite the nation’s general resistance to foreign-language music: it reached the Top 20 here for the first time last year. But growing up in the Midlands in the 90s, the closest to Latin culture we got was gawping at a sizzling platter of restaurant fajitas, and so I didn’t hear Feliz Navidad until a cover version was included on a 2000 Christmas compilation by indie radio station XFM. It’s by El Vez, a Latino Elvis impersonator who sings the “I wanna wish you a merry Christmas” chorus like a man rushing around to individual audience members, grabbing their lapels and leaving them beaded with his own sweat. When I eventually heard Feliciano’s version, it couldn’t help but feel rather stiff and polite in comparison, so I always reach for El Vez’s instead, to charge me up with the giddiness of a child ripping into what Santa has left them.Ben Beaumont-ThomasQueen – Bohemian RhapsodyView image in fullscreenStriking … Queen in the video for Bohemian Rhapsody.Photograph: David Levene/Guardian VideoWe don’t really think of Bohemian Rhapsody as a Christmas song, although it was the Christmas No 1 twice, in 1975 and after Freddie Mercury’s death in 1991. The first time around, I would have been four years old, so it’s testament to how striking Bohemian Rhapsody sounds that I still remember it, albeit entirely jumbled up in my head with the way the Christmas tree in the hall of our house looked at night: a proper 1970s tree – proudly artificial, with silver tinsel branches – with its blue and red lights reflecting in the glass front door and in the baubles, which were mirrored like disco balls. I distinctly recall sitting on the stairs after Top of the Pops had finished, my head still full of Bohemian Rhapsody, staring at the tree, lost in the sparkly wonder of it all, the theme music from The Good Life – which must have been on afterwards – coming from the living room. It felt magical: the way Christmas is meant to feel, but hardly ever does.Alexis PetridisLena Horne – Jingle All the WayThe yuletide soundtrack in our house comes with a huge dollop of cheese – lounge, light jazz, the edgier end of easy listening; laid-back holiday heroes such as Dean Martin, Count Basie, Julie London, Jimmy McGriff, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald, Elvis, Peggy Lee, Lou Rawls and Nat King Cole, easing through various arrangements of the same dozen or so songs. It’s like welcoming old friends back. You won’t get any more Christmas spirited than Lena Horne’s Jingle All the Way, a lively take on Jingle Bells with orchestration best described as “big band in dub”. Try to stand still. Or for the regretfully over-refreshed, there’s always Miles Davis’s superbly cynical Blue Christmas (To Whom It May Concern). Sample lyric: “Sidewalk Santy Clauses are much, much, much too thin …” For years now 1960s lounge songs have covered our festive spectrum and understood Christmas in a way only a dry martini can hope to.Lloyd BradleyChristina Rossetti/Gustav Holst – In the Bleak MidwinterView image in fullscreenA wintry scene.Photograph: Andrew Roland/AlamyIn the 1950s, Christmas with my mum in the rambling old house in which the two of us rattled around meant fireside warmth, mother’s jokes and fears and badly wrapped but cherished presents. We shared superstitious, God-devoid minds, but the beautiful Rossetti/Holst carol In the Bleak Midwinter mesmerised me, for its snowbound atmospherics and the narrator’s childlike desire to please awesome forces. I’ve sometimes played it on guitar at neighbours’ seasonal gatherings, usually with the intro – for a cheap laugh, not a personal revelation – “It doesn’t come much bleaker than my version”. My guitar guru, the great Wes Montgomery, was also my life-changing wormhole into the musical multiverse of jazz – his 1966 Christmas cover of Baby, It’s Cold Outside with Hammond maestro Jimmy Smith is cheesy but for a fan, it doesn’t date.John FordhamExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nothing had actually been constructed of this, supposedly the first phase of a high-speed line going north. The only trace was the furtive ecological consultants mapping newts and bats and the train’s looming presence in the minds of those who lived along the route. For many, it was a Westminster vanity project, symbolising a country run against the interests of the many to line the pockets of the few. People whose homes were under threat of demolitionwere petitioning parliament, campaigning for more tunnels or hoping the project would collapse before their farms, paddocks and ancient woodlands were wiped out.The line, we were told a decade ago, would be completed by 2026. Like many of the early claims about the longest railway to be built in Britain since the Victorian era, that fact no longer stands. The fast train is running – very – late. The official finish date of 2033 wasrecently revised upwards. “The best guess is that it will begin with a ‘4’ when you can catch a train,” one well-informed observer told me. There’s similar uncertainty about its cost, but one thing is sure: it is catastrophically over budget. When complete, HS2 will almost certainly be the most expensive railway in the world. Nearly 20 years ago, HS1, the line from the Channel tunnel to St Pancras, was completed on time and on budget for £51m per mile (£87m in today’s prices). It was criticised for being twice as expensive as a high-speed route constructed in France. HS2 may cost almost £1bn per mile.A map of the HS2 routeIn 2020, construction formally began at last. The line is being built byHS2Ltd, a government-owned company funded entirely by taxpayers’ money. A decade after my first walk, I retraced my steps beside the line. I wanted to find out what had changed for the landscape and its inhabitants, and see if this reshaping of middle England was better than people had expected, or even worse.Day one: West Ruislip to the Colne valley, six milesSince the line begins with 13 miles of tunnel from Euston, I started my walk where trains will emerge, beside West Ruislip tube station on the western edge ofLondon. Over the next eight days of walking, I discovered that HS2 is the most beneficent railway in the world. What other company would lay on a minibus so schoolchildren can get to their summer jobs? Scatter rock-salt on cycle tracks so cyclists don’t slip over in winter? Buy a Christmas tree every year for a village bisected by the line? Build holts for otters? Add top-class catering facilities to a village hall that even the villagers didn’t ask for?And yet some of those directly affected by the line, whose homes have been blighted or farms sliced in half, tell of the meanness of HS2 Ltd. Its negotiators are said to refuse to pay market rates for properties, or haven’t promptly or fully compensated small businesses. (HS2 said it aimed to offer “fair and timely compensation” for property, while considering cost to the taxpayer.) Just as HS2 cuts through the middle of England, so it may be a gauge of English politics and business today: democratic and remote, profligate and parsimonious, controlling and inefficient.I followed the first of many “footpath diversion” signs out of West Ruislip, weaving through the now-derelict golf course borrowed by HS2 for various works. (The company has bought some land but taken “temporary possession” of much more. In HS2-world, temporary is a long time.)Clank-clank-clank. Jugga-jugga-jugga. Beep-beep-beep. The people living beside HS2 have endured more than half a decade of construction work.Building a railway is not easy, especially somewhere as densely populated as England. Building a high-speed railway is even harder, because the route must be as straight as possible. Complex engineering solutions are needed to navigate the intricate lacework of southern England, its roads, rivers, railways, tracks, footpaths, woodlands and wetlands. After tortuous parliamentary approval, “enabling works” were permitted to remove trees and hedgerows and reroute roads and utilities. So many roads are being rerouted that one engineer described HS2 as “a road project with a train in the middle of it”.Open gallery|0The line includes 52 major viaducts and five tunnels, totalling more than 40 miles. These expensive feats of civil engineering are being undertaken by four consortiums, combining British building giants with European companies that have high-speed rail experience. By the end of 2025, the earthworks will be nearly 70% complete. Once the “civils” are finished, which HS2 does not expect for another four years, different firms must build the track, electrics, signalling and communications, and then trial the trains. Even testing a new railway takes years.The only people I encountered on the first morning of my walk were HS2 contractors in orange PPE: sentries at access gates or strimming this or that. Employees are instructed not to talk to passersby. I passed a posse of yellow diggers, here to excavate a basin where flood water can collect. Several drivers were asleep in their cabs. It was midday.An hour’s walk north-west, South Harefield village looked tired and dusty, its roads busy with tippers and other construction traffic. It was a relief to reach the green towpath of the Grand Union canal and Colne valley regional park, a broad mosaic of woodland, lakes and farmland which is the first significant green space west of London.Five years ago, campaigners built treehouses to try to stop HS2 from destroying a swath of the park. Back then,I visited their jolly, idealistic camp, but they were eventually evicted and pursued through the courts. Trees were cleared and construction began.When I reached the pewter swoosh of the viaduct – 2.1 miles of concrete columns stretching high above the lakes of the Colne valley – I was surprised by its grace and slenderness. A paradox of HS2 is that its twin-track width is not much wider than a single-carriageway A-road but its construction gobbles up a much broader swath of land. The viaduct, the longest rail bridge built in Britain since the 1887 Tay Bridge in Scotland, had only been finished the previous week and its pale concrete was untarnished by graffiti. (The only graffito I saw that day was on a noticeboard beside a footpath. “Fuck the HS2,” it said. “The” is significant: for many, HS2 is the Man, the system, the establishment.)View image in fullscreenColne valley viaduct near Harefield.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThis viaduct looked as fine in reality as it did in the artistic impressions of a futuristic railway that sold the original vision. Conceived in the final months of the last Labour government, HS2 was designed to sweep commuters between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes and on to Leeds (one leg of a Y-shape) or Manchester (the other leg) at 250mph – faster than any high-speed train in Europe, where the quickest operating speeds arejust under 200mph. This vision, first proposed by Labour transport minister Andrew Adonis in 2010, was enthusiastically embraced by the incoming Conservative PM David Cameron. But later, as the bill became longer, the route got shorter, despite a government-commissioned review concluding it only made financial sense if built in full. TheLeeds leg was axed in 2021; theBirmingham-Manchester leg scrapped in 2023. High speeds – and HS2’s potential track speed has been revised down to about 225mph and may drop further – become pointless over short distances so HS2’s rationale has changed: henceforth it will boost capacity and ease overcrowding on the rail network.Miraculously, HS2 has retained cross-party backing throughout its troubled history, despite polls suggesting that public support has always been low. During my eight-day walk, I could not find a single person living near the line with a positive point of view. “Criminals. They’re all criminals,” said Sarah Turner, a resident in Buckinghamshire. “We hate it. It’s desecration,” said Christy Shrimp in Northamptonshire. “It’s a disaster and who is going to use it?” said Kyn Aizlewood in Warwickshire. “There are no green credentials. The distances aren’t big enough.”After an easy two-hour walk across the park, I reached the South Portal tunnel entrance, where HS2 dives beneath the Chilterns, sparing 10 miles of this area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB). Here, I entered a vast construction site, overlooked by a multi-storey block of temporary cabins, and met Alice Williams, environmental manager, and Luke Craner, landscape clerk of works.Three million tonnes of chalk from the now-completed Chilterns tunnel has been spread over arable fields, which has relieved thousands of lorries from trundling chalk around and created a 127-hectare chalk grassland with ponds in the hollows. They showed me around the slopes which, they told me, are alive with skylarks in spring and marbled white butterflies in summer. A new woodland of 30,000 trees planted in 2017, linking two ancient woods, had already grown elegantly tall.Beside the River Colne, Williams and Craner showed me 14 ponds HS2 had dug alongside a strip of new wet grassland. These little ponds were already home to wading birds, dragonflies, mayflies and purple loosestrife and water-plantain. They were surrounded by “basking banks” for grass snakes, special two-tiered “water vole breeding banks” and five “kingfisher banks” of steep soil containing nesting tubes. Craner had set up a camera trap here; within one day, a kingfisher was seen perching on the edge of a tube. We also admired a huge square pile of sticks almost as big as a Mini – an artificial otter holt with drainage tubes leading into the river.HS2 can’t win. It’s criticised for the extravagance of its environmental mitigations and also for the modesty of its “no net loss of biodiversity” target (most construction is committed to “net gain”). Craner argued the work beside the Colne showed it was going further for nature than it was legally obliged to do. “All the structures we’ve put in here are not compensation or mitigation, they are enhancements,” he said, pointing out mature trees that were earmarked for removal but were retained when the builders realised they didn’t need to take them down. “I feel lucky to work on this site.”Days two and three: Potter Row to Waddesdon, 16 milesThe railway’s route bursts out of the tunnel into the Chilterns’ AONB by a long lane called Potter Row, and heads north to the pretty town of Wendover. It bypasses the town in a “green tunnel”, where the railway is cut deep into the ground and covered over with concrete hoops and earth. On my first visit, I’d met local resident Jacky Statham here, walking her norfolk terriers along a footpath. This time, the path was closed because of the construction work, so she gave me a tour of the Misbourne valley in her car. Ten years ago, she said, people feared the whoosh of high-speed trains. Now they can’t wait for the building work to cease. It’s thousands of lorries on local roads; floodlights illuminating once-dark rural skies; endless roadworks, traffic lights, diversions. “It brings out all the wrong emotions,” said Statham. “You see a man with HS2 on his back in the Co-op and you feel like hitting them.”It is difficult, living with such upheaval.Clank-clank-clank. Jugga-jugga-jugga. Beep-beep-beep.I heard it walking through the Chiltern beechwoods and I heard it across the Vale of Aylesbury, where the chalk turns to mudstone.View image in fullscreenJoggers on Waddesdon Greenway.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianTrudging in the rain, repeatedly diverted where footpaths were closed because of this epic, linear building site, was no fun until I found the Waddesdon Greenway, a four-mile cycle and footpath constructed from Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station (on the existing London-Birmingham Chilterns line) to the National Trust property Waddesdon Manor in 2018. Even on a wet Wednesday there were joggers, coffee-clutching walkers, a rider on an e-scooter.At the outset of HS2, a cycling and walking path running alongside the whole of the route was suggested. John Grimshaw, a civil engineer who has built hundreds of miles of cycleways, was commissioned to produce a report for the Department forTransportin 2013, identifying cycling routes from London to Manchester and Leeds. A works access road has been built alongside much of HS2 to enable contractors to reach work sites. It is six metres wide and “of very high quality”, said Grimshaw. He knows because he cycled along it – chased by HS2 security. “It’s the best road in Bucks. If it had been built just 10 metres to either side, it could’ve been turned into an end-to-end cycle path.” Instead the road, which he estimates has cost £200m-300m, will have to be dug up once the line is built. More millions “completely wasted”, said Grimshaw.Day four: Bernwood Forest to Brackley, 19 milesTen years ago I met Christopher Prideaux, who described how HS2 would take 40 hectares of his land, divide his farms and swish past his very beautiful Grade II* Elizabethan manor house. Christopher died two years ago, still fighting HS2. His son David lives in their ancestral home in a rural corner of Buckinghamshire that was once the royal hunting forest of Bernwood. The ancient hedges here were as big as a train but they did not protect David, his mother, his wife and his children from a noisy building site.David said HS2 were “very responsible about honouring rights of way. We in Britain are very respectful. We obey laws. If there’s a footpath there, you respect people who want to go on it even if there’s only two of them and it will cost £20m to put a bridge across it. Those two walkers will have their bridge.” He described the HS2 staff he dealt with as sincere. They were doing their best. “We are all just endlessly rolling with the punches,” he said. He was trying to count his blessings, which included: the worst will soon be over, passing trains will be mostly behind a bank of earth. And at least it is not a motorway.David does not wish he’d sold up and left. “The house has been under single family ownership for 500 years. We’re not going to move out on the basis of a tricky couple of years.” But he did wish that the sacrifices he and his family were forced to endure were not for a massively truncated railway. “It should’ve gone from London to Edinburgh. High-speed rail is a great idea. The shorter it gets, the dafter it is.”Walking close to HS2 proved impossible through the ancient forest of Bernwood, so I got a lift with Caroline Thomson-Smith to a farmyard where we could join a footpath to Sheephouse Wood, site ofthe infamous bat tunnel. Thomson-Smith was “a middle-aged, middle-class housewife-cum-hairdresser” before she was radicalised, in 2019, when she heard about a campaign by residents of Steeple Claydon to stop HS2 removing trees. “I was shocked and horrified by what I was hearing – not just the disregard that HS2 had for the law, the audacity, but the way the residents were being impacted: homes taken under compulsory purchase, land taken under ‘temporary possession’. They were powerless. They were downtrodden, depressed, stressed.”View image in fullscreenAn HS2 site near Twyford, close to David Prideaux’s home.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianSoon afterwards, in December 2019, contractors for HS2 entered Calvert Jubilee nature reserve and, without permission, removed trees that contained roosting bats. Thomson-Smith joined direct action campaigners. “We’d have family protests. We’d have children with us, and banners.” HS2 security wore balaclavas, which was “completely unnecessary”. In places such as Poor’s Piece, a fragment of ancient woodland close to where HS2 crosses the new East West Rail line, she believes direct action helped save some trees from the chop.We walked through Sheephouse Wood to where the railway brushes its edge.Clank-clank-clank. Jugga-jugga-jugga. Beep-beep-beep.The wood has been designated a site of special scientific interest, a nationally important site, because its ancient trees are home to colonies of rare barbastelle bats. The high-speed trains will block foraging routes, which is why the railway is being covered as it passes Sheephouse. This bat tunnel was cited by Keir Starmer as an example of how environmental protections can hamper development. On the day I visited, curved concrete sections of the tunnel were being lowered into place by six cranes. The construction had left the edge of the wood a mess.Mark Wild, HS2’s chief executive, has defended the tunnel, telling MPs that it was “not the case that the engineers have gone away with the fairies. These are engineering responses in some of the most sensitive bits of the country.” They couldn’t be avoided, he said, because of high-speed’s requirement for arrow-straight alignment. Yet the tunnel has even frustrated environmental campaigners. “They cut down bat roosts to build the bat tunnel,” Thomson-Smith said. “It’s maddening the way politicians talk as if it’s environmentalists that are causing money to be wasted.”Supporters as well as detractors mostly agree on the causes of HS2’s spiralling cost. Wild himself believes the build began too early: HS2 should have spent much longer surveying and planning and then there would have been less muddle, revision and delay during the build. The initial “costs plus” contracts for construction were disastrous: a budget was agreed for each section, but rather than the standard penalties or agreements to split costs of unanticipated complexities, the government guaranteed it would pay almost all unforeseen expenditure. This didn’t simply remove the incentive for contractors to reduce costs – it incentivised overspending.HS2 is now undergoing a “reset” under Wild, who did a similar troubleshoot on London’s Crossrail before its successful opening as the Elizabeth line. It is cutting more than 300 permanent corporate roles to become “a simplified, more cost-effective company” and is “relentlessly” focusing on “improving productivity, without compromising on safety”. A spokesperson said it was also “aiming to secure a better commercial deal with suppliers” that will reduce costs and increase productivity.Many argue HS2 is proving so expensive because of its original aspiration to be faster than other European high-speed railways. This led to its very straight alignment, requiring expensive engineering – tunnels, cuttings and earth mounds – where it met villages or ancient woodlands.The human costs of HS2 are also mounting up. As well as homes being demolished (including several hundred flats in Camden, north London), hundreds of farms have been divided by the line. Farm tracks have been closed for months or even years while replacement bridges are built. Near Sheephouse, I bumped into a cattle farmer of 54 years who said the HS2 construction work had displaced badgers living further down the valley. New badgers had moved on to his land and introduced TB to his cows. He lost a prize bull and a long bloodline of good cattle.View image in fullscreenSloes in a hedgerow near Chipping Warden.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianClose to where HS2 crosses East West Rail, I met Maggie Higgins, owner of Rosehill Farm, which, with its ancient wooden barns and orchard, must be the most scenic dog kennels in England. Higgins won a small victory in the summer of 2024. HS2 said a newly completed road bridge over the railway linking the farm to their local village of Steeple Claydon wasn’t ready to be opened, and the six-mile diversion could not be cycled by the schoolchildren who were working at the kennels over the summer holidays. Higgins asked if HS2 security staff could usher the kids on their bikes over the bridge at an appointed hour but HS2 said no. Eventually, it provided a minibus for the kids and other villagers, who could pre-book it to get around the diversion. “Sometimes the driver did nothing else all day,” said Higgins. “Isn’t that a waste of money?” (An HS2 spokesperson said: “That’s not a waste of money – that’s evidence of how seriously we took the impact of the closure on the local community.”)Days five and six: Radstone to Southam, 20 milesBeyond Buckinghamshire, the line flashed briefly into Oxfordshire and then through Northamptonshire, where the countryside became rolling fields of wheat and copses. I fell in love with this region when I walked through it a decade ago. Back then, I pre-emptively mourned the loss of peace I imagined that HS2 would bring.This time, after my sixth day of walking, I spent a night in a converted stables on the farm near Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire belonging to Jazzy Banister, who farms with her father and mother. “Time is the main stress,” said Banister. “There’s a whole wall of HS2 paperwork in my office. They send you thousands of letters and there are meetings and you need an agent to help. There’s not enough time in the day to sort it all out.”The Banisters’ farm has been severely affected by HS2 – the best land taken, fields divided, flooding, faff, constant disruption. And yet the wider landscape still looked beautiful as dusk fell. To the east, no houses or lights were visible, just fields, hedgerows and woods. To the west, HS2 glittered on the horizon like the vast encampment of an invading army. This place represented the miracle of much English countryside: there was still such beauty and tranquillity so close to major towns, roads, industry. Descending Frog Lane and crossing the boggy valley where HS2 will thunder into Warwickshire, I stumbled across a family of weasels, squeaking as they bounced into a hedge.Day seven: Southam to Kenilworth, 12 milesIn leafy Warwickshire, HS2 tunnelled beneath Long Itchington Wood but refused to spare another ancient wood, Cubbington, which has been bisected by the line. I was taken on a tour by HS2 ecologist James Segar of the mitigation woods planted next to the line, and saw the miraculous survival of the stump of thetranslocated Cubbington pear, believed to be the second-oldest pear tree in the country. Its leaves were burnished with autumnal oranges and reds just as they were when I admired the original tree 10 years ago. Most Cubbington locals I spoke to still grieved the lost section of wood, but one spoke of her delight in finding bluebells and wood anemones blooming again in the soils that HS2 moved from the ancient wood. Translocating ancient woodland soil is dismissed by some conservationists as tokenistic but, in some landscapes, HS2’s scars are starting to heal.View image in fullscreenCubbington Wood, an ancient woodland affected by HS2 development.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianClank-clank-clank. Jugga-jugga-jugga. Beep-beep-beep.Ten years ago, north of Cubbington, I stumbled across Bob Edwards’ magnificent birds of prey in an aviary behind a cottage on busy Leicester Lane. He was a falconer with a smooth, deep voice like a radio DJ, and he feared the railway would prevent him from taking clients and his raptors on to surrounding farmland to hunt rabbits. He was now 80 and living, literally, in the shadow of HS2. A vast crane loomed over his cottage. Behind the cottage was a huge bank of earth for the rerouted Leicester Lane.Edwards was one of hundreds of HS2-affected residents to petition parliament, standing before a select committee of MPs in 2016 to explain how his livelihood would be affected. The committee specifically asked HS2 to solve his problems. “In principle, I won my case,” he said. MPs told HS2 to “pay this man for what he is claiming and do it swiftly”, Edwards remembers. “There is no time limit on ‘swiftly’. They just did precisely nothing.”As directed by the MPs, HS2 bought his home in 2019, and he now rents it from them. He stayed, initially, because he was still flying his birds. But HS2 taking over surrounding farmland has meant the rabbits disappeared and he could no longer practice falconry. His birds have died of old age, but he hasn’t been able to move house because his wife is seriously ill. “It would be a catastrophe to move her. It would kill her,” he said. HS2 offered him £16,000 for “loss of business” over 15 years, which Edwards said is far below his genuine losses. They haven’t managed to agree a final compensation figure. Why has HS2 been so slow to resolve his claim? Is the railway waiting for him to die? “It would appear so,” he said.According to HS2, business owners must show evidence of loss of earnings. “We continue to seek a resolution to settle this claim,” said an HS2 spokesperson. “To support Mr Edwards, we suggested that he seek the support of an independent advocate to assist him in dealing with the process. An advocate was appointed in April 2025, the cost of which is being borne by HS2.”View image in fullscreenA newt fence near Cubbington Wood.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianEdwards seemed calm. “Boiling up wouldn’t do much good,” he said. “It’s just the way of the world. Joe Public doesn’t stand a chance. It’s all going against us but I’m a fighter and I absolutely abhor injustice.”Day eight: Kenilworth to Birmingham, 11 milesMy final day of walking began on a misty morning, as I headed from the small town of Kenilworth towards Birmingham Interchange, the planned Birmingham-edge station that will be HS2’s first stop after London. I detoured via Kenilworth’s parkland golf course. The morning golfers, men of late middle age hauling clubs from the boots of sports cars, were sanguine. The line deferentially skirts the course, no damage done, except their mornings aren’t as peaceful. “You’d have to be a poor golfer to blame the [building] noise for your shot,” said one. He and his mate appreciated how HS2 built a new two-mile cycle path between the villages of Burton Green and Berkswell, and its maintenance crew even scattered rock salt in the winter to stop the path icing up. “Which other country would do that?”It was a pleasant 90-minute stroll to Burton Green, the only village actually bisected by HS2. Its “Stop HS2” banners had disappeared; instead there was a banner saying “Save this view! No housing here.” I saw new houses going up all along the line; locals said the construction didn’t seem to put off buyers if the properties were 200 metres away.Burton Green was home to a £2.5m village hall, built by HS2 after the old one had been demolished. Villagers obtained a vast, light-filled hall with blond wood floors and a catering-standard kitchen. This was not something they were expecting, said Cheryl Wall, who I met outside the hall. “That’s been the positive. The negatives are all the disruption – noise and traffic and the road being closed.”I chatted to Chris Langton, a retiree, by the bridge that will take Burton Green’s main road over a 0.8-mile green tunnel where the line bisects the village. The threat of HS2 “really acted as a catalyst for the community”, he said. He got to know loads more people. HS2 is obliged to buy the homes of anyone wanting to sell within 120 metres of the line. It now owns about 36 houses in Burton Green. Those renting houses from HS2 tend to be younger, with families, said Langton, so that’s been good for the community, too. And HS2 buys the village a Christmas tree every year.Buoyed up by his making-the-best-of-it attitude, I enjoyed strolling the ice-free HS2 cyclepath from Burton Green to Berkswell. But beyond Berkswell, I found the countryside slashed by a bewildering swirl of motorways, dual-carriageways, pylons, fences, factories and further construction. Squadrons of diggers and dumpers were turning greenbelt around England’s second city into brown and grey. A time-traveller from any previous decade would see this colossal, frenzied construction and assume the 2020s heralded an enormous economic boom. We would have to gently explain that this was a different stage of capitalism: all this striving mess for … virtually no economic growth.View image in fullscreenRoad signs near HS2 works.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianI was forced into my car to reach Middle Bickenhill, the site for HS2’s Birmingham Interchange. Ten years ago, I found an elderly lady living on the lane here who felt “patronised and ignored” by HS2. The new station would be 200 metres from her home. Returning, I feared the worst. Surely her cottage would be abandoned, stranded in Arden Cross, a new development connected to the new station. The site was still earthworks, but developers were promising “thousands” of new homes, as well as shops and “a unique health-tech campus” that would represent “a £3.2bn opportunity to drive substantial growth”.Clank-clank-clank. Jugga-jugga-jugga. Beep-beep-beep. My path was blocked where the lane was severed by construction work. An HS2 worker blanked me at the fence.When I found the cottage, it looked lived in. I called out to a man working in a shed. Beaming, Darren Harding came over. The elderly lady was his aunt. She passed away a year ago. Since then, he’d spent almost every day renovating her cottage “as if she was still here”.Concrete: the most destructive material on EarthRead moreHere, finally, was someone who amid this ugly, destructive building effort could find their own peace, and sense of optimism. “I’ve been coming here since I was a lad,” said Harding. “I love it. You get to the top of the road and the world is 100mph flat-out going nowhere and this is a little bit of tranquil.” The other morning, he’d had three deer on the lawn and seven pheasants in the garden, whose mature trees and shrubs screen much of the building site all around. Owls visit at night.He showed me around his careful restoration and the view of what will become HS2’s Birmingham Interchange from the upstairs bedroom. The train is “supposed to be silent so hopefully it will be”, he said. The cottage will become Harding’s retirement home. “Me and my wife can walk to Resorts World [a retail and entertainment centre] and have a meal, go shopping, but no one knows we’re here,” he said. “Although we’re in the middle of a building site, we’re maintaining a bit of heaven.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere."

After 46 years in the health service, no better time for an exit interview with a leading NHS trust chief executive, who has seen the best and worst of it. Nick Hulme is in brutal truth mode. He has one foot out of the door of hisEast Suffolk and North Essex NHS foundation trust, just as the resident doctors strike for the 15th time, amid a rampant flu crisis. Buthe’s off, his time is up.“I can’t remember a time when the NHS was at such risk,” he says. Labour has put in more money and staff, productivity and activity has risen a bit, waiting times down a bit, yet waiting listsstay stubbornly high. “That’s dangerous ammunition for Nigel Farage and the Conservatives,” says Hulme, “a narrative for people who want to kill the NHS.”View image in fullscreenNick Hulme. ‘He has survived many a 10-year plan, forgotten in a year or two, but enthuses about Wes Streeting’s 250 neighbourhood health centres.’Photograph: Pagepix LtdPrivate practice is soaring, but it fell steeply when Labour last cut waiting to historic lows. That could happen again. He says that at the “top of Bupa’s risk register is the danger that NHS waits fall”. He scorns politicianspromoting “choice”, when that would require spare capacity, and at the moment the system is running red hot. He’d be tougher on consultants keeping their lists long to fuel demand for their private practice, but the BMA andRoyal Colleges, with their professional silos, are hard to confront. “Look how theyoppose physician associates, used widely across Europe,” he says.He laments how in the pandemic everyone did everything, out of silos, acting up and acting down collaboratively: he thought it was a new dawn, but afterwards they went straight back to their restrictive practices. Once a shop steward for the now defunct National and Local Government Officers’ Association(Nalgo) trade union, he knows about demarcations. He started out as an 18-year-old porter, rising to a brief (unhappy) time inside Boris Johnson’s No 10.Our conversation covers familiar NHS territory of forever dilemmas and paradoxes. He is full of enthusiasm and frustration, strong conviction and infinite exasperation, struggling to make the system work despite rotating politicians with spinning targets, austerity and reorganisations. Hulme is exceptional, yet typical of many of the best public servants, confronted like them with the effects of poverty and inequality beyond his doors. His trust has a delightful cottage hospital in affluent Aldeburgh, worth a fortune if he dared sell it, boasting a dementia-friendly “peaceful sensory garden” kept by its many volunteers, who collected £320,000for a new X-ray machine. But his patch includes the poorest places, too: Jaywick and Clacton. “What couldn’t we do for Jaywick with those scanners. They have fewer GPs, too,” he says. A Clacton family just told him they wouldn’t go for smears or screening, as it took three bus rides with small children.These facts about warpedNHSspending priorities are hard but not impossible to change, he thinks. Poor places get less, the older patients dominate resources, maternity and children are neglected, shifting funds to prevention looks near unattainable when the public always demand more treatment. He says 70% of patients in his beds are over 65, with 75% suffering the diseases of poverty – smoking, obesity, diabetes, missed early diagnoses “and poverty itself”. The NHS spends expensively on the effects of poverty that could be more cheaply prevented. He would run a social priority list, treating “the Clacton postman’s knee, off work for a year, run out of sick pay, before getting the retiree back on the golf course”.Wes Streeting’s gamble with the NHS is greater than any play for Downing Street | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThe day we talked at Colchester hospital, he was bristling over an infuriating Care Quality Commission inspection after an interview checking if his trust is “well-led”. “But whatever their judgment, I’ll be gone!” The last inspection found Colchester “requires improvement”. That grates. He agreed reluctantly to add to his trust a hospital Jeremy Hunt called “the worst in England” and did well to lift it out of “special measures”. Marked down over documentation, he asked the inspector, who had no background in acute hospitals: “But did you encounter any poor care? ‘No’, he said.”Nothing is easy. His gleaming new £90morthopaediccentrehas mostly private-style single rooms, en suite. “But that costs 30% more in nursing than bigger wards.” He is disappointed that fast-flowing throughput hasn’t raised productivity more: some surgeons do four operations when they used to do three, others still only do three but could do five, under scrutiny from the new Epic electronic data system. “Why do some wards turn around an empty bed in 20 minutes, others take three and a half hours?” It relieves stress in a ward to keep beds empty, but people wait in corridors. “NHS work was easier when I began, and more fun,” he says. “Most patients weren’t very sick, staying in for two weeks after a hernia.” Pressure to raise productivity means chasing every unforgiving minute: electronic labels halve the time to take a blood test. “But what do they do with that extra time? Chat or do more tests?” he says.View image in fullscreenNick Hulme with the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, at Colchester hospital during the Covid pandemic, May 2021.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty ImagesThe orthopaedic centre is still not full: that requires the integrated care board – a local control system undergoing yet another interminable restructure – to close units in district generals to send patients here for better specialist treatment. Will that happen? He sighs, recalling a time he closed a dangerous A&E in a small hospital: it took 42 public protest meetings led by a local MP, and many doctors admitted in private the unit was unsafe, but not in public. He jokes that he would be a new Beeching (the man who shut more than 2,000 railway stations) closing district general units, to send patients to further off specialist centres. But others plead convincingly too for the decentralised familiar local.He has survived many a 10-year plan, forgotten in a year or two, but enthuses about Wes Streeting’s250 neighbourhood health centres. However, remembering similarclinic plansin Ara Darzi’s 2008 report, experience makes him wary: “Will hospitals swallow up all the money again?” A rumbling under AneurinBevan’s founding principle worries him most. “Unless the NHS improves fast, people will fall for charlatans offering snake oil alternatives. This is the best system, but not producing the best results.” He departs with hopes and fears – and sharp words for privileged resident doctors. “Not many have such a guaranteed very good job and pension for life, starting at £38,000, £109,000 once fully trained.” He thinks they forget their privileged state, out of touch with what others earn in the NHS.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionDoctorsHospitalsHealth policyHealthWes StreetingPrivate healthcarecommentShareReuse this content"

My son thinks [sic] “old people have a massively inflated idea of how much things are worth”, so he would never flog anything on my account, lest he get tainted with oldness. It was hard to know where to start on this argument, between “maybe we just have nicer stuff”; “the worth of everything is determined by the price people will pay for it, in a citizen economy”; and “I am not old”.My daughter, conversely, is happy to funnel her wares through me, which is how I arrived at peak Vinted, its very spirit in a single item: I posted a bag of random tat for £2. It sold within five minutes.The one change that worked: I adopted a one-in, one-out wardrobe policy and rediscovered my love of clothesRead moreThis wasn’t a lucky dip. I was scrupulously transparent about what was in it: a single earring; some hair clips; a ring in the shape of a snake that had gone a funny colour; necklaces with that telltale unfixable knot of the truly cheap jewellery item; a different single earring. The first was a tiny cocktail, the second was a slice of cake, so I guess, if you squinted, you could bill them as a themed pair, “elements of a hen night”.I have never wanted so much to engage in dialogue with a buyer: what quixotic ideas had led them to want all this? What was their hair like? Were serendipitous forces at play, wherein they had the matching earrings or a love of fixing the unfixable? What on earth were they seeing in this rubbish that made them think it treasure even to the value of two pounds? You’re not really meant to interrogate people, though, so I just had to sit there and muse about them.In the event, I mused for so long that I didn’t send it in time and the sale was cancelled, as was that of the three tiny shampoos, brand new in the box (what were the chances?) and a Google Home device whose resale value is astronomically low. So it’s back to square one; is it possible to sell a bag of random tat twice?Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFashionOpinionE-commerceAppsInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

No wonder voters are turning on himTue 16 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 06.02 ESTShareTrump gave what was billed as a “Christmas speech” in rural Pennsylvania this past week that began with his “wishing each and everyone one of you a very merry Christmas, happy New Year, all of that stuff” and boasting that now, under his presidency: “Everybody’s saying ‘merry Christmas’ again.”He then claimed – contrary to the experience of nearly everyone in the crowd – that he had gotten them “lower prices” and “bigger paychecks”. He alsoassertedthat anyone having difficulty making ends meet should just cut back on buying stuff. “You can give up certain products. You can give up pencils … Every child can get 37 pencils. They only need one or two,” he said, adding: “You don’t need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice. You don’t need 37 dolls.”It’s rich – Trump preaching austerity while raking in billions from his crypto investments.“The only thing that is truly going up big, it’s called the stock market and your 401(k)s,” Trump continued, apparently unaware that 92% of the stock market is owned by the richest 10% of Americans while most Americans own no stock at all. Justover a thirdhave a 401(k), 403(b), 503(b) or Thrift Savings Plan.He was supposed to talk about affordability, but Trump’s narcissistic brain seemed incapable of the minimal empathy to recognize the public’s angst over the cost of living. So he veered far off the affordability script to attack Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota congresswoman, ridicule windmills, mock transgender people, and call Joe Biden a “son of a bitch”.Small wonder that most voters have had it with Trump. Even the Maga faithful are starting to have second thoughts.In Miami this past week, voters delivered the mayor’s office to a Democrat for the first time in nearly 30 years and rebuffed the Republican candidate, whom Trump endorsed – by a whopping 59% to 41%. Miami’s new mayor-elect, Eileen Higgins, said the city is “at the tip of the spear” of affordability concerns in America.In Indiana this past week, Republican senators rejected a redistricting plan that Trump had tried to bully them into accepting. He threatened to primary legislators who didn’t go along and even whipped up supporters to pressure them (including so-called swatting of their homes– hoax reports to provoke a police response – and even some reporteddeath threats).It didn’t work. Twenty-one senators from the Republican majority in the Indiana senate and all 10 senateDemocratsvoted it down.Even congressionalRepublicansare starting to desert him as they see that the wannabe emperor has no clothes: his ability to hurt or help them in next year’s midterms is rapidly diminishing.They’ve rejected his demand to end the filibuster, rebuked his incipient healthcare plan, forced him to cave on the Epstein files, won’t approve his bonkers $2,000 tariff checks for Americans, fret about his boat strikes off the coasts of Central and South America, and are in open rebellion against his hand-picked speaker of the House.Trump won’t steal Christmas, but it’s looking increasingly likely that Christmas will steal Trump.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Only a model that gives them hope will halt the populistsTue 16 Dec 2025 07.22 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 12.15 ESTShareHow much does Europe’s future resemble its gruesome past? That question was already pressing before Donald Trump retook the White House, and turned support for the European far-right “patriotic” parties into US policy. That is, of course, what his newly published National Security Strategy means, committing the US to “cultivating resistance” in European nations against the supposed “civilisational erasure” represented by immigration.With or without US interference, far-right authoritarianism is now an entirely plausible European future, unless there is drastic change. After all, it is already the US’s present reality. American exceptionalism once held that such an outcome was impossible in the world’s oldest continuous constitutional republic, with its system of separation of powers and no history of despotism. Yet the country is now ruled by a self-styled king, centralising executive power, weaponising the justice system,attacking civil societyandneutralising the media.The advance of the far right rests on a simple, corrosive premise. Since the financial crash, western publics have been encouraged to believe they are trapped in a zero-sum game, forced to compete for ever-diminishing resources. The far right’s message is brutally straightforward: if there is not enough to go around, why are “our” scarce resources being handed to migrants? Remove the undeserving competition, it argues, and the “indigenous” population will flourish once more.The facts say otherwise. On average, foreign arrivals are net contributors to European economies.Between 2014 and 2018, for instance, migrants contributed about €1,500 more per capita than European-born citizens. In Germany, without migrants thelabour force would shrink, condemning the country to an even deeper economic malaise.Facts, alas, mean little in the so-called immigration debate, particularly when mainstream politicians respond to far-right advances by echoing their language and demonising migrants – assisted by inflammatory and often deceitful media coverage. Economic pain provides rich fodder for demagogues, especially when people struggling to get by are persuaded that there is no alternative to the system producing that pain.After the cold war ended, the public was told that all plausible alternatives to neoliberal economics had vanished. Rolling back the state, cutting taxes on the wealthy, deregulation and weak unions were presented as unavoidable facts of life. Politicians insisted that globalisation had stripped them of agency: the markets now ruled supreme. Following the financial crash, the German-led eurozone imposed crippling austerity across the continent. When Greece’s Syriza government dared to rebel against this disastrous experiment, it was subjected to a bruising punishment – designed to deter others from following the same path.In France, voters hearPresident Macroninsist that they must work longer to preserve their social entitlements. Little wonder, then, that some are drawn tothe far-right National Rally’s promise to “reserve social assistance for French citizens”, or to“make all French citizens privilegedin their own country”.In Austria, as unemployment rises, claims that migrants steal jobs and drain social security echo ever more loudly. In Britain, a Labour government argues that support for pensioners and disabled people can no longer be afforded.No wonder Nigel Farage’s claimthat “[Keir] Starmer is choosing migrant benefits over winter fuel for pensioners” finds a receptive audience.The German elite long saw the economic travails of other Europeans as evidence of their fecklessness and irresponsibility. Yet Germany itself pursued a model built on wage suppression in the name of competitiveness, an almost religious devotion to balanced budgets, and chronic underinvestment. Add the shock of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the results are stark: growth has evaporated, living standards are under strain and the far-right AfD is surging, finding eager listeners for its message of prioritising struggling “natives”.Europe is a continent soaked in pessimism.Nearly two-thirds of German consumersfeel negative about the national economic situation. As political elites fail to deliver sustained improvements in living standards, security or the public realm, faith in democracy collapses. Just a quarter of voters in Britainare satisfiedwith how democracy works; in France, fewer than one in five feel the same.Across the continent, both the centre right and the centre left have left voters feeling trapped in a zero-sum world. Yet the reality is starkly different. The EU’s nearly 500 billionaires alone control €2.3 trillion in wealth. In thefirst six monthsof this year, their combined fortunes grew by more than €2bn a day. That the wealth created by millions of European workers is siphoned off into the assets and bank accounts of a tiny elite is not a law of nature; it is a political choice. But when it is treated as unavoidable, ordinary people understandably conclude that their survival depends on reducing competition for scarce resources – fuel for the far right’s rise.The stigma once attached to the far right, born of Europe’s nightmarish experience with fascism, has largely evaporated. The so-called cordon sanitaire – the idea that forces beyond the centre right are illegitimate – has been incinerated.The comforting belief that western democratic institutions, culture and history automatically offer a bulwark against authoritarianism should be buried. It is tempting to think that Hungary’s descent – its hollowing-out of democracy, the slow strangulation of independent media and civil society – could only occur in countries with a history of dictatorship. Trumpism bulldozes that illusion. It now seeks to use the power of a flailing hegemon to export the same fate across Europe.We face a stark choice. Either we end an economic model that condemns millions to insecurity and stagnation – or we risk losing democracy itself. The warnings could hardly be more explicit. Our failure to heed them may leave generations to regret the consequences.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsThe far rightOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeMigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

While I am not quite as hardcore as the American virologistJonas Salk, who injected the polio vaccine into himself and his family before large-scale trials, this scientific inquiry has involved some personal pain. You see, I have spent the last month trying to smile like Zohran Mamdani. This is not, as I have discovered, an easy feat.Ever since the incoming mayor of New York became a household name, I’ve been intrigued by his perma-smile. His detractorscall him a “jihadist”, and he smiles. He meets Donald Trump, and he smiles. Some Republican lawmakerslaunch a campaignto investigate his path to citizenship and deport him? He keeps on smiling. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen him look angry.Do his cheekbones permanently ache, I started to wonder? Did the wind change when he was grinning once, forcing his face into that position? And does smiling that much trick him into feeling happy despite the fact that the world is a raging dumpster fire?There’s actually been much debate on that last point, conducted by people with rather better credentials than myself. Some studies say, yes, you can smile yourself happier, and others say you can’t. A more recent study suggested that yes,smiling can slightly improve mood. But only to a limited degree. You can’t, for example, smile yourself out of depression. If only.I can’t say with certainty why Mamdani grins all the time but I suspect the reasons aren’t particularly uplifting. The thing is, not everyone is allowed to be angry. When you’re brown or black and growing up somewhere where you are a minority, you soon learn that your emotions are constantly policed. You learn that while white men’s anger issometimes seen as righteous, your rage is always wrong. And you learn that you don’t even have to be angry for people to perceive you as such. According to research by theAmerican Psychological Association, for example, prospective teachers appear more likely to misperceive black children as angry than white children. Racialised people have always been seen as more emotional and unstable. “Sullen peoples / Half devil and half child,” Rudyard Kipling wrote in his 1899 poem The White Man’s Burden.There is also a gender rage gap. I’m not sure there is a woman on earth who hasn’t been instructed to “smile!” by some random man, who thinks the fairer sex should always be affable. Even Hillary Clinton waspublicly told to smileby news host Joe Scarborough in 2016, after she’d won the Democratic primaries. And the pressure to be nice, to smile all the time, compounds when you are a woman of colour. Serena Williams has repeatedly battled the trope of the “Angry Black Woman”.Repressing your rage all the time isn’t healthy – but it’s also true that joy can be an act of resistance. What interests me about Mamdani is how subversive his grin is. Many of his critics, I suspect, would like nothing more than to see him get angry. To see him lose control, get flustered, so they can point and say: “Look at this angry brown man. Look how scary he is.” They’re still saying all that, of course, but it doesn’t exactly land when he looks like a puppy dog.Back to my science experiment. My month of constant grinning didn’t come easily because I’ve got a bit of a scowl when my mood is neutral, and can’t control my facial expressions in other circumstances. I’ve tried to keep my expression deliberately impassive in the past, but it just looks like I’m constipated. Once I got the hang of the perma-smile though, I did find it quite a useful way to stay composed in difficult circumstances. I’m obviously not being yelled at all the time like Mamdani is but I’ve been on a few panels about Gaza recently, where I’ve been asked outrageous questions by people who are strongly anti-Palestinian.“Channel Mamdani, channel Mamdani”,I thought to myself on those occasions and tried my hardest to smile nicely.My scientific conclusion? The smiling did help lower my heart rate; it’s a good way to emotionally reset. But it also made my cheeks ache and resulted in some dreadful pictures of me. So while I’ve got the Mamdani grin in my back pocket for tough occasions, it’s back to my usual expression for now.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionUS politicsNew YorkMental healthcommentShareReuse this content"

Labour’s plans for apprenticeships and training funds will turn this aroundPat McFadden is secretary of state for work and pensionsTue 16 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 11.17 ESTShareNeglect is a political choice, and one with deep human consequences.That is what has struck me in the early months as secretary of state for work and pensions. Graph after graph, slide after slide, all pointing upwards, on young people out of work, on mental health issues among the population, and on the decision by default as much as design that the response should be benefits rather than changing lives.Is this response good enough? It can keep body and soul together but it doesn’t change lives. People don’t live in a spreadsheet. There are human consequences to growing youth inactivity as well as financial ones. The number of young peoplenot in education, employment or training(Neet) grewby almost 50%between 2021 and 2024. The proportion is highest in the north-east and north-west of England, followed by the East and West Midlands, and those citing sickness and mental health problems has increased by 76% since 2019. Doing nothing would be to continue the pattern.Former John Lewis chair Charlie Mayfield – who headed ourKeep Britain Working review– has found that a young person on benefits loses out on around £1m in earnings over their lifetime and it costs the state a similar amount to support them. The work aspirations studypublished earlier this yearshowed that a majority of people on health and disability benefits suffer from low self-esteem and sense of worth.With a million young people locked out of work, the UK’s hidden jobs crisis is only growing | John HarrisRead moreThe bottom line is, we invest too much in failure and not enough in changing lives.And this is compounded by technological change in the labour market. Talk to any group of teenagers right now and you will find a high degree of concern and awareness about the impact of artificial intelligence and what it might do to jobs. Our task is not to hide from technology that is already here, but to try to position the UK as a welcome home for its use and development. AI will both destroy and create jobs, and our ambition should be to make sure it does more of the latter.Nor should we be insular in how we view this. Other countries face similar issues with Neets, but many have attacked the problem with much more vigour than we have, and have a far lower percentage of young people not in training or employment than we do. In the Netherlands, the proportion isjust under 4%– around a third of the UK level.Germany’s rate is 8%– higher than the Netherlands but lower than the UK’s. There is nothing inevitable abouthaving one in eight young peoplein this position.We have made a start on a new response here in the UK, by announcing ayouth guarantee backed by £820min funding to offer training, work experience and subsidised employment to young people out of work.On top of that, we will stop the decline in apprenticeships for young people, which havefallen by nearly 40%in starts over the past decade. Instead, we will make an explicit priority of apprenticeships for young people in our funding, and guarantee to pay all the training costs of their apprenticeships for small- and medium-sized businesses. And we will offer more short courses – known as sector-based work academy programmes – in priority areas that employers say they need.These steps form the biggest statement in years that the government wants to back young people and give them hope, rather than attacking them as shirkers and snowflakes.But to bring the Neets numbers down further, we will have to go further. That is why I have asked the former health secretary Alan Milburnto report on the issueof young people, inactivity and work next year.His task starts today, and is made more urgent as the numbers of young people reporting long-term sickness grow. The system the Tories built has produced the consequences we see now – offering claimants a choice between penury and being declared unfit for work. We need to change it – to move on from the neglect that has allowed the current pattern to take hold, and instead offer a policy answer that gives young people more hope for the future. The prize in changing course could be enormous for the young people involved, and for the country.Pat McFadden is secretary of state for work and pensionsExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionApprenticeshipsWork & careersJob huntingUnemploymentLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

And why hasn’t the single most calamitous cause of funding reduction been addressed?Tue 16 Dec 2025 13.03 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 13.05 ESTShareThe arts in England are underfunded, and were dealt a blow by Covid from which many organisations have not yet recovered. But that has been only part of the story. The sheer weight of required form-filling, the endless bureaucracy, the impracticable length of time it takes to simplybefunded byArts Council England(ACE) have caused universal frustration among those working in the arts. There is much talk of exhaustion and burnout.Many organisations have felt frustrated, too, by the strictures of ACE’s flagship strategy,Let’s Create, which, though admirable in principle, with its focus on participation in the arts, is perhaps tilted too far from recognising the expertise and individuality of artists and arts institutions. Especially in classical music and opera – where ACE has made crude interventions into the direction of the art form – the body has been widely condemned for overreach of its powers. As with many things in life, though, opinion depends on your perspective. Funding has been diverted to underserved areas, and grassroots organisations, outside the south-east. Unsurprisingly, those who have received support for the first time are better disposed to ACE than those who have had their funding reduced or cut off.Thereport on Arts Council England by Margaret Hodge, Labour peer and former arts minister, urges a bonfire of red tape. That will be welcomed. More controversially, she also recommends binning Let’s Create, the 10-year strategy designed to take ACE all the way to 2030, in favour of a simpler strategy that allows organisations to apply based on their own strengths, rather than endlessly banging square pegs into round holes.With Hodge’s language of “excellence and access to excellence”, those with long memories might remember Brian McMaster’s report of 2008,Supporting Excellence in the Arts, which similarly urged an end to box-ticking and a revival of trust in artists and arts organisations. Those with even longer memories might recallregional arts boards, which were abolished in 2001 in order to streamline the Arts Council’s operations. Hodge is proposing to revive a version of these bodies – once condemned as wasteful – in order to strengthen regional decision-making, though without, importantly, handing off powers to the political control of metro mayors. (Nationally and internationally important bodies, on the other hand, would stay within the purview of the central ACE operation, which could cause some friction.)There is often a sense with the Arts Council that it trundles off in one direction for a few years, only to be pulled back in the opposite direction, before the entire cycle begins all over again. Another revival of an old hit is a recommendation to reboot something like the oldCreative Partnershipsprogramme, which, between 2002 and 2011, put local artists into schools.The report has some sensible ideas to help plug the funding void in the arts, without simply demanding more money be coughed up from the Treasury, which in the current climate is unlikely to happen. These include extending existing tax breaks for touring (arts organisations like these tax breaks – they are straightforward and simply incentivise making things and performing them without adding all sorts of extra prescriptions). Ideas on encouraging philanthropy include increasing tax breaks for givers outside London (the vast majority of giving to the arts is in the south-east of the nation).The report is not exactly a ringing endorsement of Arts CouncilEnglandas it stands: banish your bureaucracy! Strangle your strategy! And still, England has not addressed the single most calamitous cause of funding reduction in the arts, which is the collapse of local authority support. (Though the report does recommend mandating local authorities to at least have a cultural strategy.) But Hodge does insist that Arts Council England is the right body to deliver public funding to the arts and should continue to exist. And she strongly reasserts its most central and fundamental principle, that it should be at arm’s length from government, protected from political interference.Explore more on these topicsArts Council EnglandArts fundingMargaret HodgeEnglandOperaClassical musicanalysisShareReuse this content"

His attempt to export the bullying must be resistedTue 16 Dec 2025 14.04 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 18.31 ESTShareOn the day that the governmentlauncheda high-stakes consultation to consider fresh ways of funding the BBC in the digital era, the corporation could have done without another difficult news event of its own. Donald Trump’s decision to follow through on threats tosueover the content of a Panorama programme broadcast in October 2024 may not have come as a surprise, given Mr Trump’s litigious record in the United States. But it will add to the general air of beleaguerment at the corporation and further embolden its domestic political enemies.A terse BBCstatementon Tuesday suggested that there would be no backing down in the face of White House bullying. That is the right response to absurd claims of “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” caused to the US president, and a fantastical request for damages amounting to $10bn. The BBC has rightlyapologisedfor the misleading splicing together of separate clips from Mr Trump’s rabble-rousing speech on January 6 2020, prior to the violent storming of the US Capitol. A serious error of judgment was made in that editing process – though the House of Representatives January 6 committee concluded that Trump didusehis speech to incite an insurrection. But the claim that a programme not broadcast in the US was part of a malicious plan to defame Mr Trump and subvert the democratic process ahead of last year’s election is utterly specious.The BBC is only the latest major media institution to be targeted by Mr Trump in a strategiccampaignof intimidation, although the first beyond US borders. There are already presidential lawsuits pending in relation to the New York Times (allegedly “a mouthpiece for the Radical Left Democratic Party”) and the Wall Street Journal, which experts say Mr Trump has next to no chance of winning. Legal action and regulatory threats have also led to settlements in the television industry, successfully instilling a climate of fear and self-censorship.That is the point, of course. Money is not the primary object of the exercise, though cash extracted from a case involving CBS News has reportedly been diverted towards the construction of Mr Trump’spresidential library. The main goal is a cowed mediascape allowing the US president, and online outriders such as Elon Musk, to manipulate and control debate. For US corporate empires whose ambitions partly depend on the goodwill of the Trump administration, the harassment can lead to invidious choices. But as an independent British broadcaster with its own global reputation to defend, the BBC is free to fight back.In that battle, the corporation deserves more wholehearted backing from the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, than has hitherto been the case. The BBC remains a core component of the UK’s democratic infrastructure, but Mr Trump’s lawsuit is designed to undermine its prestige and sap its confidence, playing into the hands of hisfellow travellerson the British radical right. The government should see that strategy for the attempted infringement on national sovereignty that it is. By relentlessly targeting the US “legacy” media and now the BBC, while cosplaying the role of victim, Mr Trump is seeking to galvanise his base and narrow the parameters of acceptable scrutiny and judgment. Auntie is not a menace to the functioning of democracy. But he is.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But NHS dentistry requires more radical surgeryTue 16 Dec 2025 14.03 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 17.34 ESTShareIfchanges to the NHS dental contractin England result in fewer people being left to suffer with complex problems because they cannot get treatment, that will be a big gain. Sore teeth and gums are debilitating, and dentistry ought not to be out of reach for anyone who needs it.The decision to prioritise complex cases, as well as the lack of urgent care in some places, has been taken following a consultation that highlighted these two issues. From next April, the NHS payment system will alter so that patients can book a package rather than a series of individual appointments if they need to be seen more than once.Dentistswill be incentivised to offer more slots to those needing urgent treatment for issues including severe pain and infections.But this week’s announcement is not, and should not be mistaken for, a solution to all England’s problems with dentists (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all face similar challenges with their NHS dental workforces – including acute shortages in particular places – but as health is devolved the changes apply only in England). The dry remark made by Shiv Pabary, the chair of the British Dental Association’s general dental practice committee, that the changes are the “biggest tweaks this failed contract has seen in its history”, was apt. The new fee structure announced by the health minister, Stephen Kinnock, is a big tweak to the existing system. But it is still a tweak, and not theoverhaulthat most experts agree is needed.The NHS dental contract introduced in 2006 marked a radical break with what went before. People lost the right to register with a dentist in the same way that they register with a GP, who then acts as a gateway to other treatments and who receives a payment for each patient on their list. Instead, dentists began to be paid per “unit of activity”. Very soon, problems with this arrangement emerged and were pointed out by thehealth select committeeand others. It is disturbing to realise that many of the difficulties noted then are the same ones described now, in particular the lack of access to dentists for poor people in poor places.The situation has in some respects acutely worsened. Calls about dental issues to the NHS’s non-emergency 111 number rose by 20% between July and September compared with the same period in 2024. A&E attendances jumped by nearly 45% in four years – from 81,773 in 2019-20 to 117,977 in 2023-24. A new report by the patient watchdog includes shocking case histories, including peoplepulling out their own teeth.Areas including the east of England face chronic shortages, and “golden hellos” for dentists in underserved locations have had limited success. Efforts to reduce the prevalence oftooth decay in young children, and to tackle dental health inequality, have stalled – though Labour deserves credit for the decision to introduce supervised toothbrushing in schools. This hands-on measure ought to make a difference.A new contract is promised by the end of this parliament. Ministers should go further with a pledge to restore theright to register, ensuring universal access. They must also explain how this week’s contract announcement relates to an existing plan to boost the number of urgent appointments by 700,000 – and set out a timeline so that the public knows what to expect and progress can be checked.Explore more on these topicsDentistsOpinionHealthNHSStephen KinnockLabourInequalityPovertyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

It followed years in which antisemitism originating on the left has been minimised, sanitised, or treated as a conceptual misunderstanding rather than a real threat.In Australia, language that Jews recognise immediately as dangerous has been repeatedly defended as nuance. Antisemitic imagery has been excused as metaphor. Threats have been recast as “context”. When Jews object, they are told they are conflating criticism with hatred – even when the language used would be unacceptable if directed at any other minority.This indulgence has not been politically neutral. It has come disproportionately from progressive institutions that pride themselves on moral seriousness while declining to confront antisemitism when it appears within their own ideological camp. Media outlets, including this one, have been quick to police language on the right, but reluctant to interrogate how terms like “Zionist” are deployed as proxies for Jews themselves. The result has been predictable. Warnings were dismissed. Patterns were denied.Violence did not appear suddenly. It arrived in an environment carefully prepared for it. If progressive politics cannot confront the antisemitism it tolerates – and sometimes amplifies – then its moral claims are hollow. Bondi is the cost of that failure.Simon TedeschiNewtown, New South Wales, AustraliaI am deeply saddened by Sunday’s horrific shooting. My grief is amplified by a broader grief for the fracturing of a most precious quality of our Aussie society – a thrivingly diverse culture that is respectful, peaceful and cooperative.This has been such a core part of my life that I got teary when I heard that the heroic shopkeeper who disarmed one of the shooters was a local Muslim. What then opened the floodgates for all my grief was the pride expressed by members of his Muslim family for his bravery in the face of grave danger.With xenophobia in many countries now displacing cross-cultural trust and compassion, this glimmer of promise in an otherwise deeply tragic moment in Australia’s history should be cherished.Dr Eric van BeurdenLismore Heights, New South Wales, AustraliaWhen I was a child in New Zealand, I was victimised at school for being Jewish. Despite being thousands of miles away in Tasmania, where I now live, when I heard about theChristchurch mosque shootingsin 2019, a deep grief came over me. On Sunday, I found myself frantically calling Jewish friends in Bondi, desperate to know that they were safe. I sobbed with relief that they were. But for many others, this was not the case.As with the mosque in Christchurch, this is an act of grotesque violence against a peaceful group of people celebrating their beliefs in peace. My deepest concern comes from my experience as a victim of racism, and from knowing how easy it is to lose sight of an essential truth: these crimes do not come from whole communities, but from a tiny minority of outsiders.I can only hope that Australians remember that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful too. Fear and hatred must not be turned toward any entire group of people. Both Muslim and Jewish communities are equally deserving of safety, dignity and protection.Jerusha SandlerWoodbridge, Tasmania, AustraliaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

British lives, 11 December), the UK-US medicines agreement is designed to support NHS patients by improving access to new and innovative treatments.The agreement raises the baseline threshold used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to assess the cost-effectiveness for newmedicines, enabling more treatments to be considered forNHSuse.It does notretrospectively increase the price of existing branded medicines. It also caps repayment rates for newer medicines at no more than 15% from 2026 to 2028, replacing an unpredictable system that has hampered investment and patient access to cutting-edge treatments.The UK has fallen behind international competitors in both life sciences investment and access to innovative medicines. Only around one-third of new treatments are available to UK patients in all their licensed indications. A more predictable, internationally competitive commercial environment is essential to reversing this trend.Richard TorbettChief executive, Association of the British Pharmaceutical IndustryAditya Chakrabortty’s article covers just the latest example of the impact of Keir Starmer’s submission toDonald Trump. In September, the government agreed to a tech deal that relinquishes important controls over the development of our technology sector, and this has only emboldened the US to push for us to give up our digital services tax and ability to regulate AI.Last week, Starmer admitted that he’d no longer consider joining the EU customs union as it would contradict elements of these deals. His desire to appease Washington means he’s handing over our sovereignty and eroding our rights.

As a physician with decades of experience in health policy, I believe the current discourse misses a vital distinction: the difference between prohibiteddiagnosisand legitimateobservation.The Goldwater rule was designed to prevent irresponsible “armchair diagnosis” based on hearsay. However, Dr Allen Dyer, a psychiatrist instrumental in developing the original rule,clarified in October 2024that it was never intended to serve as an absolute gag order. It does not preclude responsible discussion of observable public behaviours, particularly when a public figure voluntarily displays these patterns on a national stage.We must allow medical expertise to inform public discourse. When behaviour that bears on the national welfare is publicly exhibited and extensively documented, discussing it within ethical boundaries is not a violation of professional standards – it is a contribution to the nation’s understanding.Robert KrasnerNew York, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is the right torespect forfamily life. As theBonavero reportfrom the University of Oxford makes clear, article 8 can only prevent deportation if the impact would be “unduly harsh” on the familyandthe consequences of deportation outweigh the public interest.The number of foreign national offenders who successfully invoked human rights grounds to prevent their deportation is 0.73% of the total number of foreign offenders. Having a child or partner in the UK does not mean that a foreign national offender can successfully appeal on human rights grounds. TheHome Officedoes not keep – or at least does not appear to release – statistics on the number of foreign national offenders who are removed immediately after serving their prison sentence and those who are not, despite there being a valid deportation order (some of whom then go on to commit further serious crimes).If the discourse were more evidence-based and sufficient resources directed at enforcement rather than blaming judges and the law for its own failures, perhaps the Home Office would actually be able to deal with the problem.Jane CokerRetired upper tribunal judge, immigration and asylum chamberHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The pair exhibited cheesy smiles as João Pedro played ­photographer, pretending to capture their celebration.Then, with 15 minutes remaining, the hosts equalised through David Turnbull’s brilliant diving header, detonating the kind of noise not heard in these parts for a long time, and another awkward 48 hours were on the cards for Enzo Maresca.Cardiff City v Chelsea: Carabao Cup quarter-final – liveRead moreQuestions would surely have been asked of him by the Chelsea hierarchy had the League One leaders reached the Carabao Cup semi-finals at their expense. Fortunately for Maresca, Pedro Neto struck a late goal, with Garnacho adding his second at the death to spare any embarrassment, even if Chelsea did make wholesale changes fromthe win against Evertonon Saturday. It was after that game that Maresca’s cryptic comments sparked doubts about his future.Progressing to a third semi‑final in 18 months, another line Maresca has been at pains to repeat in recent days, seemingly could not solve ­everything in the Welsh capital. The Italian was stony-faced as he reviewed his side’s performance, insisting his demeanour was owing to the three-hour coach journey home to Cobham, Chelsea’s training ground. “I will watch two Newcastle games,” Maresca said. “There is no time. Time is for the players. For us as a staff, we’re going to be focused on the next one, that is Newcastle [on Saturday] so we’re going to prepare.”Asked if he had spoken with his bosses since his surprise remarks, Maresca replied: “No, as I said yes­terday [Monday], the day after ­Everton, I started to prepare for ­Cardiff, focus on Cardiff. Now I just said on the bus, I will watch ­Newcastle and I didn’t speak with one.”Chelsea’s supporters sang ­Maresca’s name during second‑half stoppage time and again as he and his squad went to applaud their fans. Was it a boost to hear that backing? “Absolutely,” he said. “It was a great moment, [one] I appreciate, [I am] always thankful. They have always been there, knowing that any support in the world when you don’t win, they are not happy. When you don’t win games, they have been not happy, but it’s normal. But overall, the fans have always been there.“These are the kind of games that I fall in love even more with the ­players because you cannot imagine how easy it is to slip, to slide, because they are tricky games. Every season there are teams that lose against League Two or League One teams. So you need to pay attention, to do the right things.”View image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho jumps on Pedro Neto after Chelsea’s second goal.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersCardiff were determined to savour the occasion, this stadium a sellout for a club match for the first time since April 2019, whenLiverpool visited in the Premier League, and Neil Warnock was in the home dugout. These days it is Brian Barry-Murphy, by his own admission a Pep ­Guardiola obsessive. Barry-Murphy, like Maresca, is also a Guardiola protege of sorts; the trio worked together at Manchester City when Barry-Murphy was in charge of their development squad, succeeding Maresca in the role.Moisés Caicedo captained a youthful Chelsea side that featured four teenagers, while Tosin ­Adarabioyo was the only player over the age of 24 in their starting lineup. Maresca was seemingly not overly enamoured with his side’s anaemic first‑half ­performance and introduced ­Garnacho and João Pedro in place of Tyrique George and Marc Guiu.Buonanotte, who Barry-Murphy worked with at Leicester, laid on the opener after intercepting a rare lapse by Cardiff’s teenage ­centre‑back Dylan Lawlor. ­Buonanotte spied Garnacho to his left and the ­Argentinian picked his spot in the far corner, sending a neat first‑time strike past Nathan Trott in the Cardiff goal. A few minutes later Buonanotte, now in the groove, sent a delicious shot at goal that forced a fingertip save from Trott.Cardiff were drained but only momentarily, rebooting to equalise and spark extraordinary scenes. Perry Ng sent a wonderful cross into the box from the right and Turnbull flung himself at the ball, heading past a hapless Filip Jörgensen in the Chelsea goal. Fans in the Canton Stand, who watched it all the way behind Jörgensen’s goal, went ballistic.With penalties looming, João Pedro shifted the ball to Andrey Santos, who moved it on to Neto to dispatch a low diagonal strike into the far corner, via a deflection off the Cardiff defender Joel Bagan. Relief for Maresca and Chelsea was underlined by Garnacho’s deft finish to seal the win in stoppage time. “It is probably the hope that kills you,” ­Barry-Murphy said afterwards. “There is a natural feeling of disappointment because I thought for a brief spell we could get the winner or go to penalties.”Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupCardiff CityChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The sweeping travel ban already includes two countries who will participate in the World Cup: Haiti and Iran, both of whom are subject to the most stringent restrictions.In the cases of Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the reasoning provided by the White House for imposing the bans are visa overstay rates. For B1 or B2 visitor visas of the type travelling fans would need to enter the country for the World Cup, the overstay rates listed are about 4% for Senegal and 8% for Côte d’Ivoire, according to the Department of Homeland Security.Fifa announces limited amount of $60 tickets for 2026 World Cup after fan furyRead moreWhile some fans may face restrictions when trying to enter the US, the proclamation specifically cited athletes as one category of people, along with diplomats and “individuals whose entry serves U.S. national interests,” who will be exempt from the ban.The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada, and will kick-off on 11 June. Côte d’Ivoire were drawn in to Group E, where they’ll play Germany, Curaçao, and Ecuador. Senegal have been drawn in Group I of the tournament, along with France, Norway and a European playoff team to be determined. Senegal will also be one of the United States men’s national team’s final opponents in tune-up friendlies before the World Cup. The teams will play that match on 31 May in Charlotte, North Carolina – the second-to-last game before the United States’ World Cup opener against Paraguay.The Trump administration’s World Cup taskforce, chaired by Andrew Giuliani,unveiled a fast-track visa systemfor World Cup visitors earlier in December. The Fifa prioritized appointment scheduling system will push World Cup ticket-holders to the front of the line for visa interviews. However, it is not yet known how that system will handle requests from the countries affected by the travel ban.Next year’s edition of the World Cup has faced numerous controversies, relating not only to the Trump administration’s immigration policy and enforcement but also to Fifa’s running of the tournament. Most recently, the governing body of soccer came under fire for the exorbitant ticket prices charged for games thanks to dynamic pricing.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaSenegal football teamCôte d’Ivoire football teamWorld CupFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This award is actually for players and staff. We’ve shown so much conviction, belief and togetherness that led us to our second Euro win. Moving into 2026, let’s keep pushing the women’s game forward together.”Four Lionesses – Hannah Hampton, Lucy Bronze, Leah Williamson and Alessia Russo – were named in a best women’s XI that was otherwise made up of Spain internationals: the Arsenal midfielder Mariona Caldentey and six Barcelona players.The men’s best XI included England’s Jude Bellingham and Cole Palmer – who starred at the Club World Cup – in a team otherwise dominated by PSG and Barcelona players. Manchester City’s Gianluigi Donnarumma was named as the goalkeeper but the timeframe for these awards took into account performances between 11 August 2024 and 2 August 2025, when Donnarumma was playing for PSG. There was no place for Harry Kane, but the 18‑year‑old Barcelona forward Lamine Yamal was included.Hampton was named the 2025 Fifa Best women’s goalkeeper, completing a global goalkeeper award double after she received the Ballon d’Or prize for keepers in September. Wiegman, Luis Enrique, Bonmatí, Dembélé and Donnarumma were also Ballon d’Or winners.Quick GuideThe Fifa Best world XIsShowWomen’s XI: Hampton; Bronze, Williamson, Paredes, Batlle; Bonmatí, Guijarro, Pina; Caldentey, Russo, PutellasMen’s XI: Donnarumma; Hakimi, Pacho, Van Dijk, Mendes; Palmer, Bellingham, Vitinha, Pedri; Lamine Yamal, DembéléWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Hampton saved two penalties in the European Championship final shootout and helped Chelsea to win a domestic treble last season. She is also on the shortlist for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award, which will be announced on Thursday.Hampton is the sixth winner of Fifa’s Best women’s goalkeeper award since its inception in 2019, after Sari van Veenendaal, Sarah Bouhaddi in 2020, Christiane Endler in 2021, the two-time winner Mary Earps and the winner last year, Alyssa Naeher of the US.Votes are collected from national team coaches and captains, specialist journalists and fans, each making up 25% of the poll. Hampton thanked those who had voted for her, before namechecking her coaches: “To Sarina [Wiegman] and to Sonia [Bompastor] for the belief in me this year. Both at club and country, we’ve achieved so much and there’s still so much set out for us to go and get.”Donnarumma took the men’s prize after lifting the Champions League for the first time at the end of a campaign in which PSG won a domestic treble. “It was an incredible year, one that will live long in my memory, and it’s touching to be recognised for my role in the success achieved over that period,” Donnarumma said.Lizbeth Ovalle won the Marta award, for the most popular goal scored in women’s football in 2025, named after the Brazil legend Marta, who was also nominated. Ovalle took the prize for herremarkable and unusual flicked goalscored for Tigres against Guadalajara in Liga MX Femenil action on 3 March. She later signed for the American club Orlando Pride for $1.5m.The Puskas award for the best men’s goal went to Santiago Montiel, who scored with abreathtaking overhead kickfor the Argentinian side Independiente against Independiente Rivadavia.

The 2005 series in England began two weeks after the 7 July London bombings, which killed 52 people. Day one at Lord’s coincided with an aborted follow-up atrocity that failed only because of the incompetence of those involved. Twenty years on, after the murder of at least 15 people at Bondi beach on Sunday during a Hanukah celebration, the most heinous act of terror on Australian soil, the Australian government has bolstered its security operation for Adelaide.There are practical consequences. Entry to the ground will take longer than usual. The recently formed armed Security Response Section will patrol the Oval’s beautifully green-tinged surrounds. The match was likely, at time of writing, to begin with a “moment of reflection” led by the premier of South Australia, Peter Malinauskas.Pat Cummins says Bondi terror attack ‘hit home pretty hard’ as tributes flow before third Ashes TestRead moreIn the days since Sunday Australia has felt, even in its round‑the‑clock live reporting of leads and details, like a place in a state of slow-motion shock. There were initially some suggestions the Christmas Test might be cancelled or postponed. But as the state police commissioner, Grant Stevens, said on the eve of the match, Sydney is being seen as a distinct event. “We don’t have any information whatsoever that indicates there’s a linkage between what happened in Bondi on the weekend and South Australia.”No linkage, in policing terms. But there always is linkage. In Adelaide the main centre of public mourning has been the Adelaide Holocaust Museum and Andrew Steiner Education Centre, a mile across the city grid from the cricket ground. Malinauskas laid flowers there on Monday. The opposition leader, Ashton Hurn, then did the same. Malinauskas followed up by promising the centre half a million dollars in funding.Not that there was much sign of this the day before the Test. The centre is a detached building on Wakefield Street, a midtown triple carriageway lined with startlingly beautiful purple‑plumed jacaranda trees. By Tuesday morning it had returned to a state of dormant anonymity, barring a small selection of flowers left at the entrance.The topic of morning mass inside the modern gothic Catholic cathedral next door was the commercialisation of Christmas. The only real tell as to the significance of this place were the blocks in its front wall, which showed signs of having been scoured and scrubbed a great deal of late, legacy of multiple antisemitic defacings in the years since the Hamas kidnappings of 7 October 2023 and Israel’s military response. Not long ago CCTV caught some local neo-Nazi groups performing fascist salutes outside.View image in fullscreenA display inside Adelaide’s Holocaust Museum.Photograph: Adelaide Holocaust MuseumIn this context the police verdict that Bondi is unlinked to any wider threat might raise a weary sigh. Some of Adelaide’s earliest settlers were Jewish sheep farmers, but the Jewish population now is small, close to a thousand.Despite this, reports of antisemitism are common. The city’s synagogues have security guards on service days and suffer regular graffiti attacks. Adelaide University has been wrestling with the need to foster free political speech against reports of overt hostility towards Jewish students.These tensions might be at odds with the tourist-poster view of a hail‑fellow nation of immigrants. But Australia has a longstanding problem with racism. It has a problem, more specifically, with antisemitism, incidents of which have tripled in the past two years according to a report by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. The details in its appendix now carry a disturbing sense of narrative arc. In November 2024 there was an arson attack on a kosher catering business in Bondi. In December 2024 the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne was burned to the ground. In January this year cars in Sydney were set alight and daubed with anti‑Jewish hate slogans.From the outside Australia seems to provide a very vivid case study in the way violence in Gaza and Israel has echoed around the world. Its Jewish population has the highest percentage of holocaust survivors outside Israel, something Michael Visontay, commissioning editor of the Jewish Independent, described this week as “central to its identity”. As Visontay told the New Yorker: “The sensitivity within the community to the threats of antisemitism, of prejudice … are much more pronounced here than they are virtually anywhere else.”At the same time Australia also has a significant youthful Muslim community, which has voiced its own concerns over the actions of the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza. It is a familiar dynamic, a mess of bloodshed and irresolvable tensions, one that found its most murderously deranged expression in the horror of last weekend.And at Bondi of all places. As Rabbi Yossi Engel of Adelaide’s Chabad SA synagogue told local news outlets on Tuesday: “Bondi beach is a symbol of open Australia. In terms of a spot in Australia that’s symbolic of the fair dinkum way of Australia, Bondi beach is about as plain good old Aussie as it gets.”As is the cricket, Australia’s summer pastime, and a Test match that will take place now against that same sense of horror. Even the announcement on Tuesday ofAustralia’s teamwas the spur for a trending tide of social media abuse directed towards Usman Khawaja, on the grounds Khawaja has expressed previously his concern for the suffering of Palestinian people in Gaza.Sport must now march into this world once again, staging its own pantomime tensions, holding up its cameras, a window to the world beyond. A common reaction on Australian television this week is that the country feels irrevocably changed by the massacre on Sunday. It will be felt again in Adelaide, memorialised in Sydney when England travel east for the New Year Test; and preserved now in perpetuity by the images, the sounds, the highlights reel of this Ashes tour.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26CricketBondi beach terror attackanalysisShareReuse this content"

Despite missing 17 of his 26 attempts at doubles, he scored a 96.44 average to set up a second-round meeting with Wesley Plaisier.“I don’t usually get this [crowd support], so thank you very much,” he told Sky Sports. “The fans have been great for me the last 18 months, two years, and to come here and get the support like I have, as you can hear now, still they’re chanting my name.“Honestly, if I win the million [first prize], it’s not going to change my life, but I want to win trophies. I want to be back in the top four in the world and be where I think I deserve. As long these are where they are with me, I think I can win everything, so thank you very much.”Danny Noppert recovered from a slow start to produce a fine win against Jurjen van der Velde, finally triumphing 3-1 after the fourth set. In a strong finish he threw four perfect darts at the start of the final leg to get down to 47 after nine darts.3:00‘From pubs to the Palace’: Jonathan Liew at the World Darts Championships – videoVan der Velde had arrived on stage with a can of insect spray after issues on Monday with a wasp at the venue but it was not enough to keep him in contention, Noppert missing two match darts in the final leg before claiming victory.Ricardo Pietreczko saw off the impressive José de Sousa 3-1 to seal his place in the second round, while Joe Comito upset Niko Springer 3-1 in the last match to finish.Chris Dobey shrugged off an early scare to reach the second round of the world championship with a 3-1 win against China’s Zong Xiaochen at Alexandra Palace.Another former semi-finalist, Scott Williams, cruised into the second round with a 3-0 win against Paolo Nebrida of the Philippines, while Justin Hood whitewashed the Welshman Nick Kenny.In an epic opener, Alan Soutar missed no fewer than 15 match darts before finally seeing off Finland’s Teemu Harju in a sudden-death leg.

Britain’s Josh Kerr, a world champion over 1500m in 2023, is owed $218,500 (£162,883).Meanwhile Girraphic, a Wimbledon‑based broadcasting and ­advertising agency, is still yet to be paid $690,624 (£514,810).View image in fullscreenFrance's Sasha Zhoya celebrates winning the men's 100m race during the Grand Slam Track meet at the National Stadium, Kingston, Jamaica in April 2025.Photograph: Ricardo Makyn/AFP/Getty ImagesThe World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, said the problems of GST deeply concerned him. “Well, it’s not unalloyed joy is it?” he said. “We welcome innovation into the sport. We welcome fresh investment, but it has to be underpinned by a sustainable, solid financial model executed and delivered on behalf of the athletes.”Asked whether World Athletics could stop Johnson’s plans to bring GST back in 2026, despite its precarious financial situation, Coe said he did not “want to get into the embers” of what might happen next.But, pointedly, he added: “We create the calendar. We have to police the calendar. And we have to make sure that when there are fresh events, that they come to the table with the kind of credentials and assets that I talked about.“Over the next few years, there are going to be lots of different and new things and I welcome that. But it has to be suffused in a realistic proposition that is fireproof. It’s got to be sustainable.”Coe also insisted that the World Athletics Ultimate Championships, which will launch in Budapest in ­September 2026, would be a very different proposition.“It’s a very, very big moment for us,” he said. “There’s no guarantee of success next year, but we’ve got teams that have been working at this now for three years and they will be working through Christmas to make sure that we don’t let the athletes down.“In Budapest, we’ve got the biggest prize pot ever, and it’s a very different model.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

And a good leader,” Gilmore said, when asked about transfer speculation surrounding the full‑back, who made his international debut under Eddie Jones in 2020.“He’s going to attract interest. It’s no different to whenChandler Cunningham-South was up [for contract renewal] a couple of months ago. Those players are going to attract interest. Definitely a good player.“Would we be interested? We’d be interested in any good player that fits in with our roster. In terms of the ins and outs, like any player, I can’t really disclose actual recruitment strategies.”Twickenham is the venue for Big Game 17 on Saturday, and Gilmore said fans of attacking rugby can expect entertainment from the double header: Harlequins Women v Bristol Bears Women kicks off at 3.05pm before the men’s Prem match at 6pm.“You’ve got two teams who want to use the football,” Gilmore said. “I don’t see the scoreline being 10-7. Twickenham is a bigger pitch, there’s more space to attack into. When you get two attacking teams on a bigger field, generally you’ll get bigger scorelines.”View image in fullscreenBenhard Janse van Rensburg will offer a threat for Bristol at Twickenham.Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport/Getty ImagesRegarding the threat of Bristol’s South African centre Benhard Janse van Rensburg, who is due to qualify for England next year, Gilmore said: “He’s a collision guy in that midfield, there’s no shying away from it. You can’t dip your toe in the water against him.“You’ve got to match him and go head-on, one-for-one. How you nullify him is you’ve got to go at him. If you’re passive and you let him run, that’s when he has a field day.”Meanwhile, the Gloucester director of rugby, George Skivington, voiced his disappointment at the impending departure of the Wales international Tomos Williams. The Cherry and Whites announced on Tuesday that the scrum-half will leave next summer, with his destination undisclosed. The club also revealed that the scrum-half and Gloucester academy graduate Dan Robson will rejoin from Pau for next season.“We did our best but that’s rugby, that’s sport,” Skivington said of Williams. “There’s no hard feelings and he’s in here for the rest of the season – I know he’ll give everything.

In the more recent window the Saudi Arabian club Al‑Hilaloffered United £100mand the player a £700,000-a-week salary.Football Daily | Thud and blunder: Amorim’s system dissolves into the Old Trafford chaosRead moreFernandes did not name specific members of United’s hierarchy. Jason Wilcox is the football director, Omar Berrada is the chief executive, and Sir Jim Ratcliffe leads football policy.In an interview with Canal 11, a Portuguese Football Federation‑owned channel, Fernandes was asked whether there had been an offer from Paris Saint-Germain or Real Madrid. In his reply he appeared to reference more than one transfer window.“Nowadays, the issue of loyalty is no longer seen the way it used to be,” he said. “I could have left in the last transfer window and would have earned a lot more money. Financially, it would have been much better for me.“At one point I was going to leave – I won’t say where – but I would have won many trophies that season. I decided to stay not only for family reasons but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the coach also made me stay.“But from the club’s side, I felt a bit of: ‘If you go, it’s not really that bad for us.’ That hurts me a little. More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.“ Then you look around you and see players who don’t value the club as much as you do and who don’t defend the club as much. That makes you sad.”View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes looks dejected after the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.Photograph: Peter Powell/AFP/Getty ImagesIt is understood United’s stance is that the hierarchy were clear last summer that Fernandes was a fundamental component of team plans. A year earlier his transfer fee would have been significantly lower before, in mid‑August 2024, he signed a new contract to 2027 with an option for a further year.“The club went through difficult times, and I could have done what many people do and said: ‘I want to leave the club, I don’t want to train, I just want to leave for 20 or 30 million, so they pay me more on the other side,’” Fernandes said. “And maybe I would have gone to a better club or earned more money. But I never did that.“I never felt in a position to do so, because I felt the empathy and affection I had for the club were mutual. I think that empathy can exist, but there comes a point where money is more important than you. The club wanted me to leave – I have that in my head. I told the directors that but I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision because the manager wanted me to stay. If I had said I wanted to leave, even with the manager wanting me to stay, they would have let me go.”The 31-year-old did not rule out a move to Saudi Arabia. “It’s not about the money,” he said. “Financially, I can’t complain – I’m paid very well. Obviously the difference is enormous but that was never what guided me – if one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I will play in Saudi Arabia. My lifestyle will change, my children’s lives will have sun, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain. I’ll be playing in a growing league, with players who are internationally recognised.”It is understood that United have no desire to sell Fernandes and that he continues to be central to their long-term planning.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Here is alink to the videoinstead.Footage shows Paul Doyle drive through hundreds of fans before ploughing into crowd – videoFootage from Doyle’s two-tonne Ford Galaxy showed him accelerating aggressively towards crowds, hitting 134 people in only two minutes. Some suffered life-changing injuries and many were left traumatised – including a survivor of the Manchester Arena attack and a woman who fled the war in Ukraine.Doyle, from Croxteth in Liverpool, told police he acted in a “blind panic” and claimed he feared for his life after seeing a fan with a knife. This was disproved by detectives. He pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial last month to 31 offences against 21 adults and eight children.1:01'Truly shocking': judge sentences Paul Doyle for Liverpool FC parade attack – videoSentencing Doyle to 21 years and six months in prison, Menary said: “You struck people head on, knocked others on to the bonnet, crushed prams and forced others to scatter in terror. You ploughed on at speed, violently knocking people aside or running over them, person after person after person.”Menary said dashcam footage from Doyle’s vehicle showed he was not acting in fear or panic, as he claimed, but out of “an inexplicable and undiluted fury”.His “disregard for human life defies ordinary understanding,” Menary said, adding: “It is almost impossible to comprehend how any right thinking person could act as you did.”There was no reaction from the defendant, who had sobbed for much of the two-day hearing, as he was taken to the court cells by prison officers.It can now be revealed that Doyle had a string of convictions in the early 1990s – including one for biting off a man’s ear in a pub brawl – but that he had not been in trouble with the police for 30 years until he was arrested at the parade.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Footage shows Paul Doyle driving dangerously before reaching city centre – videoA former Royal Marine who served alongside Doyletold the Guardianhe was well known at the time for his explosive outbursts. “It was like he was on a tripwire,” the former marine said. “Everyone would say: ‘He’s got a horrendous flash to bang’ – meaning the point you get annoyed to the point you’re punching people is zero time.”Doyle could be heard on dashcam videoshouting “fuck’s sake move! Get out my fucking way!” before ploughing into screaming fans. A police officer described the noise as “sickening”.As bodies lay on the ground, Doyle’s rampage wasbrought to a haltby a former soldier, Dan Barr, who climbed into a rear passenger seat and held the car’s gear selector in “park”. Even then, Doyle kept his foot on the accelerator, the court heard.When Doyle was dragged into a police van through a swarm of angry fans, he told officers: “I’ve just ruined my family’s life.”The court heard on Tuesday that those struck by Doyle’s car were aged from six months to 77 years.Francesca Massey, 24, said the parade had “reopened emotional wounds” and brought back vivid memories of being caught up in the Manchester Arena terror attack in 2017: “The same overwhelming fear, the moment of stillness before chaos and the desperate rush to escape with the crowd of innocent people around me.”She added: “This is something I felt I had overcome over the past eight years, and now I feel like I have been set back again, as it reawakened previous trauma.”Simon Csoka KC, defending, said Doyle was “horrified by what he did”: “He’s remorseful, ashamed and deeply sorry for all those who were hurt and suffered. He accepts all responsibility, he expects no sympathy.”Csoka said Doyle had been described by friends as “kind, generous and selfless” and they found his actions “incomprehensible and so utterly unlike the man that they know”.But Menary said the offending warranted one of the severest sentences he could impose, adding: “What should have been a day of communal celebration has instead left a lasting legacy of fear, injury and loss across this community.“The overall harm is exceptional, not only in the sheer number of victims and the seriousness of their injuries, but also in the depth, duration and human reach of the trauma you inflicted.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

The sharpest rise in use was among young people, according to figurespublished in the medical journal Lancet Public Health.Experts said the dramatic increase in use of nicotine pouches was probably linked to “aggressive” marketing and advertising across social media, billboards and public transport hubs in the UK.Researchers from UCL examined data from theSmokingToolkit study, including figures on almost 130,000 people aged 16 and over.The figures revealed the prevalence of nicotine pouch use has risen significantly in recent years, particularly among members of gen Z. In 2022, 0.7% of 16- to 24-year-olds used these products. This grew to 4% in 2025.But there was “no meaningful change” among people aged 35 and over during this time frame, according to the research funded by Cancer Research UK.Researchers said use was higher among men, especially those aged 16 to 24, and among people who smoked or vaped. More than two-thirds of those using the pouches also used other nicotine products.However, 16% of users had never smoked regularly.Researchers also found a rising proportion of smokers used pouches during their most recent attempt to kick the habit – from 2.6% in 2020 to 6.5% in 2025.Writing in the Lancet Public Health, the researchers said: “Nicotine pouch use has risen in Great Britain, primarily driven by sharp increases among young people, especially young men.“Most users also smoked or vaped, and a growing proportion of smokers used pouches in attempts to quit smoking. These findings underscore the importance of implementing age-of-sale legislation for nicotine pouches and conducting research on their effectiveness for smoking cessation.”Lead author Dr Harry Tattan-Birch, of UCL’s institute of epidemiology and health care, said: “The rise in nicotine pouch use has been driven almost exclusively by young people, especially young men, while use among adults over 35 remained stable and low.“This may be due in part to aggressive advertising targeting this group on social media, billboards, in bars and train stations, and through sponsorships of motorsports and music festivals.“Pouches have a substantially lower risk to health than cigarettes and are likely less harmful than e-cigarettes. However, they are not harmless and can currently be sold to children with no marketing restrictions and no cap on nicotine content.”The findings underscored the urgency of the tobacco and vapes bill, he said, which would end the sale of such products to under-18s, restrict advertising and give powers to regulate flavours, packaging, and nicotine content.“Proportionate measures are important to limit uptake among teenagers,” he said.Caroline Cerny, deputy chief executive of Ash, said the growing use of nicotine pouches was driven by “heavy and indiscriminate” marketing of the products.“Over the past year, adverts have been plastered over buses, trains, and social media with giveaways at events popular with young people such as music festivals and shopping centres,” she said.“While they are likely to be less harmful than cigarettes, they shouldn’t be used by children or people who don’t already smoke, due to the addictive nature of nicotine.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchDrugsYoung peopleHealthSmokingPharmaceuticals industryEnglandShareReuse this content"

Previously, police have had no way of tracking the activities of known sex offenders online.Keir Starmer is preparing to announce on Thursday the full strategy to halve violence against women and girls in a decade,after facing criticism over delays in publishing it.Under new regulations, registered sex offenders would be required to inform the police if they open new social media and dating app accounts or if they move into a new job.The police can use that information to monitor and increase surveillance of predators who may be looking for opportunities to offend again. The changes will be made as secondary legislation to the Sexual Offences Act 2003.If the police consider an offender’s online activity puts them at a heightened risk of reoffending, officers can seek a sexual harm prevention order to restrict their internet activity including banning their social media and dating profiles.Under the new regulations, offenders will also be required to provide police with more personal information and preserve their internet history to prove to the police they are complying with restrictions.A new team of online officers, backed by nearly £2m in funding, was announced last week, that will be deployed to use covert and intelligence techniques to tackle online activity of sexual offenders and stalkers.Mahmood said: “For too long, these crimes have been considered a fact of life. That’s not good enough. The government will use the full power of the state to bear down on abusers, stopping them in their tracks. Rapists, sex offenders and abusers will have nowhere to hide.”Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence Against Women coalition, welcomed the move and called for current violence against women and girls guidance for tech platforms to be made mandatory “with strong consequences” for those breaking the rules in the government’s new strategy.“Online sexual abuse has long been minimised by the justice system and tech platforms, leaving victims let down and with nowhere to turn and perpetrators free to harm women without consequence,” she said.In a further development, changes to NHS services across England will be made in an effort to better support survivors of sexual violence and abuse.Referral services for victims will be introduced in every area of England by 2029 to connect them with specialist help through their GP.The initiative, called Steps to Safety, will also train GP staff to better deal with domestic abuse and sexual violence.Ministers have also announced up to £50m for survivors of child sexual abuse to receive specialist care.The £50m investment to help child victims will be used to expand a “child house” model which hosts all care, therapeutic support and advocacy in one place, where children need to share their experiences only once and are supported by trained staff who understand trauma.Currently there is one child house, in north London, but this will be expanded to every NHS region in England.Measures previously announced as part of the cross-government strategy have included introducing specialist rape and sexual offences investigators to every police force and a £19m funding boost for councils to provide safe housing for domestic abuse survivors.Survivor organisationssubmitted a super-complaint against police forceson Monday over “inhumane” delays to investigating sexual offences, as research showed the rising number of investigations taking more than three years.Explore more on these topicsPoliceOnline abuseRape and sexual assaultShabana MahmoodInternet safetySexual harassmentKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Royal assent is expected by Thursday.The struggle to pass the law, which faced significant opposition from the Conservatives and business groups, meant the government made a number of concessions to secure its passage.The big quarrels over the workers’ rights bill have barely started | Nils PratleyRead moreTrade unions agreed earlier this month to remove day-one rights to unfair dismissal from the package of reforms, in return for the lifting of the compensation cap, to get the bill through parliament in time to start implementing new rights from April.Peter Kyle, the business secretary, said: “This landmark legislation, now soon to be in law, will drag Britain’s outdated employment laws into the 21st century and offer dignity and respect to millions more in the workplace.”The bill will introduce rights to guaranteed hours and payment for short-notice cancellation of shifts, bar fire-and-rehire practices in most circumstances, grant paternity and parental leave from day one, and strengthen workplace trade union rights.The day-one right to protection against unfair dismissal has been removed as a concession to business and replaced with a shortened qualifying period of six months, down from two years.The process of passing the bill – which contains key manifesto pledges – has renewed anger among a significant number of MPs and ministers towards the House of Lords, after repeated obstructions from Conservative and crossbench peers.The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: “This is a historic day and early Christmas present for working people across the country, and the trade unions who represent them.“Unions and workers have long campaigned for these vital rights. Together, we have broken a decades-long economic status quo defined by insecurity, weak rights and poor pay. Finally, working people will enjoy more security, better pay and dignity at work thanks to this bill.“It’s now vital that workers start feeling the benefits of this legislation in their lives as soon as possible. That means the legislation must be implemented in full, and at speed – with watertight secondary legislation to ensure there are no loopholes for bad bosses to exploit.”Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, said women, disabled people, ethnic minorities and young people stood to gain most from changes to unfair dismissal, zero-hours contracts and day-one rights.He said there were still obstacles ahead as the government devised codes of practice and secondary legislation.“It’s vital that as government works with employers and unions to shape these, the reforms deliver on the spirit of the bill as originally intended,” Harrison added.The Conservatives said the bill would fuel already rising unemployment. Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: “It will pile costs on to small businesses, freeze hiring, and ultimately leave young people and jobseekers paying the price for Labour’s capitulation to their union paymasters.“The Conservatives will scrap the most disastrous elements of this bill and get Britain working again.”Explore more on these topicsWorkers' rightsEmployment lawLabournewsShareReuse this content"

This is the latest landmark in a longer trend, with the region’s oldest, thickest icedecliningby more than 95% since the 1980s as the Arctic becomes hotter and rainier.This year was a record for precipitation in the Arctic. Much of this is not settling as snow – the June snow cover extent over the Arctic today is half of what it was six decades ago.A line chart showing that the current extent of ice in the Arctic sea is lowest on record“This year was the warmest on record and had the most precipitation on record – to see both of those things happen in one year is remarkable,” said Matthew Langdon Druckenmiller, an Arctic scientist with theNational Snow and Ice Data Centerat the University of Colorado and an editor of the Arctic report card. “This year has really underscored what is to come.”Scientists have been struck by how exceptional warmth in other seasons, particularly summer, is now becoming evident in winter too, affecting the annual growth of sea ice across the Arctic in its coldest months. In the past month or so, sea ice extent has been the lowest on record, potentially heralding another reduced maximum for sea ice next year.“There’s been a steady decline in sea ice and unfortunately we are seeing rain now even in winter,” said Druckenmiller. “We are seeing changes in the heart of winter, when we expect the Arctic to be cold. The whole concept of winter is being redefined in the Arctic.”These changes are acutely felt by people and wildlife in the Arctic – rain falling on to snow can freeze into a barrier that makes it harder for animals to forage for food, while also making for more slippery, hazardous conditions for people traveling by road. The retreat of glaciers can also cause potentially dangerous flooding,as seen in Juneau, Alaska, this year.The loss of sea ice is opening up vast areas of dark ocean, which is absorbing, rather than reflecting, more of the heat that is raising global temperatures. While the melting sea ice isn’t itself causing the seas to rise,the loss of land-based glaciers is, with Noaa reporting that the huge Greenland ice sheet lost 129bn tons of ice in 2025. This will add to sea level rise that willmenace coastal cities for generations to come.“We are seeing cascading impacts from a warming Arctic,” said Zack Labe, a climate scientist at Climate Central. “Coastal cities aren’t ready for the rising sea levels, we have completely changed the fisheries in the Arctic which leads to rising food bills for sea food. We can point to the Arctic as a far away place but the changes there affect the rest of the world.”Explore more on these topicsArcticClimate crisisIceGlaciersnewsShareReuse this content"

Today, he raises 130 head of cattle and grows corn, wheat, grass and soybeans on 1,200 acres of land.For his family, his animals and wider business, water is life.So when, in May 2024, the Texas-basedAligned Data Centersbroke ground on its NEO-01, four-building, 200,000 sq ft data center on a brownfield site that abuts farmland that Hermes rents, he was concerned.“We have city water here. That’s going to reduce the pressure if they are sucking all the water,” he says of the data center.“They’re not good, I know that.”Two years ago, the company said it would invest about $202m on a “hyperscale” data center that would employ 18 people and dozens more in the construction process. Although the company claims it uses a closed-loop, air-cooled system for cooling its computers that can reduce the need for water, artificial intelligence, machine-learning and other high power-demand processes do rely on water as a cooling agent.All the while, a 10-minute drive north, the shoreline of Lake Erie hasn’t been this low in years.Water levels across all five Great Lakes have begunto drop in recent monthsas part of a long-term fall. Since 2019, the Great Lakes have seen water-leveldecreasesof two to four feet. While experts say this is a natural decrease given the record highs the lakes have experienced since 2020, it’s happening at a time when a huge new consumer of water has appeared on the horizon: data centers.The source of the largest single deposit of freshwater on the planet, the Great Lakes, in particular Lake Erie, are already struggling with the fallout of drought and warmer water temperatures that, at this time of year, fuel major lake-effect snowstorms, and greater than normal levels of evaporation due to the absence of ice cover.With major cities such as Chicago, Toronto, Detroit and Pittsburgh all within a few hundred miles of each other, small, under-resourced communities around the Great Lakes have become hugely attractive for data-center companies.In Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, Microsoft is building what it calls the “world’s most-powerful AI data center” that is set to open early next year and expected to use up to 8.4bn gallons of municipal water from the city of Racine every year. Racine gets its water from LakeMichigan. Similar stories are playing out in Hobart, Indiana, where AWS is planning to build a data center two miles from Lake Michigan’s shoreline, and in Port Washington, Wisconsin.In Benton Harbor, Michigan, locals are concerned that a proposed $3bn data center would contribute to environmental pollution and traffic.Forty miles west of Aligned’s under-construction data center in Ohio, in Woodville Township, hundreds of people showed up to a public meeting last October to voice concern about another proposed data center project in their rural community.“The Great Lakes region, especially in states such as Illinois and Ohio, [is] among the most data-center dense states in the region. In addition to the high volumes of water used on site for cooling, our recent research found that even more water may be consumed to generate electricity to power data centers’ energy needs,” says Kirsten James, senior program director for water at Ceres, a nonprofit headquartered in Boston.“These impacts can conflict with communities’ water-resource planning efforts.”The Great Lakes Compact, a 2005 accord signed by the governors of eight US states and two Canadian provinces, means that Great Lakes Water must only be used within the regional basin.Research by Purdue University found that data centers on average consume about 300,000 gallons of water a day. Water used by data centers is warmed significantly and for those that do not use a closed loop system, that heated effluent water, just 20% of the initial amount, is often discharged back into local wastewater systems or the environment, with potentially serious consequences for flora, fauna and human consumers. Even closed-loop systems that reuse the same water repeatedly need millions of gallons of water.While many new data centers are drawing water from local municipalities that, in turn, get their water from groundwater, much of that supply comes from the Great Lakes watersheds.Some communities are fighting back. Last month, residents of Fife Lake, Michigan, were overjoyed after hearing a plan for a data center in their town of 471 residents would be scrapped due to local opposition.Similar stories of successful opposition have played out in Indiana and elsewhere.But the data centers are fighting back.Private firms representing data center companies have often successfully sued community authorities, accusing them of illegally excluding certain types of developments, making small towns powerless in the battle to keep out giant water-guzzling corporations.In Michigan’s Saline Township, a community of about 400 people outside Ann Arbor, OpenAI and Oracle used a representative company to successfully sue the local authority to overcome opposition and build a massive facility that would use 1.4 gigawatts of electricity – roughly the equivalent of powering 1.4 million homes.The Detroit Free Press editorial board assailed the move, calling it a “a fait accompli, hammered into this tiny Washtenaw county community over the objections of residents, the elected board that represents them, and Michigan’s attorney general, absent expert or outside testimony save a cursory public hearing held over Microsoft Teams”.Data companies and their backers, however, say their presence is a net gain for Great Lakes communities by providing jobs and investment over the course of years.Aligned has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Perkins Township, the local school system and a career center. In return, it gets a 15-year tax exemption from local authorities. A representative declined to respond to questions from the Guardian asking how much water it intends to use at the data center and from where it originates.Local municipalities that support these facilities claim that the data centers will increase tax revenue and help rebuild ageing infrastructure such as water delivery systems that, in some places, are in significant need of upgrading. Calls, emails and messages left with Erie county commissioners asking if local authorities plan to supply the Perkins Township data center with water were not responded to.Some Perkins Township residents say a number of local companies have been hired during the construction phase, bringing work to the area.But many argue those investments are not worth the long-term price the community may pay.Amanda Voegle, who works at a heating business now directly facing the data center, is concerned about water and many other issues.“A couple of years ago, there was a water pollution issue at the site. I’m very concerned. Is this [water] going back into the lake?”Two years ago, the construction site upon which the data center is being built was found to be the source of contamination of a river that flows into Lake Erie, with the remediation company responsible cited by the Ohio EPA for unauthorized discharges into state waters.“I don’t understand why they built it so close to the street, because it’s an eyesore,” says Voegle.She says there have been other unusual incidents at her workplace recently, including power surges.“I don’t know if it’s related [to the data center]. It’s probably almost weekly that we lose power and have to fully reboot everything. There was a couple of things we actually had to replace because [the power surge] fried it.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyOhioMichigannewsShareReuse this content"

Even the sound of rain can cause trauma responses among people who lived through it.“Simple things can trigger them,” Ifill says. “One woman mentioned a trolley we often push through the corridors, carrying bedding and other items, whose sound reminded her of cracking branches and the wind. She no longer wants to hear that sound.”Hurricane Melissa, a category 5 storm, led to apackage of up to $6.7bnover three years and an additional $150m (£112m) payout from Jamaica’s pioneeringcatastrophe bondfor reconstruction, partially covering the estimated$9bn in economic losses. But the financial relief, experts warn, cannot cover the unseen cost: the widespread trauma – especially among those still recovering fromHurricane Berylin 2024.View image in fullscreenFunding focuses on physical reconstruction, but experts say mental health should be integrated into disaster response.Photograph: Ricardo Makyn/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile most attention focuses on physical reconstruction, studies over the past three years show thatpost-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) risks increase after hurricanes and displacement. Experts are calling for the integration of mental health into climate-disaster policy acrossCaribbean small island developing states.Researchers emphasise how extended displacement, loss of livelihoods and inadequate services worsen mental health risks. A 2023 Caribbean-focused paper warned ofa significant risk of PTSD, depression and anxiety after climate-related events. A qualitative study in Dominica this year alsodocumented anxiety, fearand emotional distress among people displaced by Tropical Storm Erika and Hurricane Maria.Dr Eamin Heanoy, a researcher at the University of Alberta, studied disaster survivors across a broad range of countries, including Mexico, India, Canada, Bangladesh, Germany, the US and Indonesia. Herqualitative review, published last year in the journal Healthcare, says that survivors could face three mental health challenges after a natural disaster: PTSD, depression and anxiety.Dr Rose-Ann Smith, a lecturer in geography and disaster risk management at the University of the West Indies inJamaica, agrees with this assessment. She notes that humans are generally resilient, but as the climate crisis worsens, mental health is becoming an increasingly significant issue – although prevalence surveys are lacking.Smith and Heanoy found that women reported higher mental distress than men. “So it’s quite possible women are more psychologically vulnerable than males [in such catastrophes],” Smith says.View image in fullscreenThe loss of homes and resources can exacerbate psychological struggles experienced by those attempting to recover from a disaster.Photograph: Ricardo Makyn/AFP/Getty ImagesHeanoy says that while some initial improvement in mental health occurs within a year, long-term outcomes remain uncertain. Whether or to what extent disaster survivors who experience mental challenges recover will depend to a large extent on what triggered their illness.The experts observe that during and in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, loss of homes and resources can intensify the mental struggle to rebuild. Smith calls housing loss “one of the primary stressors”, particularly when insurance or savings are lacking. “Rebuilding comes with its own mental burden,” she says.Ifill observes the same among her patients: “People who had mental health challenges before have noticed it’s significantly worse in this short period of time.”Hurricane Melissa destroyed two of Jamaica’s most prominent river water intakes, delaying the complete restoration of water supplies. Even if the catastrophe bond payout provides some relief, it cannot resolve all of Jamaica’s infrastructure problems in the aftermath.And, as experts highlight, rebuilding alone cannot heal emotional wounds caused by permanent disabilities or the loss of loved ones. Heanoy reports that survivors consistently find community support to be more responsive than government assistance. Smith observes that communal ties strengthen resilience.View image in fullscreenVolunteers unload bottled water for distribution to people affected by the passage of Hurricane Melissa.Photograph: Ina Sotirova/The Guardian“The government’s role is essential,” Smith says. “In its absence, or when it is slow, communities keep each other whole.”In times of disaster, Ifill says, mutual support from communities helps overcome challenges. She says she was “impressed by the sense of humour and relaxed manner” among strong communities in Jamaica. “Your house is gone, right? But if a community has more jovial people, they make jokes about the storm.”Ifill also praises Jamaica’s government for encouraging citizens to look after their mental health after Melissa, but warns about the harms of doomscrolling. “I recommended [staff] limit social media, stick to reliable news, and use WhatsApp to connect with family.”Mental health has garnered greater attention from international agencies over the past decade because of the climate crisis, as scientists have realised that the frequency of hurricanes and other extreme weather eventsis increasing.The World Health Organization publisheda booklet on psychological first aidin 2011 to guide field workers when dealing with survivors of traumatic events. The Pan American Health Organization (Paho) has also published guidelines, with documents released in2016and2019on psychological coping strategies and psychosocial support in response to natural disasters in the region.‘I’ve never seen anything like it’: can Jamaica adapt to the Caribbean’s increasingly unpredictable weather?Read moreTheCaribbean Development Bankhas also taken steps to help deal with such psychological trauma. Its president, Daniel Best, says that feedback from communities and staff members on the ground led the bank to initiate a psychosocial support programme in 2018 in conjunction with Paho. The project was designed to build individual and social resilience in the event of a disaster by training mental health professionals, creating a regional expert roster for emergency response, combating stigma and encouraging the use of mental health services.View image in fullscreenResidents of the town of El Cobre, in the city of Santiago de Cuba, charge their mobile phones in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa.Photograph: Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty ImagesMental health needs assessment and action plans for care and psychosocial support, Best says, adding that all of the bank’s borrowing member states can benefit from that project.Support from international organisations is crucial, as mental health is often not the top priority in governments’ responses to climate disasters. Experts such as Heanoy say that when survivors cannot rebuild or restore their pre-disaster lives, research shows that the trauma could persist, reducing the chances of full recovery.Kieron Chaboo, a farmer from Orange Grove, Trinidad and Tobago, who lost all the crops on his 30-acre (12-hectare) farm during massive floods in 2018, highlights the crucial role of financial resources in safeguarding mental health.He says he has always saved money with flood loss in mind, as he does not rely on government assistance to rebuild his life. Seven years after the disaster, he feels frustrated as he has yet to hear from officials responsible for compensating farmers for their losses. “They came and did their investigation,” he says. “But up to this day, we never got compensation.”View image in fullscreenPeople walk along a street in Petit Goave, Haiti, where floods caused by Hurricane Melissa killed several people.Photograph: Egeder Pq Fildor/ReutersBest notes that the region accounts for less than1% of global emissionsbut bears disproportionate climate impacts, and says that a swift, well-funded recovery is critical to prevent such prolonged suffering.“Our reality and our infrastructure do not match the climate conditions that we are facing. Attempting to rebuild an entire country to make it climate resilient is going to take time,” he says, adding that winds of 185mph (300km/h), as experienced in Jamaica, will inevitably cause significant destruction.He says the money needs to be available to enable countries to access and develop at the appropriate level. “If we can have structures that can withstand [major hurricanes], that means we will lose fewer people, and we will lose fewer of our possessions,” Best says. “If we can reduce loss, then it gives us a fighting chance to be mentally and psychosocially a bit more grounded.”Explore more on these topicsJamaicaSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanHurricane MelissaNatural disastersExtreme weatherGlobal healthClimate crisisCaribbeanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He says he has never got ill from drinking water from the Tigris River and believes that as long as the water is flowing, it is clean. But the truth is that soon it may not be flowing at all.Iraq’s famed Tigris is heavily polluted and at risk of drying up. Unless urgent action is taken to save the river, life will be fundamentally altered for the ancient communities who live on its banks.View image in fullscreenSheikh Nidham: ‘For our religion, the importance of water is like air.’Photograph: Hannah Lynch/The Guardian“No water, no life,” says Sheikh Nidham, a Mandaean religious leader living in the southern Iraqi city of Amarah, on the banks of the river in which he has been regularly immersed since he was a month old.Mandaeans are members of one of the oldest gnostic religions in the world. Southern Iraq has been their homeland for more than a thousand years, particularly in Maysan province. Amarah, the provincial capital, is built around the Tigris.Wateris central to their faith and every major life event requires ritual purification. Marriage ceremonies begin in water, and before drawing their last breath, Mandaeans should be taken to the river for a final cleansing.“For our religion, the importance of water is like air. Without water, life wouldn’t exist. At the beginning of creation, Adam was the first man on Earth. Before Adam there was water, and water was one of the elements that created Adam,” Sheikh Nidham explains.The Tigris is one of the two famous rivers that cradle Mesopotamia and once formed part of the “fertile crescent”. The river rises in south-east Turkey, and runs the length of Iraq, through its two largest cities, Mosul and Baghdad, until it joins the Euphrates; together, as the Shatt al-Arab, they finish their journey south to the Gulf.Map of Iraq and the wider regionHere, on the banks of these rivers, the history of the world was changed. Large-scale agriculture was first developed, the first words were written, and the wheel was invented. Today the Tigris waters are used for irrigation, transport, industry, power generation, and drinking for the estimated18 million Iraqiswho live within its basin.“All the life of Iraqis depends on the water. All the civilisation and all the stories that you hear, it depends on those two rivers. It’s more than water to drink or to irrigate or to use or to wash … It’s more even than spirituality,” says Salman Khairalla, the founder ofHumat Dijlah, a non-governmental organisation dedicated to protecting the river.But the health of the river has been in decline for decades. Iraq had state-of-the-art water infrastructure until the US made it a target in 1991’s Operation Desert Storm. With treatment plants destroyed, sewage flowed into the waterways. Years of sanctions and conflict mean the infrastructure has never fully recovered. Today, across southern and central Iraq, just30%of urban households are connected to a sewage treatment facility. That number drops to 1.7% in rural areas.In addition to municipal waste, chemical fertilisers and pesticides in agricultural runoff, industrial waste including from the oil sector, andmedical refuseall find their way into the river. A2022 studyfound that water quality at numerous sites in Baghdad was rated “poor” or “very poor”. In 2018, at least118,000 peoplein the southern city of Basra were treated in hospital after drinking contaminated water.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view taken in September 2021 shows a dried-up riverbed in the Huwaiza marshes about 260 miles (420km) south of Baghdad, on the Iraq-Iran border.Photograph: Asaad Niazi/AFP/Getty ImagesThe river has also dramatically shrunk in volume. In the past 30 years, Turkey has built major dams on the Tigris and the amount of water reaching Baghdad hasdecreased by 33%. Iran too has built dams and diverted water away from shared rivers that feed the Tigris. Within Iraq, water is frequently overused, especially in the agricultural sector thatusesat least 85% of the country’s surface water.The climate crisis is taking a toll. Iraq has recorded a30%declinein precipitation and is in the grip of its worst drought in nearly a century. Demand for fresh water is expected to exceed supply by 2035. This summer, the Tigris was so low people could easilywalk acrossit.Khairalla believes that upstream dams and mismanagement are the areas of biggest concern because as the river’s volume drops, the concentration of pollutants increases. “The water quality depends on the quantity,” he said.The Iraqi government has had to repeatedly press its northern neighbour to release more water from its dams. Wastage in Iraq is one of the concerns frequentlyraisedby Turkish officials in these discussions.In November, Baghdad and Ankara signed amechanismto tackle some of the river’s problems: stopping pollution, introducing modern irrigation technologies, reclaiming agricultural land, and improving water governance. It has been described as an “oil-for-water” accord as infrastructure projects will be undertaken by Turkish companies and paid for with oil funds. The Iraqi foreign ministry touted it as a “first of its kind” deal.The agreement, however, has drawn harsh criticism from experts, environmental activists, and the public, who are concerned about the lack of detail that has been released, that it appears to hand Ankara control of Iraq’s water resources, and is not officially binding.View image in fullscreenFishing boats in a depleted river in the Huwaiza marshes, near Amarah, on the Iraq-Iran border.Photograph: Asaad Niazi/AFP/Getty Images“There is no actual agreement right now,” said Mohsen al-Shammari, a former minister of water resources. “I would say it’s more like election propaganda.” The deal was signed just nine days before Iraq’s general election.Iraq’s water ministry, environment ministry, and government spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.Without water, Sheikh Nidham fears for the future of Mandaeans in southern Iraq. Many have alreadyleft the countryor moved upstream to the autonomous Kurdistan region. Estimates put their worldwide population at between 60,000 and 100,000, with fewer than 10,000 remaining in Iraq. A dying Tigris may be the final nail in the coffin.Explore more on these topicsRiversIraqWaterMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Richard, a former hairdresser, now volunteers his skills at a homeless shelter in Cardiff, and also helps friends by working as a delivery driver.Faye, an ex-nurse, volunteers as a cook at Cegin Hedyn community kitchen in Carmarthen and provides mental health counselling services to local organisations, including Brecon & District Mind charity. She will be working on Christmas Day.“The first time we won we gifted people cars, donated a minibus to the local rugby team and did our best to help friends and family,” said Faye. “It was all new and it was amazing to be able to make a difference.“This time around, who knows? We’re just going to take our time and enjoy the moment.”Explore more on these topicsNational lotteryWalesGamblingnewsShareReuse this content"

TheBBC reportedon Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.The agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. TheNew York Times first reportedBritish confirmation that negotiations had stalled.“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Tuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.The Trade Representative’s office said in apost on Twitter/Xthat these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.Thomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to theNew York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.The retaliation by the US follows a$140m fineslapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyUS politicsEuropean UnionKeir StarmerDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

But a subsequent letter sent on Tuesday said that his reply, received on Monday “does not directly address our request”.Two of those refusing food are on day 45 of their protest – one day less than Martin Hurson did before becoming the sixth of 10 IRA hunger strikers to die in 1982 – and another is on day 44.The latest letter says that Qesser Zuhrah, who has been refusing food since 2 November, experienced her legs shaking uncontrollably a few nights ago, collapsed on to the floor for hours and went in and out of consciousness.Zuhrah, who is being held at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey awaiting trial, was sick in an ambulance which was called only after an entire night of her begging to be taken to the hospital.The lawyers say that Amy Gardiner-Gibson, also at HMP Bronzefield on day 45, is exhausted and their test results are showing low white blood cells, low red blood cells and cognitive decline.“Given the context of our clients’ rapidly deteriorating health and the increasing likelihood that they might die as a result of this strike, this is highly concerning,” the letter from Imran Khan & Partners, seen by the Guardian, says.It adds that their commitment to this course of action “means that their death is increasingly more than a mere possibility. It is a likelihood, particularly if the situation remains unresolved.”The demands of the prisoners – who will have have been in prison for more than a year before they are tried – include immediate bail, endingthe ban on Palestine Actionand stopping restrictions on their communications.They allege that mail, calls and visits have been restricted on spurious grounds or without explanation, that legal mail has been opened unlawfully, access to books has been blocked, inmates have been taken off or banned from prison jobs for “security reasons” and “non-association orders” have been implemented between their clients.A lack of or late medical observations or treatment since the hunger strike began is also alleged in some cases.Two out of the eight hunger strikers – Jon Cink, who was in hospital, and Umer Khalid, who has muscular dystrophy – are understood to have ended their protest. The other prisoners refusing food are Heba Muraisi (day 44), Teuta Hoxha (day 38), Kamran Ahmed (day 37) and Lewie Chiaramello (day 12), who has diabetes.More than 50 MPs and peers have written to Lammy urging him to meet with MPs representing the hunger strikers and their loved ones, or their lawyers, “and act to prevent a catastrophe”.The independent MP and former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, put the request for a meeting to the justice minister, Jake Richards, in the Commons on Tuesday. When Richards replied “no”, laughter was heard from some MPs in the chamber, prompting Corbyn to post on X that “they should be ashamed of themselves”.Last week, the speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, said it was “totally unacceptable” that Lammy had failed to reply to a request from the Labour MP, John McDonnell, for a meeting with MPs to discuss the hunger strikers.The lawyers’ letter to Lammy says: “You are uniquely placed in that as a senior government minister with oversight of His Majesty’s prison service, you can bring about a resolution of the situation, such that the increasing deterioration of our clients’ health does not lead to their death.“We make clear that our request for a meeting is in an effort to seek to resolve the immediate situation and prevent the loss of life. Unless you tell us, we cannot see any reason why you would not want to engage in this process.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We continually assess prisoners’ wellbeing and will always take the appropriate action, including taking prisoners to hospital if they are assessed as needing treatment by a medical professional.“His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service has assured ministers that all cases of prisoner food refusal are being managed in accordance with the relevant policy and with appropriate medical assessment and support, consistent with prisoner rights.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But when his regular doctor wouldn’t provide it in the amounts he wanted, he turned to Plasencia.Plasencia admitted to taking advantage of Perry, knowing he was a struggling addict. Plasencia texted Chavez that Perry was a “moron” who could be exploited for money, according to court filings.Chavez admitted to obtaining the ketamine from a wholesale distributor on false pretenses and pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine. He has not been in custody.Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on Friends, when he became one of the biggest TV stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC’s megahit.Chavez is the second person to be sentenced of the five defendants who have pleaded guilty in connection with Perry’s death at age 54 in 2023.Perry was found dead by his assistant on 28 October. The medical examiner ruled ketamine was the primary cause of death. The actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression that has become increasingly common.Seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him, about a month before his death, Perry found Plasencia, who in turn asked Chavez to obtain the drug for him.He met with Plasencia between San Diego and Los Angeles to hand off ketamine he got using fraudulent prescriptions. In all, he admitted to supplying 22 5ml vials of ketamine and nine ketamine lozenges.Chavez will also be expected to do 300 hours of community service.The other three defendants who reached deals to plead guilty will be sentenced at their own hearings in the coming months. Garnett has said she would seek to make sure all the sentences made sense in relation to one another.Explore more on these topicsMatthew PerryLos AngelesLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

But thousands of demonstrators have stagedprotestsat the site of the proposed hotel and apartment building, a historically resonant spot long off-limits to developers.All the president’s millions: how the Trumps are turning the presidency into richesRead moreA spokesperson for Affinity Partners, an investment company run by Trump’s son-in-law and diplomatic envoy,Jared Kushner, which was developing the buildings alongside the Trump Organization, said: “Because meaningful projects should unite rather than divide, and out of respect for the people of Serbia and the City of Belgrade, we are withdrawing our application and stepping aside at this time.”Since Donald Trump won back the White House 13 months ago, his sons have struck a spree of deals from the Gulf to Vietnam that have helped to swell the family’s income to anestimated $864min the first half of this year alone. The president’s financial disclosures show that, while Donald Trump Jr and Eric are formally in charge of the Trump Organization, profits still flow to their father.The Trumps’ critics call it “pay to play”: the perception that enriching the first family can buy the president’s favour. The White House has responded to questions whether commercial considerations have influenced pardons, technology transfers, sanctions relief and tariff reductions by insisting that “neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest”.View image in fullscreenSerbia’s culture minister, Nikola Selaković, has been indicted over the project.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Trumps have mulled adding a Belgrade property to their international portfolio since at least 2013. In 2024, Kushner came to Serbia to announce that one was finally to be built. In January, days after Trump’s inauguration, Ericrevealedit would bear the family name.Two months later, Trump Jr was in Belgrade to see Vučić. While Serbians were filling the streets withprotests against his regime’s alleged corruptionand incompetence, the president and Trump Jr enjoyed what Vučić called a “cordial conversation” about “bilateral relations” – comments that suggested blurred lines between business and geopolitics.

Once a gem of modernist architecture, it was preserved as the ruins of the genocidal Slobodan Milošević regime’s military headquarters, bombed by Nato in 1999.Nine days after Trump’s November 2024 election victory, the Vučić regime revoked this protected status. But the necessary paperwork had been falsified, the head of the cultural heritage institute said after his arrest in May. Vučić spoke darkly of “corrupt gangs” of prosecutors bringing “fabricated cases”.But the prosecutor, Mladen Nenadić, pressed on. He made further arrests, culminating on Monday in the indictment of Vučić’s culture minister, Nikola Selaković, and other officials “in connection with the illegalities in the removal of the status of cultural property” from the site of the planned Trump Tower.Selaković denies wrongdoing. None of these allegations relate to the Trumps’ conduct or Kushner’s.Vučić said on Tuesday that those who opposed the Trump Tower wanted to “destroy Serbia”. The country faces an energy crisis after the Trump administration in October imposed sanctions on its Russian-owned oil refinery.Estela Radonjic Zivkov, an official at the heritage institute who defied pressure from agents of the state security agency to support the project, welcomed the decision to abandon the project. She told the Guardian: “This decision demonstrates that public interest, the rule of law, and professional integrity cannot be permanently overridden by political will and private interests.”Explore more on these topicsSerbiaDonald TrumpDonald Trump JrJared KushnerEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

However, the Water (Special Measures) Act passed in May only bans performance-related payments for those at the top of water companies including the chief executive and chief financial officer. As the latest awards are retention payments, they do not fall within the scope of the ban.‘Outwitted’: have water companies managed to sidestep Labour’s bonus ban?Read moreThe chair of the Efra committee, Alistair Carmichael, said: “It’s important that the focus of Thames management is on turning round the company and not on rewarding staff and having to handle negative headlines.“The public is rightly furious at the prospect of senior staff in a company with the performance record of Thames receiving bonuses. We will continue to monitor this situation.”The first tranche of retention payments to senior managers, totalling almost £2.5m, was paid in April. The company latersaid it had no intentionof clawing that money back. The managers were due to receive the same amount again in December, and a further £10.8m collectively next June.Paying executives large sums, in some cases up to £1m each, proved controversial because the retention payments came from a £3bn emergency loan secured by Thames’ class-A creditors.The creditor loan, which was challenged in court by rival bondholders, has an interest rate of 9.75%, plus fees. It was given by hedge funds, banks and other big investment firms that it already owes about £11.5bn, including Aberdeen, M&G, Elliott Management and Invesco.The same creditors are now the lead contenders to take over formal ownership of Thames in return fora further £5.3bn in equity investment and debt. They were forced to step in to avoid Thames Water collapsing into temporary nationalisation after theUS private equity firm KKR pulled outof a rescue deal.Thames is in a desperate race to raise funds andpersuade the water regulator to let it off hundreds of millions of pounds in finesor risk being renationalised.The class-A creditors have been trying to persuade the government to sign off on a recapitalisation deal which would let Thames Water escape environmental obligations and fines. The alternative would put the company into special administration.Thames Water declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterCorporate governanceUtilitiesWater industryExecutive pay and bonusesnewsShareReuse this content"

The latest data suggest things are moving in the wrong direction.The employment rate in the three months to October was 74.9%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), down 0.3 percentage points on the quarter.This shift was not driven by economic inactivity – a significant worry after the pandemic, as many people took early retirement or were unable to stay in work for health reasons – and was the focus of Labour’s Get Britain Working white paper last year.UK unemployment rose to four-year high of 5.1% before budgetRead moreInstead, as Nye Cominetti, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, has said, the more immediate worry is the relentless rise in unemployment.According to the ONS’s labour force survey released on Tuesday, the unemployment rate in the three months to Octoberrose to a four-year highof 5.1% – 0.8 percentage points higher than a year ago.Inactivity has been drifting down – to 21%, 0.7 percentage points lower, and not out of line with the norm before Covid. Health-related inactivity remains crucially important – but is not driving the current deterioration in the jobs market.UK unemployment chartYoung people have been hit particularly hard: the number of 18- to 24-year-olds out of work, at 546,000, is the highest since 2015 and up 85,000 on the quarter.“Young people again find themselves at the heart of this downturn, just as they were in the wake of the financial crisis and Covid. Policymakers and employers need to redouble efforts to support them,” Cominetti said.Labour intends to equalise theminimum wagefor younger workers with the adult rate, with another significant rise due in April, but some commentators, including the Resolution Foundation, have raised questions about whether that is the right step in the current climate..The ONS’s alternative, real-time indicators of the labour market – gathered from HMRC’s pay as you earn system – reveal an even more worrying employment picture.On this measure, the annual growth rate of payrolled jobs slipped into negative territory in March 2025 – just as Rachel Reeves’s employer national insurance increase and a chunky minimum wage rise were about to kick in – and has declined ever since.The early “flash estimate” for November suggests a loss of 0.6% of payrolled jobs in the economy year on year – the fastest decline since the depths of the pandemic..Theextended and chaotic run-in to Reeves’s late November budget, with relentless speculation about where tax rises might fall, seems unlikely to have helped.Of course, this continued slowdown in the jobs market brings with it softening wage growth – which should reassure theBank of England as it prepares to consider cutting interest ratesthis week.Annual growth in regular pay was 4.6%, according to the ONS’s main series, down significantly from the 5.9% in the final three months of 2024. The early real-time data suggests a much sharper decline, from an annual rate of 3.7% in September to just 2.7% in October.If Wednesday’s inflation data also reassures, that should open the way to the pre-Christmas cut in borrowing costs Reeves and her colleagues hope for. But the accelerating downturn in the labour market appears likely to take over from inflation as one of the biggest headaches facing ministers in 2026.Explore more on these topicsUK unemployment and employment statisticsLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

Federal government jobs declined by 162,000 in October, and 6,000 in November.Chart of US jobsThe latest jobs numbers arrive against a tumultuous background for the US’s economic data, once regarded as the gold standard in government data.The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)announcedthat full October jobs data would not be released and November’s jobs data was delayed due to the 43-day federal government shutdown. Questions have also been raised about its accuracy.Federal Reserve chairJerome Powellwarned last week that the data from the BLS should be treated with a “skeptical eye” while the hangover left from the shutdown works through the system.There are signs that the US’s job market is weakening. ADPreportedUS private sector employers shed about 32,000 jobs in November after adding 47,000 jobs in October.TheSeptember jobs report, released late in November due to the federal government shutdown, stated the US added 119,000 jobs, higher than economist predictions. Unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, its highest level since 2021.US added 119,000 jobs in September in report delayed by federal shutdownRead morePowell cautioned last week that jobs figures are likely worse than the numbers that have been reported and that Trump’s immigration policies have hurt labor supply, which has kept the unemployment rate relatively flat.His comments came after the Fedannouncedit was cutting interest rates by a quarter point, a move toward “risk management” over concerns of a weakening labor market.“Labor supply has also come down quite sharply. So, you know, if you had a world where there is just no growth in workers and you really don’t need a lot of jobs to have full employment, some people argue that is what we are looking at,” said Powell. “So, there is an overcount in the payroll job numbers, we think, continuing, and it will be corrected. I don’t have an exact month in my head right now. Again, I think forecasters generally understand that. We think it is about 60,000 a month, so 40,000 jobs could be negative 20, but that could be wrong by 10 or 20 in either direction.”Powell also cautioned about the veracity of the jobs report data due to the lack of data collection in October and early November due to the government shutdown.“We are going to get data, but we are going to have to look at it carefully and a somewhat skeptical eye by the January meeting,” added Powell.Economists suggested on Tuesday that the latest jobs report was unlikely to persuade policymakers on the Fed’s open market committee to ease monetary policy, and cut rates, at its next meeting.“The labor market remains weak, but the pace of deterioration probably is too slow to spur the FOMC to ease again in January,” said Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.The BLS has been under attack from the Trump administration. In August, TrumpfiredBLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer, hours after the July jobs report was published. Trump claimed, without evidence, the report was “rigged” to make him look bad.His nominee to replace McEntarfer, EJ Antoni, waswithdrawnin late September after bipartisan criticism over his lack of qualifications. The BLS was shut down, furloughing staff, during the 43-day shutdown of the federal government and a new nominee to lead the agency has yet to be made.The lack of leadership at the agency comes as the number of staff at the agency has shrunk under theTrump administration. The agencylost 20%of staff from fiscal year 2024, 2,058 total employees, to proposed staff levels for fiscal year 2026, 1,851 total employees.Explore more on these topicsUS economyJerome PowellTrump administrationUS politicsFederal ReserveUS unemployment and employment statisticsEmploymentnewsShareReuse this content"

Morrisons loses £17m VAT battle over rotisserie chickensHigh court rules whole cooked cool-down chickens should be subject to standard 20% tax rate for hot foodBusiness live – latest updatesJulia KolleweTue 16 Dec 2025 05.44 ESTFirst published on Tue 16 Dec 2025 05.13 ESTShareThe UK supermarket chainMorrisonsfaces a £17m tax bill after losing a lengthy court battle against HMRC over the charging of value added tax (VAT) on rotisserie chicken.The high court has ruledthat whole cooked cool-down chickens should be subject to the standard 20% VAT rate for hot food.The dispute relates to changes introduced by the then chancellor George Osborne’scontroversial “pasty tax” of 2012, when the Treasury imposed VAT on all hot takeaway food sold by bakeries and supermarkets, such as Cornish pasties, pies and sausage rolls. This prompted a public outcry, forcing the Treasury to partially row back.Morrisons becomes first UK supermarket to delay net zero targetsRead moreThe Treasury initially said that food sold above “ambient temperature” should be subject to VAT. It later decided to apply VAT to food stored in a hot cabinet, while exempting products placed on a rack that are sold either cold, or “incidentally hot” but eaten cold.Morrisons has argued that its rotisserie chickens should not be taxed because they are either eaten cold or reheated for dinner.The court ruling noted that Morrisons sold the chickens in bags with foil lining labelled “caution: hot product”.One witness said the chickens were not displayed for sale for more than two hours after they were taken out of the oven. If they had not been sold by the end of that period, they were discarded as waste.Richard Nichols, the finance director of Morrisons until January, told the court that the company’s tax and treasury team had always cooperated with HMRC of its own initiative. He added that Morrisons “operates in a highly competitive industry sector with low profit margins” and needed certainty of tax treatment to inform pricing decisions.He said research showed that 80% of Morrisons customers buying rotisserie chickens ate the chicken cold or for a later meal.Nichols said the chickens were typically bought by people on lower incomes, and two-thirds of customers felt £4.50 was the maximum they would pay, above the £4.40 price at the time of the hearings.With VAT, the price would have risen to £5.28 and “could have resulted inhundreds of thousands fewer chickens being bought every month, which would have repercussions for the whole supply chain and for balanced diets of families across the UK”, Nichols argued. It is unclear whether Morrisons will immediately increase the retail price of the chicken.Witnesses said after two hours, chickens in a bag had a temperature of between 42C and 45C, whereas a naturally cooling chicken would be at 31.8C. The judge said this showed that the products were stored in an environment that retained heat.The ruling concluded: “Morrisons failed to disclose the heat and grease/fluid retention features of the chicken paper bags and the fact that cool-down rotisserie chickens were taken off sale after two hours, whilst they were still well above the ambient temperature and were not on a cooling trajectory that meant that they would only be ‘incidentally hot’ when sold.”The ruling also said: “HMRC did not give clear and unambiguous rulings in 2012-14 that cool-down rotisserie chickens were zero-rated, which Morrisons had a legitimate expectation it could rely on.”Morrisons declined to comment on the ruling.Explore more on these topicsMorrisonsSupermarketsRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The planet-sized movie franchise of Avatar continues to spin massively in the cosmos – yet without affecting the tides in any other world. Maybe Avataristhe cosmos and its originatorJames Cameronis the new L Ron Hubbard; the creator, or rather prophet, of a new belief system involving big blue creatures with pointy ears that flap and twitch when they talk, to whom we will all one day be required to bow down when they float past. And while the rest of the cinema industry has quietly abandoned 3D without ever quite admitting it, theatres showing James Cameron’s giant new three-hour hunk of nonsense are still handing out the 3D specs to the customers.The first film was about human invaders seeking to exploit and colonise the weird tall blue Na’vi people in another galaxy for their mineral resources by piloting “avatar” replicants into their midst. One of these pilots was Cpl Jake Sully, played by Sam Worthington, who fell in love with Neytiri, played byZoe Saldaña, and stayed behind as a Na’vi – thus infuriating his commanding officer, Col Miles Quaritch, played by Stephen Lang, who since then has died in battle but is now resurrected as a Na’vi avatar, looking scarily as if Vinnie Jones had joined the Blue Man Group. Quaritch’s teen son Spider (Jack Champion) has turned against him and lives with Jake and Neytiri as their adoptive child. In the second film, the Na’vi people found a new world of water. Now in this third film they face the new element of … fire. For the proposed fourth and fifth films, they will presumably tackle earth and wind.View image in fullscreenWitchy … Varang (Oona Chaplin) in Avatar: Fire And Ash.Photograph: 20th Century Studios/PASo the Na’vi have come into contact with a new and apparently quite unexpected leader: Varang, played by Oona Chaplin, who provides the film with a kind of witchy sex interest. She is the leader of the Mangkwan clan, who live in a volcano and are possessed by the spirit of fire and ash, a fierce destructive belief that survival can only be achieved by dominance. The bullish Quaritch makes common cause with Varang in his need to divide and subdue the Na’vi and gain revenge over Jake, whose treachery he can’t forgive, and so he gives Varang weapons. The film makes it clear with a post-coital shot that they are having bedroom relations, to which the only response is a mixture of “wow” and “eww”.As ever, the look of this film is impressive and yet strange. Billions upon billions of pixels have been crunched to create its huge, infinitesimally detailed digital world. Like Middle-earth, it is probably the key to the franchise’s great success but, presented as it is in motion-smoothed high-definition, it looks to me like a “making of” featurette projected on to the white cliffs of Dover. And when ordinary human faces appear, they seem bizarrely out of context, as if Photoshopped in, like seeing American movie stars’ faces on a poster advertising a panto.Edie Falcoagain plays the general, her face set in an unvarying expression of pop-eyed annoyance at everything that presents itself to her senses. As an actor, she probably thinks it’s the only way to get through this. Jemaine Clement has a cameo that oddly humanises the film.What we are heading for is yet another mighty struggle between the Na’vi and the evil human invaders, the “pink-skins”, and (as ever) it needs to be conveniently resolved by calling on the assistance of huge undersea creatures whose presence certainly levels the playing field. There are, admittedly, some dramatic moments that prevent this thirdAvatarfrom being quite the bland screensaver the second one was: we get an Abraham-and-Isaac-type crisis that makes Jake question what leadership really is, and also a Holmes-v-Moriarty-at-the-Reichenbach-Falls-type confrontation. Yet audiences may find Quaritch’s decision-making a touch eccentric, and the beginning of the fourth film is now going to be bogged down with a long and contrived explanation about what happened to him. Avatar is as gigantically uninteresting and colossally impervious to criticism as ever: a vast, blank edifice that placidly repels objection.Avatar: Fire and Ash is out on 18 December in Australia and 19 December in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmAvatarJames CameronScience fiction and fantasy filmsAction and adventure filmsZoe SaldañaEdie FalcoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Mistletoe and wine. Children singing Chriiiiiiistian rhyme. But what is this? Beneath the unrecyclable wrapping paper stirs a sense of unease. For here comes the BBC’s annual Ghost Story for Christmas, a brrr-inducing, Mark Gatiss-helmed adaptation of EF Benson’s The Room in the Tower, starring Tobias Menzies and Joanna Lumley.The festive schedules have, of course, long played host to ghost stories; the season lends itself as readily to the shrouded and malign as the baubled and mulled. But which are the finest of TV’s many Christmas chillers?View image in fullscreenBrrr-inducing … A Ghost Story for Christmas: The Room in the Tower.Photograph: BBC/Adorable Media/Joe DugganLet us clamber into our Vauxhall Trepidation and, screaming pre-emptively, explore.A Warning to the CuriousBBC, 1972“It’s Chriiiiiiiiiiiiiiistmaaaaas,” observes Noddy Holder in Slade’s Merry Xmas Everybody, a howl of midwinter dread that may well have been prompted by an incautious, late-night viewing of this, the second (and arguably best) of the BBC’s Ghost Stories for Christmas. The plot? An amateur archaeologist (Peter Vaughan) digs up a Saxon crown, an act that – thanks to the artefact’s undead guardian – ensures he is sadly unlikely, this Christmas, to be “hanging up his stocking on the wall”.Inside No 9: The Devil of ChristmasBBC, 2016View image in fullscreenForged in ketchup and molten knitwear … Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith in The Devil of Christmas.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyThe climactic twist may have been too unpleasant for some [waves] but this was in every other respect a belter: a brilliant pastiche of low-budget 70s horror anthologies, forged in ketchup and molten knitwear, the whole thing lurched with the biliousness of the era. Ding dong merrily? Not here, pal.Ghost Stories for ChristmasBBC, 2000MR James (Christopher Lee) reads a selection of his short stories. Yawnsville? Au contraire. While the sparse, candlelit setting provided the perfect backdrop for James’s tales of supernatural torment, the lingering closeups invited viewers to marvel at the astonishing architecture of Lee’s head; a vast, sepulchral edifice that would surely have elicited whispers of sorcery were it to have been discovered in a tropical thicket by a malarial Victorian in a pith helmet.The League of Gentlemen Christmas SpecialBBC, 2000Welcome ye to Royston Vasey, where among those sharing festive yarns of horror with an unsympathetic Rev Bernice (Reece Shearsmith) are a tramp who’d suffered Herr Lipp’s (Steve Pemberton) vampiric advances and a hapless Mr Chinnery (Mark Gatiss), who bringeth the gift of surprise in the form of an ossified monkey scrotum.The Woman in BlackITV, 1989View image in fullscreenMagnificently unsettling … Pauline Moran in The Woman in Black.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockFew sights are as conducive to “simply having a wonderful Christmastime” as that of a Victorian phantom shrieking towards the camera, her gums bared like the “before” photo in an advert for Listerine. And so it was, with this magnificently unsettling adaptation of Susan Hill’s 1983 novel, that the nation’s shoulder pads didst wither as one.The Box of DelightsBBC, 1984One of the most enduringly wonderful of all gulp-inducing “yuletide” adventures, this Bafta-winning series took in pagan mythology, puppets and Robert Stephens as dastardly occultist Abner Brown in a performance of seething, spittle-flecked enormousness.The SignalmanBBC, 1976Dickens. Steam trains. Bowler hats. Denholm Elliott. Self-sacrifice. Claustrophobia. Tunnels. Danger. Eyeless prophets of doom. Mute terror. “Below there!” Death. Bloody – and, if you will – hell.Bergerac: Fires in the FallBBC, 1986“The 1986 Bergerac Christmas special?” you splutter. “Scary?” To which I bellow: “Yes.” Here was a wholly unexpected case for offshore leisure cop DS Jim Bergerac (John Nettles), his leather blouson wilting in the ensuing firestorm of deranged arsonists, narked-off spirits and – the marmalade-dropper – a graveyard loiterer in a shroud.The Stone TapeBBC, 1972Yes, the acting is large, the “attitudes” wearisome and someone really should have asked goateed protagonist Michael Bryant to use his INDOORS VOICE. But Nigel Kneale’s tale of boffins uncovering “recordings” of ancient horrors remains uniquely disconcerting, its atmosphere of suffocating dread accompanied by unearthly blips, sniggles andskrrrreeeeeeeps.Whistle and I’ll Come to YouBBC, 1968Here comes Michael Hordern, jowls flapping like windsocks as he’s chased along a beach by what appears to be a bedsheet making slowed-down cow noises. Despite its unfestive origins (it was first aired in May 1968), Jonathan Miller’s adaptation of MR James’s short tale is perhaps the quintessential winter ghost story – a panorama of existential uneaseencompassing social awkwardness, unnameable evil and the ageless horror of an underwhelming lunch (“I told them I didn’t like tomatoes”).A masterpiece, obviously, with (slowed-down cow) bells on.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Benny made wrestling drama The Smashing Machine, starring The Rock; Josh a loose take on the life of Marty Reisman, a shoe-store clerk in 1950s New York, who aspires to table tennis pre-eminence but must hustle to fund his passage to championships in London and Tokyo.The trailer for Marty Supreme.The film – whose score draws significantly from the 1980s – is A24’s most expensive yet and a major awards hopeful for its star, director and writer. It also features one of the wildest and most characterful supporting casts ever assembled, including David Mamet, Sandra Bernhard, high-wire artista Philippe Petit, fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, the British-Indian academic Pico Iyer, Abel Ferrara and Tyler the Creator.Gwyneth Paltrow has been lured out of retirement to play a faded film star, Kay, with whom Marty begins an affair. Meanwhile Kevin O’Leary – a Canadian entrepreneur known as Mr Wonderful on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon’s Den – makes his film debut as her billionaire husband, Milton, with whom Marty shares a dynamic not unlike that between Guy Pearce and Adrien Brody in The Brutalist.View image in fullscreenChalamet in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Courtesy of A24You’ve said that Marty represents the confidence, cockiness and ambition that America expressed in the postwar years. Who represents America today?I think that the victory of the second world war really set aflame the idea of the American dream. That an individual can change the world. You can be anyone from anywhere and you can find glory and there’s a reason to your existence.View image in fullscreenWith Tyler, The Creator.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/Getty ImagesAnd then, in the 1980s, America was coming out of the defeat in Vietnam and the cultural and economic depression. So Reagan tried to resurrect the American dream. But this time, it was in quote marks. The 80s were the first postmodern era – and are really the most lasting era. You walk around and hear 80s music all the time. It was the last truly modern movement. It was then that capitalism won, the past began to haunt the future and the future was just revisiting the past.What is happening now, because of the lasting effect of the 80s, is that the American dream – that quest for prosperity – is in double quote marks. And it might be even harder to achieve.The film feels rooted in the postwar literature ofBellow and Roth;young Jewish men chasing to make their way in New YorkThese wide-eyed determined people who live with a sense of urgency, outside of time, are very attractive to me. I love Budd Schulberg’s What Makes Sammy Run? And Mordecai Richler’s The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz was very influential. That chronicling of the Lower East Side, all these idiosyncratic singular characters living on top of each other in chaos. Me and [co-writer] Ronald Bronstein also read a lot of nonfiction books, which were not very well written. But usually, the worse the writing, the better – for film purposes.View image in fullscreenDirecting Marty Supreme.Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima/APIs there a type of anxiety innate to particular ethnic groups? Could you have made this story about a community that wasn’t Jewish?I do think there is a certain unrest in Jewish culture. Not so much in the text of the Old Testament. But amongst the culturally Jewish there is a sense of constant rebuilding. The idea of ‘we might have to move at any moment’. It’s a nomadic culture that’s been moved around a lot. That impermanence is actually quite spiritual, but I do think there’s a latent anxiety in that lifestyle because of it.Near the end of the film, at the Tokyo championship, Milton says he’s a vampire. What does he mean?What we saw in Japan after the war was so unique: the way they embraced defeat after being such an intense – and pretty violent – culture. The war didn’t end for them until 1952, when America started to leave.View image in fullscreenWith Gwyneth Paltrow.Photograph: Jim Ruymen/UPI/ShutterstockI thought: how fascinating that they used table tennis to come out of isolation. They invented this new bat, which they called the atomic paddle, and with it they obliterated everybody. It was the beginning of passive colonialism and carpetbagging and corporate colonialism and globalism. But there were a lot of protections to prevent American companies moving into Japan. Sony is called Sony because the [Japanese] founder heard GIs calling little kids “Sonny”.A vampire is no different than someone who sucks the oil out of the planet. They’re a parasite who lives off hosts. Milton is a vampire. He’s a cold, corporate, capitalist colonialist. And they’ll be around for ever; I don’t see them going anywhere. There is an art to what they do – obviously a lot of destruction, too – but sometimes a beauty. That’s why I cast Mr Wonderful. Kevin is the asshole on that show; he’s the most crude. And he came up with that line vampire line, actually.Marty’s friend and fellow pingpong champ, Béla (played bySon of Saul’s Géza Röhrig) tells Marty how, while imprisoned at Auschwitz, he came across some beehives. He covertly smeared honey all over his body and let his fellow prisoners lick it off him later.That’s based on a true story. Alojzy Ehrlich was a Jewish guy from Hungary whose life was spared by Auschwitz officers who recognised him and his talents. He was a genius. Like a lot of these players: very high IQ. It’s peculiar the sport attracted a very eccentric type of person: smart, but got bad grades, couldn’t hold a job. But they could dispose of bombs [as Ehrlich did and Röhrig’s character does] and be at a hotel like this [Claridge’s] because they were international, and thought bigger. I learned more about the Holocaust in that little story than from some movies that are only about the Holocaust.View image in fullscreenAt the LA premiere.Photograph: John Salangsang/ShutterstockMilton is angry that he lost his son in the war and he thinks part of the reason why was defending the Jews. In his speech to Marty there is buried some sort of latent antisemitism. That’s his way of coping. I’m not someone who thinks the whole world is looking through that lens, though. I’m much thicker-skinned than that.The honey-licking sacrifice contrasts with the vampiric suckingEven more of a call to the vampiric is the shot of Marty and Kay in the hotel room. [Production designer] Jack Fisk would do silly things like put paintings around which evoked Transylvania and whatnot. Kay is literally biting the neck of young Marty. She’s trying to suck the youth out of this man and get his passion.View image in fullscreen‘That’s why I shoot on film: it preserves’ … a scene from Marty Supreme.Photograph: Courtesy of A24Do older people today do that?There is more of an obsession with youth than there’s ever been. In our lifetimes, I think there will be ways to raise your life expectancy in rich countries by 50 years. And eventually immortality. And that’s scary. Because an end is very important. Narrative is important. Imagine sitting down to watch a movie with no run time.I also fear electromagnetic catastrophe and the loss of everything. Some intelligent life-form finds this planet and we’re all gone: all of the hard drives are dead. Not that [aliens] would have any idea how to get the information off them. But things shot on film they’ll be able see. That’s why I shoot on film: it preserves.How big a risk do you think that is?View image in fullscreenWith Robert Pattinson, directors Benny Safdie and Buddy Duress at the Heaven Knows What premiere in 2015.Photograph: Anna Webber/FilmMagicI think if it’s a possibility, it’s gonna happen. Maybe an asteroid will hit the world first. This is all speculative and I’m a bit paranoid sometimes – but I have CDs I put tons of jpegs, photos of my childhood that I scanned on which are now gone, dead, no information.

It will be the most valuable, because it was the moment when we saw things change.Marty Supreme begins at the moment of a child’s conception – we see sperm swimming towards an egg – and takes place over the next nine months. Is it a repudiation of the idea men don’t do much during pregnancy? And are men programmed, like sperm, to compete?I think that men are lost and women have a very concrete understanding of a purpose for humanity. You see amongst the chaos of the sperm there’s one that’s like: I need to be the person. And then there’s the egg that’s just there. And if you look at the cosmos, those [eggs] are the planets.View image in fullscreen‘A very concrete understanding of a purpose for humanity’ … Gwyneth Paltrow in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Courtesy of A24When my daughter was born, she didn’t need her dad.

So it felt natural for Michael Douglas, just 31, to make his first foray into producing withOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, a tale of one man raging against the system.Fifty years since its release, Douglas is struck how Cuckoo’s Nest resonates anew in today’s landscape. “It’s about as classic a story as we’ll ever have and it seems timeless now, with what’s going on in our country politically, about man versus the machine and individuality versus the corporate world,” the 81-year-old says via Zoom from Santa Barbara, California.One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest at 50: the spirit of rebellion lives onRead moreIs he talking about Donald Trump? “Not just in America but we see autocratism continue around the world,” Douglas adds. “When we have insecurity, people tend to go to having an omnipotent figure that will solve everything.”The autocrat in Cuckoo’s Nest is Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who enforces strict routines and suppresses any spark of individuality in an Oregon psychiatric hospital. She wages a battle of wills with Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a rebellious small-time criminal who fakes insanity to avoid prison labour and ends up committed to a mental institution. As McMurphy’s anarchic spirit spreads, the ward briefly feels freer and more alive.The film, released on 4K Blu-ray last month for its 50th anniversary, is based onKen Kesey’s 1962 novel. Fresh from his success in Spartacus, Douglas’s father Kirk had acquired the rights and played McMurphy in a 1963 Broadway stage production. Douglas, meanwhile, read Cuckoo’s Nest in college. “Reading it, and being a hippie at the time, and the psychedelics that were involved and all that, it was kind of a Bible for us,” he recalls.Kirk spent years trying get a film version made but decided to give up and sell the rights. Douglas recalls: “I never thought about producing but I said let me run with it and he was generous enough and kind enough to let that happen. As a result, we finally got it made. My half of the producing fee I gave to Dad and he made more money off of that than any movie he had done in his career.View image in fullscreenMichael Douglas on set.Photograph: Photo 12/Alamy“But he was disappointed at not being able to play the part, which always had been an issue, and I certainly know after all these years how you can count good parts on one hand in your whole career. It doesn’t come along that often. The only saving grace was when he finally saw the picture he loved it and he loved Jack’s work.”Kirk’s letdown at not playing the role was offset by “how proud and impressed” he was, Douglas adds. “He looked at me with a new eye, something you couldn’t believe, because to your father you were always a kid and so it was nice. But yeah, he liked to remind me about it.”Douglas’s producing partner Saul Zaentz asked Kesey to write a screenplay but it was not the right fit and they fell out with the author. The project began to take shape, however, with screenwriter Lawrence Hauben, who steered Douglas towards the wild, mordant humour of Czech directorMiloš Forman.Forman, then holed up in New York’sChelsea hoteland reputed to be in the grip of a breakdown, nonetheless flew to California. Unlike most directors, who kept their plans to themselves, Forman dissected the script page by page. Douglas was sold.They had to wait six months for Nicholson to finish another project but this proved a blessing as they could extend casting options far and wide.Danny DeVito, who was Douglas’s oldest friend and had appeared in a 1971 off-Broadway production of Cuckoo’s Nest, was the first to sign up. Finding the right actor to play Chief Bromden, a towering Native American who pretends to be deaf and mute, would be more serendipitous.On a flight to New York, Douglas sat next to a used-car dealer and rodeo announcer called Mel Lyman from Eugene, Oregon, and told him about the film. “I gave him my number and forgot about it and about six months later, I get a call in my office. ‘Listen, Michael, the biggest sonofabitch Indian I ever seen walked in the door the other day. This sonofabitch is big, Michael, I’m telling you.’ That wasWill Sampson.”When Douglas and Nicholson first met Sampson at Portland airport, they knew they had their man. “Will comes off [a plane] with his cowboy boots on and his hat and he’s over seven feet, with long hair, and Jack shouts: ‘Oh, my God, it’s the chief! It’s the chief! Oh, I can’t believe it’s the chief.’ He looked at him and it was central casting. That was probably the most euphoric moment: how are we gonna find this guy, this character, and there he was.“Then Jack said, ‘Can he talk? Can he talk?’ And then he went, ‘Wait a minute, he doesn’t have to talk! He doesn’t talk in the movie.’ We were so excited that we wanted him to stay with us so he came with us. We were on a little tiny twin prop plane and we were overcrowded. Will was sitting in the front seat next to the pilot, and we didn’t have enough room, and Jack was sitting on his lap: ‘God damn, it’s the chief, it’s the chief!’They struck gold again with Fletcher for the role of Ratched. Douglas says: “It was at a time politically -Gloria Steinem– when the idea of a woman playing a villain was a no-no. Guys loved to be the villain; villains were great. Four major actresses turned the part down and then Miloš found Louise in a Bob Altman movie, playing a smaller part and we tested her and she was wonderful, and that was a great new discovery too.”The production decamped to an active psychiatric hospital in Oregon – in January, when daylight vanished by mid-afternoon. The hospital’s director, Dr Dean Brooks (who would later appear in the film), encouraged his patients to join the crew. They did, across multiple departments.Douglas recalls:“Why are we in Oregon in January? It gets dark at 3.30 in the afternoon, whatever light I had out the windows. We felt there was this need for the very verisimilitude and the cooperation. Dr Brooks, who now has been cast as in the picture, helped integrate our actors into actual group therapy sessions with the patients in the hospital.“Since it was a state mental hospital, it was also a hospital for the criminally insane. Part of our deal with them was hiring many patients to work on our crew. In the art department we had an arsonist working there, and I remember thinking, is this the best place for this gentleman to be?”But ultimately, Douglas argues, the decision to film on location paid off. “The difference of going home every night back to your home in Los Angeles and then coming to work versus being there. At a point many of our actors were actually sleeping on their cots on the set at night because it built that bond.”View image in fullscreenMichael Douglas on set.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty ImagesNicholson and Fletcher watched electroconvulsive shock therapy at six o’clock one morning. ActorBrad Dourif, who played a young, voluntary patient on the psychiatric ward, found the immersive experience valuable. Speaking from his home in Woodstock, New York, the 75-year-old recalls: “We would go up and spend four hours in maximum security with dangerous people.“Drugs changed everything. Everybody was extraordinarily normal. I talked to a bunch of people and they were very normal. That was the lesson that Miloš wanted us to have: that he didn’t want everybody to look crazy with some kind of shtick. He kept saying, ‘Do it natural, natural’.He adds: “There was a big fight over windows. The cinematographer frosted the windows and Miloš was upset about that because he said that he wanted to see outside and to see cars going outside, to get a feeling that they’re not isolated from a world that they could take part in. It was sitting right out there and whatever it was that was going on in everybody’s head, all they had to do was, go outside. They didn’t have to be there - almost.”Dourif believes that Bibbit is bipolar, a term that had not yet been introduced. The character also has a pronounced stutter, which worsens under stress or when confronting authority, symbolising the way the world – and especially his mother – has silenced him. Dourif recalls how he worked on the stutter.“I did some exercises where I would go to a place where there was a line and everyone was in a hurry and you had to know what you wanted before you got there, otherwise people would kill you - like Grand Central station - and I would go and stutter.“Miloš also said to me, which was an incredible note, that in his experience, anybody who talks to somebody and stutters is being incredibly courageous because at the moment they are trying to talk, they are totally alone.”Cuckoo’s Nest was turned down by every major studio yet went on to win the “big five” Oscars: best film, director, actor, actress and screenplay. Steven Spielberg, who had directed Jaws that year,told the recentJaws @ 50 documentary: “Oh yeah, I would’ve [voted for] One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest for best picture over Jaws. I would’ve done that.”It was a first Academy award for Nicholson. Dourif reflects: “He was owed an Oscar and he was like, ‘I’m not letting this slip out of my hands, man, I’m going to do the very best I can.’“He brought everybody up. He was the only person who had done a lot of movies. The rest of us had done stage so he knew what we were supposed to do. He was there to advise us. Basically, he understood about needing to play and so when it was difficult off camera he would try to make us laugh. That was a cool thing.”Mercurial and mischievous, Nicholson delivered set pieces such as pretending to watch a baseball game – announcing imaginary pitches, hits, and plays with exuberance – even as he stares at a blank TV screen after Ratched refused his request to switch the ward’s schedule.View image in fullscreenMichael Douglas poses with an honorary award at a screening of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in JulyPhotograph: Michal Čížek/AFP/Getty ImagesDourif continues: “Somebody said about Nicholson that his performances were, ‘I can do what I want’ – there was something innately rebellious in his spirit – but by Cuckoo’s Nest it had translated to, ‘I can do what I want, and you can too.’ It was an allegory against the dangers of what institutions do to people.”In the pantheon of great movie endings – Citizen Kane, Dead Poets Society, The Graduate, Planet of the Apes – there is surely a place for Cuckoo’s Nest.The chief discoversthat McMurphy has been lobotomised, smothers him with a pillow as an act of mercy and finds uncanny strength to uproot a huge hydrotherapy machine and hurl it through a window so he can run away to freedom.Dourif was moved by the ecstatic response ofChristopher Lloydas one of the patients whose spirit was liberated by McMurphy: “I thought Will was incredible – he did a beautiful job - but Christopher Lloyd sold that. His reaction to it was astounding and absolutely dead on.”Douglas also credits composerJack Nitzsche’s inspired use of a bowed saw, saying: “Jack created this incredible score – wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah – which built up at the end. Then Christopher Lloyd, that last image - we knew the ending worked.“It was one of those pictures where we’re firing on all cylinders. We had a solid script, it was cast beautifully, very well directed, the score was great. My first movie as a producer, it lends me so much information for the rest of my career. I learned so much from that and I’m so proud to be sitting here talking to you about it 50 years later.”Explore more on these topicsOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's NestMichael DouglasJack NicholsonMiloš FormanDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She’s only made four features in 20 years, but with obsessive consistency each time: an exquisitely controlled hermetic world that exudes weird biological and psychological anxieties – from the pre-pubescent prep school of 2004’s Innocence, to the island hospital nurturing impregnated boys in 2015’sEvolution. These microcosms, governed by their own internal laws, seem to exist in some far-off arthouse realm indifferent to regular cinema.But her new film,The Ice Tower, makes the coyest of glances towards commercial territory by rooting itself in Hans Christian Andersen. “Vast, immense, glittering like ice was the realm of the Snow Queen,” lullabies Marion Cotillard in the preamble; the story is the preferred bedtime reading of teenage orphan Jeanne (Clara Pacini), who escapes from her foster home, heads down the mountain, and stows away on a film production of the fairytale. The queen is being played by imperious diva Cristina van der Berg (who is played for us by none other thanla Cotillard).Seen through Jeanne’s eyes, it is film-making itself that, this time, becomes a rarefied, hieratic Hadžihalilović world. The set-dressings, fittings and backstage loiterings are heavy with latent significance. Offering herself as an extra, Jeanne becomes an initiate in this rite. After Jeanne poses as “Bianca” on set, Cristina adopts the girl with the white stuff as her protege; the kid, enthralled at finally entering the magic kingdom, is only too happy to comply. As scenes from the shoot spin kaleidoscopically into Jeanne’s daydreams and back, Hadžihalilović keeps us at a crepuscular threshold of the artificial and the real, fiction and the truth.But this is a cautionary tale, about the perils of fantasy and idolisation. Guided by her reverie, Jeanne doesn’t understand what she is seeking from her frosty role model: a mother substitute, or an infatuation. Call it a madonna-hoar complex. Or perhaps it’s even more: to become the Snow Queen herself. Sharing a similar forlorn past, Cristina knows the price of inhabiting the fantasia: “You think that is enough for her?” she says of her character’s splendid isolation. In the film’s indeterminate analogue 1970s setting is a warning for all who are dazzled and entranced by too much imagery in the digital snowglobe.The Ice Tower review – Marion Cotillard focus of obsession and idolisation in death-wish fairytaleRead moreAnd where, as the ondes Martenot warbles disquietingly on the soundtrack, is the monster hiding in this fairytale? Could it be the director (played by Hadžihalilović’s real-life partner, directorial enfant terribleGaspar Noé), seen at one point slime-ing up another ingenue? No, of course it must be Cotillard – reigning over the film, ever more claustrophobically, with trademark damaged hauteur. You could interpret The Ice Tower as a kind of #MeToo film – but one with a very French bent, the country having embraced the movement suspiciously. Perhaps the monster is film-making and art itself: hoarding and crystallising beauty, as Hadžihalilović does so expertly, until desire hits absolute zero.Explore more on these topicsFilmBest films UK 2025Drama filmsMarion CotillardfeaturesShareReuse this content"

By opera house standards, that’s a remarkably big number, especially for a staging that is now more than 40 years old.But it’s not hard to see why this Turandot keeps on returning. Puccini’s darkest, most ritualistic and choral opera is a showstopper shot through withmusical colour, innovation and interest. In tough economic times for the art form, it offers guaranteed box office, due in no small part to the iconic tenor aria Nessun Dorma. What’s more,Andrei Serban’s 1984 production is a living theatrical classic, in which everything is played out within oppressive sets inhabited by shadowy watchers. It is confidently revived here by Jack Furness, with eye-catching orientalist choreography by Kate Flatt.View image in fullscreenSimone del Savio, Emmanuel Fonoti-Fuimaono and James Kryshak as a lively Ping, Pang and Pong in Turandot at the Royal Opera House.Photograph: Camilla GreenwellAnd then, for the four pre-Christmas performances only, there is alsoAnna Netrebko. Immediately Netrebko’s Turandot starts to sing, which does not happen until midway through the second act, one realises that everything preceding this moment, effective though it may have been in its way, has been run-of-the-mill by comparison. Netrebko’s vocal richness and the grandeur of her phrasing lift things to a different level. There are times in her performance when one is aware of being in the presence of operatic greatness.Yes, there are occasional caveats about vibrato and attention to text – but then there were plenty of those with Callas and Sutherland too – and when judging Netrebko one is judging in their league. Turandot, unlike many Puccini heroines, is unavoidably a very loud sing. For some very fine Turandots that was always enough. Yet Netrebko brings softness and an extended line too, where Puccini permits, and there is nothing metallic or heartless about her rendering of the great riddle scene around which this opera rotates.Almost inevitably, the evening’s other principals are eclipsed by Netrebko.Yusif Eyvazovmade a stentorian start as Turandot’s suitor Calaf, but by the time he got to Nessun Dorma in the final act, Eyvazov was relying on heft and training rather than lyricism.Masabane Cecilia Rangwanashawas a warmly sung Liu, the opera’s victim and the only character whom one cares about. Simone del Savio, Emmanuel Fonoti-Fuimaono and James Kryshak were a lively Ping, Pang and Pong, yet without making the most of the roles, while Rafał Siwek was a dignified Timur. The veteran tenorRaúl Giménezsang the Emperor Altoum. Daniel Oren’s conducting was relentless but unilluminating.Until 4 February.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

It could mean more royalties – but many are worriedEamonn FordeTue 16 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 05.01 ESTShareThis was the year that AI-generated music went from jokey curiosity to mainstream force.Velvet Sundown, a wholly AI act, generated millions of streams; AI-created tracks topped Spotify’s viral chart and one of the US Billboard country charts; AI “artist” Xania Monet “signed” a record deal. BBC Introducing is usually a platform for flesh-and-blood artists trying to make it big, but an AI-generated song by Papi Lamour was recently played on the West Midlands show. And jumping up the UK Top 20 this month is I Run, a track by dance act Haven, who have beenaccused of using AI to imitate British vocalist Jorja Smith(Haven claim they simply asked the AI for “soulful vocal samples”, and did not respond to an earlier request to comment).The worry is that AI will eventually absorb all creative works in history and spew out endless slop that will replace human-made art and drive artists into penury. Those worries are being deepened by how the major labels, once fearful of the technology, are now embracing it – and heralding a future in which ordinary listeners have a hand in co-creating music with their favourite musicians.AI music platforms analyse huge amounts of recorded music in order to learn its sounds, structures and expressions, and then allow users to create their own AI-generated music via text or speech prompts. You might ask for a moody R&B song about a breakup sung by a female vocalist, and it will come up with a decent approximation of one, because it’s absorbed hundreds of such songs.Artists and labels initially saw AI as the biggest existential threat sinceNapster-fuelled piracy: if not a replacement for human creativity, then certainly a force that could undermine its value. Gregor Pryor, a managing partner at legal firm Reed Smith, says background music for things such as advertising, films and video games, where you’re not relating to a personality as you would in pop music, “is where the real damage will be done” first of all. “People will ask: why would I pay anyone to compose anything?”View image in fullscreen‘New creative possibilities’ … screengrab from the Suno AI music generator.Photograph: SunoAware of the scale of the shift, last year the Recording Industry Association of America, representing the three major labels, initiatedlegal action against AI music companies Suno and Udiofor copyright infringement, alleging they had trained their AI platforms on the labels’ artists without their permission. But then there was an extraordinary about-turn. They didn’t just settle the matter out of court – Universal Music Group (UMG) then partnered with Udio, and Warner Music Group (WMG) with Udio and Suno. They also have deals in place with AI companyKlay, the first to get all three major labels on board, adding Sony Music (discussions with indie labels are ongoing). WMG chief executive Robert Kyncl has said these recent deals are to ensure the “protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters” and to fuel “new creative and commercial possibilities” for them, while UMG chief Lucien Grainge heralded “a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish and create incredible experiences for fans”.Kyncl made another bold statement as to why these deals are taking place: “Now, we are entering the next phase of innovation. The democratisation of music creation.”View image in fullscreenMonet maker  … AI artist Xania Monet. An AI-generated image from ‘her’ Instagram account.Photograph: xania_monetAnnouncing its Universal tie-in, Udio chief executive Andrew Sanchez has said Udio users will be able to “create [music] with an artist’s voice and style”: so not just create the aforementioned moody R&B song, but one with a specific existing artist’s voice. He also says Udio will allow users to “remix and reimagine your favourite songs with AI … take your favourite artists, songs or styles and combine them in novel ways. In our internal experimentation, the team has gotten some truly remarkable and unusual results that will definitely delight.”Klay meanwhile states that “fans can mould their musical journeys in new ways”, but it’s essentially the same offering: a subscription service where you can manipulate the music of others, or create your own from it. Ary Attie, Klay’s founder and chief executive, says his company will properly compensate artists whose work is used, and won’t supplant the work of human musicians: “This technology is not going to change any of that.”Klay is a rarity in that it signed up all three major labelsbeforeit started training its AI system on their music: “A core part of our philosophy,” Attie says. He argues that rival AI companies – he doesn’t name names – have been “acting in a way that doesn’t respect the work of artists, and then being forced into a corner”. Suno did not respond to an interview request; Udio claimed its executives were “extremely swamped” and therefore unable to answer questions. The current, and synchronised, messaging from labels and gen AI companies with licensing deals is that they all respect both art and artists and that their deals will reflect this.They are also positioning gen AI as the single biggest democratising leap ever in remix culture, effectively enabling everyone to become musically creative. The counterargument is that, by lowering all barriers to entry and by allowing the manipulation of a song or a musician’s character at scale, it vastly devalues and negates the creative act itself.But what do musicians actually think of the prospect of their work being used to train AI, and reworked by the general public? “Everybody should be selling or licensing their voice and their skills to these companies,” Dave Stewart of Eurythmicsargued to me this week. “Otherwise they’re just going to take it anyway.” That view is directly countered by the major labels and AI companies, who have insisted artists and songwriters get to opt in to have their music made available, and if they do, get royalties when their music is used to train AI, or manipulated by users on platforms such as Udio, Suno and Klay.Others take a grimmer view about howthese companies might reshape the industry. Irving Azoff, legendarily forthright artist manager and founder of the Music Artists Coalition in the US, responded to the Universal/Udio deal with biting cynicism. “We’ve seen this before – everyone talks about ‘partnership,’ but artists end up on the sidelines with scraps,”he said. In the wake of the same deal, the Council of Music Makers in the UKaccusedthe major labels of “spin” and called for a more robust set of artist-label agreements. And the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance says there is a disturbing “lack of transparency” around the deals (though more detail is likely to emerge on what users can do with any music they create, and any potential commercial uses of it).View image in fullscreen‘I’m yet to be convinced’ … Catherine Anne Davies performing as the Anchoress in 2024.Photograph: TeeGeePix/AlamyCatherine Anne Davies, who records as the Anchoress and also sits on the board of directors at theFeatured Artists Coalition(FAC), has many reservations here. “Most people don’t even want their work to be used for training AI,” she says. “I’m on the dystopian side, or maybe what I call the realist side of things. I’m interested in the way that AI can be assistive in the creative process – if it can make us more efficient, if it can streamline our processes. But generative AI for me, in terms of creative output, is a big no-no at the moment. I’m yet to be convinced.”Musician Imogen Heap feels that AI itself is not to be feared as a tool – she uses an AI she calls Mogen to listen to every aspect of her life, with a view to it being a creative partner (as exploredin a recent Guardian article). To help address some of the issues, she has created Auracles, an artist-led, non-profit platform she hopes will be the place where the rights and permissions around AI are set out. It’s not enough to say you’re happy with your music being used by AI, she says – instead, what’s needed are “permissions that grow and evolve over time”.Other companies are cropping up with similar offers. “We must protect the artists at all costs,” says Sean Power, chief executive of Musical AI, who aims to give musicians “an exact portion of the influence they’re having on all the generative outputs” – meaning compensation every time even a tiny bit of one of their songs is used by a user of Udio et al.Terms of these deals are undisclosed, but labels are likely to be seeking settlement for any past use of their artists’ copyrights as well as an advance on future use, plus an equity stake in the platform. And while artists will be able to opt out of including their work, they probably won’t be consulted on these partnerships going ahead, with this lack of consultation being something that artist representative bodies such as FAC have been particularly critical of. “The big artists, the labels need to be nice to; those who have a platform will be consulted to some degree,” says a music licensing expert, speaking anonymously. “The very few, who as individual artists are able to make a dent on share price, will have approval.”I approached Universal, Sony and Warner about the specific concerns raised by artists here: namely limited transparency around the deals, their commercial terms and how opt-ins work; if there is a risk of gen AI undermining existing revenue sources; and if there is significant artist refusal to assign their works for gen AI training. None of the companies would comment on the record about the specifics. Though in an internal Universal memo about AI deals, sent to all staff earlier this year and seen by the Guardian, Grainge said “we will NOT license any model that uses an artist’s voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist’s existing songs without their consent.”The Guardian understands that labels are currently having discussions with artists and their managers to better explain how these deals will work and why they believe they can bring in additional revenue, although they will need to convince artists that gen AI will not damage other sources of income, notably from streaming.But it isn’t clear whether consumers will actually pay to play around with music in the way Udio and others hope they will. AI is thesingle biggest hype category in Silicon Valleyright now, with an average of $2bn of venture capital investment going into AI companies every week in the first half of this year. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet (parent company of Google), recently warned of thecatastrophic domino effectacross the tech sector if this AI bubble bursts, a concern theBank of Englandalso recently raised.Reed Smith’s Gregor Pryor argues that AI music could, counterintuitively, end up being positive for human musicians. “By its nature, AI is derivative and cannot create new music,” he says. “Some investors in music catalogues that I speak to say it’s good for artists, because music ‘verified’ as created by humans will have greater value.”Artists will frame their work as having an invaluable human essence, their music speaking entirely from the heart, but it will become incrementally more difficult for the casual listener to distinguish between music created by a human and that created by AI. The Guardian understands that radio stations and DJs are currently extremely nervous about AI-powered music slipping through their quality filters, effectively hoodwinking them and hanging question marks over how their playlists work. The example of Papi Lamour might force them to do much greater due diligence on what they put forward for airplay consideration. Or they could be the first trickles of a flood that roars through radio and streaming services as the boundaries between AI and human-created music crumble.AI, bot farms and innocent indie victims: how music streaming became a hotbed of fraud and fakeryRead moreDavies is especially worried about artists not thinking through the long-term implications of licensing to AI services. “We cannot think of ourselves selfishly as entities that will be unaffected, because the entire ecosystem will experience a knock-on effect financially. What about your fellow composers and creators? But also what about the generations to come after? Are we fucking this completely, just to make sure that we can pay our mortgages now?”AI’s current level of sophistication means it is really producing composites of existing music, creating a Frankenstein’s monster of melodies. However, when AGI (artificial general intelligence) finally arrives, withAnthropic co-founder Dario Amodeisuggesting that could happen as soon as next year, we will be catapulted into an exhilarating and terrifying realm of uncertainty for the future and the purpose of human-created art.“It’s literally happening under our noses,” warns Davies. “We should be so much more concerned than we are.”Explore more on these topicsMusicArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The title of this startlingly original fiction is an ironic reference to Roughing It in the Bush; or, Forest Life in Canada, an 1852 memoir about “the civilisation of barbarous countries” by Susanna Moodie – Simpson’s eponymous “white lady” – a Briton who settled in the 1830s on the north shore of Lake Ontario, where Simpson’s ancestors resided and she now lives.That 19th-century settlers’ guidebook went on to be hailed as the origin of Canadian women’s writing; Margaret Atwood adopted the Suffolk-born frontierswoman’s voice in her 1970 poetry collection, The Journals of Susanna Moodie. Though she mentions Moodie’s book only in an afterword, Simpson’s perspective is different. For Moodie, extolling “our copper, silver and plumbago mines” in the extractivist British colony, the “red-skin” was a noble savage, and the “half-caste” a “lying, vicious rogue”. Yet, rather than a riposte to the toxic original, Noopiming – first published in Canada in 2020 and shortlisted for the Dublin Literary award in 2022 – sets about building a world on its own terms. The “cure”, then – the antidote to Moodie’s blinkered vision – is this book.To read Noopiming is to be immersed in a storytelling aesthetic that is both challenging and innately familiarFor a non-Ojibwe, to read it is to be immersed not only in an alternative worldview, but in a storytelling aesthetic that is both challenging and innately familiar, in which humans, other animals and plants coexist and communicate on an equal plane. Divided into 10 parts, and shifting from prose to poetry and back, the book is set in the city (Toronto), the reserve and the tenacious wild spaces in between. The narrator, Mashkawaji, who is frozen stiff in lake ice after an unspecified tragedy, is visited by seven characters, whom she identifies as parts of herself.Among them are Akiwenzii (the narrator’s will), an Elder man who fishes through a hole in the ice and lives in a cabin near the reserve dump; and Mindimooyenh (the narrator’s conscience), an Elder woman fired from her university job, who scours discounted food bins in grocery chains for “bargoons”. Alienated and deprived of wilderness, the young lovers Asin (“my eyes and ears”) and Lucy (“my brain”) suffer insomnia which can be relieved only by sleeping out in the bush. Asin, who works for a community radio station, takes ornithology courses and watches campfires on YouTube, while Lucy learns to hunt, lamenting that “no one on the reserve remembers how to tan hides with brains”.Sabe (“my marrow”), a recovering drinker “sober for over a year”, attends sweat-lodge purification ceremonies run by Akiwenzii. For Mindimooyenh, loquacious as an adult after being forbidden to talk in residential schools, ceremony is exercise rather than religion. Its repetitive, meditative nature brings distracted minds back to the present, since the brain is “constantly … rebuilding networked pathways”.Simpson quit her tenure track in academia more than 20 years ago to relearn her ancestral language and ways of thought from Elders. As part of her recentring of the world – and her refusal, like Toni Morrison, to pander to the “white gaze” – some words in the novel appear unitalicised and untranslated (an afterword steers readers towards the onlineOjibwe People’s Dictionary). Some characters have both human and non-human traits, the novel evoking a profound interdependence between people and the natural world. Ninaatig (“my lungs”) is both a maple tree that has their sap drawn in sugar-making ceremonies, and pushes a shopping cart. “Nervous system” Adik, whose caribou hooves are sore from asphalt, buys a voice recorder to capture the melody of hooves on ice. All are neutrally they/them, since, as Simpson has noted elsewhere, Nishnaabeg culture has more than two genders and sexual orientations: “I’ve normalised queerness because that’s how my ancestors did it.”Along with engaging dark humour, we get satirical swipes at “white people in canoes … going nowhere fast”, or “tree cops” who manage dwindling parkland by “charging a ransom to hike the trail”. The transmission of wisdom, or its interruption, is a key thread. Akiwenzii defies guards to carve new knowledge on the “Teaching Rocks” of Kinomagewapkong, noting that a sacred site must be renewed, not roped off as a tourist attraction. Akiwenzii fears that “maybe each generation is just a watered-down version of the last”. Yet for Adik, the sound of the gorge “carving out rock” is the “language of the past talking to the present … the sound of hope”.After funeral rites take place on the lake, a section of lyric poetry, Mashkawaji’s Theory of Ice, gives way to fabular philosophy drawn from nature. Asin’s human observation of migrating geese switches to the perspective of the birds. Geese in formation revel in the “synergy of moving though waves of air like a body much larger than the sum of its parts”, their flight also representing the human potential for community. But it is the stubbornly adaptive racoon that best symbolises the Ojibwe people’s defiant survival: “Sure, they had been dispossessed, displaced and their habitat gentrified … but they were not taking it. No way. They moved the fuck back in. Committed, built lodges, spoke their language, did their ceremonies and took care of each other.”Ultimately, it is this healing care and connection between the characters, human and non-human, in the teeth of ecological disaster, that offers a profound corrective to Moodie’s territorial worldview. Valiantly fighting an undertow of despair, they forge what, in the consciousness of the geese, are “flyways through the grief”.Noopiming: The Cure for White Ladies by Leanne Betasamosake Simpson is published by And Other Stories (£14.99).

A great populariser and advocate of the humanities in public life, he has done for Dante what his Bard colleague Daniel Mendelsohn did for Homer inAn Odysseyand other books.This short volume tells the story of the Hospital of the Innocents in Dante’s home town of Florence, a building Luzzi has been fascinated by since encountering it in 1987 on his college year abroad. The Innocenti, as it is known, was the first institution in Europe devoted solely to the care of unwanted children. The first foundling, named Agata because she was left by its gates on Saint Agata’s Day 1445, had been nibbled at by mice.At the time, children made up half the population of Florence, and many were abandoned. The church demanded “be fruitful and multiply” and condemned the use of contraception, which was primitive anyway. Babies were left inside church doorways, dumped in rivers and chucked on to rubbish tips. They were, in the lively Tuscan vernacular, thegittatelli– the thrown-away ones. Many were the result of unwanted sexual advances, especially on servants by their masters. In a fiercely patriarchal society, the majority of children deposited at the Innocenti were girls. The mothers would break a coin in two and hang one half round the baby’s neck in the hope of meeting them again.The Innocenti, like the city itself, mixed high-minded motives with utilitarian and cruel onesThe Innocenti was built by the Silk Weavers Guild in an era when the contribution that wealthy Florentines were expected to make to civic life was measured in counting-house ledgers like “a business’s gains and losses”. The building had arches designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, architect of the Duomo, and it housed (and still houses) works by the greatest artists of the Renaissance: Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, Piero di Cosimo, Andrea and Luca della Robbia. By caring for and educating its children, the Innocenti saved many of them from poverty, sex work or trafficking. And it lessened some of the stigma of illegitimacy, which in Renaissance Italy meant to be “born without honor, a status equivalent to a living death”. To suggest, as the book does in its subtitle, that the Innocenti “discovered” our modern idea of childhood feels a stretch. But it did contribute to the now accepted notion that the fate of every child matters, and inspired similar institutions across the world, including Thomas Coram’s Foundling Hospital, established in London in 1739.Luzzi mostly tells the story straight, without the blend of memoir and scholarship that characterises his previous books. He does make brief reference to where his interest in caregiving comes from: he became a father and widower on the same day, when his heavily pregnant wife was killed in a car crash, and his mother and sisters helped him raise his daughter. For more on that compelling story, I recommend his book In a Dark Wood.But this book mostly paints a wonderfully sensual and cinematic picture of early modern Florence in all its grubby, gorgeous detail. The Innocenti, like the city itself, mixed high-minded motives with utilitarian and cruel ones. It farmed out babies to wet nurses, who would use them as cash cows, almost starving them and sometimes even collecting payments after they had died. And it spent its donations on expensive art while feeding its charges on bread and water, the bread made not with flour but with the bran they also fed to the mules. The boys were taught a well-rounded curriculum of maths, Ciceronian rhetoric and music; the girls learned to weave and were pushed into a life of domestic service, even when the hospital’s directors knew that this opened them up to sexual exploitation.The Innocenti emerges as an absorbing case study in how the beautiful frescoes, arching columns and paintings of the Italian Renaissance masked “the sweat and suffering of forced labor, the raping of slaves, the abuse of children”. The words of the German critic Walter Benjamin might have been this book’s epigram: “There is no document of civilisation which is not at the same time a document of barbarism.”The Innocents of Florence: The Renaissance Discovery of Childhood by Joseph Luzzi is published by WW Norton (£23).

This is its 19th revival: the performance on 18 December will be its 295th at Covent Garden. Turandot tackles grand emotions and even grander themes: love, fear, devotion, power, loyalty, life and death in a fantastical, fairytale version of imperial China. And, of course, there’s surely opera’s most famous moment, the showstopper aria Nessun Dorma.“If the opera has depths, Șerban is content to ignore them, but for once it doesn’t seem to matter. The three-storey Chinese pagoda set, army of extras and troupe of masked dancers make his cartoon-coloured creation the nearest the company has to a West End spectacular,” wrote the Guardian’sErica Jeal reviewing a 2005revival.View image in fullscreenPuccini’s libretto states that the emperor appears among “clouds of incense … among the clouds like a god”. In this production he does indeed appear as if from the heavens, his magnificent throne lowered slowly to the ground.View image in fullscreen“Puccini wanted opera to be lyrical, and was sceptical of a lot about modernism, but with this he also looked forward – with many moments of dissonance and strange colouristic effects,” says the Royal Opera’s head of opera Oliver Mears, who thinks this epic production is the perfect introduction to the art form. “It’s a colourful, opulent spectacle that’s stood the test of time and after four decades, remains an outstanding showcase for great singers.”In this current revival, the role of Turandot is shared between Anna Netrebko, Maida Hundeling and Anna Pirozzi. Calaf, the unknown prince is sung by Yusif Eyvazov, Arsen Soghomonyan and Roberto Alagna, and Liù is shared between Masabane Cecila Rangwanasha and Juliana Grigoryan. Raúl Giménez is the Emperor.It’s a riotous virtuosic spectacle … visually stunning and theatrically accomplishedTom Service (2001)View image in fullscreenTurandot was Puccini’s 12th and final opera. “Its bones are bigger than in any of his other works: the chorus plays a larger role, the orchestra is larger, and Puccini is constantly reaching for an epic quality. In most of his other operas, it’s the intimacy, the small ensembles, that are most crucial. But here the set pieces with chorus are the main feature and it is these that make this opera so popular – the sheer spectacle of so many people on stage,” wrote Antonio Pappanoin an essay for the Guardianpublished in 2023.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Youth Opera Company, the Royal Opera’s in-house chorus of nine to 13-year-olds.

He’d written much of the third act, up to the death of Liù, but there were only sketches as to his thoughts on how the work should end. His student, Franco Alfano, wrote a completion that gave the tale a hasty and happy – if psychologically unconvincing – ending that reprised the famous Nessun Dorma aria. It is this ending (albeit a shortened version) that has been used in almost every production ever since the work’s premiere at La Scala, Milan, in 1926.View image in fullscreenAzerbaijani tenor Yusif Eyvazov has his hair and makeup done, and does vocal warmups in his dressing room.View image in fullscreenAndrei Șerban’s staging concerns itself less with the complex psychology of a work in which –as some have noted, the hero, Calaf, has a suicidal obsession with Turandot, while she is frigid, guarded and violent – and more with the spectacle.The action takes place amid shadowy watchers,  indifferent to the heartlessness that pervades the work up to its sudden happily-ever-after endMartin Kettle (2025)View image in fullscreenRussian soprano Anna Netrebko sings the role of Princess TurandotView image in fullscreenAnna Netrebko as Princess Turandot and Yusif Eyvazov as CalafAnd what of Nessun Dorma itself?

A 1972 recording of Luciano Pavarotti singing it was chosen to soundtrack the 1990 World Cup hosted by Italy and it became a pop culture hit of epic proportions. The Three Tenors album is still today the best-selling classical album ever – some 12m copies were sold.The aria is sung by the unnamed prince (Calaf), who has won the hand of the unwilling Turandot by solving three riddles. But he poses a riddle of his own: if she can find out his name before dawn then he will give up his life thus releasing her from the hateful marriage promise. The princess turns the city upside down and tortures those who she thinks can tell her the prince’s name, but she fails. No one shall sleep (“Nessundorma”) sings Prince Calaf, “I will conquer” (Vincerò-ooo), and he does.View image in fullscreenAzerbaijani tenor Yusif Eyvazov as Calas sings aria Nessum Dorma.The gloriously idiosyncratic Good Opera Guide written by the lateSir Denis Formansummarises Puccini’s opera as “the one where a prince avoids decapitation by winning a word game, and nobody sleeps” and its setting as “Peking, China in the middle ages also fairyland.”View image in fullscreenDancers waiting in the wings.View image in fullscreenThe fantasy version of Peking might be fairyland but that didn’t stop the People’s Republic of China banning it until 1998 because it was felt the opera portrayed China unfavourably.Turandot is unlike Puccini’s other operas.

Debussy and Ravel heard Javanese gamelans at the Paris Exposition of 1889 and incorporated the sounds into their music, Van Gogh and Degas discovered the woodcuts of Hokusai and Hiroshige, Gilbert and Sullivan wrote The Mikado to coincide with a Japanese exhibition in London in 1885, and in drawing rooms bedecked with Japanese prints, Chinese screens and bamboo wallpaper, western hostesses in silk kimonos presided over jasmine tea and games of mah-jongg.”View image in fullscreenAnna Netrebko as Princess Turandot, waits backstage for the curtain call.View image in fullscreenYusif Eyvazov (Calaf) embraces revival director Jack Furness after the show.“Puccini’s unfinished opera is itself an enigma that resists decoding,” says Jack Furness, who has directed the past four revivals of Șerban’s production. “In this staging … each musical gesture of the score is reflected onstage with overt theatricality, imagination and flair, drawing on a range of world-theatre traditions. In recent revivals we have emphasised the deep links of both the story and production to the Italiancommedia dell’arte. And Kate Flatt’s choreography, which ritualises the drama and controls the flow of time, never fails to take the breath away.”View image in fullscreenTurandot is at the Royal Opera House until 4 February.Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a Travelodge hotel room, a couple wake up after a one night stand. She’s in the shower; he’s devouring a bucket of KFC for breakfast. When she emerges, Glaswegian Mary (Karen Piriestar Lauren Lyle) licks her lips and takes pleasure from recounting their mind-blowing sex while Hoosier Mike (Skins’ Alexander Arnold) reserves his orgasmic delight for the drumsticks. Wasn’t last night amazing, she asks. “It was something else,” he replies – and half an hour later we find out what he means.Far from a casual encounter, this one-nighter is the result of separate missions. Mary has spent months sleeping with different men in order to get pregnant. Mike, whose apparent naivety grows increasingly suspect, reveals himself to have been dispatched for just that job. And it is very much a duty – he has planned the conception like a business trip.View image in fullscreenIntimacy and anonymity … Lauren Lyle and Alexander Arnold.Photograph: Danny KaanBeneath its strange comedy of miscomprehension and some fizzy repartee (mostly from Mary), Ireland considers, albeit far more fleetingly, similar issues of secular and religious faith, affirmation, self-belief and sheer goodwill to his more recent two-hander,The Fifth Step. The lightness of Lyle and Arnold’s rapport means that seriousness doesn’t always surface but they remain a compelling double act as they shift the sands. Each character has moments of touching tenderness, specifically around the gift of Mary’s pregnancy, amid gags riffing on each other’s very different worlds. Together they capture the awkward morning-after mix of intimacy and anonymity, heightened by Ceci Calf’s set, which has the right muted colours and stuffy air (curtains are opened to reveal the charming view of a brick wall).The humour is never as outlandish as Ireland’s black comediesUlster AmericanorCyprus Avenueand Max Elton’s production could perhaps benefit from borrowing more from the discombobulated, wired feeling of the fringe. In what could almost be a TV pilot, the script is delivered with the flourish of a tall tale but makes for an invigoratingly earnest consideration of the divine and the very human. Its origins lie in a series of “dream plays” envisioned by Edinburgh’s Traverse to let playwrights realise ideas that would be otherwise unimaginable. At 45 minutes, the result is funny and chewy but leaves you yearning for a bit more.AtSoho theatre, London, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreDavid IrelandSoho theatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

A deft balance is struck, with enough self-mocking silliness to endear herself and keep us entertained, but some arresting thinking too about Singh’s home country and its progress towards female liberation.That’s the subject under interrogation here, albeit refracted through the confusions and contradictions of a woman who grew up wishing to be a man. Few of the female role models on offer in India seemed terribly inspiring – and the one that did, a high-achieving distant relative, undercut her inspo standing with a very unsisterly warning against spinsterdom. No wonder our host swings wildly between pride in her independence well into middle age, anxiety that her descent into “crazy lady” status may soon be irreversible – and therapy sessions advising she reframe her sadness as a colourful personality trait.It’s engaging stuff, even for audiences like me, who could hardly be more of an outsider to the material. Singh also performs in Hindi, and her audience tonight includes many who could watch her in either tongue. I’m sure the material, suggestive as it is of a culture at a slightly different point on its gender-politics trajectory, is even more relatable to Hindi speakers, featuring as it does occasional asides and knowing gags about Bollywood star turned rightwing politician Kangana Ranaut.Singh has mixed feelings about her, just like her mixed feelings about everything else – except the inadequacies of the opposite sex, which can be taken for granted. We leave Singh being persuaded by a self-help podcast to connect with her “divine feminine” and reject the masculine rat race. It won’t go well: we know that by now. But in her heartfelt yet doomed attempts to square the vicious circles of freedom and femininity, singledom and self-improvement, there is plenty to amuse.AtSoho theatre, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsComedySoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Yes, Little Bulb’s Olivier-nominated festive show – first staged at Polka last year – features a magical nutcracker toy and young siblings transported to mysterious new worlds. But there’s also a pants-wearing Mouse King, a slab of flying poo, five crooning mice and a Yoda-inspired elder rodent. This is the Nutcracker how your youngest kids might dream it and it’s a wildly imaginative and warm-hearted creation.The action has been relocated to modern-day Wimbledon, where a grieving family face their firstChristmaswithout mum. They’ve moved into a new house – only it’s not very new at all. The sewers are clogged up, there are mouse droppings everywhere and, worst of all, siblings Clara (Lakeisha Lynch-Stevens) and Fritz (Dominic Conway) will be sharing a bedroom.Clare Beresford, Dominic Conway and Alexander Scott’s script – devised with help from the company – is peppered with endless inspired cheese gags (Fondu? How about fon-don’t?), and sly nods to the “big people” in the audience. There’s heaps of excellent physical comedy, a stream of very silly Christmas songs (“Last Christmas I gave you my cheeeeese”) and some expertly choreographed audience interaction. The cast manages a tricky balancing act, committing to the sorrow and shocks in the story but making the young audience feel safe, included and happy.View image in fullscreenCheesy cheer … The Nutcracker at St Martin’s theatre.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe script is consistently entertaining, although it does occasionally feel a little wordy in the first half. However, when the central quest kicks off – with Clara and Fritz hunting down the dastardly Mouse King – it’s utterly inspired. The story of the “Cheesy five” mice is told through a beautiful shadow puppet show, one of the endless lo-fi delights conjured up in Sam Wilde’s simple but evocative set. There are sword fights and magical shields, Pipes of Peril clogged up with monster poos and a Desert of Dust represented by a very sulky woman in a very dusty cloak. To watch this gleeful show is to feel young again, happily playing make-believe with your siblings.

It also returns him to the world of aliens, previously explored in films such as War of the Worlds, ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.“It’s like old-school Spielberg,” O’Connor recentlysaidin an interview. “I think people will be excited.”Earlier this year, Koepp called the film “a very emotional experience”.“I finished reading the script and I bawled,” Domingosaid. “I thought it was one of the most beautiful scripts about our humanity. I think it was just the most beautiful film about our humanity, and I literally cried because Steven Spielberg believes in the possibility of the human beings we could be.”The marketing campaign has coincided with the success of hit documentaryThe Age of Disclosurewhich alleged a government cover-up over the existence of alien life. It recently broke a record to become the most-rented documentary in its first 48 hours of release on Amazon Prime Video.Billboards have recently cropped up in Times Square for the movie and the trailer will play before the latest Avatar movie this month.Disclosure Day will be out in cinemas in the summer of 2026, a season that will also see the release of blockbusters including Toy Story 5, Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey, Minions 3, Supergirl, a live-action Moana and He-Man: Masters of the Universe.Explore more on these topicsSteven SpielbergEmily BluntColin FirthJosh O'ConnorScience fiction and fantasy filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

Christine Hazell is 88, has progressive memory loss, and had never made art until six months ago. She has since created more than 200 drawings, which have rapidly gone viral on Instagram, inspired a following, and will feature in four scheduled exhibitions. She is also Higgs’s mother.It’s the best example of outsider art I’ve seen in Yorkshire – made with real purity and no commercial motivationWhat began in May was an idea of Higgs’s sister Gaby, an architect based between London and York, where Hazell lives in a 17th-century terraced cottage. Discovering coloured pencils and drawing pads left behind by her now adult children, Gaby suggested her mum try to copy some family photos, to occupy her days. Hazell’s first drawings captured the faces of her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and family dog, Kizzy. Since then she has produced new drawings every day. “Mum can spend 10 minutes or two hours on each portrait,” Gaby says. Taken by Hazell’s absorption in this activity, she began sending them in phone messages to her brother.View image in fullscreen‘She says it’s her job to “spoil” perfection’ … Hazell’s portrait of her daughter, Gaby Higgs.Photograph: Christine HazellSince 2004, Yorkshire-born Higgs has lived with his wife, the American artistAnne Collier, in New York, where he is director and chief curator ofWhite Columns, the city’s oldest alternative art space. He was intrigued to discover that drawing had ignited something in his mother.“It struck me that these were significant drawings by an elderly person who had never drawn before. I’d be fascinated by anyone who began making art in their 80s,” he says of his decision toshare them on social media, as we sit at the kitchen table where Hazell creates her drawings. The fact that the artist is his mother – who no longer recognises her family members but is engrossed by the process of drawing their images – makes it all the more meaningful to him.Because of Hazell’s condition, what happens during that process is unknowable, but Higgs observes a certain progression. “She has quickly acquired a distinctive style and an independent view of the world by translating photos into drawings.” When making her portraits, she chooses what to leave out and what to amplify. “I made a video this week of mum drawing my nephews and niece when they were little,” says Higgs, “and she mentions how perfect they look in the photo. She says it’s her job to ‘spoil’ that perfection, which she does by disrupting it in her drawing. She also described her drawing of a cat that looked ‘like a nightmare’. It’s about giving her subjects a different face.”View image in fullscreen‘Never too late’ … Christine Hazell at work.Photograph: Gaby HiggsFor him, it vindicates the idea that we are all inherently creative: “Allow someone the time, encouragement and resources to be creative and it will most likely happen.”There has been a surge of interest among Higgs’ 65.3k Instagram followers, who react with wonder to his weekly posts of new drawings. Attracting praise from Tracey Emin (“Something so good going on here, and shows it’s never too late”), Pulitzer prize-winning art critic Jerry Saltz and Tate Britain’s director Alex Farquharson, the drawings have inspired collaborations with UK gallerists.Florencia Clifford and her partner Hugo Hildyard, who own and runPartisan, a York restaurant and exhibition space for emerging art, will show Hazell’s first selection, depicting 24 subjects from across Yorkshire, under the title Different Faces. “I was amazed when I saw those early posts,” Clifford says. “I knew immediately I’d like to exhibit the drawings if I could. Christine’s art is magical and moving – a freedom of expression without self-consciousness.”View image in fullscreen‘It only gets more interesting’ … a portrait of curator, publisher and gallerist Matthew Higgs, by his mother Christine Hazell.Photograph: Christine HazellNext July, London’sStudio Voltairewill show another group of drawings. “There’s such care and consideration in the line-making and the forms,” says its director Joe Scotland. “The fact that Christine has begun making art at 88 sits within our interests – creativity can come out at any age and we’ve been very influenced by White Columns in terms of broadening our platform of support.”Atthe Blacksmith’s Shop, East Yorkshire’s outsider art gallery, owner-curator Mark Ibson will include Hazell’s art in his August 2026 summer show. “It absolutely meets our criteria,” he says. “It’s the best example of outsider art I’ve seen in Yorkshire, made with real purity and no commercial motivation.” After that, Hazell’s drawings – whose latest subjects include musicians and actors – will cross the Atlantic to hang in White Columns.“It only gets more interesting,” Higgs says. “Mum is becoming more confident, more certain of the way she edits a photo into a drawing. It’s amazing that someone’s ability to visualise things can accelerate so quickly, when in other aspects of their life things are slowing down.”Christine Hazell: Different Faces will show atPartisan, York, from 17 December to 1 MarchExplore more on these topicsArt and designExhibitionsDrawingArtYorkshireAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We met at my then-cinema the Scala – it was a busy, noisy office but a sunny day, so we went up to the roof. Susie, who was already something of a legend having cast Stephen Frears’ Bloody Kids, Laura Mulvey’s avant garde films and Ben Kingsley in Gandhi, unleashed a volcanic eruption of unbridled enthusiasm for Angela Carter and Neil’s script. The collection of explosive expletives and voluble “darlings” almost blasted me to the King’s Cross streets below.View image in fullscreenMicha Bergese and Sarah Patterson in The Company of Wolves.Photograph: Itc/Sportsphoto/AllstarSo began a professional relationship that spanned more than 23 movies. The task we set her for The Company of Wolves was tricky: to find an actor to play the adolescent Rosaleen. She achieved it through painstaking and meticulous methods (her trademark) over the next few months, exceeding our expectations when she discovered the excellent Sarah Patterson. She then topped that with the suggestion of Angela Lansbury for “Grannie” (who flew from Hollywood to shoot with us and had her character’s head decapitated for her troubles) and a superlative supporting cast of dancers, performance artists and veteran actors for our strange, violent woodland fairytale. Her passion for cinema was infectious: not only for the film-makers, but also the agents and actors who read our scripts. Susie demanded an intelligent and thoughtful response to the screenplays so no simple yes or no would suffice.Her acting origins as a member of the 60s/70s avant garde experimental improvisational theatre collective The People Show (alongside her film director cousin Mike Figgis) might appear to be at odds with her consummate belief in professionalism, punctuality and absolute commitment to the director and ultimately the movie. Woe betide any actor that arrived late to a Susie Figgis casting audition!View image in fullscreenThe Full Monty.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarAfter The Company of Wolves she came up with a whole series of brilliant finds for Neil: Cathy Tyson in Mona Lisa, Jaye Davidson in The Crying Game and Eamonn Owens in The Butcher Boy. In parallel she continued her relationship with Richard Attenborough and Frears on numerous films through the 1980s, and was involved in casting Oscar and Bafta winning productions including Heat and Dust, The Killing Fields, The Mission, Local Hero, A World Apart, Scandal and Wish You Were Here. She was, and remained, at the forefront and cutting edge of new British cinema, mixing big budget Hollywood movies and BFI and Film4 productions with equal relish.Her molotov cocktail personality, a mixture of unashamed no-nonsense Brit and subversive leftwing radical, was a unique and unblinkingly honest blend, disarming for some but not always a comfortable combination for others. Most directors who worked with her knew they were in safe, if occasionally delightfully eccentric, hands. In the 1990s her talent was brought to bear on a multitude of films, standouts being Ken Loach’s Hidden Agenda, Jane Campion’s The Piano, Interview With the Vampire, Michael Collins, The Full Monty, The End of the Affair, Todd Haynes’ Velvet Goldmine and Tim Burton’s Sleepy Hollow.View image in fullscreenHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamySusie’s passion for cinema and commitment to her art often led to animated and vociferous discussions to say the least – but she kicked off the 2000s with the first Harry Potter film, The Philosopher’s Stone. Burton worked closely and amicably with her on all of his UK films including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd and Alice in Wonderland, and she continued to make crucial contributions to films as diverse as Colette and Bohemian Rhapsody.Susie gave 100% to her movies and her infectious love and ribald humour added propulsive energy to any film over and above her casting genius. Her presence and inspiration are irreplaceable in the current landscape of timid British cinema.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industrycommentShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Across North America, Mexican spirits have always been big – tequila even overtook whiskey asthe US’s second biggest spirit in 2023– but it’s taken the UK a little longer to catch on.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Now, though, premium Mexican spirits are on the rise, and we are surely in our agave era. Celebs are bringing out agave-based drinks by the crate-load (shout out to Rita Ora, Kendall Jenner and Nick Jonas), spicy margs have their own merch, and evenWaitrose reported an 86% increase in sales of tequila last year.This growing love of tequila has had a knock-on effect on the agave category as a whole, driving interest in mezcal, the lesser-known Mexican agave spirit. No longer the preserve of taquerias, it is now on the menu in lots of places, from luxury hotels to cool neighbourhood cocktail bars.What’s the difference between tequila and mezcal? Essentially, it’s all about the type of agave used. By law, tequila must be produced with at least 51% blue Weber agave and it can only be produced in five states, with Jalisco being the state at the heart of the tequila world.Mezcal refers to spirits made from other varieties of the agave plant, often using species such as espadín, tobalá and tepeztate. It can be made in nine states, though Oaxaca is the main region. Unlike tequila, agave for mezcal is roasted underground over hot volcanic stones before fermentation, hence the smoky flavour.Within the tequila and mezcal categories, there are a few main styles, too:Blanco/plata/silver: unaged or rested for up to two months, the spirit should taste crisp, clean and fresh with citrussy, tropical flavours. The liquid will be clear or very light.Reposado:aged for two months to one year, the spirit becomes softer, warmer and takes on woody flavours from the barrel. The liquid is usually golden.Anejo:aged for one to three years, the spirit is far sweeter, richer and more complex. The liquid is a deep caramel colour.There are other styles, such as extra anejo, but these are the main ones to look out for to navigate the labelling.Testing was not for the fainthearted: I tried each of the 40-ish tequilas and mezcals I sourced straight and unchilled, making notes on the aroma and taste for each until I had a shortlist of about 25. From there, I mixed up any specific serves recommended by the brand, or that I thought would particularly complement the spirit, and whittled down the list to a sensible number that I hope spans a range of styles and price points. As ever, I have tried to include several sustainable options and small, independent producers within this.Whether you’re an agave aficionado or are just getting acquainted with Mexican spirits, tequila and mezcal are valuable assets to your home bar. From sipping over ice to mixing up bloody marias or mezcalitas, having a great-tasting bottle to hand always helps get the party started.The best tequila and mezcal for 2025Best luxury tequila:Patrón El AltoView image in fullscreen£186 at the Whisky Exchange£146 at AmazonThis premium, aged tequila from agave heavyweight Patrón is the first of its kind. A blend of extra anejo, anejo and reposado tequila that has been aged for four years in 11 different barrels (American oak and French oak among them), it’s a thing of beauty. On first tasting, it’s hard to believe this is a tequila. It’s a bit like sipping a fine cognac:verysmooth, gently sweet and with notes of dried fig, it’s rich and complex, but somehow retains the lightness that makes great tequila so delicious. I love it and couldn’t possibly sully it by drinking it with anything else. It comes in a lovely, ornate bottle and box, ideal for giving as a gift should you be moved to.Best blanco tequila:Teremana blancoView image in fullscreen£39.95 at Master of Malt£39.99 at SelfridgesDwayne “the Rock” Johnson worked with a Mexican, family-owned distillery to create a home for his small-batch tequila, Teremana. Using mature, blue agave that’s responsibly sourced from the Jalisco highlands, Teremana Blanco is sweet, light, clean and fresh, as a young tequila should be. Notes of tropical fruit and a touch of spearmint mean this tequila is naturally easy-drinking, but it also makes a mean margarita.Best rosa tequila:Código 1530 rosaView image in fullscreen£46.95 at Master of Malt£46.95 at the Whisky ExchangeCódigo’s small-batch blanco tequila has been given a rose makeover with this 1530 rosa expression. Made using traditional methods and mature, lowland agave, the blanco spirit is rested for a month in uncharred French, Napa Valley cabernet wine barrels, imbuing the liquid with delicate red wine notes. Fruit-forward flavours of blackcurrant and cherries mingle with the salty, herbaceous agave, making it obvious this is not a straightforward tequila. Interesting on its own, it’s also good in a tangy paloma (two parts tequila, one part grapefruit juice, one part sparkling water, lime).Best smoky mezcal:Del Maguey Vida ClásicoView image in fullscreen£43.99 at Master of Malt£48.95 at the Whisky ExchangeDel Maguey’s ethos is to capture the essence of a place (such as a wine’s terroir), and its single village mezcals can be pricey. As such, this entry-level expression from the tropical, riverside village of San Luis del Rio in Oaxaca is a treat to try. Handcrafted using mature, maguey espadín fruit and ancient production processes, it has bags of tropical fruit flavours and notes of ginger and cinnamon that give it a lingering fiery finish. All mezcals are wonderful with fresh pineapple juice, but this one particularly so, with the juicy tartness complementing the smoke and spice of Vida Clásico beautifully.Best mezcal for a margarita:Rosaluna jovenView image in fullscreen£39.95 at the Whisky ExchangeThere’s a lot to like about this mezcal, even if you think you don’t like mezcal. For a start, it’s sustainably produced in Oaxaca by a brother and sister who grow, farm, ferment and distil their own spirit, using extra sweet, over-ripened agave, just as six generations have done before them. Sweet like caramel and punchy with pineapple notes, it has a lovely roasted quality, but none of the smokiness usually found in mezcal. Rosaluna won an award for the world’s best margarita at the US Beverage Testing Institute, and I can attest to this: it’s delicious. Be sure to try a dash in good hot chocolate for a Mexican taste sensation.Best mezcal gift set:The Lost Explorer trilogy packView image in fullscreen£99.95 at Hard to Find Whisky£96.95 at AmazonThis trio of mezcals from Oaxaca-based the Lost Explorer is an ideal first foray into the categoryanda great gift for signed-up members of the mezcal fanclub. If you need further convincing, this exact selection is available as a tasting flight atMestizo(a Mexican friend once said this was the only authentic Mexican restaurant in London).All three are award-winning artisanal mezcals, sustainably produced by maestro mezcalero Fortino Ramos, but otherwise they couldn’t be more different from each other. Using agaves grown for eight to 12 years (the longest I’ve seen), each mezcal has its own personality, demonstrating the importance of species and terroir. The espadín expression is sweet and herbal with lots of orchard fruit; tobalá is earthy, savoury and warm with leather, charred lime and background of smoke; finally, the salmiana is grassy with hints of succulents and zesty, green chilli – it’s like a picante cocktail in a bottle.Best mezcal for sipping:Zacal Manso Sahuayo y BrutoView image in fullscreen£119.50 at Zacal Mezcal£119.50 at Master of MaltUnlike the vast majority of mezcal, which hails from Oaxaca, new mezcal brand Zacal is based in Michoacán (known as the soul of Mexico), and it offers something a little different. Indeed, this small-batch, artisanal spirit (which gets its name from the blend of two organic semi-wild agaves from which it’s made) was recently awarded the highest accolade ofdouble goldat the International Spirits Challenge.The blend of two agaves gives a harmonious, balanced sip, while the use of a small chimney in the production process draws away excess smoke and leaves a more delicate character in the spirit. The mezcal is gently sweet and herbal, amazingly clean and has an almond-like, creamy finish; frankly, it tastes expensive. Sip it over ice and level up with a charred grapefruit garnish.Best anejo tequila:Herradura anejoView image in fullscreen£53.75 at Master of Malt£58.95 at the Whisky ExchangeThe Herradura distillery was founded in 1870 in Jalisco, and is now the last to remain on the historic Hacienda estate. Often credited with creating the reposado and extra anejo categories of tequila, Herradura has long been a pioneering brand, so the depth of this 25-month-aged anejo shouldn’t be a surprise. Tasted side-by-side against other tequilas in the same category and price range, this liquid is far richer and more complex. A warm caramel colour, with tons of oak flavour and a rum-like character of vanilla, toffee and wood smoke, Herradura anejo gives you a lot of bang for your buck.Best bargain tequila:Sierra reposadoView image in fullscreen£18 at Sainsbury’s£18.99 at the Bottle ClubThe only non-100% agave tequila on this list, Sierra tequila has won many awards as a mixto tequila – one that uses other sugar sources in addition to agave. Sierra uses Mexican sugar cane alongside its 51% agave, which goes some way to explaining its low price tag. But put any tequila snobbery out of your mind, and this reposado is a nice surprise. The kitsch mini sombrero had me bracing myself for a rough spirit; it’s not, and neither was the youngerblanco. Sierra reposado is aged in toasted oak barrels for nine months, giving it hints of woody pineapple, a silky smoothness and absolutely no raw alcohol burn. Result.Best tequila for cocktails:El Jimador blancoView image in fullscreen£19.96 at Asda£19.96 at AmazonThis is another bargain tequila, and a 100% agave tequila at that. El Jimador was created out of the Herradura distillery, with the aim of bringing out a high-quality, 100% agave tequila at an accessible price. Today, it’s one of the top tequilas in the UK, and it’s easy to see why: unaged, it’s crisp, clear, citrussy and versatile enough for any classic tequila-based cocktail. I enjoyed it in a strawberry spritz (El Jimador Blanco, strawberry puree, sugar syrup, lime and prosecco) during the summer. TheEl Jimador anejoshaken up with Kahlua, espresso and sugar syrup also makes a searingly good “Mexpresso martini”.Best classic mezcal:Del Suelo espadínView image in fullscreen£45 at Ocado£50.27 at AmazonThis mezcal is a definitive example of the category. Made in the remote Oaxaca mountains in the village of San Luis del Rio (where the Del Maguey Vida Clásico hails from) using sustainable practices, it has everything you could want from a top-notch mezcal. Del Suelo’s mezcalero has been making mezcal here since childhood, and he’s nailed it. It’s fresh yet (very!) smoky, saline and savoury, thanks to those volcanic soils and smoking stones. I found it reminiscent of an Islay whisky. Use it to make classic cocktails with a mezcal twist, and it won’t disappoint.Best tequila for parties:818 tequila blancoView image in fullscreen£42.99 at Master of Malt£42.99 at Drink SupermarketWhen the tequila shots come out, I hope it’s this award-winning 100% agave tequila owned by Kendall Jenner in the glass. Using mature, blue agave grown on family-owned farms in Jalisco, the distillery slow cooks the fruit and uses traditional stone pits to extract the juice before fermenting and distilling in copper pot stills. The result is an extremely light-bodied, young and sweet tequila, with herby citrus and lots of dessert-adjacent flavours: think marzipan, key lime pie and tropical fruit.Best unsmoky mezcal:Los Siete Misterios Doba-YejView image in fullscreen£49.95 at Master of Malt£53.50 at the Whisky ExchangeAs with the Rosaluna, this artisanal mezcal from Los Siete Misterios is much lower in smoke than you expect from the spirit, with lots of citrus and fruit at the fore instead. Made in Oaxaca (including in the world capital of Mezcal, Santiago Matatlán), espadín agave are cooked underground before being crushed in a horse-drawn tahona, fermented then twice distilled in copper-pot stills. Neat, it has notes of dried and fresh coconut and a summery profile with just the faintest wisp of pineapple smoke. A real all-rounder, it’s as satisfying sipped as it is in tropical cocktails – I love it as a spicy marg.For more cocktail cabinet inspiration from the Filter:The best gins for G&Ts, martinis and negronisThe best whisky: 13 tried-and-tested tipplesThe best vodkas, testedJoanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

After all, few have “the time or attention for a board that needs a lot of explaining”. The trick is to find a balance between styles. “The perfect five would be a hard, a soft, a blue, a sheep and a goat’s,” says Carver, who factors in 50-60g of each cheese per person. “The general consensus is 30-40g, but at Christmas you need more than you can fathomably eat.”As to what those cheeses are, Percival would champion classic regional cheeses that “have languished on the margins for too long”. First up,Stonebeck Wensleydale: “It’s incredibly creamy with a flavour that unfolds long after you’ve eaten it,” she says. “It will make you rethink everything you thought you knew about Wensleydale.” Next up,Appleby’s cheshire, which, Percival notes, is “succulent and mineral, with a gentle crumble and citrus brightness. A big wedge with salted cultured butter and crackers is the perfect cheese course.” Just add a glass of port or kombucha.Mrs Kirkham’s lancashire, meanwhile, would be a dream on Christmas Eve with gingerbread or gingersnaps, Percival adds. Carter, however, is very partial to a sheep’s cheese: “There’s not an awful lot of sheep’s milk cheese made in the UK,” he says, “butWakebridge[made in Derby] is similar to a lancashire or cheddar, and it’s got a nice sweetness to it.”But don’t stop there: you then need to accessorise, Percival says. That might be a plum and red onion chutney, a drizzle of good honey, or some spiced poached quinces, plus those all-important crackers (her go-tos are sourdough and oatcakes). Carter, on the other hand, prefers “something that’s a bit out of the box”. Think a not-too-strong goat’s cheese with rose Turkish delight, say, kimchi with stilton or garlic with brie. “Roast some garlic, then mix it with a bit of honey to make a paste. That, or a simple parsnip puree, would be really nice with a soft, bloomy rind cheese.”While it’s arguably always the right time for cheese, Percival often goes early. “In the US, where I’m from, cheese often appears before the meal. It’s something to nibble with a glass of something fizzy, and its job is to whet the appetite, not finish the meal.” Even so, Carter is firmly in the post-dessert cheeseboard camp: “I like to finishChristmasdinner at about 4pm, eat chocolate for a few hours, then have cheese and port around 6pm. And then that’s Christmas Day done.”Got a culinary dilemma?

How does this change families, for good and bad?Gaby HinsliffTue 16 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShareIf life had worked out differently, Serena would by now be coming to terms with an empty nest. Having brought up seven children, she and her husband might even have been enjoying a little more money and time for themselves. But as it is, three of their adult children are now at home: the 23-year-old finishing his degree; the 28-year-old, a teacher, saving for a house deposit; and the 34-year-old, after a mental health crisis. At 63, Serena comes home from her job as a social worker to a mountain of laundry, and a spare downstairs room requisitioned as a bedroom.Having a houseful is “really good fun”, she says, and makes life richer and more interesting. But it took a while to get used to partners staying over – “I’m not a prude, but you don’t necessarily want to be part of that life for your children, do you?” – and lately, she has felt the lack of an important rite of passage. “I’ve become old and I never really felt it, because I’ve been in that parent mode for such a long time,” she says. “It’s suddenly hit me that I didn’t have that transition that often happens, with kids who leave when you’re in your 40s and 50s – that just hasn’t happened. It’s odd.”And she isn’t alone. Robert and his wife were planning to go travelling next year, once they had retired, to “try to remember who we each are” in this new child-free phase of life. But their eldest is now back home having left university this summer without a job in atough year for graduate recruitment, and his parents are reluctant to leave him ploughing through demoralising job interviews alone. It’s hard, says Robert, to know where responsibility for an adult child begins and ends. “If he was 18 I’d be much more involved, but I’m trying not to be – I’m trying to be interested in what he does, but to draw that line. He doesn’t like being told what to do.”View image in fullscreenBoundaries between gen Z and their often remarkably accommodating gen X parents seem to be blurring.Photograph: Posed by models; SolStock/Getty ImagesChildren flying the nest once felt like a full stop, the moment family life changed for good. But increasingly it’s the beginning of a new and fluid stage, of adult fledglings coming and going, potentially for years.According to an analysisby the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex, 15%of 21- to 35-year-olds boomeranged back at least once after leaving home between 2009 and 2020, often after a relationship breakup or job crisis.For many families, keeping the door open is the natural response to punishingly high rents, rising youth unemploymentand a sense that gen Z simply can’t afford the lives their parents had at the same age.But supporting children for longer, and sometimes putting retirement or downsizing plans on hold to do it, has consequences.Onestudy of middle-aged parentsacross 17 European countries, led by researchers at the London School of Economics, found that those whose empty nests unexpectedly filled back up experienced a decline in their quality of life comparable to having an age-related disability. Resuming family responsibilities after tasting freedom may have felt, the researchers concluded, like “a violation” of this life stage.Resuming family responsibilities after tasting freedom may have felt, researchers concluded, like ‘a violation’Yet, for their kids, being back at home is increasingly the norm. And while for some that’s a source of frustration or even shame, the stigma may be fading now that 43% of 25-year-olds in the UKlive with their parents, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. TikTok isawash with jokesabout raiding the parental fridge and gatecrashing their fancy holidays. Boundaries between gen Z and their often remarkably accommodating gen X parents, meanwhile, seem to be blurring, as more families embrace multigenerational living.“The empty nest phase was agony. I found it one of the hardest things ever,” says Barbara, a widowed mother of 23-year-old twins who have just graduated and are both back with her in London, job-hunting. Though at first she felt sad for the boys being unable to fly the nest, lately she has begun wondering whether flat-sharing is really the essential life stage it once seemed. “Just because we were able to go out and rent and then buy a property [at that age] doesn’t mean that’s something they have to do. I say to them: ‘There’s lots of things you have that we didn’t.’ The world is different. It helps that all their mates are in the same position.” She has enjoyed meeting her sons’ friends, introducing them to hers, and getting to know them as grown men. “It’s not even childhood going on longer; it’s a differenttypeof adulthood.”Is “full nesting” really only about hard economic times? Or is it sometimes meeting a deeper need for togetherness?In his final year at university, Julia’s eldest son is one of the lucky few in his cohort to land a job offer. But when he starts work, he won’t be moving into a flatshare like she did: instead, he is moving back home to live with his parents and two younger siblings, to save money.“My parents when I graduated were like, ‘Off you go’ – there was never any question of moving home,” his mother says. “But rents were so much cheaper then. You could just look in Loot, get a room in a shared house.” Julia could even afford to enjoy London life on her earnings from working in a bookshop, but that world is gone. “Drinking is so expensive now. Going on a date is expensive … I’d love him to go into a house with his friends, and I think that’s really what he wants to do. But it’s just so expensive.” She has friends, she says, who are still subsidising the rent or holidays of children who are well into their 20s and have left home.View image in fullscreen‘You know how we had lockdown, and everyone was around each other all the time? Well, we’re used to it.’Photograph: Posed by models; Maskot/Getty ImagesJulia plans to charge her son rent – in return for two meals a day, all laundry and the services of the family cleaner – but to bank the money as a deposit for him later. “You do what you can for them. I wouldn’t want to be 21 again now.”She enjoys her son’s company, but the arrangement is not what she imagined for this stage of her life. Her husband had dreamed of buying a boat. She had promised herself that she would quit her PR job and retrain in something creative when the children left. But if the younger two follow their elder brother’s path, she will be in her 60s by the time they all leave, though she suspects her daughter will make different choices. “It’s a very attractive life, with central heating, your mum doing your laundry, getting your dad to give you a lift to the pub occasionally. But I think girls are a bit more independent.” The figures bear her out: 61% of 18- to 24-year-olds living at home are men.Kate’s 19-year-old son is in his first year of university in Birmingham, living at home and commuting in. His 17-year-old brother has similar plans. Both boys were fearful of racking up huge debts with no guarantee of a job afterwards, she says, and keen to avoid taking maintenance loans. But that’s not the only advantage. “They’re coming home, having a shepherd’s pie, getting clean clothes – they’re not in freezing halls eating Pot Noodles.” In turn, she enjoys having them around a little longer. “I’ve been going to the gym with my eldest sometimes and it’s really lovely to go and do things like that together.” Kate has already told them that when they do leave, they’re welcome to move back later to save for a house deposit – the only way she can imagine them ever being able to buy.They’re coming home, having a shepherd’s pie, getting clean clothes – they’re not in freezing halls eating Pot NoodlesKate does worry that they’re not learning the life skills acquired by living independently. “I started off saying, ‘Right, come and learn how to do a stir-fry,’ but the truth is I still do absolutely everything. It’s just easier. If you’re putting a white wash on and it’s just half a load, you’re going to go round all the washing baskets to see if you can fill it, aren’t you?” But for her older son in particular, who suffered from anxiety towards the end of school, she thinks it was comforting to know that he wouldn’t have to leave home at 18 as she did.Kate isn’t the only parent I speak to who mentions either mental health issues or a lack of emotional readiness to leave home, nor the only one who instinctively connects it to growing up during a pandemic.“You know how we had lockdown and everyone was around each other all the time? Well, we’re used to it. We’re used to being a unit in some ways; we really learned how to tolerate each other in quite intense circumstances,” says Kate. It makes living together feel more natural, she thinks – though, as was the case in lockdown, she worries about young people whose families can’t or won’t take them back in. “You’re trapped then, aren’t you? And you have fewer chances in life.”For home, it turns out, is an important safety net. The ISER team at the University of Essex found that far from being depressed about moving back into their old teenage bedrooms, on average boomerang kids’ mental health scores improved after they returned home, suggesting that they found it a relief. “A lot of young people who are living independently are often in rather poor housing, with a lot of stress, living in unstable private rented housing,” notes Prof Emily Grundy, the study’s co-author. Going home may feel like going backwards, but it often beats whatever sent you there.Fiona was 37 when she moved back home with her baby son, after her partner’s death from a sudden illness. Still reeling from the loss, she had spotted a little house in the village where she grew up, hundreds of miles from her then home in London: the plan was to live with her parents for a year while it was renovated. In the end, she stayed nearly eight years.At first, she was embarrassed to admit she had moved back to the house she left at the age of 17. “You do feel that you’re not a proper adult.”Yet living together as adults has transformed her relationship with her parents in unexpected ways. “Moving back in was such an eye opener, seeing your parents as adults from an adult perspective,” she says. “I realised so many things about my relationship with them, and how I am as a person.”Fiona has had issues around food and her weight, and coming home made her realise that her mother did, too. But with that understanding came a deeper bond. “I know them so much better now, and now that I’ve moved out again and I’ve got a bit more distance I have more empathy for them.” Her new house is only minutes away, so her parents still help with childcare. As they get older, she anticipates spending more time looking after them. “Before, I saw the idea of them getting older and needing help as being a burden. And now I view it completely differently – because of everything that’s happened, I’m closer to them.”What are the ground rules for successful “full nesting”? At 77, Rob is a veteran: his daughter Jess moved back temporarily once after university, again when changing jobs, and is back again (this time with her five-year-old daughter, Evie) after separating from her husband, while her family home is being sold.Gen Z know the social contract is broken. It’ll take more than youth clubs and StarmerTok to reach them | Gaby HinsliffRead moreOver the phone from what was once their spare bedroom-cum-office, but is now, he sighs, “absolutely full of clutter”, Rob says he and his wife have found having their granddaughter around an immeasurable joy. But he recommends setting rules for who does what household chores, to stop everyone falling unthinkingly back into childhood roles, and charging rent. “I think every parent who has got adult children who moved home will recognise that all of a sudden the adults become children again. You do make assumptions about ‘whoever normally does the cooking will just carry on and cook extra for me’.” They have also learned to meet halfway over the state of the house: “If my daughter was here she’d say I was over-tidy, and I would say she was untidy. You have to be prepared to compromise.”But while they have always got on well, he says, there are also perhaps deeper reasons for their closeness as a family. Jess was born a twin, and her sister died during the pandemic. “It brought us together against the world, really,” says Rob, quietly. “There was no way we weren’t going to do this.”Financial planner Jane Gow, meanwhile, advises that parents shouldn’t jeopardise their own security in retirement when trying to help their children out.“I say: ‘You need to put your own oxygen mask on first,’” says Gow, whose own four adult children have all boomeranged back at various points. Once children leave, she argues, parents are perfectly entitled to downsize, or to rent their old bedrooms out if they need the money; to stop paying for their phones and car insurance, and to ask for rent if they do return. “This is when, really, the big pension contributions should be coming in, in the last few years while we still can.”For parents of younger children, she recommends encouraging independence early by getting them to do their fair share of chores and to save small amounts of pocket money. If they’re at university: “It’s sitting down and budgeting with them, or when they get used to paying bills.”And if it’s too late for all that? Maybe don’t make any plans to redecorate.“If I went home in the 90s to my parents, they would have said: ‘But we’ve turned your bedroom into something else,’” says Kate, resignedly. “You’re not thinking that now, are you?”Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsFamilyParents and parentingHomesUK cost of living crisisStudentsConsumer affairsYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here are a select few of the country’s countless regional specialitiesLiz BoulterTue 16 Dec 2025 02.01 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 05.16 ESTShareLast week’s announcement that Italian cuisine has been added toUnesco’s intangible cultural heritage listcame as no surprise to anyone familiar with that country’s obsession with food. Unesco called Italy’s cooking a “communal activity” in which “people of all ages and genders participate, exchanging recipes, suggestions and stories”.It might have added people of all walks of life, too, because in Italy being a foodie is not the “preserve” of the chattering classes. I’ve heard building workers in a low-cost trattoria gravely discussing what starter and wine best complement a certain lunch dish, and a shabbily dressednonnaat Turin’s Porta Palazzo market enthusing over a variety of carrot available only at her favourite stall.And in this land where the salami will change from one valley to the next, many people take an endearing pride in foods from their region, village, even family. So, in no particular order, here is a selection of local delights from the Alps to Sicily.Star baker, VeronaPanettone is now a British fixture alongside mince pies, but in fair Verona, the Christmas confection ispandoro, a soft, leavened cake made in a star-shaped tin, without the dried fruit that many dislike. It usually has a dusting of icing sugar to resemble the nearby alpine peaks.Pandoro, however, is a factory version of the older, roundoffella– made with sourdough matured for days, it has a denser crumb and comes topped with almonds. Try it atAntica Offelleria Verona, which uses a “mother” that is more than a century old.Prosperity pulses, UmbriaView image in fullscreenThe patchwork fields of Castelluccio di Norcia, where flowering lentils are grown.Photograph: Andrea Federici/AlamyChristmas foods vary around Italy, but on New Year’s Eve lentils are a must. With their round, flat shape, they’re supposed to resemble coins and mean a wealthy year. The best lentils in Italy (some say the world) are the small, tender and quick-cooking ones from the high Castelluccio plain in southern Umbria, near Italy’s pork capital, Norcia. Castelluccio village and Norcia are still strugglingafter the 2016 earthquake, and make tourists very welcome. Conjure prosperity with a sausage and lentil dinner atGranaro del Monte, close to Norcia’s basilica, which finally reopened just over a month ago.Dairy delight, PugliaView image in fullscreenFresh burrata cheese heads.Photograph: Vladimir Gerasimov/AlamyFor years it has been rare to open a menu anywhere and not find a starter involving burrata. But while this soft cheese feels luxurious, it originated in hard, thrifty lives near the ancient city of Andria in Puglia. Snowed in and unable to get their milk to market in the early 1900s, the Bianchino brothers were apparently casting around for a way to use it up. They mixed cream with scraps left from making mozzarella and stuffed them in a casing made of the same stretched-curd cheese – never imagining the wobbly pouches would later grace tables from Stockholm to Sydney. Today, Andria is known for the freshest burrata and cow’s milk mozzarella, and many Puglians, such as my friend Savio, won’t eat these cheeses anywhere else in Italy, as they’re best enjoyed within 24 hours. Buy atCaseificio Olanda, with its “milk museum”, on the outskirts of Andria.Bread of heaven, SardiniaView image in fullscreenCrispy pane carasau topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and poached egg.Photograph: Ivan Canavera/AlamyLooking like an oversized poppadum,pane carasauis a crispy flatbread also calledcarta musica(manuscript paper). Double cooked so that it keeps, it was carried by shepherds spending months in high summer pastures and is one of Europe’s oldest breads: traces were found in 3,000-year-oldnuraghe(stone tower) excavations.

But Calabria has made thecipolla rossaits own, claiming you can eat them raw like an apple. Their sweetness comes not from a high sugar content but a natural lack of pungent pyruvic acid. Fresh onions are available from May through summer at the Saturday market in Tropea.

So it was withmissoltini, a freshwater answer to anchovies produced on the shores of Lake Como.Agoni, a kind of shad, are cleaned, salted, hung to dry for 10 days then packed in a barrel with bay leaves. They are traditionally eaten grilled with polenta, which modern palates may find rather strong and salty. I love them as an umami nugget in pasta or risotto recipes, or topping crisp crostini with honey and vinegar.

Even more delightful is the knowledge that it can be made weeks ahead of time, and whisked out of the freezer and brought to the table as needed. There’s allo a wibbly-wobbly jelly with a soft melt-in-your-mouth set, rather than the more solid, gelatinous variety I so strongly associate with childhood tea parties. Plus, it has sparkling booze in it, which, of course, makes the whole thing feel very grown-up.Salted caramel zuccottoI have a soft spot for salted caramel ice-cream, but you can fill the marsala-drenched panettone shell with whatever flavour ice-cream you like; if you wanted to be extra-fancy, you could even layer different flavours on top of each other, so that, when you slice into the zuccotto, you see stripes of colour down the middle.Prep40 minFreeze1 hr 45 minServes12-142 litres salted caramel ice-cream500g whole panettone120mlmarsala260g dark chocolate, finely chopped150g salted butter150g white chocolate, finely chopped80ml double creamRedcurrants, for decorationTake the ice-cream out of the freezer, open the lid and leave to soften slightly. Line a three-litre bowl with cling-film.Cut the panettone into roughly 2cm-thick slices and press them into the lined bowl so the entire surface is lined with cake; save some for the top. Drizzle most of the marsala over the panettone, again saving a little for the top. Spoon the softened ice-cream into the panettone-lined bowl, then cover the top with the last few slices of panettone, so the ice-cream is sealed inside. Drizzle over the last of the marsala, then cover the whole bowl with cling-film and put in the freezer for an hour, or longer.Melt the dark chocolate and butter in a saucepan on a very low heat, stirring all the while to make sure the chocolate doesn’t burn or catch, then take off the heat.Unwrap the frozen bowl and turn out the frozen panettone and ice-cream cake on to a serving dish, ideally with a lip. Peel off the cling-film, then pour on the hot chocolate so it covers the entire surface of the cake. Return to the freezer for 30–45 minutes, or longer, so the chocolate can harden.Warm the white chocolate and cream in a small saucepan over a low heat, until the chocolate melts, then pour this over the chocolate-covered cake. Decorate with a few redcurrants and return to the freezer until you’re ready to serve.Pomegranate Campari jellyView image in fullscreenSkye McAlpine’s pomegranate Campari jelly.The joy of jelly is that you can (indeed, you must) make it in advance, which in part at least is what makes it such an ideal dinner party dessert. It’s also low-effort, easy to make and both gluten- and dairy-free, so it’s a good option when navigating dietary restrictions.Prep5 minCook15 minSetOvernightServes8-1016g gelatine leaves(about 10 leaves)175ml Campari175ml pomegranate juice400ml prosecco300g caster sugarHandful of pomegranate seeds, to servePut a 1½-litre jelly mould on a small tray, so it’s easy to carry to the fridge once filled; I often use bits of scrunched-up foil to stabilise it on the tray.Put the gelatine in a small bowl, cover with cold water and leave to soak for five minutes. Pour the Campari, pomegranate juice and prosecco into a saucepan. Add 250ml water and the sugar, give it a good stir to help dissolve, then put on a medium heat. Do not stir once the pan is on the heat, because that will kill the bubbles in the prosecco (you want as many of those in the jelly as you can get). Bring to a boil for about a minute, or just under, until the sugar is completely dissolved, then take off the heat.Ladle roughly 250ml of the ruby-red liquid into a measuring jug and add the softened gelatine, giving the leaves a good squeeze first in your hands to remove excess water. Whisk until the gelatine dissolves completely, then pour the remaining liquid from the saucepan into the jug. Carefully pour into the jelly mould, carry to the fridge and leave to set overnight for a gentle, wibbly-wobbly texture. It will now keep happily in the fridge for two to three days.To serve, carefully plunge the mould into a dish of hot (not boiling) water, making sure it doesn’t splash into the jelly. Hold it there for three to five seconds, until you can see the edges begin to separate from the sides of themould, then immediately lift out the mould and put a serving dish on top, taking care to centre the mould on the dish. Using both hands to hold the two together, flip over: the jelly should slip out easily. Sprinkle over the pomegranate seeds to serve.These recipes are edited extracts from The Christmas Companion: Recipes, Crafts and Inspiration for a Magical Festive Season, by Skye McAlpine, published by Bloomsbury at £28.

None of the text or email notifications of cancellations mention this. Consequently, I have ended up inadvertently paying for five cancelled lessons.I have raised this multiple times with the company but in vain.It feelsas if they are profiting from parents’ unawareness.SW,address unknownTravelodge guest suffers sleepless night as hotel says it is ‘overbooked’Read moreOther parents have taken to online platforms includingTrustpilotto deplore the opaque process and poor communications.Customers have to plough through six pages of terms and conditions to find the refund clause. Even then they might not get their money back – another clause warns that refunds will only be given in “certain circumstances” if lessons are cancelled by the provider. The FAQs on the website also mention the refund process, but that’s not good enough.According to the consumer lawyer Gary Rycroft, failure to include the process on notifications of cancellations is likely to be an unfair practice under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008.“Customers are automatically entitled to a price reduction or refund as per the Consumer Rights Act and a company cannot make that refund conditional on finding or following a hidden process,” he said.I put this to Swim! It was unabashed. “We do not restrict statutory rights, and any customer who believes they are entitled to a refund can request one easily,” it said, ignoring my question about why the refund process is not highlighted in cancellation notifications.Instead, it gave a woolly pledge: “We appreciate feedback from customers and consumer advocates and are committed to continuously improving our communication and customer service on this matter.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Everything is so bleak at the moment, only the sight of a tiny baby animal can save us now.How tiny are we talking?Oh, unbelievably tiny. There are pictures of a two-week-old Panya standing next to a lettuce. Guess what? They’re the same size!View image in fullscreenPanya at nearly two weeks old, with his mother and a lettuce, on 8 December 2025.Photograph: Friedemann Vogel/EPAThis is too cute. I can’t handle it.Nor can anyone. Panya, born at a zoo in the German city of Duisburg at the end of last month, has already become a sensation online. He has driven Reddit into a frenzy, with one commenter frothing: “Look at that little bean!! Welcome to the fun, little one! We shall post about you with reckless abandon.” It’s just like Moo Deng all over again.Sorry, who?Moo Deng? Thepygmy hippo who went viralafter she was born last year in Si Racha, Thailand. Surely you remember that.Is she smaller and cuter than Panya?Well, given she is more than a year older than Panya, she probably isn’t smaller, no.View image in fullscreenMoo Deng at two months old, on 15 September 2024.Photograph: Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty ImagesUgh, yuck, not interested.What? Why? Surely Moo Deng hasn’t lost all her appeal purely because you have been distracted by another baby animal?Get that ancienthas-beenout of my sight.But surely the world is big enough to contain two miniature hippopotamuses at the same time. Especially given that the WorldWildlifeFund reckons there are only about 2,500 pygmy hippos out in the wild as it is.Listen, it isn’t my fault that pygmy hippos quicklygrow out of their cuteness.Where can I see Panya, the tiny king of my heart?Right now, nowhere. He is still so young and small that he is being kept in a private enclosure with his mother. Eventually, Duisburg zoo will put him on public display.My heart will explode when I see him.Careful, now.

And remember that a leading zoologist claimed that life in the public eye had turned him into “a psychopath, addicted to human attention”?Jesus.Sorry, too bleak. I’ll keep it light.Essentially you’re saying we shouldn’t get tooexcited about Panya, nor put any undue pressure on him?No, be excited by all means, but just retain a sense of perspective.

The internet is full of DIY advice, and one of the most popular tips is to mix washing-up liquid with water and use it as a pest spray. It’s cheap, easy and always within reach. But it’s not without risk.The hackA diluted detergent solution is said to break down the waxy coating of soft-bodied pests, dehydrating them on contact. It can work wonders on aphids, spider mites and thrips, killing them quickly without the need for harsh chemicals. But household detergents weren’t made for plants. The wrong formula or a heavy hand can cause serious leaf burn, leaving behind residue that stresses your plant more than the pests did.ThemethodMix half a teaspoon of mild, fragrance-free washing-up liquid into 1.5 litres of water. Shake gently, then test on one or two leaves first. Leave for 24 hours to check for damage. If the plant tolerates it, lightly mist affected areas, but never drench the whole plant. Rinse thoroughly with clean water after 10–15 minutes. Always spray on a dull day or in the evening ; combined with strong sunlight, soap can scorch leaves.Houseplant hacks: do humidifiers really help houseplants?Read moreThe testThe solution didn’t shift mealybugs on my jade plant, but worked brilliantly on a nearby coleus plagued by aphids; they were gone within days, with no damage.The verdictWashing-up liquid works as a gentle deterrent for soft-bodied pests but won’t conquer tough infestations like mealybugs. Use sparingly, test first and always apply when sunlight is low to avoid scorch marks.Explore more on these topicsHouseplantsHouseplant hacksGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Few were prepared for the chaos that would be unleashed in January. The volume and speed of executive orders coming out of the White House were seen as a deliberate tactic to overwhelm and create panic. In many ways it worked – there was confusion, anger and exhaustion as organisations scrambled to fill the gap left by theUSAIDfreeze. But that was just the beginning.The US administration has been the key driver, supported by intense advocacy work by ultra-conservative groups using the moment to strengthen global ties with political allies.Q&AWhat is the anti-rights movement?ShowThe anti-rights movement – also known as the anti-gender movement – refers to a global network of political leaders, religious institutions, civil society groups as well as billionaire families and individuals that seek to undermine progress across a wide spectrum of issues. These include  abortion, LGBTQ rights, trans rights, non-traditional family structures and comprehensive sexuality education.They do this by lobbying governments, supporting court cases, discrediting international efforts to advance equality, spreading disinformation, and funding non-profit organisations that align with their values.Until Everyone is Free, a report by Purposeful, an organisation focused on girls’ activism in Africa, described the “anti-rights tide” as a “transnational and orchestrated rollback of rights and freedoms fuelled by far-right extremism and authoritarianism on a scale unseen in modern history”.Many influential groups, including Family Watch International, C-Fam and the Alliance Defending Freedom are ultra-conservative US-based Christian organisations with strong links to governments in Africa, Asia and Latin America. There are similar groups in Europe and Australia.Such organisations have gained prominence in recent years, with support from governments including those of the US and Hungary. They spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advocacy, lobbying, litigation and media campaigns.While independently funded and run, they use similar tactics and rhetoric, emphasising national sovereignty, “family values”, parental rights, freedom of speech and religious freedom, which they promote among partners in poorer countries byspeaking at international conferences, particularly in Africa, and training  policymakers and campaigners in the US.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.We look at five moments that affected the safety, dignity and lives of women and girls.Figures reveal stark reality of US funding cuts as 1,394 family planning clinics shutRead moreUSAID dismantledIn March, six weeks after USAID is frozen, causingturmoil around the world, US secretary of state Marco Rubio confirms that83% of the agency’s programmes will be eliminated.US diplomats,former presidentsand humanitarian andhealth expertscondemn the news, warning that people will die as a result.

Meanwhile, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, opens the women’s summit with a stark warning that “the poison of patriarchy” is back, aftera report showsthat anti-rights actors are actively undermining longstanding consensus on key women’s rights issues around the world.View image in fullscreenAn anti-abortion activist looks at a photo of his baby daughter during a rally organised by CitizenGo, an ultraconservative Christian group, in Nairobi, Kenya.Photograph: Dai Kurokawa/EPAAfrican ‘family values’ conferencesOver the summer, a series of conferences in Africa focused on the traditional family and national sovereignty sparks alarm among rights advocates. On 9 May, Uganda’s president and first lady open the thirdInterparliamentary Forum on Family, Sovereignty and Valuesin Entebbe to push back oncriminal foreign forces eroding traditional family values. A few days later, the Pan-African Conference on Family Values is held in Nairobi. Both events are attended by leading US and European anti-rights figures, including president of Family Watch International, Sharon Slater; Austin Ruse, president of the Center for Family and Human Rights (C-Fam); and Jerzy Kwaśnewski, co-founder of Poland-based “extremist religious organisation” Ordo Iuris, who calls on African NGOs to push back against “radical global social engineering” of the UN and EU. In June, the Mormon church hosts theStrengthening Familiesconference in Sierra Leone, an event, reproductive rights advocates say that has becomean anti-LGBTQ, anti-gender platform.

The International Planned Parenthood Federation(IPPF) says their destruction will deny more than 1.4 million women and girls contraceptive supplies, and lead to 174,000 unintended pregnancies and 56,000 unsafe abortions in the five African countries it surveyed. IPPF says the plan is anideological decision“about imposing an anti-rights agenda on the entire world” and “an intentional act of reproductive coercion”.Médicins San Frontières(Doctors Without Borders) calls it “callous” and “reckless”. NGOs offer to buy the contraceptives so that they can reach their intended destinations but the US refuses all offers. Today, the situation is at a standstill as the Flemish government will not allow usable products to be destroyed.View image in fullscreenA protester wears a bandana over her mouth during a rally in Washington DC to protest against the global gag rule during Trump’s first term.Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images‘Global gag rule’ expandedReviving the global gag rule, which halts US aid to groups that provide, advocate for or advise on abortion services overseas, is standard practice for republican administrations, so it came as no surprise when President Trumpreinstated the rule in his first week of officein January. He alsorejoined the Geneva Consensus Declaration, ananti-abortion agreementcreated by former Trump health adviser Valerie Huber that has gained support from about 40 countries. But in October, the US announces it intends to expandthe global gag ruleto include governments and multilateral organisations in addition to NGOs, and to cover diversity programmes. More details on the expansion of the global gag rule are expected in early 2026. Rajat Khosla, director of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and ChildHealth, says widening the scope of the rule will have “unimaginable effects”. Reproductive justice campaigners fear that new US aid packages being negotiated with countries in Africa will become conditional on accepting the expanded global gag.Explore more on these topicsAnti-rights movementReproductive rightsContraception and family planningAbortionTrump administrationAfricaWomennewsShareReuse this content"

They are in a dangerous environment. They are facing grave, grave danger to their lives and we are still in discussions with various authorities, both in Russia as well as inUkraine, to see how we can free them from the situation they are in.“In fact, the emphasis is more with the authorities inRussiaand less so with the authorities in the Ukraine, because the information that we have is that they were bungled into the Russian military forces,” he said, in answer to a reporter’s question at a press briefing on Monday.He said the engagements with Russia were ongoing and that the issue was “receiving the highest possible attention in our government”. Russia’s embassy in SouthAfricadid not reply to a request for comment.On 6 November, South Africa’s government said it had received distress calls from the men. Later that month, another of Zuma’s daughters, Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube,filed a police reportalleging that Zuma-Sambudla and two others had deceptively recruited the men, who included eight of her family members.‘Outright evil:’ anguish and anger over South Africans tricked into fighting for RussiaRead moreZuma-Sambudla filed her own police report, claiming she had been deceived by Blessing Khoza, another of those accused by her half-sister. She alleged he had tricked her into recruiting the men for what she had believed was a legitimate paramilitary training course that she herself had attended.Khoza and Siphokazi Xuma, the third person accused of luring the men to Russia, could not be reached for comment.On 5 December, at least 13 relatives and friends of the men protested outside Durban city hall, carrying signs with messages such as “Save Our Men. Home Is Where They Belong”, “Bring Our Men Home – End The War” and “Bring Them Back Alive. Bring Them Back Safe”.An unnamed mother told the national broadcasterSABC: “What makes it worse is hearing what they are being put through. They are being ill-treated and slowly they are breaking down. They are pleading with us every day to bring them home. That’s all we want at this stage, for them to come back home alive.”One mother told the Guardian she had not heard from her son since 27 August, when he called her to say he was being forced to sign a contract in Russian that he did not understand, but was worried he was being sent to the frontlines in Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaUkraineRussiaAfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As the staccato sound of firecrackers and explosions rang out across Martyr’s Square in the heart of Tripoli, for once it was not Libya’s militias battling it out for a larger stake in the country’s oil economy, but a huge firework display celebrating the reopening of one of the finest museums in the Mediterranean.The National Museum of Libya – housing Africa’s greatest collection of classical antiquities in Tripoli’s historic Red Castle complex – had been closed for nearly 14 years due to the civil war that followed the former dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s downfall. Its ceremonial reopening came at the climax of a lavish show compressing Libya’s rich history and attended by diplomats and Arab celebrities, with a full-size Italian orchestra, acrobats, dancers, arches of fire and lights projected on to the fort. It did not lack for circus drama or cost, peaking with a billowing Ottoman sailing ship arriving high above the port on wires to be greeted by an angelic-appearing Libyan woman.View image in fullscreenA fireworks display during the reopening ceremony.Photograph: Libyan government platform/ReutersAbdul Hamid Dbeibah, the prime minister of Libya’s UN-recognised government of national unity – Libya has two rival governments, one in the east and one in the west – was then taken to the doors of the museum, where he wielded a big stick, as if at the opening of the British parliament, to hammer on them and demand entry. The giant wooden doors drew open slowly and crowds poured in.Inside, Libya’s history revealed itself – a record of a vast country shaped by successive occupations from Greek to Roman, Ottoman and Italian. On its four floors could be found cave paintings worthy of Lascaux; 5,000-year-old mummies from the ancient ​settlements of Uan Muhuggiag ⁠in Libya’s deep south; tablets in the Punic alphabet; and countless treasures from the still largely unvisited Roman coastal cities of Leptis Magna and Sabratha, including spell-binding mosaics, friezes and statues of great public figures and gods. Gone, however, was Gaddafi’s turquoise VW beetle, once given pride of place in the collection and one of the museum’s fewlosses to the uprising.Speaking the next day in offices once occupied by Italian archeologists on the top floor of the Red Castle, Dr Mustafa Turjman, the former head of the department of antiquities, recalled evacuating all the museum’s works to secret hideaways to keep them from robbers and smugglers. He admitted there was hesitation about the reopening, after artefacts from the tiniest coin to giant statues were brought back from hiding.View image in fullscreenVisitors at the National Museum in Tripoli.Photograph: Libyan government platform/ReutersTurjman said the museum showed people what Libya had once been – a region of great cultural and economic self-confidence, well connected to the world beyond the sea. “We are part of the Mediterranean,” he said.This was not just a moment for classicists, or lovers of Libya’s rich history, Turjman said, but a moment for a country riven between its eastern and western regions to come together. “This is a museum about the whole of Libya … the archaeological masterpieces of the whole country. It is a force for unification,” he said. “So when people from Tripoli [in the west] come here they see statues from [the eastern region of] Cyrenaica, and when Cyrenaicans come they see their heritage, so it helps reunify the two regions … We are relatives. Their cousins are here and out cousins are here.”Turjman hopes the museum will help educate Libyans after the distorted teaching of the Gaddafi era, and the first few weeks of the museum’s opening is dedicated to bringing in schoolchildren. “The most important thing is teaching the mind. Teaching how to respect time and history, and how to respect others, and to be involved in the world,” he said. “We have to build the minds. My generation studied the philosophy of the Greeks as part of our heritage, but this stopped. Libya is often an arid remote region, but we kept this heritage: it shows our willpower.”View image in fullscreenStatues in the National Museum.Photograph: Libyan government platform/ReutersPersuading the world to see Libya “through optimist’s eyes”, as the government slogan puts it, could be a tough ask. True, embassies are reopening, as are long-closed luxury hotels. The British oil multinational BP has reopened its office and new oil investments are planned. Luxury waterfront marinas have been built. A drive-in food complex has sprung up. But there is much to overcome.A Libyan passport provides free passage to virtually nowhere and the country remains close to the bottom of world league tables for press freedom and corruption. On the museum’s opening night a notorious people smuggler, Ahmed al-Dabbashi, was reported shot dead in a gunfight with Libyan security forces inSabratha. Australia only last week advised its citizens to stay away; in Tripoli’s al-Madina souq some of the shops say they are open only two hours a day due to the lack of visitors.Dbeibah is disarmingly frank in interview about his country’s failings, including the arrest of three of his ministers in a corruption investigation, even if he insisted spending was transparent down to the last dinar. He admitted the country’s inability to shake off its dependency on the oil economy meant that 2.5 millions Libyans were on the government payroll – roughly a third of the population. Distorting but popular subsidies also mean petrol is cheaper than water, costing less than £1 to fill a tank. The price makes it a target for smuggling that the various auditing agencies seem incapable of preventing.View image in fullscreenThe official reopening came at the climax of a lavish ceremony.Photograph: Mahmud Turkia/AFP/Getty ImagesPressed on why the east and west of the country had set up conflicting parallel institutions since the 2014 uprising, he blamed politicians and not the people.Dbeibah has not been elected to office. Becoming prime minister in 2021 as part of a UN-supervised process, he was due to stay in power only until elections across the country could be held. But a parliament or president with a meaningful mandate remains a distant prospect so long as the political elite in east and west prefer the personal riches disunity brings.The UN Libya mission is organising “a structured dialogue” in an effort to reconcile the country ahead of elections possibly next year, but Dbeibah says he opposes holding a vote until there has been a referendum on a new constitution. The merry-go-round of west and east setting preconditions for elections never stops. One Libyan official said: “Libyans have no clue about politics. Gaddafi prevented that.”View image in fullscreenDbeibah knocking on the museum door.Photograph: Libyan government platform/ReutersOne of the very first visitors to the museum was theEgyptian comedian and TV host Bassem Youssef, who has millions of social media followers and has appeared on Piers Morgan’s TV show to speak about the Gaza war.He said it had taken time to convince his wife it would be safe to visit Libya, and reflected on “the rectangular screen in our pockets that shapes our consciousness and minds”. He said Libya was in the news only when it was embroiled in conflict or other problems, and when things calmed down the media were no longer interested. It was as if for an Arab country to be in the news, something had to be wrong, he said.“The image of any country or society has nothing to do with the reality on the ground, but rather with the lens through which one sees reality,” he said. “Unfortunately, we must admit that this lens, which transmits the image of most of our Arab countries, is broken, cracked and distorted.”Explore more on these topicsLibyaMiddle East and north AfricaAfricaMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

Democrats have called for the release of video detailing that attack, and Trump at one point supported making the footage public but later backtracked and deferred to Hegseth.As he left a classified briefing conducted for senators alongside Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, the Pentagon chief said he would not release it in its entirety.“In keeping with longstanding department of war policy, Department of Defense policy, of course, we’re not going to release a top-secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public,” Hegseth told reporters.The video was not shown in the briefing, according to lawmakers who attended, but Hegseth said that he would hold a viewing on Wednesday for members of the House and Senate committees on the armed services along with Frank Bradley, the admiral who commanded the strike.Chuck Schumer, the top Senate democrat, said that he demanded Hegseth show the full video of the 2 September strike to all senators in their behind-closed-doors briefing, but the secretary refused.“The administration came to this briefing empty handed,” Schumer said, noting that anything shown in the classified setting would not be made public. “That’s the major question that we face, and if they can’t be transparent on this, how can you trust their transparency on all the other issues swirling about in the Caribbean?”Chris Coons, a Democratic senator, said lawmakers were told the full video could not be shown due to “classification” issues, which he struggled to believe because Trump, Hegseth and other defense officials have repeatedly posted portions of footage from other attacks.“It is hard to square the widespread routine prompt posting of detailed videos of every stripe with a concern that posting a portion of the video of the first strike would violate a variety of classification concerns,” the Delaware lawmaker said.Some Democrats objected to not being able to see the video, noting that they held positions in committees that deal with issues related toVenezuela.“I have asked, and will continue to ask, to see that – why, as a member of Congress and the ranking member in the foreign affairs committee, I’m not allowed to see it,” Democratic congressman Gregory Meeks told reporters after joining other House lawmakers for a briefing with Rubio and Hegseth.The United States has attacked more than 20 vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean since the beginning of the campaign in early September, killing at least 90 people that Washington alleges were smuggling drugs. Inthe most recent attackannounced Monday, US Southern Command said it had hit three vessels and killed eight individuals.Lawmakers in both the Senate and House of Representatives have introduced war powers resolutions intended to stop the president from engaging in hostilities against Venezuela without Congress’s permission. Both chambers could vote on the measures this week, but it’s unclear if they would have enough Republican support to pass.Several Trump allies who emerged from Hegseth’s briefing with senators said they had no reservations about his actions against Venezuela or targeting of boats.“The process we have is legally sound. It’s been supported by legal opinions for a quarter century now of how we find these people, we fix them, and we finish them,” said Tim Sheehy, a Montana senator and former Navy Seal.While previous US administrations have stopped and detained vessels suspected of carrying drugs, Sheehy implied such operations were now too risky.“Keep in mind, if we don’t drop a bomb, we decide to interdict, as is being said by many folks, we have an obligation to send a team to interdict,” he said.“Interdicting a vessel underway, is perhaps the most dangerous mission we have in our entire military inventory.”Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina senator, said that Trump should not stop his campaign against Venezuela until the removal from power of Maduro, who the United States has designated a “narco-terrorist” andmaintainsstole last year’s presidential election.“If he’s still standing when this is over, this is a fatal, major mistake to our standing in the world. If, after all this, Maduro is still in power, that’s the worst possible signal you can send to Russia, China, Iran,” Graham said.Republican Rand Paul has been critical of the air strikes, and said the briefing did not allay his concerns over the campaign’s legality.“One of my criticisms has been that there really isn’t a legal or a moral justification for killing unarmed people, and I’ve heard nothing to contradict my previous assertion that these people were unarmed,” the Kentucky senator said.Don Bacon, a moderate Republican congressman who will retire after next year, said he supported Trump’s policy towards Venezuela but thinks Congress should vote to authorize it.“I heard what I thought was reassuring, a message that we’re trying to do this right,” Bacon said. “I think they should have to have congressional authorization. I would be supportive of it, if we got to vote on it.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaUS foreign policyPete HegsethAmericasTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has also battled unsuccessfully against leftwing rebels for control of criminal networks along the Venezuelan border.In recent years, the group has attempted to present itself as a political movement similar to Colombian insurgent factions groups, which would grant it different conditions at peace talks, but it is not widely considered to have concrete political aims.Colombia identifies new threat in drug war: the autonomous narco drone subRead moreIn a statement on Tuesday, the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, described the Gulf Clan – which calls itself the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AGC) – as a “violent and powerful criminal organisation with thousands of members” whose “primary source of income is cocaine trafficking, which it uses to fund its violent activities”.Although other criminal groups in Colombia – the world’s leading cocaine-producing country – have been designated as terrorist groups in the past, Tuesday’s ruling marks the first under the current administration ofDonald Trump, which has targeted six cartels in Mexico and two in Venezuela.The move is likely to exacerbate tensions between Trump and Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, whostrongly opposes the US president’s pressure campaignagainst Venezuela and the deadly airstrikes that have killed more than 90 people off the coasts of both countries in the Pacific and the Caribbean.The two leaders have traded public barbs for weeks. After warning that any country producing narcotics was a potential target – and singling out Colombia – Trump said last week that Petro “is going to have himself some big problems if he doesn’t wise up”.Petro, in turn, warned Trump to “not wake the jaguar” with threats of military action.The US has used its so-called war on drugs to justify the strikes on boats it alleges are ferrying drug shipments. Petro has described the attacks a “murder”. Early on Tuesday, the US Southern Command said it hadcarried out new strikes on three vesselsnear Colombia’s Pacific coast, killing eight people.Other Colombian criminal organisations have been featured on the US foreign terrorist organisations list for years, including the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) that took up arms again after the 2016 peace agreement.Some Colombian officials hoped that the Gulf Clan might be weakened by the capture and extradition to the US of its main leader in 2022. Instead, the group unleashed a campaign of terror, assassinating police officers and local leaders and holding large swaths of the country hostage.The Gulf Clan is now engaged in halting talks with the government but is considered the main obstacle to Petro’sstumbling “total peace” planto end the country’s many-sided armed conflict.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasTrump administrationMarco RubioDrugs tradeDrugsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Imperialist intervention is not something to debate, but something to reject outright.”Another Colombian author, Giuseppe Caputo,citedthe deadlyUS airstrikeson boats that have so far killed more than 90 people many of them in the same Caribbean waters that border Cartagena.“I think that, given the grave moment of escalating imperial violence, it is better to withdraw from a festival held on the shores of the bombarded Caribbean Sea, which has decided to invite someone who dedicated a peace prize to the fascist responsible for these crimes,” wrote Caputo on his social media, recalling that Machado dedicated her Nobel prize to Trump.Machado recently toldCBSthat she “absolutely supports President Trump’s strategy” on Venezuela and that the “cost of staying in power” for Maduro must be increased “by force”.The Venezuelan opposition leader suffered avertebra fractureduring herfilm-like escapefrom Venezuela, where she had been in hiding for more than a year, to Oslo, Norway, to receive the prize.After a clandestine 5,500-mile journey that involved passing through multiple checkpoints on land, being rescued by a team led by a US special forces veteran after 12 hours in a flimsy boat in the rough Caribbean waters, and a flight on a private jet to Oslo, she ultimately missed the Nobel ceremony but took part in events and press conferences.It is unclear when or how she will return to Venezuela. Her remote participation in the Hay festival Cartagena – in a conversation with the Venezuelan journalist and former minister of trade and industry Moisés Naím – is still scheduled January 30.Machado’s team said she would not comment on the writers’ protest.The festival, which was founded in Wales and later expanded to other countries, issued astatementsaying it respected the authors’ decisions but believed that open and diverse dialogue is essential to defending “the free exchange of ideas and freedom of expression”.“It is important to clarify that the Hay festival does not align itself with or endorse the opinions, positions or statements of those who take part in its activities, nor their political views,” it added.The Dominican writer and activist Mikaelah Drullard, the third to pull out in protest,saidthe festival’s invitation to Machado amounted to a validation of everything she says and “an ideological weapon to promote her justifications for US intervention, invasion and militarisation of the Caribbean, and of her delight at the success of the ultra-right Kast in Chile’s election.”Explore more on these topicsMaría Corina MachadoVenezuelaHay festivalAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the country’s distinct and somewhat arbitrary spelling reflects the legacy of howCanadawas colonized.“Canadian English evolved through Loyalist settlement after the American Revolutionary War, subsequent waves of English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish immigration, and from European and global contexts,” the letter says, with the current accepted spellings of words reflecting “global influences and cultures from around the world represented in our population, as well as containing words and phrases from Indigenous languages”.The linguists pointed out that Canada’s distinct style of spelling was widespread in media and government documents, with this deliberate decision reflecting a desire to preserve a vital element of the country’s “national history, identity and pride”.The prime minister’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the decision to use British spellings.The letter’s authors, who are university professors and editors, say many Canadians are “passionate” about spelling words in a uniquely Canadian way, but acknowledge there are many opinions on what exactly is “Canadian”.Citing the Canadian Press stylebook, they highlight an aversion to the British variant of certain words (preferring tire instead of tyre, and jail over gaol) but also a rejection for some US versions (using cheque instead of check, and manoeuvre instead of maneuver).Other words in the Canadian lexicon are borrowed from the country’s French and Indigenous histories. A “toque” originally referred to atuque– a knitted winter hat worn by French and Métis fur traders. The word “muskeg”, used to describe peat-like lands, is derived from the Cree wordmaskek(ᒪᐢᑫᐠ) – “low-lying marsh”.In a nod to Carney’s love of hockey metaphors to capture the current trade battle with the United States, the linguists said preserving Canadian English is “the simplest way to takean ‘elbows up’ stance”.Explore more on these topicsMark CarneyCanadaAmericasEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I spoke to President Xi about it, and I asked to consider his release,” Trump told reporters on Monday, without specifying when he asked Xi.“He’s an older man, and he’s not well. So I did put that request out. We’ll see what happens.”The US president had said before he returned to the White House that he wanted to free Lai, a businessman who launched the pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily.Trump met with Xi in October in South Korea, where he is believed to have raised Lai’s case.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said on X shortly after Trump’s remarks that theHong Kongverdict showed China’s determination to “silence those who seek to protect freedom of speech and other fundamental rights”.He noted thatChinapromised to uphold a separate system before Britain handed over the financial hub in 1997.“Reports indicate that Mr Lai’shealth has severely deterioratedduring more than 1,800 days in prison,” Rubio said in a statement.“We urge the authorities to bring this ordeal to an end as soon as possible and to release Mr Lai on humanitarian grounds.”Governments, institutions and rights groups across the world havecondemned Lai’s conviction. The British citizen is a devout Catholic, with his case being raised in the US by an ad hoc coalition of democracy and press freedom advocates and Christian activists, who form a key base for Trump.Lai’s daughter Claire Lai also appealed for his freedom after the conviction, telling the Associated Press that Lai would devote himself to God and his family rather than political activism if he were released.“He just wants to reunite with his family. He wants to dedicate his life to serving our Lord, and he wants to dedicate the rest of his days to his family. My father is fundamentally not a man who operates on illegal ground.”Lai, 78 and diabetic, was found guilty on Monday of all three charges in a national security trial and could spend the rest of his life in prison, after already being jailed since his arrest in late 2020.His conviction is part of a clampdown by China on Hong Kong following mass protests in 2019.Explore more on these topicsJimmy LaiDonald TrumpTrump administrationHong KongChinaXi JinpingAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Our investigators had to wait for the effects of medication to wear off and for him to obtain a legal [adviser],” Lanyon told ABC radio on Wednesday morning.“We expect to speak to him today.”The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he expected Naveed to be charged “over the coming hours”.‘We are all human beings first’: Jews and Muslims embrace at vigils for those killed in Bondi beach terror attackRead moreFifteen people were killed in the attack on a Hanukah event, Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly 30 years, and it is being investigated as an act of terrorism targeting the Jewish community.The first funerals for those killed were being held on Wednesday,including funerals for Rabbi Eli Schlangerand Rabbi Yaakov Levitan. Schlanger worked at the Chabad of Bondi, which hosted Sunday’s Chanukah by the Sea event, and his funeral was to be held at the centre just 1km from the site of the attack.Twenty-two people wounded in the attack remained in hospitals acrossSydney, three in a critical condition, five in a critical but stable condition, and the remainder in a stable condition.In a statement providing more details about one of the men alleged to have carried out the attack, police in the southern Indian state of Telangana said Sajid Akram, 50, attained a degree in commerce in Hyderabad, the large and bustling tech and pharma hub that is the state capital.Akram then moved to Australia in November 1998 to find work and married a woman described as of European origin, with whom he had a son and a daughter.He went back to India six times for family-related reasons, such as property matters and to visit his parents, but did not return when his father died, the police statement said.It said Akram’s family seemed unaware of any alleged “radicalisation” and local police had no “adverse record” of him before he left in 1998.“The family members have expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalisation,” the statement said.“The factors that led to the radicalisation of Sajid Akram … appear to have no connection with India or any local influence in Telangana.”Australian police said Sajid Akram and his son, Naveed, hadtravelled to the Philippines last month.The father travelled on an Indian passport, and the son on an Australian one, and the purpose of the trip was under investigation, officials said, adding that it was not conclusive whether they were linked to any terrorist group or whether they received training in that country.Reasons for Bondi suspects’ Philippines trip remain unclear, but Islamic State is active thereRead moreMeanwhile, the devastated parents of the youngest victim of the terror attacktold a memorial at Bondi beach on Tuesday eveningthat they named her Matilda because she was their firstborn in Australia.“And I thought that Matilda was the most Australian name that could ever exist,” the 10-year-old’s father, Michael, told the crowd.Michael and his wife Valentya, who requested their surnames be withheld, immigrated to Australia from Ukraine. They broke down as they addressed the crowd.“I couldn’t imagine I would lose my daughter here,” Valentyna said.Other victims of the attackinclude Holocaust survivor Alexander Kleytman, 87; dedicated and much-loved community volunteer Marika Pogany, 82, whodied “on her favourite Bondi beach”; and three people who tried to stop the shooting:Boris Gurman, 69 and wife Sofia Gurman, 61, who were shot after trying to disarm one of the alleged gunmen; andReuven Morrison, who threw bricks at Sajid Akram.– with Reuters and Australian Associated PressExplore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackAustralian police and policingAntisemitismBondi beachSydneyIndianewsShareReuse this content"

But thousands of demonstrators have stagedprotestsat the site of the proposed hotel and apartment building, a historically resonant spot long off-limits to developers.All the president’s millions: how the Trumps are turning the presidency into richesRead moreA spokesperson for Affinity Partners, an investment company run by Trump’s son-in-law and diplomatic envoy,Jared Kushner, which was developing the buildings alongside the Trump Organization, said: “Because meaningful projects should unite rather than divide, and out of respect for the people of Serbia and the City of Belgrade, we are withdrawing our application and stepping aside at this time.”Since Donald Trump won back the White House 13 months ago, his sons have struck a spree of deals from the Gulf to Vietnam that have helped to swell the family’s income to anestimated $864min the first half of this year alone. The president’s financial disclosures show that, while Donald Trump Jr and Eric are formally in charge of the Trump Organization, profits still flow to their father.The Trumps’ critics call it “pay to play”: the perception that enriching the first family can buy the president’s favour. The White House has responded to questions whether commercial considerations have influenced pardons, technology transfers, sanctions relief and tariff reductions by insisting that “neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest”.View image in fullscreenSerbia’s culture minister, Nikola Selaković, has been indicted over the project.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Trumps have mulled adding a Belgrade property to their international portfolio since at least 2013. In 2024, Kushner came to Serbia to announce that one was finally to be built. In January, days after Trump’s inauguration, Ericrevealedit would bear the family name.Two months later, Trump Jr was in Belgrade to see Vučić. While Serbians were filling the streets withprotests against his regime’s alleged corruptionand incompetence, the president and Trump Jr enjoyed what Vučić called a “cordial conversation” about “bilateral relations” – comments that suggested blurred lines between business and geopolitics.

Once a gem of modernist architecture, it was preserved as the ruins of the genocidal Slobodan Milošević regime’s military headquarters, bombed by Nato in 1999.Nine days after Trump’s November 2024 election victory, the Vučić regime revoked this protected status. But the necessary paperwork had been falsified, the head of the cultural heritage institute said after his arrest in May. Vučić spoke darkly of “corrupt gangs” of prosecutors bringing “fabricated cases”.But the prosecutor, Mladen Nenadić, pressed on. He made further arrests, culminating on Monday in the indictment of Vučić’s culture minister, Nikola Selaković, and other officials “in connection with the illegalities in the removal of the status of cultural property” from the site of the planned Trump Tower.Selaković denies wrongdoing. None of these allegations relate to the Trumps’ conduct or Kushner’s.Vučić said on Tuesday that those who opposed the Trump Tower wanted to “destroy Serbia”. The country faces an energy crisis after the Trump administration in October imposed sanctions on its Russian-owned oil refinery.Estela Radonjic Zivkov, an official at the heritage institute who defied pressure from agents of the state security agency to support the project, welcomed the decision to abandon the project. She told the Guardian: “This decision demonstrates that public interest, the rule of law, and professional integrity cannot be permanently overridden by political will and private interests.”Explore more on these topicsSerbiaDonald TrumpDonald Trump JrJared KushnerEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The European Holiday Home Association argues the Catalan decree is “unjustified” and breaches EU law on the freedom to provide services.In the wake of such legal challenges, Brussels officials say an EU law will enable local authorities to take “justified and proportionate measures” to control short-term holiday rentals.Draft legislation, which will not be published until December 2026, could effectively propose a “white list” of options available to local authorities in areas of housing stress, such as caps on the number of nights a home can be rented out for short-term stays.“We are not forcing cities or regions or member states to do these things but we are making it possible to solve these problems where they arise,” Jørgensen said.The commission, the EU’s fiscal regulator, will also grant member states greater leeway to offer subsidies or incentives to finance affordable housing.The plans to curb speculation are more open-ended. EU officials say they will analyse “housing price dynamics, including available evidence of speculation patterns” and seek to shed more light on property ownership.View image in fullscreenDemonstrations calling for change have been held in Barcelona for several years.Photograph: Zuma Press Inc/AlamyThe Socialist group in the European parliament welcomed the plan, which had been theirkey demand for supporting Ursula von der Leyen’s second termas commission president. The Socialists and Democrats (S&D), a diminished force in the more right-leaning parliament, who have recently lost key votes on deregulation, were quick to claim the affordable housing plan as a victory.S&D leader Iratxe García Pérez described the plan as a “historic milestone” in response to a “social emergency” as she called for quick and ambitious implementation “with massive investments”.But the plan also faced criticism for being no more than “a framework of intentions and future timelines”. Maria Ohisalo, a Finnish Green MEP, also said the plan lacked “a more decisive approach to real estate speculation, which plays a fundamental role in the housing crisis”.The centre-right European People’s party housing spokesperson, Nikolina Brnjac, welcomed the emphasis on cutting red tape and accelerating housebuilding.The commission – as part of a broader deregulation driveunder the banner of “simplification”– has pledged to map EU rules to assess where they may be putting “unnecessary administrative burden” on small and medium-sized housebuilding companies.As anti-tourism protests grow in Europe, we need a rethink – but that’s no reason to stop travelling | Leah PattemRead moreBetween 2010 and 2024, house prices increased by 53% across the EU, and rents by 25%, while general prices increased by 39%,according to Eurostat.But the averages mask significant variations. Rents in Estonia surged by 208% over this period – with rises of 177% in Lithuania, 108% in Ireland and 107% in Hungary.People in cities struggle most with unaffordability. Almost 10% of city dwellers lived in a household where total housing costs were more than 40% of disposable income in 2024, defined by Eurostat as “housing cost overburden rate”.City dwellers in Greece (29%) and Denmark (23%) were the most likely to be burdened with such high housing costs.The mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Colboni, told the Guardian this week thathousing costs were akin to “a new pandemic”as he and 16 other city leaders urged the EU to help mobilise at least €300bn (£262bn) a year in public and private funds to promote the construction of affordable homes.The EU is not following that call for an affordable housing fund modelled on the pandemic recovery scheme, which was financed by EU borrowing.But officials pointed to anannouncement from European public and regional banks on Tuesdaypromising a €375bn investment in social and affordable housing by 2029.Explore more on these topicsEuropean CommissionHousingEuropeEuropean UnionOvertourismAirbnbnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the US would also hold consultations with the Russians, followed by high-level meetings that could take place as soon as this weekend.“We are counting on five documents. Some of them concern security guarantees: legally binding, that is, voted on and approved by the US Congress,” he said, adding that the guarantees would “mirror article 5” of Nato.However, Zelenskyy made clear that on the key issue of the Donbas region – which Russia is seeking to control in its entirety, including areas it has not yet occupied – Ukraine saw no change in the Russian position, adding: “They want our Donbas. And we do not want to give away our Donbas.“The Americans want to find a compromise, [and] they offer a ‘free economic zone’ [in the Donbas]. And I will emphasise once again: ‘free economic zone’ does not mean under the leadership of the Russian Federation.”US officials have declined to give specific details of what the security package was likely to include, and what would happen if Russia attempted to seize more land after a peace deal was reached. They did, however, confirm that the US did not plan to put boots on the ground in Ukraine.Leaders of the UK, France,Germanyand eight other European countries said in a joint statement that troops from a “coalition of the willing” could “assist in the regeneration of Ukraine’s forces, in securing Ukraine’s skies, and in supporting safer seas, including through operating inside Ukraine”.What did Ukraine peace talks in Berlin achieve – and what happens next?Read moreThey stopped short, however, of suggesting these would be guarantees that would match Nato’s article 5, and there is little sign that Russia is anywhere close to agreeing to the kind of package under discussion between Washington and Kyiv.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Ukrainian armed forces install anti-drone nets in the city centre of Izium, Kharkiv.Photograph: Diego Fedele/Getty ImagesThe head of Ukraine’s delegation to the talks, Rustem Umerov, also underlined he saw a Russian rejection of proposals as a potential outcome in which case Ukraine would seek more weapons from the US.On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it had not seen the details of proposals on security guarantees. “We have seen newspaper reports so far, but we will not respond to them. We have not seen any texts yet,” its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters.Peskov added that Moscow, which has in the past demanded Kyiv cede territories Russia claims as its own and ruled out the presence of any foreign troops in Ukraine, had not changed its stance on the conflict and the achievement of its military goals.“Our position is well known. It is consistent, it is transparent and it is clear to the Americans. And, in general, it is clear to the Ukrainians as well,” Peskov said.Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Russia would not agree to troops from Nato countries operating in Ukraine “under any circumstances”. Asked about a potential for deployment of European forces in Ukraine outside the Nato framework, he added: “No, no, and no again.”The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said on Monday that peace was closer than at any time since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion. But privately, European officials say that at this stage the talks are more about keeping the Trump White House onboard with supporting Ukraine than about reaching a lasting deal between Moscow and Kyiv.View image in fullscreen(From left) US negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, in Berlin on Monday.Photograph: dts News Agency Germany/ShutterstockThe main sticking point between the Ukrainian team and US negotiators remains the issue of land. Trump wants Ukraine to give up the parts of the Donbas region it still holds, while Ukraine wants to freeze the lines at the current point of contact.The US negotiation team, led by Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, has proposed a compromise solution whereby Ukraine would withdraw, but Russia would not advance and the demilitarised area would become “a free economic zone”. Russia has suggested it could use police and national guard formations rather than the military, implying it would still expect to control the territory.“I want to stress once again: a ‘free economic zone’ does not mean under the control of Russia. Neither de jure nor de facto will we recognise Donbas – its temporarily occupied part – as Russian. Absolutely,” said Zelenskyy.It is not clear how the two sides will proceed on the territorial issue, with Zelenskyy previously suggesting that a compromise solution such as a free economic zone could be theoretically possible if the Ukrainian people voted for it in a referendum. The critical stumbling block is likely to be when the plans are put to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has given no sign he is willing to compromise on his war aims.“If Putin rejects everything, we will end up with exactly what we are experiencing on our plane right now – turbulence,” said Zelenskyy, recording the comments after his plane took off from Berlin for the Netherlands.“I believe the United States will apply sanctions pressure and provide us with more weapons if he rejects everything. I think that would be a fair request from us to the Americans,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaTrump administrationGermanyEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Dozens of relics found during the metro station’s construction are displayed behind glass screens, including jugs, bowls and votives, such as a stag’s antlers and hairpins, found in the wells.View image in fullscreenPorta Metronia station opens in Rome.Photograph: Marco Di Gianvito/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockMeanwhile, at Porta Metronia, located in Piazzale Ipponio, a vast military barracks including a commander’s house featuring frescoes and mosaic floors was discovered. The barracks, found at a depth between 7 and 12 metres, are believed to date back to the early second century AD – before the construction of the Aurelian walls, the huge defence around the city.“The military complex was an exceptional find,” Simona Moretta, the scientific director of the excavation, told reporters, adding that soldiers were either part of the emperor’s guard or based there for city security.However, although trains are running from Porta Metronia, passengers will have to wait until early next year before the museum opens.The opening of the two stations adds a further 3km (1.9 miles) to Metro C, whose extension, built by a consortium led by Webuild, will eventually branch out to include Piazza Venezia before heading towards the area of the Vatican.Pietro Salini, the chief executive of Webuild, said their delivery represented “a strategic milestone that combines in an exemplary way progress in infrastructure with the conservation of our heritage”.Carlo Andrea, a tour guide and historian, has been keeping close watch of the construction progress on his blogOdissea Quotidiana.“It’s been an eternal wait,” Andrea, who plans to give tours in the stations, said as he visited Colosseo-Fori Imperiali. “There has been a bit of resignation too as there’s this sense among Romans that the city will never have the same infrastructure as other European capitals. But then on days like this, we’re reminded that it’s important to build the subway, even if it’s a challenge in Rome, also because it brings us wonderful things.”Explore more on these topicsItalyArchaeologyRail transportEuropeMuseumsHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

carsCommission proposes cutting obligation for 100% zero emission vehicles beyond 2035 to 90% after pressure from industry and some EU statesLisa O’CarrollTue 16 Dec 2025 12.24 ESTFirst published on Tue 16 Dec 2025 09.30 ESTShareThe EU has confirmed it wants to water down its 2035 ban on the sale of new petrol or diesel cars, yielding to heavy pressure from the car industry and leaders from several EU member states including Germany and Italy.Wopke Hoekstra, a European climate commissioner, described the proposals as a “win-win” situation for consumers and industry, keepingEuropeon the electrification course with a series of carrot and stick measures.Under current legislation, manufacturers were obliged to ensure that 100% of production of cars and vans had zero emissions from 2035.The European Commission has now proposed reducing this to 90%, enabling the continued manufacture of a portion of plug-in hybrid electric cars, or even combustion engines beyond 2035.In a carrot-and-stick approach, the remaining 10% of assembly line output that is not carbon neutral will need to be compensated by other green measures on the factory floor, including the use of green steel made in Europe or use of biofuels in non-electric vehicles.“This will allow for plug-in hybrids (PHEV), range extenders, mild hybrids, and internal combustion engine vehicles to still play a role beyond 2035, in addition to full electric (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles,” the commission said.Apostolos Tzitzikostas, a commissioner for sustainable transport, said: “This gives the market and the consumer the freedom to decide which technology they want to drive.” The industry commissioner, Stéphane Séjourné, said the European industry faced three challenges: competition from China, “a crisis in demand” and slow tech development in Europe.The proposals, which require approval from EU governments and the European parliament, are the bloc’s biggest retreat from its green policies enacted over the previous five years.Opponents said the announcement was a blow for Europe’s electrification journey.Chris Heron, the secretary general of the trade association E-Mobility Europe, said it was “the wrong time for Europe to take the wind out of its own sails”, adding the only way the EU industry could remain competitive was to reinforce its policy, not by “pulling off course”.Greenpeace UK’s policy director, Dr Douglas Parr, urged Keir Starmer not to follow suit. “The UK must not join Europe in this act of economic self-sabotage,” he said.Greenpeace Germany’s executive director, Martin Kaiser, described the plan as “an early Christmas present for Chinese electric car manufacturers”.Announcing the proposals, Hoekstra said the EU was “staying the course on zero emissions” but “introducing some flexibility for manufacturers so they can meet their CO2targets in the most cost efficient way”.Séjourné also announced measures to accelerate the delivery of small electric cars.If the vehicles are under 4.2 metres in length, cost between €15,000 to €20,000 (£13,151 to £17,535) and are made in the EU, customers will benefit from reductions in road tolls and discounts at charging stations and manufacturers will get bonus credits for their factory floor carbon output.Up to 2035, manufacturers of small electric cars will get “super credits” allowing them to bank bonus carbon credits for their factories.BEUC, the EU organisation of consumer bodies, welcomed efforts to bring small EVs to the market, saying hybrid cars at a cost of €40,000 were “nowhere near a real option for most households”.The commission is also proposing to relax targets for electric vans, reducing the requirements for a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 to 40%.The move, which followslobbying by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will be seen as a victory for the European car industry, which has struggled to make the transition to electric and facesgrowing competition from Chinese rivals.The decision, which had beenwidely anticipated in recent days, has already been denounced by the Green party in the European parliament, which has said it amounts to a “gutting” of flagship legislation aimed at cutting Europe’s emissions.The commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who championed the green deal, insisted that “Europe remains at the forefront of the global clean transition”.She said the proposals, which must be supported by the European parliament, were taken after “intense dialogues with automotive sector, civil society organisations and stakeholders”.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryAutomotive emissionsEuropean UnionGreenhouse gas emissionsFossil fuelsGreen

The Argentinian legal system is especially open to accommodating universal jurisdiction claims.The filing claims the response from Iran’s security forces to the protests inIranincluded “shooting live ammunition, paintball guns, metal pellets not intended to be shot at close range, and other projectiles at protesters. They also carried out mass arrests, arbitrary detentions, custodial torture, and ultimately even executions of protesters that continue to the present day.”Specific officers across the range of Iran’s security services have been named in the filing, but their names are being kept confidential.One of those making the claim, UK-based Mahsa Piraei,told the Guardian “what is being pursued here is not revenge in a personal sense, but accountability and truth”. Her mother, Minoo Majidi, 62, was shot dead in September 2022. Autopsy reports showed more than 167 metal pellets had been fired into her back at point-blank range. She had been on a street protest over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who waskilled in a Tehran police stationafter being arrested fornot complying with Iran’s rules around the hijab.Piraei, one of Majidi’s three children, lived in the UK at the time of her mother’s brutal death, but returned to Iran at great risk to visit her grave. Her sister Roya posted a photograph of herself by her mother’s grave with her hair shaved on her private social media account. A friend published the photograph which went viral, forcing Roya to seek exile in Turkey.Piraei said: “Through legal filings and documentation the aim is to preserve evidence, name crimes and prevent erasure.” She added her mother’s death was “not an isolated incident but part of a systematic practice. Even if protesters were not individually targeted for death, the actions of the security services show a reckless and knowing disregard for human life. Firing such weapons into crowds made serious injury or death foreseeable and effectively intentional.”She added: “Over time my grief did not disappear, but it became clearer to me that staying silent would be another form of loss. I no longer measure myself by whether I can ‘fix’ what happened because I cannot. Instead I measure myself by whether I refuse to let my mother’s life and death be erased.”The other two litigants who can be identified are Kowsar Eftekhari and Mersedeh Shahinkar, both victims of blinding at close range by paintball guns.Eftekhari, a 23-year-old university student, was shot in the right eye in October 2022. She protested in the streets for weeks, witnessing fellow protesters being shot with live ammunition and being beaten herself with electronic batons by security officers.View image in fullscreenAn activist with ‘Mahsa’ painted on her body during a protest outside the Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires in 2022.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesDuring a protest on 12 October, Eftekhari was at a demonstration near Tehran University when a plainclothes officer shot her with seven or eight paintballs at the range of a metre. He then allegedly shot her in the eye when she did not respond to his demand to disperse. A video of the attack including blood pouring from her right eye went viral, and she was eventually given asylum in Germany.Shahinkar, 38 at the time she was attacked on 18 October, only realised what had happened when she felt something warm on her face. Protesters warned her not to get into an ambulance since she might be taken to a police station. When Shahinkar finally arrived at a medical clinic, a staff member told her to leave because they would not treat protesters. But a doctor examined her and sent her to a hospital, where Shahinkar pretended a rock accidentally injured her eye so that she would not be denied treatment. She posted her injuries on her Instagram page, and in January 2023 plainclothes officers approached her, leading her to flee Iran. She collectedthe 2023 Sakharov prize, which honours individuals or groups who defend human rights and basic freedoms, as a representative of the Women, Life, Freedom movement.The group seeking the criminal investigation say the filing is not viewed just as a legal complaint with no hope of a practical outcome. Universal jurisdiction allows complaints to be investigated in a third country even if the offence did not occur in that country and the offender is not there. Argentina has some of the most liberal rules on universal jurisdiction claims in the world.In 2014 alone the principle of universal jurisdiction led to 27 convictions, the opening of least 36 cases, covering crimes committed in 32 countries. Cases are currently being prosecuted in 16 different countries.As the request is solely for a criminal investigation, and this is not a civil lawsuit, there is no demand by the complainants for money damages. The complaint would not be the first case against Iranian officials brought in Argentina. In June 2025, an Argentinian judge ordered that in absentia trials begin against seven Iranian suspects, along with three Lebanese individuals, for the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires in which 85 people were killed and hundreds wounded.Explore more on these topicsIranHuman rightsProtestWomenMiddle East and north AfricaArgentinanewsShareReuse this content"

This is her story of multiple displacements, injury and devastation over the last two yearsAshley Kirk,Manisha Ganguly,Ed Gargan,Antonio Voce,Prina ShahandLaure BoulinierTue 16 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 02.02 ESTShareWhen 26-year-old Nour AbuShammala stepped back into her family’s apartment inGazaCity in October the rooms were gutted, the walls were damaged by bombing, and there was no water or electricity, but it was still home.Since the outbreak of war in October 2023 she has been forced to flee six times. This is her story of relentless displacement, survival and loss, told using photography and videos provided by AbuShammala and satellite imagery of a ruined Gaza.Loading...undefinedAbuShammala was a rising star in international law. A graduate of Al-Azhar\n  University and the Palestinian Bar Association, she had been selected for the\n  prestigious Bertha Justice Fellowship to document Israeli violations for the\n  international criminal Court and had enrolled for a master’s at the University\n  of Jordan.Born in Khan Younis, she grew up in a wealthy suburb of Gaza City. Her home\n  was a fourth-floor, three-bedroom, 180-square-metre apartment with a sea view.\n  She lived there with her parents, Khalil and Sahar, sister Nesma, and brother\n  Muhammad.They are a close-knit, educated family deeply involved in civic and\n  human-rights work. By Gaza’s standards, they had a privileged life.undefinedundefinedundefinedKhalilonce led a human rights associationand Sahar chairs the Palestinian Development and Women Studies Association. Nesma\n  recently graduated in computer systems engineering, and Muhammad worked with displaced\n  people until he was injured in an airstrike.undefined“I’ve lived in Sheikh Ajleen – Al-Quds Street, southwest Gaza City – since I\n  was six,” she said. “It was quiet, away from the city’s noise, with only a few\n  homes nearby.”That neighbourhood is now rubble. The grocery store she visited with her\n  sister, her school, university and mosque – a lifetime of memories – lie\n  destroyed.undefinedundefinedAbuShammala was at home in Gaza City, getting ready to meet friends for a\n  birthday celebration, when Israel invaded after theHamas attackson 7 October 2023.“I had no idea what was happening. It was a shock for all of us,” she\n  recalled, remembering waking up to the sound of rockets.Days later, Israel issued evacuation orders. On 13 October, the AbuShammala\n  family packed what clothes they could and fled south to Khan Younis, to the\n  home of her late grandfather. The car journey took around 40 minutes.AbuShammala had always loved Khan Younis, her father’s hometown. It was a\n  place of family gatherings and childhood memories. War changed that: once a\n  refuge, Khan Younis came to symbolise loss. “I am someone who has no place.\n  Someone lost from their home, knowing the way but not knowing how to return.”undefinedShe stayed mostly indoors, unable to face the destruction. “I would tell\n  myself [the IDF] were posting [photos of the destruction] only to scare us. The thought was terrifying,” she said.undefinedundefinedTwo months later, in late December 2023, AbuShammala was on the move again. After evacuation leaflets fell over Khan Younis, \nher family travelled 10 minutes by truck to a patch of land their relatives owned in al-Mawasi. Soon after, \nthey learned that her grandfather’s house in Khan Younis had been destroyed, along with much of the wider neighbourhood.It was the middle of winter, and they left in a hurry. “Later, we had to buy\n  new essentials like clothes, carpets, kitchen appliances and other basics,”\n  AbuShammala said.Five of them slept in a single 6×4-metre tent. Later, they acquired a storage\n  tent to free a little space.undefinedWinterin the tent was “unbearable”, though AbuShammala felt luckier than families with\n  small children facing the same conditions.\"We had set up a kind of kitchen made of tarps with all our kitchen items.\n  Then for about two months the gas completely ran out and we had to cook over\n  fire. It was very difficult, especially in winter, having to go outside to\n  cook or even to use the bathroom in the cold.\"There was barely any signal, so AbuShammala spent most of her time in the tent\n  reading books on her phone. She especially enjoyed Guillaume Musso novels.When her family first arrived, few others were there. But once the IDF entered\n  Khan Younis, the area filled with tents.The experience carried an echo of her family’s past. Her grandparents had fled\n  militia attacks decades earlier, surviving only because of UN tents and aid.undefinedundefinedBy 21 July 2024, the family had rented an apartment in Nuseirat, in central Gaza. \nThey moved there in a shared car, and stayed there nearly a year until thesecond trucein 2025.The neighbourhood was quieter and less damaged than most, but tents surrounded\n  their building, a reminder of how few had shelter.undefinedundefinedThere was water and electricity, so “mentally it felt easier, and even though\n  it wasn’t like being in our home, at least we felt a bit of normal life”.Yet Gaza City – normally a ten-minute drive away – felt impossibly far. “We\n  weren’t able to go to Gaza because the army initially restricted movement from\n  the south to the north,” AbuShammala recalled.Video recorded by Nour showing the family apartment in Gaza City after the warThen came thefamine, after all border crossings into Gaza were closed. “Imagine not even being\n  able to find flour to make bread. You’re forced to live on whatever type of\n  food is available, and even that is sold at unbelievable prices.“We mostly ate hummus and fava beans, and we tried to ration how much bread we\n  had so it would last as long as possible.”For AbuShammala, life in Nuseirat was survival in exile.“My love for Gaza cannot be described in words. Any destruction here feels\n  like something inside me is destroyed too. They are stealing our years, our\n  lives, our dreams and our memories”.undefinedundefinedOn 8 April 2025, AbuShammala returned to her family’s home in Gaza City to\n  find it in ruins. An airstrike had flattened part of the building. Their home\n  was burned and hollowed out.The return meant more than the destruction. She walked through the blackened\n  rooms, recalling where everything once stood – sometimes reaching for a\n  vanished bookshelf or mirror.“Even though our apartment was burned and everything inside was gone, the\n  moment I stepped back, I felt I was truly home, in my neighborhood, my city,\n  among my people. It felt like my soul had come back to me.”undefinedInside, they found bullet casings and alcohol bottles. A neighbour said\n  Israeli soldiers had stayed there, and stickers on the door appeared to\n  confirm it.The area, just north of theNetzarim corridor, had been under tight military control for months.undefinedundefinedStill, the family began rebuilding with whatever materials they could find:\n  repairing walls, covering damage and laying new pipes. They cooked over open\n  fires when gas ran out.undefinedThen, on 30 June, Muhammad was at al-Baqa café when an Israeli airstrike hit.\n  A 500lb (230kg) bomb killed 24 Palestinians.Muhammad survived, shielding his friend, journalist Bayan Abusultan, but\n  shrapnel shattered his legs, leaving him permanently disabled and unable to\n  work.The Israeli military said the strike was under review, claiming it targeted\n  Hamas operatives. Legal expertssaidthe use of such a large bomb in a civilian area likely constituted a war crime.undefinedTheir return home was disrupted after renewed evacuation orders in September. The family fled once more to Nuseirat – paying $1,600 (£1,200) to hire a truck for a two-hour journey that should have taken 20 minutes.They returned to the same apartment they’d kept paying rent for “in case\n  things got worse – which they did.”undefinedThat month was a fragile pause. AbuShammala described life as “on hold,” the\n  sound of explosions shaking the house each night. She worked when she could,\n  commuting to Deir al-Balah for her job with the Stars of Hope Society, helping\n  women with disabilities through a UN Women-funded programme.“I do feel grateful for what I still have, and I know that compared to others,\n  my family and I are considered lucky. But we still live with fear and anxiety.\n  There’s also the sense of loss that isn’t always visible, the time and years\n  slipping away.”Eleven days after theceasefire was announced on 10 October, the family returned once again to Gaza. The walls they rebuilt in summer\n  were already cracking from fresh bombings. Water and gas were scarce.Videos recorded by Nour as she walked around her Gaza City neighbourhood on her return in October 2025. Video: Nour AbuShammala“My neighborhood still needs time to heal. My school still needs time before\n  it can reopen its doors to students. And even when that time comes, nothing\n  will ever be the same again. No one can erase the memories.”Yet Gaza City still feels like home. Now, each morning, the family returns to\n  work. “We all try in our own ways, to contribute to our country and remain\n  active members of our community despite everything we’re living through.”undefinedAbuShammala and her sister walked through what was left of their\n  neighbourhood. The mosque and shop were gone; the Bar Association building was\n  badly damaged.“Every beautiful place I once knew has turned into ashes. The suffering hasn’t\n  ended. The wounds of this city are still open.”undefinedAbuShammala speaks of both hope and caution when looking to the future: “There’s a sense of relief, that the killing has stopped, the displacement has stopped, the destruction has stopped, and that there’s finally a chance to return home.“But at the same time, things are still very hard. Gaza needs a lot of time to recover, life hasn’t really come back yet. The pain and the scars are still there. There’s sadness despite everything. And Israel isn’t making things any easier, there’s always this fear that we’ll wake up one morning and the war will start again, that our home will be gone, that our dreams will be stolen once more.”Still determined to return to her career in international law, AbuShammala remembers the advice her mentor gave her when she first began: “The road to justice is long.”UN experts have concluded that Israel’s actions in Gazaamount to genocide– a charge Israel rejects.As those investigations unfold, AbuShammala’s life remains suspended, balancing daily survival and the struggle to rebuild with her hopes for education and a career beyond the war.AbuShammala is waiting for a border crossing to open so she can begin her master’s degree in Jordan – the path she set out on before the war.“Gaza is not just a place or walls for me,” she said. “It’s something alive inside me. Sometimes I wish we never woke up on October 7, that our lives hadn’t turned upside down like this. Or I wish I could forget everything that’s happened, as if I never lived through it.”For now, she remains in a broken city, with her family, trying to rebuild what’s left of their home.AbuShammala is currently writing a book about her experiences during the war.MethodologyThis project draws on multiple sources to trace where the AbuShammala family have lived over the past two years and how each neighbourhood has changed through the war.The Guardian was in regular contact with Nour and Khalil AbuShammala over a two-month period to document their story, gather imagery and verify events.Satellite imagery fromPlanetandVantorwas used to assess damage and movement across time. Images are dated within the piece and span periods before and during the conflict, with additional imagery used for verification.Reported damage was verified against satellite analysis, user-generated footage, news reports and official IDF updates. Footage provided by Nour was geolocated using identifiable landmarks and compared with satellite images. Using a combination of these visuals and archive pictures, the Guardian verified footage showing buildings before and after they were destroyed by Israeli strikes."

But all four grounds of his appeal were rejected by judges in their judgment handed down in a London court. They found that evidence presented by the commissioner to support his appeal was “a highly selective exercise”.After the unlawful detention finding last year that was upheld on Tuesday, the British government could face a bill of millions of pounds in damages for unlawfully detaining more than 60 people for such a long period.Diego Garcia, halfway between Tanzania and Indonesia, has beaches of white sand surrounded by turquoise seas and dense forests of coconut palms.But the conditions for the asylum seekers were less favourable. They were accommodated in rat-infested tents, largely deprived of their liberty.Map showing location of Diego Garcia in Indian OceanMargaret Obi, the acting judge of the BIOT supreme court, found last December that they had been unlawfully detained. In her ruling, she said: “It is unsurprising that the claimants feel as if they are in a prison; that is exactly what it is, in all but name.”The Leigh Day solicitor Tom Short, representing some of the Tamils, welcomed Tuesday’s ruling: “The BIOT court of appeal’s ruling today that the commissioner unlawfully detained our clients for over three years in a fenced and guarded camp in conditions that amounted to a prison, is full vindication of the judgment made earlier by Ms Justice Obi after a full trial on the island of Diego Garcia,” he said. “The court has found that the commissioner intended to confine our clients – including 16 children – in this way and that he had no justification for doing so. His attempt to rewrite history has failed.”Simon Robinson, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, also representing some of the clients, said: “We welcome the judgment of the court of appeal dismissing the commissioner’s appeal on all grounds. Their unlawful detention was at a cost of £108,000 a day to the UK taxpayer. The substantial damages which will now be owed, add to these costs. These costs escalated because of the egregious delay by the home secretary and foreign secretary in agreeing to end their detention and relocate them.”A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office,said: “The BIOT commissioner appealed the initial judgment on several grounds. Diego Garcia has never been a suitable location for migrants, and this was a highly unique situation where safety was carefully considered throughout.“It is now for the BIOT administration to study the judgment carefully, and to consider next steps. However, this is clearly not the outcome we wanted.”Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsImmigration and asylumRefugeesMigrationSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

State leaders have claimed it is being used to disenfranchise poor and minority voters – particularly Muslims – as “illegal immigrants” and manipulate the electoral roll to benefit the Modi government.The BJP openly embraces a Hindu nationalist ideology seeking to reshape India from a secular state into aHindurashtra,or Hindu nation. During the party’s 11 years in power, its policies and discourse have sharply polarised the nation along religious lines fuelling a surge in anti-Muslim hostility. The BJP has gained unprecedented power over state institutions and its ruling alliance governs 21 out of 28 states.In states such as West Bengal, critics have alleged that it is primarily Muslims facing the threat of being disenfranchised and deported by SIR, while Bangladeshi Hindus living illegally in India say they are being assured of citizenship.Speaking in parliament last week, Rahul Gandhi, a leader of Congress, India’s largest opposition party, alleged that SIR was part of a wider project by the BJP to conduct “votechori[theft]” and destroy the longstanding integrity of India’s democratic elections, which have been held since independence.“When you destroy the vote, you destroy the fabric of this country, you destroy modern India, you destroy the idea of India,” said Gandhi, who in recent months has claimed to have substantial evidence of foul play among the voting processes in multiple state elections, which has been repeatedly denied by the BJP.The opposition has alleged SIR is being used as a covert national register of citizens (NRC), similar to what took place in the north Indian state of Assam a few years ago. There, NRC led to hundreds of thousands, primarily Muslims, being rounded up and detained in detention centres or forced to face citizenship tribunals, with some deported to Bangladesh.The BJP has denied any irregularities in the SIR process, calling it a routine administrative exercise to “cleanse” the electoral roll of “infiltrators”, a term mostly referring to Muslims coming illegally from neighbouring Bangladesh.Responding to Gandhi in parliament, the home minister, Amit Shah, said the BJP was protecting India’s democracy with a policy of “detect, delete and deport”. “Can a country’s democracy be safe when the prime minister and chief minister are decided by illegal immigrants?” he added.The electoral commission (EC), the government body conducting the survey, has said SIR is a means to ensure that deceased, illegitimate and duplicate voters are removed from the voter register. However, in parliament Gandhi accused the EC of being controlled by the BJP and “colluding with those in power to shape elections”.SIR already provoked a significant backlash and a slew of legal challenges when it was carried out in Bihar, a state of 130 million people, earlier this year. More than 6.5 million people were removed from the voter list as a result. The EC had claimed it was because they were dead or had moved away, but many turned out to be alive, and it resulted in millions of complaints.Opposition parties alleged that many of those removed were Muslims or belonged to communities that do not form the vote bank of the Hindu nationalist BJP, while other names were added erroneously, a claim the EC has denied. In the Bihar state election that took place in November after the SIR process was completed, the BJP won by a historic landslide.View image in fullscreenBangladeshis, who have lived in India as illegal immigrants for years, gather at the Hakimpur border in West Bengal to return home.Photograph: Shaikh Azizur Rahman/The GuardianNowhere has SIR been more controversial than in West Bengal, the state neighbouring Bangladesh, which has a high number of Muslims.The ruling Trinamool Congress party (TMC) government, led by the chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, has described SIR as a “politically motivated” process to “capture West Bengal by trickery”. West Bengal is one of the few states where the BJP has so farfailed to gain political tractionbut state elections are due next year.Banerjee also alleged that the “shadow of fear and uncertainty” being created by SIR has led to panic and distress among the people, creating a widespread fear among the state’s Muslims that they will lose their citizenship. TMC has linked the stress of SIR to multiple deaths and suicides that have taken place in the state in recent weeks, and Banerjee wrote to the EC to intervene and halt the process.Among those left in extreme stress was Jahir Mal, who lived in a mud-walled, plastic-roofed shack in Khalisani, 25 miles (40km) west of Kolkata with his wife and children. After news of the electoral revision exercise spread, his family recounted how he began watching SIR-related videos on Facebook warning of mass expulsion and then stopped going to work and isolated himself from family and neighbours.An illiterate Muslim labourer, he feared that as he was not on the electoral list, he would immediately be deemed an illegal citizen by SIR – despite being born in India.“He kept asking, ‘What will I do if they send me to Bangladesh? I have no connection there’,” recounted his wife, Rejina. “I begged him to calm down and assured him nothing would happen … But he wouldn’t listen.“On November 4, the SIR officials were scheduled to arrive at 10am to check the documents. At 9am, when no one else was home, my husband took his life.” Now Rejina is left alone with their three young children, the family’s sole breadwinner gone. “I don’t know how we will survive. I am broken,” she said.The government has denied that the SIR discriminates against Muslims. But critics have pointed to inflammatory comments made by local BJP leaders such as Suvendu Adhikari, who said Hindus who fled persecution in Bangladesh were “welcome” and would receive citizenshipunder a controversial actpassed by the BJP in 2019, whereas Muslims from the same country were “infiltrators” whose names would be detected and deleted.Bangladeshi Hindus living in India without documents confirmed to the Guardian they had been given assurances by local BJP leaders that SIR would not result in them being detained or deported as infiltrators, despite their illegal status.Bikash Das, a Hindu from Bangladesh, said he had come to India 10 years ago, and despite not being an official citizen had managed to obtain an Indian ID and vote in the past two elections. He said SIR had initially caused him concern that he and his family would be deported. “Then, some local BJP leaders reassured us that we would definitely be granted Indian citizenship,” he said.The SIR process has also sparked anger and protest in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which have been ruled by opposition parties for decades and where the BJP has been attempting to make electoral inroads.In Tamil Nadu, the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party has formally opposed the exercise. In Kerala, the Communist party of India (Marxist)-led government passed a resolution against SIR, condemning it as a “citizenship survey” by the backdoor.Though it was due to be completed by early December, the SIR deadline for many states has been pushed back by several weeks. The final voter lists are due to be published in February 2026.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He had been living in sheltered accommodation inPeterboroughafter his release on licence in 2014, after serving 48 years in prison for the killings.The case shaped public debate on sentencing, parole and the protection of police officers.Roberts’ murders took place on 12 August 1966 in Shepherd’s Bush, west London. DS Christopher Head, 30, DC David Wombwell, 25, and PC Geoffrey Fox, 41, had stopped a van containing Roberts and his associates John Duddy and John Witney.The officers were carrying out a routine check when Roberts opened fire without warning, killing Wombwell at the scene and shooting Head in the back. Fox, who was seated in an unmarked police car, was shot through the windscreen.The brutality of the attack caused nationwide shock at a time when armed violence against police was exceptionally rare.The killings led to a 96-day search, one of the most extensive in British policing history. Roberts used his former military training to evade capture before he was eventually found sleeping rough in Hertfordshire. All three men were convicted at the Old Bailey.Capital punishment had been abolished the previous year, but the judge described the murders as “the most heinous crime for a generation or more” and imposed a life sentence with a minimum tariff of 30 years.Roberts became one of Britain’s most notorious inmates and was repeatedly refused parole amid concerns about his behaviour and associations. His eventual release in 2014 prompted anger within policing, and news of his death has renewed longstanding criticism.Matt Cane, general secretary of the Metropolitan police federation, said: “The three officers murdered by Roberts never got a chance to grow old. The life sentence for their loved ones still continues. Life should mean life if you murder a police officer in the course of their duties – Roberts should never have been freed.”Duddy and Witney both died years earlier. The case remains a defining reference point in discussions about sentencing, policing and public protection in the UK.Explore more on these topicsCrimePolicePeterboroughnewsShareReuse this content"

TheBBC reportedon Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.The agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. TheNew York Times first reportedBritish confirmation that negotiations had stalled.“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Tuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.The Trade Representative’s office said in apost on Twitter/Xthat these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.Thomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to theNew York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.The retaliation by the US follows a$140m fineslapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyUS politicsEuropean UnionKeir StarmerDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Previously, police have had no way of tracking the activities of known sex offenders online.Keir Starmer is preparing to announce on Thursday the full strategy to halve violence against women and girls in a decade,after facing criticism over delays in publishing it.Under new regulations, registered sex offenders would be required to inform the police if they open new social media and dating app accounts or if they move into a new job.The police can use that information to monitor and increase surveillance of predators who may be looking for opportunities to offend again. The changes will be made as secondary legislation to the Sexual Offences Act 2003.If the police consider an offender’s online activity puts them at a heightened risk of reoffending, officers can seek a sexual harm prevention order to restrict their internet activity including banning their social media and dating profiles.Under the new regulations, offenders will also be required to provide police with more personal information and preserve their internet history to prove to the police they are complying with restrictions.A new team of online officers, backed by nearly £2m in funding, was announced last week, that will be deployed to use covert and intelligence techniques to tackle online activity of sexual offenders and stalkers.Mahmood said: “For too long, these crimes have been considered a fact of life. That’s not good enough. The government will use the full power of the state to bear down on abusers, stopping them in their tracks. Rapists, sex offenders and abusers will have nowhere to hide.”Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence Against Women coalition, welcomed the move and called for current violence against women and girls guidance for tech platforms to be made mandatory “with strong consequences” for those breaking the rules in the government’s new strategy.“Online sexual abuse has long been minimised by the justice system and tech platforms, leaving victims let down and with nowhere to turn and perpetrators free to harm women without consequence,” she said.In a further development, changes to NHS services across England will be made in an effort to better support survivors of sexual violence and abuse.Referral services for victims will be introduced in every area of England by 2029 to connect them with specialist help through their GP.The initiative, called Steps to Safety, will also train GP staff to better deal with domestic abuse and sexual violence.Ministers have also announced up to £50m for survivors of child sexual abuse to receive specialist care.The £50m investment to help child victims will be used to expand a “child house” model which hosts all care, therapeutic support and advocacy in one place, where children need to share their experiences only once and are supported by trained staff who understand trauma.Currently there is one child house, in north London, but this will be expanded to every NHS region in England.Measures previously announced as part of the cross-government strategy have included introducing specialist rape and sexual offences investigators to every police force and a £19m funding boost for councils to provide safe housing for domestic abuse survivors.Survivor organisationssubmitted a super-complaint against police forceson Monday over “inhumane” delays to investigating sexual offences, as research showed the rising number of investigations taking more than three years.Explore more on these topicsPoliceOnline abuseRape and sexual assaultShabana MahmoodInternet safetySexual harassmentKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood that the corporation is likely to argue that it did not have the rights to air the documentary in the US, and that the case should therefore be dismissed.The move is an attempt to see the lawsuit off before litigation costs mount. It will be greeted with relief by supporters of the BBC who have argued that its editorial independence would be called into question if it sought to settle.The Panorama programme, Trump: A Second Chance?, was broadcast before the 2024 US presidential election. It spliced together two parts of the January 6 speech he gave before the attack on the US Capitol that day.Trump’s complaint argues both that the programme defamed him and that it violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. It says the broadcast caused Trump “massive economic damage to his brand value and significant damage and injury to his future financial prospects”.The BBC will note that audiences in the US were unable to access the show via iPlayer, the BBC’s streaming platform.The corporation is also arguing that Trump could not have suffered serious reputational harm from the programme because he won the presidential election. In Florida, Trump actually increased his vote share from his previous campaigns.The lawsuit alleges that Florida residents may have been able to watch the programme using a virtual private network (VPN) or via the international streaming service, BritBox. The BBC has not responded directly to those claims.The BBC board and lawyers are still working closely on the issue. The BBC’s legal department is guiding the discussions, but the board, together with the BBC chair, Samir Shah, are understood to be closely involved.The suit also claims the documentary was distributed in the US through a company called Blue Ant Media Corporation. The company is not a defendant in the case.However, a spokesperson for Blue Ant Media said none of its buyers had aired the Panorama episode in the US, while the version it was distributing did not include the infamous edit, which had been cut out to make the programme shorter.The timing could scarcely be worse for the BBC, as it searches for a new director general. It comes after the resignation ofcurrent director general Tim Davie and head of BBC News, Deborah Turness, following the fallout from the Panorama edit.It also comes with the government officially launching the process of renewing the BBC’s charter, which will see it fundamentally re-examine whether the corporation should be part-funded by advertising or subscriptions.The spliced clips in the edition of Panoramasuggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.Shah has already personally apologised to Trump and the BBC has said it gave “the mistaken impression” that the president had “made a direct call for violent action”. However, its lawyers have argued it did not defame him.While there were no complaints about the documentary at the time it was broadcast, the edit came to light in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the BBC. His memo was sent to the BBC board earlier this year and subsequently leaked to the Daily Telegraph.At one point, Trump’s lawsuit cites former prime minister Liz Truss in support of its allegation that the BBC is “institutionally biased against President Trump”.“No less an authority than the United Kingdom’s former prime minister, Liz Truss, discussed this bias, the need to hold the BBC accountable, and the BBC’s pattern of actual malice,” it states.Keir Starmer has come under pressure to back up the BBC. Both the shadow culture secretary, Nigel Huddleston, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, urged the prime minister to use his relationship with Trump to persuade him not to pursue the legal action.Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, said it was “right that the BBC stand firm” against Trump’s claims of defamation and that he hoped “they will continue to do so”.Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally who founded the Newsmax platform, said it would prove cheaper for the BBC to settle the case.However, figures close to the BBC have urged it to fight the legal action. Former BBC Radio controller Mark Damazer said it would be “extremely damaging” to the BBC’s reputation to offer a settlement.Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer at the firm Howard Kennedy, said he believed the claim was “meritless”, but that Trump was seeking political, rather than financial, gain.“[The BBC] will plead substantial truth, no damage to [Trump’s] reputation – but it will also, at that time, file the motions to dismiss [the lawsuit],” he predicted. “There are lots of legal defects in the complaint.”Explore more on these topicsBBCDonald TrumpFloridaFactual TVTelevision industryDocumentarynewsShareReuse this content"

In the video, a masked individual wearing a black beanie, green jacket, and black gloves walks in the residential neighborhood by Brown’s campus.In Tuesday’s press conference, Providence police chief Oscar L Perez said the video shows the individual “casing the area”.“That’s what criminals do prior to committing a crime,” Perez said.The manhunt for the shooter has been going on since Saturday, when a person dressed in blackkilled at least two people and wounded nine others at Brownduring final exams. A person of interest was detained then released on Sunday, and FBI director Kash Patelhas faced criticismfor prematurely declaring the case solved.At the press conference, Perez confirmed that the investigation was ongoing as hundreds of tips have come in: “We have been receiving hundreds of tips. However, we’re about close to 200 actionable tips that we’re still conducting investigations on, which is incredible and is important.”Perez also said that police are asking for video footage from any type of camera footage from residents near Waterman Avenue and Hope Street in Providence. He noted that such footage – potentially from equipped vehicles such as Teslas – going as far back as “at least a week” could be helpful in their search.Rhode Island attorney general Peter Neronha also said during the conference that he believes the investigation is “going really well” and that locals “should take confidence” in law enforcement and prosecutors on the case who are “veterans of what they do”.“They’re smart, they’re professional and they’re getting the resources from the mayor and the governor that they need, the state police as well, to get this job done and I’m confident they are going to be able to do that. Just need a little bit of patience,” Neronha said.Brown president Christina Paxson also spoke on Tuesday and emphasized that the university “is deeply committed to the safety and security and well-being of our community, and I’ve been deeply saddened to see people questioning that.”“We understand that as time goes on, there is maybe a natural instinct to assign responsibility for a tragic event like this,” she said. “Anxiety and fear is very natural, but the shooter is responsible.”The FBI is offering a$50,000 rewardfor information on the shooter.Explore more on these topicsBrown University shootingRhode IslandnewsShareReuse this content"

Federal government jobs declined by 162,000 in October, and 6,000 in November.Chart of US jobsThe latest jobs numbers arrive against a tumultuous background for the US’s economic data, once regarded as the gold standard in government data.The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)announcedthat full October jobs data would not be released and November’s jobs data was delayed due to the 43-day federal government shutdown. Questions have also been raised about its accuracy.Federal Reserve chairJerome Powellwarned last week that the data from the BLS should be treated with a “skeptical eye” while the hangover left from the shutdown works through the system.There are signs that the US’s job market is weakening. ADPreportedUS private sector employers shed about 32,000 jobs in November after adding 47,000 jobs in October.TheSeptember jobs report, released late in November due to the federal government shutdown, stated the US added 119,000 jobs, higher than economist predictions. Unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, its highest level since 2021.US added 119,000 jobs in September in report delayed by federal shutdownRead morePowell cautioned last week that jobs figures are likely worse than the numbers that have been reported and that Trump’s immigration policies have hurt labor supply, which has kept the unemployment rate relatively flat.His comments came after the Fedannouncedit was cutting interest rates by a quarter point, a move toward “risk management” over concerns of a weakening labor market.“Labor supply has also come down quite sharply. So, you know, if you had a world where there is just no growth in workers and you really don’t need a lot of jobs to have full employment, some people argue that is what we are looking at,” said Powell. “So, there is an overcount in the payroll job numbers, we think, continuing, and it will be corrected. I don’t have an exact month in my head right now. Again, I think forecasters generally understand that. We think it is about 60,000 a month, so 40,000 jobs could be negative 20, but that could be wrong by 10 or 20 in either direction.”Powell also cautioned about the veracity of the jobs report data due to the lack of data collection in October and early November due to the government shutdown.“We are going to get data, but we are going to have to look at it carefully and a somewhat skeptical eye by the January meeting,” added Powell.Economists suggested on Tuesday that the latest jobs report was unlikely to persuade policymakers on the Fed’s open market committee to ease monetary policy, and cut rates, at its next meeting.“The labor market remains weak, but the pace of deterioration probably is too slow to spur the FOMC to ease again in January,” said Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.The BLS has been under attack from the Trump administration. In August, TrumpfiredBLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer, hours after the July jobs report was published. Trump claimed, without evidence, the report was “rigged” to make him look bad.His nominee to replace McEntarfer, EJ Antoni, waswithdrawnin late September after bipartisan criticism over his lack of qualifications. The BLS was shut down, furloughing staff, during the 43-day shutdown of the federal government and a new nominee to lead the agency has yet to be made.The lack of leadership at the agency comes as the number of staff at the agency has shrunk under theTrump administration. The agencylost 20%of staff from fiscal year 2024, 2,058 total employees, to proposed staff levels for fiscal year 2026, 1,851 total employees.Explore more on these topicsUS economyJerome PowellTrump administrationUS politicsFederal ReserveUS unemployment and employment statisticsEmploymentnewsShareReuse this content"

We fight like hell.”The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. It has previously acknowledged the editing was an “error of judgment” and apologized to Trump, but insisted there was no legal basis for a defamationclaim.Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, and Deborah Turness, the head of BBC News,resigned over the affairlast month. They announced their departures at the height of a crisis sparked by allegations of “serious and systemic problems” in the BBC’s coverage of issues including Trump, Gaza and trans issues.The claims were leveled by Michael Prescott, a PR executive and former independent external adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee (EGSC), in a memo sent to the broadcaster’s board, and eventually leaked to the Daily Telegraph.Trump has long tried to used legal threats and lawsuits to pressure news companies that produce coverage he does not like. His lawsuit against the BBCtakes this campaign global.Itwas filed at the US district court for the southern district of Florida – even though BBC iPlayer, the main streaming platform that carries Panorama, and BBC One, the main TV channel that broadcasts it, are not available in the US. The episode never aired in the US.‘Not for the faint-hearted’: is running the BBC an impossible job?Read moreA spokesperson for Trump’s legal team neverthelessclaimed the edits of his speech, which were aired a week before the 2024 presidential election, amounted to a “brazen attempt” to interfere in the contest.“The BBC has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda,” the spokesperson said. “President Trump’s powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference just as he has held other fake news mainstream media responsible for their wrongdoing.”The Florida court has jurisdiction over this case, Trump’s lawsuit argued, because the BBC is “engaged in substantial and not isolated business activities” in the state. It pointed to the BBC’s website and BritBox, a streaming platform it operates in several markets including the US.Trump had teased the lawsuit earlier on Monday, telling reporters at the Oval Office: “In a little while, you’ll be seeing I’m suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth. Literally, they put words in my mouth. They had me saying things that I never said coming out.”View image in fullscreenThe BBC’s director general and head of news resigned following accusations of bias at the British broadcaster, including in the way it edited Donald Trump’s speech.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersSince his re-election last November, Trump has scored several high-profile legal wins against big media firms in the US. ABC, owned by Disney,agreed to pay $15mas part of a settlement over a defamation lawsuit he brought following comments made by the anchor George Stephanopoulos.In July, Trump alsoreached a $16m settlementwith Paramount, parent of CBS News, over what he claimed was false editing of a pre-election interview with the Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris.While many legal experts viewed the case as easily winnable for Paramount, company leadership viewed it as a distraction – particularly as it sought federal government approval for amerger with Skydance Media.In Trump’s complaint against the BBC, his legal team writes: “The BBC, faced with overwhelming and justifiable outrage on both sides of the Atlantic, has publicly admitted its staggering breach of journalistic ethics, and apologized, but has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses.“Accordingly, President Trump brings this action for compensatory and punitive damages for the extensive reputational harm inflicted upon him by the defendants.”BBC has shown ‘leak and launch’ tactics work to destabilise it, ex-board member saysRead moreTrump has repeatedly denied responsibility for the insurrection in January 2021, which was aimed at blocking Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s win over Trump in the 2020 US presidential election.Following his return to office earlier this year, Trumppardoned hundreds of peoplewho had been involved in the attack, including some convicted of violent acts.On Monday, press freedom campaigners urged the BBC to stand strong and “fight back”.“You don’t get to call out any alleged journalistic blunder and demand $10bn,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press foundation, said. “It’s preposterous for Trump to claim those damages when he won the 2024 election and hasn’t lost a penny because of the BBC’s editing.“It’s also absurd for him to claim associating him with January 6 is defamatory after he spent years insisting nothing bad happened that day and then pardoned those involved. And it’s similarly outrageous that his claims are based on supposedly damaging implications of his using the word ‘fight’. He sells T-shirts with that word on them.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpBBCUS politicsPress freedomnewsShareReuse this content"

It is expected to publicly respond, and advise shareholders on whether to accept or reject the bid, in the coming days.A press release announcing Paramount’s hostile bid last week said the offer would be backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital, a private equity firm.

He has previously been seen as closely allied with Larry Ellison, one of the world’s richest men, and father of David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance.Trump has expressed frustration in recent weeks over his treatment by CBS News, which is owned by Paramount, and its 60 Minutes show.“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called “takeover,” than they have ever treated me before,” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday. “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”Explore more on these topicsMediaParamount PicturesWarner BrosJared KushnerMergers and acquisitionsShareReuse this content"

She’s dominating each race and winning by large margins, too.The American skiing standout claimed a record-extending 105th World Cup victory after several of her top challengers went out during the opening run of a night race Tuesday.Shiffrin added to her first-run lead and finished 1.55 seconds ahead of Swiss skier Camille Rast and 1.71 ahead of German racer Emma Aicher.Shiffrin has now won the opening four slaloms of the season – and five straight including the final race of last season.Lindsey Vonn continues remarkable comeback with World Cup ski victory at 41Read moreAll of her margins of victory this season have topped a full second – and three of them more than 1.5 seconds: 1.66 in Levi, Finland; 1.23 in Gurgl, Austria; and 1.57 in Copper Mountain, Colorado before her latest performance in the French Alps.Rivals scrambling to catch Shiffrin ran into difficulty.Lena Duerr, the German who stood third after the first run, went off course early in her second trip down.Lara Colturi, the Italian-born skier who races for Albania, straddled a gate toward the end of her opening run – ending a streak of three consecutive slalom podiums.Wendy Holdener managed a seventh-place finish despite a mishap at the end of her first run.Holdener hit a hole in the finish area, got flipped up into the air and landed on her back. After grimacing in pain for a few moments, she got up and walked away. It wasn’t immediately clear if she was injured but she competed in the second run.Defending World Cup slalom champion Zrinka Ljutic and Olympic silver medalist Katharina Liensberger, the next two starters, went out midway down.It’s the third straight slalom that Ljutic has failed to finish.Katharina Truppe of Austria finished fourth and American skier Paula Moltzan moved up from ninth to fifth with the fastest second run.Shiffrin earned her 68th World Cup slalom win. She also won gold in slalom at the 2014 Sochi Olympics – then took gold in giant slalom four years later at the Pyeongchang Games. Shiffrin didn’t medal at the 2022 Beijing Games.Women’s Alpine skiing at the winter Olympics will be held in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy – where Shiffrin won four medals in her four events at the 2021 world championships and where Lindsey Vonn holds the record of 12 World Cup victories.Vonn, who won a downhill last week at age 41, no longer competes in slalom.

The sweeping travel ban already includes two countries who will participate in the World Cup: Haiti and Iran, both of whom are subject to the most stringent restrictions.In the cases of Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the reasoning provided by the White House for imposing the bans are visa overstay rates. For B1 or B2 visitor visas of the type travelling fans would need to enter the country for the World Cup, the overstay rates listed are about 4% for Senegal and 8% for Côte d’Ivoire, according to the Department of Homeland Security.Fifa announces limited amount of $60 tickets for 2026 World Cup after fan furyRead moreWhile some fans may face restrictions when trying to enter the US, the proclamation specifically cited athletes as one category of people, along with diplomats and “individuals whose entry serves U.S. national interests,” who will be exempt from the ban.The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada, and will kick-off on 11 June. Côte d’Ivoire were drawn in to Group E, where they’ll play Germany, Curaçao, and Ecuador. Senegal have been drawn in Group I of the tournament, along with France, Norway and a European playoff team to be determined. Senegal will also be one of the United States men’s national team’s final opponents in tune-up friendlies before the World Cup. The teams will play that match on 31 May in Charlotte, North Carolina – the second-to-last game before the United States’ World Cup opener against Paraguay.The Trump administration’s World Cup taskforce, chaired by Andrew Giuliani,unveiled a fast-track visa systemfor World Cup visitors earlier in December. The Fifa prioritized appointment scheduling system will push World Cup ticket-holders to the front of the line for visa interviews. However, it is not yet known how that system will handle requests from the countries affected by the travel ban.Next year’s edition of the World Cup has faced numerous controversies, relating not only to the Trump administration’s immigration policy and enforcement but also to Fifa’s running of the tournament. Most recently, the governing body of soccer came under fire for the exorbitant ticket prices charged for games thanks to dynamic pricing.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaSenegal football teamCôte d’Ivoire football teamWorld CupFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The new pricing tier, called the entry tier, will comprise 10% of that 8% allotment, or 1.6% of all available tickets taking into account both sets of supporters. Given the size of most 2026 World Cup stadiums, that amounts to a little over 1,000 tickets per match available at that price point, split evenly between supporters of both teams.Welcome to the 2026 World Cup shakedown! The price of a ticket: the integrity of the game | Marina HydeRead moreFifa said in its announcement that, like the rest of the 8% of tickets available to team supporters, the distribution of these tickets will be handled by each member association (for example: The FA in England or the US Soccer Federation in the United States).Fifaadded that the associations are “requested to ensure that these tickets are specifically allocated to loyal fans who are closely connected to their national teams,” but offered no specifics.On Tuesday night the British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, urged Fifa to go further in lowering the tickets costs after the introduction of the $60 tickets. “I welcome Fifa’s announcement of some lower priced supporters tickets,” he said in a statement. “But as someone who used to save up for England tickets, I encourage Fifa to do more to make tickets more affordable so that the World Cup doesn’t lose touch with the genuine supporters who make the game so special.”The ticket prices for next year’s showpiece event, co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, have come under fire from all sides since first going on sale. Though Fifa set a $60 price floor for the cheapest tickets to group stage matches, their use of dynamic pricing has driven prices for those matches and those in the knockout round well into the high hundreds and often thousands. The pricing practice – common in North America for sports and concerts – is expected to help deliver record revenues to Fifa off the back of an expanded tournament, the first to feature 48 teams. The ticket allocation for supporters available through football associations have been similarly priced to those available to the general public, though now with the exception of the newly-announced entry tier.Critics of Fifa’s ticketing policy have includedFootball Supporters Europe, who called the latest pricing update a “monumental betrayal” and “extortionate” in a statement earlier this month. New York City mayor-electZohran Mamdani also took exception, calling the prices an “affront to the game” in an interview with the Guardian and launching a petition to Fifa as an extension to his ultimately successful campaign to run New York City.Fifa officials have at various points defended dynamic pricing as something that is natural and expected in the North American market, while also pointing to the benefits increased revenue will bring to its member associations. Fifa said in its release that it had received over 20m requests for tickets, including 5m in the first 24 hours, of the latest sales phase for the World Cup, which began on 11 December and runs until 13 January.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaFootball ticket pricesWorld CupFootball politicsShareReuse this content"

So it’s tough for me to want to be happy, or any of that, but obviously it’s a success,” said Flagg, who had a bag of ice on his ankle after rolling it at the end of regulation.Flagg also became just the fifth rookie to record 40 points, five rebounds and five assists in the last 15 years as he finished with seven board and six assists.As Sudan burns, the NBA’s embrace of the UAE shows how sport enables atrocityRead more“The more time he spends on the floor, the more he sees, the better he gets. He displayed it all tonight,” Dallas coach Jason Kidd said.Flagg has been playing his best basketball the past few weeks as the No 1 overall draft pick has averaged 25.7 points in the last seven games. He’s also playing aggressive enough to get to the line and went 15 for 20 against Utah.“It’s come a long way from the start of the season, so I’m proud of that fourth quarter,” Flagg said. “It’s a new game … but I am getting more and more comfortable … and just settling in, honestly, just being myself and letting the game come to me.”He scored 12 points in the fourth quarter and made a savvy play to get the game into overtime when he missed a free throw on purpose with such a big carom that teammate Max Christie got the rebound with 3.9 seconds remaining and was fouled.With Anthony Davis out and Dallas missing several other teammates to injuries, this game may be a harbinger of things to come as Flagg becomes the centerpiece of the Mavericks’ offense.“We were going to Coop. He was killing them the whole game, so they finally tried to double him.” PJ Washington said. “It doesn’t surprise me at all. I know exactly what he’s capable of. He’s a special player so there will be a lot more to come.”A Hollywood ending?

But he couldn’t stop thinking of what he could have done to get the win despite the throbbing ankle. The Jazz made a late 11-0 run and then dominated in overtime as Flagg didn’t score a basket in the extra period.“I gotta be better. I had a couple of dumb turnovers, missed a couple easy ones, but I gotta be better, executing down the stretch like that,” Flagg said.Setting records might be nice but Flagg feels it just means he’s consistently improving and that’s been his goal all season.“I’m not really focused on a lot of that stuff (the records). I’m more just focused on being present, day to day, and trying to get better and getting our team as many wins as we can,” Flagg saidExplore more on these topicsNBADallas MavericksCooper FlaggBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Here is alink to the videoinstead.Footage shows Paul Doyle drive through hundreds of fans before ploughing into crowd – videoFootage from Doyle’s two-tonne Ford Galaxy showed him accelerating aggressively towards crowds, hitting 134 people in only two minutes. Some suffered life-changing injuries and many were left traumatised – including a survivor of the Manchester Arena attack and a woman who fled the war in Ukraine.Doyle, from Croxteth in Liverpool, told police he acted in a “blind panic” and claimed he feared for his life after seeing a fan with a knife. This was disproved by detectives. He pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial last month to 31 offences against 21 adults and eight children.1:01'Truly shocking': judge sentences Paul Doyle for Liverpool FC parade attack – videoSentencing Doyle to 21 years and six months in prison, Menary said: “You struck people head on, knocked others on to the bonnet, crushed prams and forced others to scatter in terror. You ploughed on at speed, violently knocking people aside or running over them, person after person after person.”Menary said dashcam footage from Doyle’s vehicle showed he was not acting in fear or panic, as he claimed, but out of “an inexplicable and undiluted fury”.His “disregard for human life defies ordinary understanding,” Menary said, adding: “It is almost impossible to comprehend how any right thinking person could act as you did.”There was no reaction from the defendant, who had sobbed for much of the two-day hearing, as he was taken to the court cells by prison officers.It can now be revealed that Doyle had a string of convictions in the early 1990s – including one for biting off a man’s ear in a pub brawl – but that he had not been in trouble with the police for 30 years until he was arrested at the parade.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Footage shows Paul Doyle driving dangerously before reaching city centre – videoA former Royal Marine who served alongside Doyletold the Guardianhe was well known at the time for his explosive outbursts. “It was like he was on a tripwire,” the former marine said. “Everyone would say: ‘He’s got a horrendous flash to bang’ – meaning the point you get annoyed to the point you’re punching people is zero time.”Doyle could be heard on dashcam videoshouting “fuck’s sake move! Get out my fucking way!” before ploughing into screaming fans. A police officer described the noise as “sickening”.As bodies lay on the ground, Doyle’s rampage wasbrought to a haltby a former soldier, Dan Barr, who climbed into a rear passenger seat and held the car’s gear selector in “park”. Even then, Doyle kept his foot on the accelerator, the court heard.When Doyle was dragged into a police van through a swarm of angry fans, he told officers: “I’ve just ruined my family’s life.”The court heard on Tuesday that those struck by Doyle’s car were aged from six months to 77 years.Francesca Massey, 24, said the parade had “reopened emotional wounds” and brought back vivid memories of being caught up in the Manchester Arena terror attack in 2017: “The same overwhelming fear, the moment of stillness before chaos and the desperate rush to escape with the crowd of innocent people around me.”She added: “This is something I felt I had overcome over the past eight years, and now I feel like I have been set back again, as it reawakened previous trauma.”Simon Csoka KC, defending, said Doyle was “horrified by what he did”: “He’s remorseful, ashamed and deeply sorry for all those who were hurt and suffered. He accepts all responsibility, he expects no sympathy.”Csoka said Doyle had been described by friends as “kind, generous and selfless” and they found his actions “incomprehensible and so utterly unlike the man that they know”.But Menary said the offending warranted one of the severest sentences he could impose, adding: “What should have been a day of communal celebration has instead left a lasting legacy of fear, injury and loss across this community.“The overall harm is exceptional, not only in the sheer number of victims and the seriousness of their injuries, but also in the depth, duration and human reach of the trauma you inflicted.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Joshua, Netflix and the sport itself should know betterTue 16 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTSharePrecisely 85 years ago, one of the most fearsome heavyweight boxers in history stunk out the joint. Joe Louis was in the midst of his “Bum of the Month club”: a staggering run of 13 world title defences in 29 months against an assortment of stiffs, wild men and colourful characters. And when he arrived in Boston on 16 December 1940, most believed that Al McCoy would rapidly become his next victim. Only it didn’t quite turn out that way.“McCoy was expected to crumple under the first punch Louis tossed in his direction,” the New York Times’ correspondent wrote. “Instead, the wily New England veteran made Louis appear ludicrous at times. Adopting a crouching, bobbing, weaving style, McCoy was an elusive target for the paralysing fists of the titleholder.” After the messy contest was stopped at the end of the fifth, a storm of jeers rang out. Louis had won, but only his bank balance had been enhanced.View image in fullscreenJoe Louis (left) takes on Al McCoy in 1940.Which brings us to the freak show taking place further along the eastern seaboard this Friday, when the former heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medallistAnthony Joshua faces the influencer turned boxer Jake Paulin Miami. Let us be blunt: this fight makes Louis v McCoy look like the Rumble in the Jungle. Whatever happens, it will degrade Joshua’s reputation – and damage that of his sport.How can it not, given that Paul is a 13-fight novice, who has only boxed above the cruiserweight limit (14st 4lb) once and looked ploddy and mechanical inbeating a 58-year-old Mike Tyson? While Joshua, for all he is on the slide, still has a sledgehammer right and a pedigree honed across 13 world title contests.Throw in the fact that Joshua is likely to come into the ring around three stone heavier, and it is staggering that any governing body would sanction it.If we believe the promises of Joshua, and his promoter Eddie Hearn, that the fight won’t be “managed” to take it easy on his opponent, the best we can hope for is that Paul does not get seriously hurt.But really Joshua, as well as Netflix, should know better. And so should the sport.Because when it comes to boxing, there is an unspoken social contract at play. We know the risks. If anything, they are even starker given the recent research on the dangers of subconcussive impacts on the brain. Yet those dangers are partly offset by the discipline and societal benefits boxing instils, especially in more disadvantaged areas.This fight rips that contract up into thousands of pieces. And then spits on it.‘It’s not normal to walk into the tornado’: To fans, there was only one Ricky Hatton. Those who loved him knew manyRead moreSome will say that Paul should be lauded for bringing a new audience to boxing, not just with his trash-talking but by being a little out of the box. Perhaps. But history teaches us that there really is nothing new under the sun.One of Louis’s opponents, “Two Ton” Tony Galento, who stood at just 5ft 8in but weighed well over 16 stone, fought a bear and a kangaroo to promote his fights, and told journalists that he was going to “moider the bum” before their meeting. All of which makes Paul’s antics look rather mild.“He was a saloon keeper, and from the looks of him, he must have had a drink with every customer,” wrote Louis, who was hurt in the first and put down in the third, before pummelling his opponent in the fourth.It probably didn’t help his performances that the married Louis was spending large parts of this period womanising. “It was a bad period. I was going through something like what happens to an alcoholic when he falls off the wagon,” he later wrote in his autobiography. “I got drunk with all those beautiful, exciting women.”Another opponent, the Chilean Arturo Godoy, give Louis a full-throated kiss on the lips after their first fight was settled narrowly in the American’s favour. “It was my worstest fight ever,” Louis admitted in the ring afterwards. “I ain’t never had no grown-up man kiss me on my mouth before.”View image in fullscreenJoe Louis dukes it out with Arturo Godoy in February 1940.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveAnd then there was Lou Nova, who claimed to have developed a secret weapon, a “cosmic punch” from his yoga trainer, before he fought Louis. Add in the fact that Nova was a vegetarian and, by 1941 standards, he was seriously out there.“I thought, what the hell is a cosmic punch and what the hell is yoga?” Louis said later. “When the press asked me, I told them I didn’t care about his cosmic punch; I was just going to give him my regular right over a left hook and knock him out. I didn’t like all the mysterious shit he was talking about.”There is nothing mysterious about Friday’s fight, of course. Both Joshua and Paul have signed up because they will take home about £70m each. Netflix, meanwhile, believes it can top the 65 million concurrent streams it got for Paul v Tyson – a record – and further boost subscribers.View image in fullscreenMike Tyson punches Jake Paul during their heavyweight bout in 2024.

The truth is that Paul would get nowhere near any of the 13 members of the Bum of the Month Club. And he should be nowhere near a ring with Joshua, either.Incidentally, Louis insisted that he didn’t care about the dismissive name given to his long line of victims – or the criticisms he received. “A friend of mine told me that Alexander the Great started crying when he had no more worlds to conquer,” he wrote. “I wasn’t gonna cry. I had to make some money … but those guys I fought were not bums.”It is hard to argue with any of that, especially given that Louis also had the taxman chasing after him.

The 42-year-old looked right at home with the lights on and temperatures in the teens during a night that felt like a callback to his prime in Green Bay.While those days are long gone, Rodgers is playing meaningful football in December, which is all he really wanted when he decided in June to return for a 21st season.

The Steelers sacked Tagovailoa four times, and Asante Samuel Jr picked him off to end a promising first-quarter Miami drive.Tagovailoa remained winless in games where the temperature at kickoff was under 40 degrees. Miami had minus-20 yards of total offense in the third quarter.The Dolphins’ improved play of late solidified – temporarily, anyway – coach Mike McDaniel’s status. With the playoffs now out of reach, Miami will turn its attention to the future, one that might not include the bespectacled 42-year-old whose idiosyncratic approach may be wearing thin.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsPittsburgh SteelersAaron RodgersnewsShareReuse this content"

This award is actually for players and staff. We’ve shown so much conviction, belief and togetherness that led us to our second Euro win. Moving into 2026, let’s keep pushing the women’s game forward together.”Four Lionesses – Hannah Hampton, Lucy Bronze, Leah Williamson and Alessia Russo – were named in a best women’s XI that was otherwise made up of Spain internationals: the Arsenal midfielder Mariona Caldentey and six Barcelona players.The men’s best XI included England’s Jude Bellingham and Cole Palmer – who starred at the Club World Cup – in a team otherwise dominated by PSG and Barcelona players. Manchester City’s Gianluigi Donnarumma was named as the goalkeeper but the timeframe for these awards took into account performances between 11 August 2024 and 2 August 2025, when Donnarumma was playing for PSG.

Hampton thanked those who had voted for her, before namechecking her coaches: “To Sarina [Wiegman] and to Sonia [Bompastor] for the belief in me this year. Both at club and country, we’ve achieved so much and there’s still so much set out for us to go and get.”Donnarumma took the men’s prize after lifting the Champions League for the first time at the end of a campaign in which PSG won a domestic treble. “It was an incredible year, one that will live long in my memory, and it’s touching to be recognised for my role in the success achieved over that period,” Donnarumma said.Lizbeth Ovalle won the Marta award, for the most popular goal scored in women’s football in 2025, named after the Brazil legend Marta, who was also nominated.

The pair exhibited cheesy smiles as João Pedro played ­photographer, pretending to capture their celebration.Then, with 15 minutes remaining, the hosts equalised through David Turnbull’s brilliant diving header, detonating the kind of noise not heard in these parts for a long time, and another awkward 48 hours were on the cards for Enzo Maresca.Cardiff City v Chelsea: Carabao Cup quarter-final – liveRead moreQuestions would surely have been asked of him by the Chelsea hierarchy had the League One leaders reached the Carabao Cup semi-finals at their expense. Fortunately for Maresca, Pedro Neto struck a late goal, with Garnacho adding his second at the death to spare any embarrassment, even if Chelsea did make wholesale changes fromthe win against Evertonon Saturday. It was after that game that Maresca’s cryptic comments sparked doubts about his future.Progressing to a third semi‑final in 18 months, another line Maresca has been at pains to repeat in recent days, seemingly could not solve ­everything in the Welsh capital. The Italian was stony-faced as he reviewed his side’s performance, insisting his demeanour was owing to the three-hour coach journey home to Cobham, Chelsea’s training ground. “I will watch two Newcastle games,” Maresca said. “There is no time. Time is for the players. For us as a staff, we’re going to be focused on the next one, that is Newcastle [on Saturday] so we’re going to prepare.”Asked if he had spoken with his bosses since his surprise remarks, Maresca replied: “No, as I said yes­terday [Monday], the day after ­Everton, I started to prepare for ­Cardiff, focus on Cardiff. Now I just said on the bus, I will watch ­Newcastle and I didn’t speak with one.”Chelsea’s supporters sang ­Maresca’s name during second‑half stoppage time and again as he and his squad went to applaud their fans. Was it a boost to hear that backing? “Absolutely,” he said. “It was a great moment, [one] I appreciate, [I am] always thankful. They have always been there, knowing that any support in the world when you don’t win, they are not happy. When you don’t win games, they have been not happy, but it’s normal. But overall, the fans have always been there.“These are the kind of games that I fall in love even more with the ­players because you cannot imagine how easy it is to slip, to slide, because they are tricky games. Every season there are teams that lose against League Two or League One teams. So you need to pay attention, to do the right things.”View image in fullscreenAlejandro Garnacho jumps on Pedro Neto after Chelsea’s second goal.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersCardiff were determined to savour the occasion, this stadium a sellout for a club match for the first time since April 2019, whenLiverpool visited in the Premier League, and Neil Warnock was in the home dugout. These days it is Brian Barry-Murphy, by his own admission a Pep ­Guardiola obsessive. Barry-Murphy, like Maresca, is also a Guardiola protege of sorts; the trio worked together at Manchester City when Barry-Murphy was in charge of their development squad, succeeding Maresca in the role.Moisés Caicedo captained a youthful Chelsea side that featured four teenagers, while Tosin ­Adarabioyo was the only player over the age of 24 in their starting lineup. Maresca was seemingly not overly enamoured with his side’s anaemic first‑half ­performance and introduced ­Garnacho and João Pedro in place of Tyrique George and Marc Guiu.Buonanotte, who Barry-Murphy worked with at Leicester, laid on the opener after intercepting a rare lapse by Cardiff’s teenage ­centre‑back Dylan Lawlor. ­Buonanotte spied Garnacho to his left and the ­Argentinian picked his spot in the far corner, sending a neat first‑time strike past Nathan Trott in the Cardiff goal. A few minutes later Buonanotte, now in the groove, sent a delicious shot at goal that forced a fingertip save from Trott.Cardiff were drained but only momentarily, rebooting to equalise and spark extraordinary scenes. Perry Ng sent a wonderful cross into the box from the right and Turnbull flung himself at the ball, heading past a hapless Filip Jörgensen in the Chelsea goal. Fans in the Canton Stand, who watched it all the way behind Jörgensen’s goal, went ballistic.With penalties looming, João Pedro shifted the ball to Andrey Santos, who moved it on to Neto to dispatch a low diagonal strike into the far corner, via a deflection off the Cardiff defender Joel Bagan. Relief for Maresca and Chelsea was underlined by Garnacho’s deft finish to seal the win in stoppage time. “It is probably the hope that kills you,” ­Barry-Murphy said afterwards. “There is a natural feeling of disappointment because I thought for a brief spell we could get the winner or go to penalties.”Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupCardiff CityChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the more recent window the Saudi Arabian club Al‑Hilaloffered United £100mand the player a £700,000-a-week salary.Football Daily | Thud and blunder: Amorim’s system dissolves into the Old Trafford chaosRead moreFernandes did not name specific members of United’s hierarchy. Jason Wilcox is the football director, Omar Berrada is the chief executive, and Sir Jim Ratcliffe leads football policy.In an interview with Canal 11, a Portuguese Football Federation‑owned channel, Fernandes was asked whether there had been an offer from Paris Saint-Germain or Real Madrid. In his reply he appeared to reference more than one transfer window.“Nowadays, the issue of loyalty is no longer seen the way it used to be,” he said. “I could have left in the last transfer window and would have earned a lot more money. Financially, it would have been much better for me.“At one point I was going to leave – I won’t say where – but I would have won many trophies that season. I decided to stay not only for family reasons but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the coach also made me stay.“But from the club’s side, I felt a bit of: ‘If you go, it’s not really that bad for us.’ That hurts me a little. More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.“ Then you look around you and see players who don’t value the club as much as you do and who don’t defend the club as much. That makes you sad.”View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes looks dejected after the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.Photograph: Peter Powell/AFP/Getty ImagesIt is understood United’s stance is that the hierarchy were clear last summer that Fernandes was a fundamental component of team plans. A year earlier his transfer fee would have been significantly lower before, in mid‑August 2024, he signed a new contract to 2027 with an option for a further year.“The club went through difficult times, and I could have done what many people do and said: ‘I want to leave the club, I don’t want to train, I just want to leave for 20 or 30 million, so they pay me more on the other side,’” Fernandes said. “And maybe I would have gone to a better club or earned more money. But I never did that.“I never felt in a position to do so, because I felt the empathy and affection I had for the club were mutual. I think that empathy can exist, but there comes a point where money is more important than you. The club wanted me to leave – I have that in my head. I told the directors that but I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision because the manager wanted me to stay. If I had said I wanted to leave, even with the manager wanting me to stay, they would have let me go.”The 31-year-old did not rule out a move to Saudi Arabia. “It’s not about the money,” he said. “Financially, I can’t complain – I’m paid very well. Obviously the difference is enormous but that was never what guided me – if one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I will play in Saudi Arabia. My lifestyle will change, my children’s lives will have sun, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain. I’ll be playing in a growing league, with players who are internationally recognised.”It is understood that United have no desire to sell Fernandes and that he continues to be central to their long-term planning.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The court sided with the player amid accusations of betrayal and harassment surrounding the breakdown of their relationship. PSG had been seeking €440m from Mbappé, citing damages and a “loss of opportunity” after he left on a free transfer. It is understood PSG are likely to appeal.Mbappé’s representatives said the ruling “confirms that commitments must be honoured. It restores a simple truth: even in the professional football industry labour law applies to everyone.”PSG said in a statement: “Paris Saint-Germain takes note of the judgment pronounced by the Paris labour court, which it will execute, while reserving the right to appeal.Paris Saint-Germainhas always acted in good faith and with integrity, and will continue to do so. The club is now looking to the future, based on unity and collective success, and wishes the player the best for the rest of his career.”The relationship between the 2018 World Cup winner and the reigning European champions turned bitter when Mbappé decided in 2023 not to extend his contract, which was set to expire in summer 2024. This deprived the club of a hefty transfer fee despite having offered him the most lucrative contract in club history when he signed a new deal in 2022. He was sidelined from a pre-season tour and forced to train with fringe players. He missed the opening league game but returned to the lineup for a final season after discussions with the club – talks that are central to the dispute.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé with PSG’s president Nasser al-Khelaifi at a press conference in May 2022.Photograph: Michel Spingler/APThe club accused Mbappé of backing out of an August 2023 agreement that allegedly included a pay reduction should he leave on a free transfer, an arrangement PSG said was meant to protect its financial stability. PSG claimed that Mbappé hid his decision not to extend his contract for nearly 11 months, from July 2022 to June 2023, preventing the club from arranging a transfer and causing major financial harm. They accused him of violating contractual obligations and the principles of good faith and loyalty.Mbappé’s camp insisted PSG had never produced evidence that the striker agreed to forego any payment. His lawyers claimed the club failed to pay wages and bonuses for April, May, and June 2024.“Mbappé scrupulously fulfilled his sporting and contractual obligations for seven years and right up to the final day,” his advisers said on Tuesday. “He did everything possible to avoid litigation, even going so far as to withdraw a harassment complaint in a spirit of conciliation. In total, he had been seeking payment of his salaries and bonuses for more than 18 months.”PSG rejected all accusations of harassment, highlighting that Mbappé took part in more than 94% of matches in 2023–24 and always worked under conditions compliant with the Professional Football Charter.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The French club were seeking a total of €440m in damages, including €180m for the lost opportunity to transfer Mbappé because he left as a free agent afterdeclining a €300m offer from Saudi club Al-Hilalin July 2023.Mbappé joinedReal Madridin the summer of 2024 on a free transfer after scoring a club-record 256 goals in seven years at PSG, who won the Champions League this year without him.Explore more on these topicsKylian MbappéParis Saint-GermainReal MadridLigue 1La LigaEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

However, Andrée Jeglertz arrived at Manchester City after managing Denmark at the Euros, where his team failed to pick up a point, and has had an instant impact. City look a different beast under the 53-year-old. The league leaders’ opening-day defeat by Chelsea is firmly in the past: they have won all 10 games since, have scored eight more goals than any other side and have built a six point lead at the top. Where previously City had struggled to kill off matches against title rivals, this season there has been a ruthlessness epitomised by their late winner ina 3-2 defeat of Arsenal, after they had twice given up the lead, and a comprehensive3-0 win over Manchester United.SWBest teamThere can be only one answer here: City. They are playing like potential champions and have used wide areas to great effect. Khadija “Bunny” Shaw is scoring at a rate of more than a goal a game, Lauren Hemp, Aoba Fujino, Kerolin and Kerstin Casparij are at the top of their game and City even coped well despite their captain Alex Greenwood’s recent injury, the sort of absence that might have prompted them to capitulate in previous seasons. Sydney Lohmann and Grace Clinton have settled well, and Vivianne Miedema has created an impressive 22 chances in 11 games as a No 10.TGBest signingCentre-back was a position where City had to strengthen and they opted for a youthful choice with the 22-year-old Canada defender Jade Rose. Amid the team’s flurry of goals at the other end, Rose has gone under the radar but done a really mature, steady job for her age, defending well with 42 clearances but also threading through balls and carrying the ball higher up the pitch. Honourable mentions go to the 19-year-old Tottenham centre-back Toko Koga, Jess Park for her form after signing for United and Ellie Carpenter’s excellent performances for Chelsea, while Beata Olsson has done well for Liverpool with five goals in nine games.TGView image in fullscreenJade Rose has done a mature, steady defensive job at Manchester City and helped to build attacks.Photograph: Jess Hornby/WSL/WSL Football/Getty ImagesBest playerShaw continues to underline why she is one of the best strikers in the world at the moment, if notthebest. After her last campaign was interrupted by injury issues, she has found her groove. Her scoring ability is second to none: she has 12 goals, seven more than anyone else in the league. Not content with bringing up her 100th in 120 appearances for Manchester City against Aston Villa, she went on to get her 101st, 102nd and 103rd. She does not only score goals, however, but is integral to the way City build. City have caught the eye with their dynamic attacking football and her ever-developing connection with Miedema has been a joy to watch in these opening months.SDBiggest disappointmentAfter Arsenal’s stunning and battling run to asecond European title, expectations were high. However, they are eight points adrift of City, one defeat and four draws (against Chelsea, Manchester United, Aston Villa and Tottenham) leaving them only a point ahead of United and two ahead of Tottenham. What’s clear is Arsenal’s squad, the oldest in the league, needed an overhaul in the summer that didn’t come. Injuries have taken a toll but they are no excuse with the depth in their number. Meanwhile, dressing-room disharmony has been a factor. At the very least, they need to rediscover the doggedness that powered them to victory in Lisbon in May, and changes in January could reset things.SWPosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women1122302Chelsea Women1113243Arsenal Women1113224Man Utd Women1111215Tottenham Hotspur Women110206London City Lionesses11-7157Brighton & Hove Albion Women111148Aston Villa Women11-4139Leicester Women11-13910Everton Women11-8811West Ham Women11-15512Liverpool FC Women11-133Biggest gripeScheduling has long been a contentious subject as leagues and broadcasters try to find the right window for fixtures that will suit both TV viewership and spectators. The decision, however, to move most games to a noon kick-off has caused ructions among WSL fans. Midday is a time wholly unsuitable for match-goers – unless it is a local derby, it increases the difficulty for travelling fans and cost. The fact thatviewing figures on Sky are strugglingtoo – only 71,000 tuned in to watch one of the biggest games of the season between Arsenal and Chelsea – compounds the issue. In addition, many of this season’s matches have been held at the same time, leading to a lack of momentum throughout a weekend and a misunderstanding of the fact that a strong proportion of the women’s football fanbase watch more than just their own team. WSL Football has said it will reconsider in the summer but you can’t help but feel it has hindered potential growth off the back of the Lionesses’ summer success.SDHopes for second halfNo furtheranterior cruciate ligament injuriesafter eight WSL players endured that fate in the first half of the season, including Brighton’s Michelle Agyemang, the Liverpool duo Marie Höbinger and Sophie Román Haug and most recently Tottenham’s Jessica Naz. On a lighter note, it would be welcome to have a reduction in the number of unofficial tactical timeouts managers are enjoying while goalkeepers receive treatment, usually bang on the 22-minute mark or when their side are under heavy pressure. And purely for the sake of the morale of women’s football fans on Merseyside, it would be nice to see Liverpool and/or Everton finally win a home league game.TGGet in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Despite missing 17 of his 26 attempts at doubles, he scored a 96.44 average to set up a second-round meeting with Wesley Plaisier.“I don’t usually get this [crowd support], so thank you very much,” he told Sky Sports. “The fans have been great for me the last 18 months, two years, and to come here and get the support like I have, as you can hear now, still they’re chanting my name.“Honestly, if I win the million [first prize], it’s not going to change my life, but I want to win trophies. I want to be back in the top four in the world and be where I think I deserve. As long these are where they are with me, I think I can win everything, so thank you very much.”Danny Noppert recovered from a slow start to produce a fine win against Jurjen van der Velde, finally triumphing 3-1 after the fourth set. In a strong finish he threw four perfect darts at the start of the final leg to get down to 47 after nine darts.3:00‘From pubs to the Palace’: Jonathan Liew at the World Darts Championships – videoVan der Velde had arrived on stage with a can of insect spray after issues on Monday with a wasp at the venue but it was not enough to keep him in contention, Noppert missing two match darts in the final leg before claiming victory.Ricardo Pietreczko saw off the impressive José de Sousa 3-1 to seal his place in the second round, while Joe Comito upset Niko Springer 3-1 in the last match to finish.Chris Dobey shrugged off an early scare to reach the second round of the world championship with a 3-1 win against China’s Zong Xiaochen at Alexandra Palace.Another former semi-finalist, Scott Williams, cruised into the second round with a 3-0 win against Paolo Nebrida of the Philippines, while Justin Hood whitewashed the Welshman Nick Kenny.In an epic opener, Alan Soutar missed no fewer than 15 match darts before finally seeing off Finland’s Teemu Harju in a sudden-death leg.

Britain’s Josh Kerr, a world champion over 1500m in 2023, is owed $218,500 (£162,883).Meanwhile Girraphic, a Wimbledon‑based broadcasting and ­advertising agency, is still yet to be paid $690,624 (£514,810).View image in fullscreenFrance's Sasha Zhoya celebrates winning the men's 100m race during the Grand Slam Track meet at the National Stadium, Kingston, Jamaica in April 2025.Photograph: Ricardo Makyn/AFP/Getty ImagesThe World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, said the problems of GST deeply concerned him. “Well, it’s not unalloyed joy is it?” he said. “We welcome innovation into the sport. We welcome fresh investment, but it has to be underpinned by a sustainable, solid financial model executed and delivered on behalf of the athletes.”Asked whether World Athletics could stop Johnson’s plans to bring GST back in 2026, despite its precarious financial situation, Coe said he did not “want to get into the embers” of what might happen next.But, pointedly, he added: “We create the calendar. We have to police the calendar. And we have to make sure that when there are fresh events, that they come to the table with the kind of credentials and assets that I talked about.“Over the next few years, there are going to be lots of different and new things and I welcome that. But it has to be suffused in a realistic proposition that is fireproof. It’s got to be sustainable.”Coe also insisted that the World Athletics Ultimate Championships, which will launch in Budapest in ­September 2026, would be a very different proposition.“It’s a very, very big moment for us,” he said. “There’s no guarantee of success next year, but we’ve got teams that have been working at this now for three years and they will be working through Christmas to make sure that we don’t let the athletes down.“In Budapest, we’ve got the biggest prize pot ever, and it’s a very different model.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

And a good leader,” Gilmore said, when asked about transfer speculation surrounding the full‑back, who made his international debut under Eddie Jones in 2020.“He’s going to attract interest. It’s no different to whenChandler Cunningham-South was up [for contract renewal] a couple of months ago. Those players are going to attract interest. Definitely a good player.“Would we be interested? We’d be interested in any good player that fits in with our roster. In terms of the ins and outs, like any player, I can’t really disclose actual recruitment strategies.”Twickenham is the venue for Big Game 17 on Saturday, and Gilmore said fans of attacking rugby can expect entertainment from the double header: Harlequins Women v Bristol Bears Women kicks off at 3.05pm before the men’s Prem match at 6pm.“You’ve got two teams who want to use the football,” Gilmore said. “I don’t see the scoreline being 10-7. Twickenham is a bigger pitch, there’s more space to attack into. When you get two attacking teams on a bigger field, generally you’ll get bigger scorelines.”View image in fullscreenBenhard Janse van Rensburg will offer a threat for Bristol at Twickenham.Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport/Getty ImagesRegarding the threat of Bristol’s South African centre Benhard Janse van Rensburg, who is due to qualify for England next year, Gilmore said: “He’s a collision guy in that midfield, there’s no shying away from it. You can’t dip your toe in the water against him.“You’ve got to match him and go head-on, one-for-one. How you nullify him is you’ve got to go at him. If you’re passive and you let him run, that’s when he has a field day.”Meanwhile, the Gloucester director of rugby, George Skivington, voiced his disappointment at the impending departure of the Wales international Tomos Williams. The Cherry and Whites announced on Tuesday that the scrum-half will leave next summer, with his destination undisclosed. The club also revealed that the scrum-half and Gloucester academy graduate Dan Robson will rejoin from Pau for next season.“We did our best but that’s rugby, that’s sport,” Skivington said of Williams. “There’s no hard feelings and he’s in here for the rest of the season – I know he’ll give everything. We put our best foot forward and Tommy’s got to make the decision he thinks is right for him. We’re not going to fall out over it.”Regarding the signings of the Wales captains Jac Morgan and Dewi Lake, announced on Monday, Skivington said: “They are honest, hard-working, tough characters who really want to do something. They are the right age profile to drive the club forward.”Explore more on these topicsRugby unionHarlequinsNorthamptonnewsShareReuse this content"

This year’s period covers their participation in theClub World Cupand its aftermath.The figure, which goes some way towards vindicating Enzo Maresca’s rotation and his complaints about injuries, is contained in a report published by the insurance company Howden, which puts the cost of injuries to clubs in Europe’s top five leagues over the past five years at almost £3bn.By not explaining ‘worst 48 hours’ Enzo Maresca has put himself at even greater risk | Jacob SteinbergRead moreMaresca cited the impact of the Club World Cup in September when Chelsea were missing five defenders through injury and lost three successive games in the Champions League and Premier League. He made five changes last week for theChampions League defeatat Atalanta, a setback followed bycryptic commentson Saturday after a Premier League win against Everton that he had endured his“worst 48 hours”at the club owing to a lack of support from unspecified people.The report found Chelsea had 23 injuries between 1 June and 31 October, including seven during theClub World Cupin the US, the same number as Paris Saint-Germain, whom they beat in the final.Howden calculated the financial loss toChelseaof players missing through injury as £17m up to October, almost a quarter of their £80m Club World Cup prize money, and more than a third of their £45m loss last season. It calculates financial loss according to wages paid to injured players.Manchester City were found to have had the second-most injuries among Club World Cup teams, at 22, although they did not sustain any during the tournament, perhaps because they were knocked out in the last 16. PSG were found to have had 19 injuries, including seven during the Club World Cup.Howden’s findings echo concerns expressed by the global players’ union, Fifpro, regarding workload. A Fifpro report in October showed Chelsea’s players were given 20 days off after the Club World Cup and that PSG rested their players for 22 days.“The Howden report demonstrates the impact of pushing players to their limits through a year-round schedule of football,” the Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive and Fifpro board member, Maheta Molango, said.“Serious injuries are always going to happen if players are not given proper breaks for rest and recovery. Players are exposed to an extreme schedule at a younger and younger age. That will have an impact on their careers and their wellbeing. The current calendar makes no sense for players, fans or clubs.”Howden has produced the Men’s European Football Injury Index for the past five years, with the report released on Tuesday calculating there have been 22,596 injuries in Europe’s top five men’s leagues over that period, costing clubs a combined £2.97bn. Premier League clubs account for 24% of these injuries, with more than £1bn paid out in salaries to injured players.Manchester United incurred the highest injury costs of Premier League clubs at £154.5m over five years, with Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City above average.The report also highlights that young players are most susceptible to injury. Premier League forwards under the age of 21 sustained an injury every 120 minutes of competitive domestic football over the past five years.Explore more on these topicsChelseaClub World Cup 2025Club World CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Artists who have opposed any dilution of their copyright include Sam Fender, Kate Bush and the Pet Shop Boys. Campaigners to protect artists’ copyright have voiced fears that ministers have paid too much attention to US tech companies’ interests.The US president, Donald Trump, hassaid: “We have to allow AI to use that [copyrighted] pool of knowledge without going through the complexity of contract negotiations,” and warned international governments not to “make rules and regulations that … make it impossible” for AI companies to do business.Last month Paul McCartneystepped upthe campaign to protect copyright by releasing a new recording, which was almost entirely silent save for some ambient clattering in the studio as a protest against copyright theft by AI companies.Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament on Monday there was “no clear consensus” on the issue and the government would “take the time to get this right”, and promised to make policy proposals by 18 March 2026.“Our approach to copyright and AI must support prosperity for all UK citizens, and drive innovation and growth for sectors across the economy, including the creative industries,” she said. “This means keeping the UK at the cutting edge of science and technology so UK citizens can benefit from major breakthroughs, transformative innovation and greater prosperity.“It also means continuing to support our creative industries, which make a huge economic contribution, shape our national identity and give us a unique position on the world stage.”But campaigners for copyright holders said the consultation response set a clear course for the government to take.“This is an overwhelming show of support for the commonsense position that AI companies should pay for the resources they use, and a total rejection of the government’s ‘preferred option’ of handing AI companies the work of the UK’s creatives for free,” said Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for copyright fairness.“Liz Kendall should listen to the people and rule out changing copyright law to benefit AI companies.”Owen Meredith, the chief executive of the New Media Association, urged Kendall to rule out any new copyright exception and end the uncertainty created by “this prolonged process”.“This will send a clear message to AI developers that they must enter into licensing agreements with the UK’s media and creative copyright owners, unlocking investment and strengthening the market for the high-quality content that is the most valuable ingredient in producing safe, trustworthy AI models,” he said.Last month, Kendall indicated she was sympathetic to artists’ demandsnot to have their copyrighted works scraped by AI companies without payment and wanted to “reset” the debate. “People rightly want to get paid for the work that they do,” she said, and “we have to find a way that both sectors can grow and thrive in future”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingIntellectual propertyShareReuse this content"

Today, he raises 130 head of cattle and grows corn, wheat, grass and soybeans on 1,200 acres of land.For his family, his animals and wider business, water is life.So when, in May 2024, the Texas-basedAligned Data Centersbroke ground on its NEO-01, four-building, 200,000 sq ft data center on a brownfield site that abuts farmland that Hermes rents, he was concerned.“We have city water here. That’s going to reduce the pressure if they are sucking all the water,” he says of the data center.“They’re not good, I know that.”Two years ago, the company said it would invest about $202m on a “hyperscale” data center that would employ 18 people and dozens more in the construction process. Although the company claims it uses a closed-loop, air-cooled system for cooling its computers that can reduce the need for water, artificial intelligence, machine-learning and other high power-demand processes do rely on water as a cooling agent.All the while, a 10-minute drive north, the shoreline of Lake Erie hasn’t been this low in years.Water levels across all five Great Lakes have begunto drop in recent monthsas part of a long-term fall. Since 2019, the Great Lakes have seen water-leveldecreasesof two to four feet. While experts say this is a natural decrease given the record highs the lakes have experienced since 2020, it’s happening at a time when a huge new consumer of water has appeared on the horizon: data centers.The source of the largest single deposit of freshwater on the planet, the Great Lakes, in particular Lake Erie, are already struggling with the fallout of drought and warmer water temperatures that, at this time of year, fuel major lake-effect snowstorms, and greater than normal levels of evaporation due to the absence of ice cover.With major cities such as Chicago, Toronto, Detroit and Pittsburgh all within a few hundred miles of each other, small, under-resourced communities around the Great Lakes have become hugely attractive for data-center companies.In Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, Microsoft is building what it calls the “world’s most-powerful AI data center” that is set to open early next year and expected to use up to 8.4bn gallons of municipal water from the city of Racine every year. Racine gets its water from LakeMichigan. Similar stories are playing out in Hobart, Indiana, where AWS is planning to build a data center two miles from Lake Michigan’s shoreline, and in Port Washington, Wisconsin.In Benton Harbor, Michigan, locals are concerned that a proposed $3bn data center would contribute to environmental pollution and traffic.Forty miles west of Aligned’s under-construction data center in Ohio, in Woodville Township, hundreds of people showed up to a public meeting last October to voice concern about another proposed data center project in their rural community.“The Great Lakes region, especially in states such as Illinois and Ohio, [is] among the most data-center dense states in the region. In addition to the high volumes of water used on site for cooling, our recent research found that even more water may be consumed to generate electricity to power data centers’ energy needs,” says Kirsten James, senior program director for water at Ceres, a nonprofit headquartered in Boston.“These impacts can conflict with communities’ water-resource planning efforts.”The Great Lakes Compact, a 2005 accord signed by the governors of eight US states and two Canadian provinces, means that Great Lakes Water must only be used within the regional basin.Research by Purdue University found that data centers on average consume about 300,000 gallons of water a day. Water used by data centers is warmed significantly and for those that do not use a closed loop system, that heated effluent water, just 20% of the initial amount, is often discharged back into local wastewater systems or the environment, with potentially serious consequences for flora, fauna and human consumers. Even closed-loop systems that reuse the same water repeatedly need millions of gallons of water.While many new data centers are drawing water from local municipalities that, in turn, get their water from groundwater, much of that supply comes from the Great Lakes watersheds.Some communities are fighting back. Last month, residents of Fife Lake, Michigan, were overjoyed after hearing a plan for a data center in their town of 471 residents would be scrapped due to local opposition.Similar stories of successful opposition have played out in Indiana and elsewhere.But the data centers are fighting back.Private firms representing data center companies have often successfully sued community authorities, accusing them of illegally excluding certain types of developments, making small towns powerless in the battle to keep out giant water-guzzling corporations.In Michigan’s Saline Township, a community of about 400 people outside Ann Arbor, OpenAI and Oracle used a representative company to successfully sue the local authority to overcome opposition and build a massive facility that would use 1.4 gigawatts of electricity – roughly the equivalent of powering 1.4 million homes.The Detroit Free Press editorial board assailed the move, calling it a “a fait accompli, hammered into this tiny Washtenaw county community over the objections of residents, the elected board that represents them, and Michigan’s attorney general, absent expert or outside testimony save a cursory public hearing held over Microsoft Teams”.Data companies and their backers, however, say their presence is a net gain for Great Lakes communities by providing jobs and investment over the course of years.Aligned has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Perkins Township, the local school system and a career center. In return, it gets a 15-year tax exemption from local authorities. A representative declined to respond to questions from the Guardian asking how much water it intends to use at the data center and from where it originates.Local municipalities that support these facilities claim that the data centers will increase tax revenue and help rebuild ageing infrastructure such as water delivery systems that, in some places, are in significant need of upgrading. Calls, emails and messages left with Erie county commissioners asking if local authorities plan to supply the Perkins Township data center with water were not responded to.Some Perkins Township residents say a number of local companies have been hired during the construction phase, bringing work to the area.But many argue those investments are not worth the long-term price the community may pay.Amanda Voegle, who works at a heating business now directly facing the data center, is concerned about water and many other issues.“A couple of years ago, there was a water pollution issue at the site. I’m very concerned. Is this [water] going back into the lake?”Two years ago, the construction site upon which the data center is being built was found to be the source of contamination of a river that flows into Lake Erie, with the remediation company responsible cited by the Ohio EPA for unauthorized discharges into state waters.“I don’t understand why they built it so close to the street, because it’s an eyesore,” says Voegle.She says there have been other unusual incidents at her workplace recently, including power surges.“I don’t know if it’s related [to the data center]. It’s probably almost weekly that we lose power and have to fully reboot everything. There was a couple of things we actually had to replace because [the power surge] fried it.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyOhioMichigannewsShareReuse this content"

So why are the major labels embracing it?Companies such as Udio, Suno and Klay will let you use AI to make new music based on existing artists’ work. It could mean more royalties – but many are worriedEamonn FordeTue 16 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 05.01 ESTShareThis was the year that AI-generated music went from jokey curiosity to mainstream force.Velvet Sundown, a wholly AI act, generated millions of streams; AI-created tracks topped Spotify’s viral chart and one of the US Billboard country charts; AI “artist” Xania Monet “signed” a record deal. BBC Introducing is usually a platform for flesh-and-blood artists trying to make it big, but an AI-generated song by Papi Lamour was recently played on the West Midlands show. And jumping up the UK Top 20 this month is I Run, a track by dance act Haven, who have beenaccused of using AI to imitate British vocalist Jorja Smith(Haven claim they simply asked the AI for “soulful vocal samples”, and did not respond to an earlier request to comment).The worry is that AI will eventually absorb all creative works in history and spew out endless slop that will replace human-made art and drive artists into penury. Those worries are being deepened by how the major labels, once fearful of the technology, are now embracing it – and heralding a future in which ordinary listeners have a hand in co-creating music with their favourite musicians.AI music platforms analyse huge amounts of recorded music in order to learn its sounds, structures and expressions, and then allow users to create their own AI-generated music via text or speech prompts. You might ask for a moody R&B song about a breakup sung by a female vocalist, and it will come up with a decent approximation of one, because it’s absorbed hundreds of such songs.Artists and labels initially saw AI as the biggest existential threat sinceNapster-fuelled piracy: if not a replacement for human creativity, then certainly a force that could undermine its value. Gregor Pryor, a managing partner at legal firm Reed Smith, says background music for things such as advertising, films and video games, where you’re not relating to a personality as you would in pop music, “is where the real damage will be done” first of all. “People will ask: why would I pay anyone to compose anything?”View image in fullscreen‘New creative possibilities’ … screengrab from the Suno AI music generator.Photograph: SunoAware of the scale of the shift, last year the Recording Industry Association of America, representing the three major labels, initiatedlegal action against AI music companies Suno and Udiofor copyright infringement, alleging they had trained their AI platforms on the labels’ artists without their permission. But then there was an extraordinary about-turn. They didn’t just settle the matter out of court – Universal Music Group (UMG) then partnered with Udio, and Warner Music Group (WMG) with Udio and Suno. They also have deals in place with AI companyKlay, the first to get all three major labels on board, adding Sony Music (discussions with indie labels are ongoing). WMG chief executive Robert Kyncl has said these recent deals are to ensure the “protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters” and to fuel “new creative and commercial possibilities” for them, while UMG chief Lucien Grainge heralded “a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish and create incredible experiences for fans”.Kyncl made another bold statement as to why these deals are taking place: “Now, we are entering the next phase of innovation. The democratisation of music creation.”View image in fullscreenMonet maker  … AI artist Xania Monet. An AI-generated image from ‘her’ Instagram account.Photograph: xania_monetAnnouncing its Universal tie-in, Udio chief executive Andrew Sanchez has said Udio users will be able to “create [music] with an artist’s voice and style”: so not just create the aforementioned moody R&B song, but one with a specific existing artist’s voice. He also says Udio will allow users to “remix and reimagine your favourite songs with AI … take your favourite artists, songs or styles and combine them in novel ways. In our internal experimentation, the team has gotten some truly remarkable and unusual results that will definitely delight.”Klay meanwhile states that “fans can mould their musical journeys in new ways”, but it’s essentially the same offering: a subscription service where you can manipulate the music of others, or create your own from it. Ary Attie, Klay’s founder and chief executive, says his company will properly compensate artists whose work is used, and won’t supplant the work of human musicians: “This technology is not going to change any of that.”Klay is a rarity in that it signed up all three major labelsbeforeit started training its AI system on their music: “A core part of our philosophy,” Attie says. He argues that rival AI companies – he doesn’t name names – have been “acting in a way that doesn’t respect the work of artists, and then being forced into a corner”. Suno did not respond to an interview request; Udio claimed its executives were “extremely swamped” and therefore unable to answer questions. The current, and synchronised, messaging from labels and gen AI companies with licensing deals is that they all respect both art and artists and that their deals will reflect this.They are also positioning gen AI as the single biggest democratising leap ever in remix culture, effectively enabling everyone to become musically creative. The counterargument is that, by lowering all barriers to entry and by allowing the manipulation of a song or a musician’s character at scale, it vastly devalues and negates the creative act itself.But what do musicians actually think of the prospect of their work being used to train AI, and reworked by the general public? “Everybody should be selling or licensing their voice and their skills to these companies,” Dave Stewart of Eurythmicsargued to me this week. “Otherwise they’re just going to take it anyway.” That view is directly countered by the major labels and AI companies, who have insisted artists and songwriters get to opt in to have their music made available, and if they do, get royalties when their music is used to train AI, or manipulated by users on platforms such as Udio, Suno and Klay.Others take a grimmer view about howthese companies might reshape the industry. Irving Azoff, legendarily forthright artist manager and founder of the Music Artists Coalition in the US, responded to the Universal/Udio deal with biting cynicism. “We’ve seen this before – everyone talks about ‘partnership,’ but artists end up on the sidelines with scraps,”he said. In the wake of the same deal, the Council of Music Makers in the UKaccusedthe major labels of “spin” and called for a more robust set of artist-label agreements. And the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance says there is a disturbing “lack of transparency” around the deals (though more detail is likely to emerge on what users can do with any music they create, and any potential commercial uses of it).View image in fullscreen‘I’m yet to be convinced’ … Catherine Anne Davies performing as the Anchoress in 2024.Photograph: TeeGeePix/AlamyCatherine Anne Davies, who records as the Anchoress and also sits on the board of directors at theFeatured Artists Coalition(FAC), has many reservations here. “Most people don’t even want their work to be used for training AI,” she says. “I’m on the dystopian side, or maybe what I call the realist side of things. I’m interested in the way that AI can be assistive in the creative process – if it can make us more efficient, if it can streamline our processes. But generative AI for me, in terms of creative output, is a big no-no at the moment. I’m yet to be convinced.”Musician Imogen Heap feels that AI itself is not to be feared as a tool – she uses an AI she calls Mogen to listen to every aspect of her life, with a view to it being a creative partner (as exploredin a recent Guardian article). To help address some of the issues, she has created Auracles, an artist-led, non-profit platform she hopes will be the place where the rights and permissions around AI are set out. It’s not enough to say you’re happy with your music being used by AI, she says – instead, what’s needed are “permissions that grow and evolve over time”.Other companies are cropping up with similar offers. “We must protect the artists at all costs,” says Sean Power, chief executive of Musical AI, who aims to give musicians “an exact portion of the influence they’re having on all the generative outputs” – meaning compensation every time even a tiny bit of one of their songs is used by a user of Udio et al.Terms of these deals are undisclosed, but labels are likely to be seeking settlement for any past use of their artists’ copyrights as well as an advance on future use, plus an equity stake in the platform. And while artists will be able to opt out of including their work, they probably won’t be consulted on these partnerships going ahead, with this lack of consultation being something that artist representative bodies such as FAC have been particularly critical of. “The big artists, the labels need to be nice to; those who have a platform will be consulted to some degree,” says a music licensing expert, speaking anonymously. “The very few, who as individual artists are able to make a dent on share price, will have approval.”I approached Universal, Sony and Warner about the specific concerns raised by artists here: namely limited transparency around the deals, their commercial terms and how opt-ins work; if there is a risk of gen AI undermining existing revenue sources; and if there is significant artist refusal to assign their works for gen AI training. None of the companies would comment on the record about the specifics. Though in an internal Universal memo about AI deals, sent to all staff earlier this year and seen by the Guardian, Grainge said “we will NOT license any model that uses an artist’s voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist’s existing songs without their consent.”The Guardian understands that labels are currently having discussions with artists and their managers to better explain how these deals will work and why they believe they can bring in additional revenue, although they will need to convince artists that gen AI will not damage other sources of income, notably from streaming.But it isn’t clear whether consumers will actually pay to play around with music in the way Udio and others hope they will. AI is thesingle biggest hype category in Silicon Valleyright now, with an average of $2bn of venture capital investment going into AI companies every week in the first half of this year. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet (parent company of Google), recently warned of thecatastrophic domino effectacross the tech sector if this AI bubble bursts, a concern theBank of Englandalso recently raised.Reed Smith’s Gregor Pryor argues that AI music could, counterintuitively, end up being positive for human musicians. “By its nature, AI is derivative and cannot create new music,” he says. “Some investors in music catalogues that I speak to say it’s good for artists, because music ‘verified’ as created by humans will have greater value.”Artists will frame their work as having an invaluable human essence, their music speaking entirely from the heart, but it will become incrementally more difficult for the casual listener to distinguish between music created by a human and that created by AI. The Guardian understands that radio stations and DJs are currently extremely nervous about AI-powered music slipping through their quality filters, effectively hoodwinking them and hanging question marks over how their playlists work. The example of Papi Lamour might force them to do much greater due diligence on what they put forward for airplay consideration. Or they could be the first trickles of a flood that roars through radio and streaming services as the boundaries between AI and human-created music crumble.AI, bot farms and innocent indie victims: how music streaming became a hotbed of fraud and fakeryRead moreDavies is especially worried about artists not thinking through the long-term implications of licensing to AI services. “We cannot think of ourselves selfishly as entities that will be unaffected, because the entire ecosystem will experience a knock-on effect financially. What about your fellow composers and creators? But also what about the generations to come after? Are we fucking this completely, just to make sure that we can pay our mortgages now?”AI’s current level of sophistication means it is really producing composites of existing music, creating a Frankenstein’s monster of melodies. However, when AGI (artificial general intelligence) finally arrives, withAnthropic co-founder Dario Amodeisuggesting that could happen as soon as next year, we will be catapulted into an exhilarating and terrifying realm of uncertainty for the future and the purpose of human-created art.“It’s literally happening under our noses,” warns Davies. “We should be so much more concerned than we are.”Explore more on these topicsMusicArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His attempt to export the bullying must be resistedTue 16 Dec 2025 14.04 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 18.31 ESTShareOn the day that the governmentlauncheda high-stakes consultation to consider fresh ways of funding the BBC in the digital era, the corporation could have done without another difficult news event of its own. Donald Trump’s decision to follow through on threats tosueover the content of a Panorama programme broadcast in October 2024 may not have come as a surprise, given Mr Trump’s litigious record in the United States. But it will add to the general air of beleaguerment at the corporation and further embolden its domestic political enemies.A terse BBCstatementon Tuesday suggested that there would be no backing down in the face of White House bullying. That is the right response to absurd claims of “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” caused to the US president, and a fantastical request for damages amounting to $10bn. The BBC has rightlyapologisedfor the misleading splicing together of separate clips from Mr Trump’s rabble-rousing speech on January 6 2020, prior to the violent storming of the US Capitol. A serious error of judgment was made in that editing process – though the House of Representatives January 6 committee concluded that Trump didusehis speech to incite an insurrection. But the claim that a programme not broadcast in the US was part of a malicious plan to defame Mr Trump and subvert the democratic process ahead of last year’s election is utterly specious.The BBC is only the latest major media institution to be targeted by Mr Trump in a strategiccampaignof intimidation, although the first beyond US borders. There are already presidential lawsuits pending in relation to the New York Times (allegedly “a mouthpiece for the Radical Left Democratic Party”) and the Wall Street Journal, which experts say Mr Trump has next to no chance of winning. Legal action and regulatory threats have also led to settlements in the television industry, successfully instilling a climate of fear and self-censorship.That is the point, of course. Money is not the primary object of the exercise, though cash extracted from a case involving CBS News has reportedly been diverted towards the construction of Mr Trump’spresidential library. The main goal is a cowed mediascape allowing the US president, and online outriders such as Elon Musk, to manipulate and control debate. For US corporate empires whose ambitions partly depend on the goodwill of the Trump administration, the harassment can lead to invidious choices. But as an independent British broadcaster with its own global reputation to defend, the BBC is free to fight back.In that battle, the corporation deserves more wholehearted backing from the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, than has hitherto been the case. The BBC remains a core component of the UK’s democratic infrastructure, but Mr Trump’s lawsuit is designed to undermine its prestige and sap its confidence, playing into the hands of hisfellow travellerson the British radical right. The government should see that strategy for the attempted infringement on national sovereignty that it is. By relentlessly targeting the US “legacy” media and now the BBC, while cosplaying the role of victim, Mr Trump is seeking to galvanise his base and narrow the parameters of acceptable scrutiny and judgment.

Just don’t expect the ‘war on drugs’ to endKojo KoramRescheduling marijuana might seem an unlikely move for a Republican president – but it perfectly coheres with his ‘America First’ worldviewTue 16 Dec 2025 11.34 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 12.04 ESTShareFor decades, the issue of cannabis reform was firmly viewed as a leftist pipe dream. To most conservatives, particularly US Republicans, legalising weed was as realistic as nuclear disarmament, or abolishing national borders.Think of the phrase “war on drugs” and the first people that probably come to mind are Republican presidents Nixon, Reagan and George HW and George W Bush. Although the clampdown reached its harshest levels during the presidency of Mr “I didn’t inhale” Bill Clinton, it always seemed as if the GOP owned the position of being “tough on drugs”. As recently as 2023, Mitch McConnell, then Senate Republican leader, reaffirmed this reputationby statingthat: “Democrats are struggling with the basics. This should not be this hard. Drugs belong off our streets.”Yet it now seems that the biggest change to US federal drug policy for more than 50 years will happen through a Republican president. On Monday, Donald Trump confirmed the rumours that he is “very strongly” considering rescheduling cannabis (or marijuana, as it is still called in US state documents, due to an early-20th-century driveto emphasisethe plant’sforeignness) from Schedule I in the Controlled Substances Act – where its currently sits alongside heroin –to Schedule III, next to drugs such as codeine.This change has been a long time coming. The Department of Health and Human Servicesrecommendedrescheduling back in 2023, and speculation that action was imminent had been buildingsince August, when Trump said he was “looking into” this issue. But it is still a bold move, and one that could help Trump’sfloundering popularityahead of the midterms.Despite the controversy that still surrounds this drug, cannabis rescheduling is well-supported by the US population. When public comment was invited on the proposed rescheduling, nearly 43,000 people submitted comments, with almost 70%calling for rescheduling– arecord. Having cannabis classified as aSchedule I drug– ie a substance with no acceptable medical use and high potential for abuse – looks like an increasingly absurd position in a country where 40 out of 50 stateshave activemedical cannabis programmes and 24 states have even legalised cannabis for recreational use.Yet Trump’s actions are seemingly mired in contradiction. Just this month, Trump was re-energising the “war on drugs”by threateningto escalate his recent bombing raids on Venezuelan and Colombian shipping vessels he accuses of trafficking drugs. Hehas describedthe presidents of these countries as narcotics traffickers and, in September, he used his address to the UNto send a message: “To every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America, please be warned that we will blow you out of existence.” Why is Donald Trump softening drug laws at home while ramping up the drug war abroad?These stances aren’t as contradictory as they first appear. Trump rescheduling cannabis doesn’t necessarily mean he has been convinced by social-justice arguments around the devastation the drug war caused to minority communities and producer countries. His stated reason for pushing this change is because it “leads to tremendous amounts of research” as it would make it easier for scientists to study the drug. Trump has also likely been influenced by the multi-billion-dollar cannabis industryemerging across the USover the last decade, thanks to state-level reform. This growth will be accelerated by rescheduling, as it will allow the new cannabis megacorporations access to standard business tax deductions. Moving to Schedule III removes cannabis from longstanding restrictions underIRS Code section 280Ethat have proved burdensome for the fledgling cannabis industry. Cannabis stocksjumpedby as much as 54% when news of rescheduling first began to leak.However, it is important to remember that rescheduling does not legalise or even decriminalise cannabis; it does not dismantle the architecture of arrests, deportations, mandatory drug tests and exclusion from public housing, student loans and travel visas that were designed over the past few decades to enforce the criminalisation of cannabis. People will still be in prison on cannabis-trafficking charges whileCannabisInc is flooded with investor cash.With a number of the Silicon Valley tech titans who have surrounded Trump 2.0 havinginvestedin commercialisedcannabis(andpsychedelics), the expected economic boost that will accompany rescheduling provides a clear financial incentive for Trump to liberalise drug policies at home. The same does not apply internationally however, where Trump impinges on the sovereignty of Latin American countries. But a reshaping of the “war on drugs” perfectly coheres with Trump’s “America First” worldview: hyper-commercialisation at home, aggressive mercantilism abroad.For real progress to happen, cannabis would need to be taken out of the Controlled Substances Act entirely. And to really help the communities that have been devastated by the “war on drugs”, decriminalisation would need to be combined with policies that ensure a substantial portion of the profits made from selling legal cannabis are taxed and reinvested in disenfranchised communities. That includes those in Latin America who have borne the brunt of the violence of the drug war for more than half a century. Trump’s rescheduling, while moving away from the “Reefer Madness”of yesteryear, is still a long way off from a policy that prioritises people over profits.Dr Kojo Koram is professor of law and political economy at Loughborough University, and writes on issues of law, race and empire.

While I am not quite as hardcore as the American virologistJonas Salk, who injected the polio vaccine into himself and his family before large-scale trials, this scientific inquiry has involved some personal pain. You see, I have spent the last month trying to smile like Zohran Mamdani. This is not, as I have discovered, an easy feat.Ever since the incoming mayor of New York became a household name, I’ve been intrigued by his perma-smile. His detractorscall him a “jihadist”, and he smiles. He meets Donald Trump, and he smiles. Some Republican lawmakerslaunch a campaignto investigate his path to citizenship and deport him? He keeps on smiling. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen him look angry.Do his cheekbones permanently ache, I started to wonder? Did the wind change when he was grinning once, forcing his face into that position? And does smiling that much trick him into feeling happy despite the fact that the world is a raging dumpster fire?There’s actually been much debate on that last point, conducted by people with rather better credentials than myself. Some studies say, yes, you can smile yourself happier, and others say you can’t. A more recent study suggested that yes,smiling can slightly improve mood. But only to a limited degree. You can’t, for example, smile yourself out of depression. If only.I can’t say with certainty why Mamdani grins all the time but I suspect the reasons aren’t particularly uplifting. The thing is, not everyone is allowed to be angry. When you’re brown or black and growing up somewhere where you are a minority, you soon learn that your emotions are constantly policed. You learn that while white men’s anger issometimes seen as righteous, your rage is always wrong. And you learn that you don’t even have to be angry for people to perceive you as such. According to research by theAmerican Psychological Association, for example, prospective teachers appear more likely to misperceive black children as angry than white children. Racialised people have always been seen as more emotional and unstable. “Sullen peoples / Half devil and half child,” Rudyard Kipling wrote in his 1899 poem The White Man’s Burden.There is also a gender rage gap. I’m not sure there is a woman on earth who hasn’t been instructed to “smile!” by some random man, who thinks the fairer sex should always be affable. Even Hillary Clinton waspublicly told to smileby news host Joe Scarborough in 2016, after she’d won the Democratic primaries. And the pressure to be nice, to smile all the time, compounds when you are a woman of colour. Serena Williams has repeatedly battled the trope of the “Angry Black Woman”.Repressing your rage all the time isn’t healthy – but it’s also true that joy can be an act of resistance. What interests me about Mamdani is how subversive his grin is. Many of his critics, I suspect, would like nothing more than to see him get angry. To see him lose control, get flustered, so they can point and say: “Look at this angry brown man. Look how scary he is.” They’re still saying all that, of course, but it doesn’t exactly land when he looks like a puppy dog.Back to my science experiment. My month of constant grinning didn’t come easily because I’ve got a bit of a scowl when my mood is neutral, and can’t control my facial expressions in other circumstances. I’ve tried to keep my expression deliberately impassive in the past, but it just looks like I’m constipated. Once I got the hang of the perma-smile though, I did find it quite a useful way to stay composed in difficult circumstances. I’m obviously not being yelled at all the time like Mamdani is but I’ve been on a few panels about Gaza recently, where I’ve been asked outrageous questions by people who are strongly anti-Palestinian.“Channel Mamdani, channel Mamdani”,I thought to myself on those occasions and tried my hardest to smile nicely.My scientific conclusion? The smiling did help lower my heart rate; it’s a good way to emotionally reset. But it also made my cheeks ache and resulted in some dreadful pictures of me. So while I’ve got the Mamdani grin in my back pocket for tough occasions, it’s back to my usual expression for now.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionUS politicsNew YorkMental healthcommentShareReuse this content"

Students live in fear of ICESeth LavinI am in awe of the children and their parents as they live through raids. How can you call an operation targeted when it blankets a city in fear?Tue 16 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTShareThere is snow on the ground, but for someChicagofamilies, this is a moment of unfreezing. ICE is still out there, but Commander Gregory Bovino and his strike force have moved on. After months, Operation Midway Blitz has quieted.In places like the elementary school where I am principal, some parents who were hiding are poking their heads out doors. Children holding their breath since September are beginning to exhale.But the danger isn’t over; it’s just somewhere else. LA, Washington DC, Chicago. Then Charlotte, New Orleans Minneapolis.News stations call them “stings” and “sweeps” and “crackdowns” – words that suggest a line between those in and out of focus: targets and civilians, innocent and guilty.What Chicago's fight against ICE can teach us all about how to resist oppression | Zoe WilliamsRead moreBut in one Chicago school, a third grade boy stopped eating because he was afraid to type in his lunch code, worried ICE would somehow see it and know where he was, or his family.In another, agents entered a schoolyard in the middle of the day and took alandscaperwhile children were inside learning.The Department of Homeland Security says these operations target “gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers”, the “worst of the worst” and “Criminal Illegal Aliens Released From Jail and Back into American Communities”.They want us to imagine dark strangers who put others in danger. Trump himself calls immigrants “animals” and “rough people” who are “poisoning the blood of our country”.But when they talk about immigration, they are talking about our students. About you, or your grandmother. Your neighbor. People who walk their kids to school.Most years, my job is to make sure we have enough copy paper and to observe classes, such as the room I visited on Halloween when a teacher dressed like a Teletubby read aloud to eighth graders from The Tell-Tale Heart.This year, in the same building: a student who had begun barricading his bedroom door each night, terrified agents would appear; a mom in the hallway whose eyes welled with tears when I asked: “How are you?”, and who said to me: “I’m just so scared.”I am in awe of her, and her children, who have spent months living through terror: doing math homework. Bringing cupcakes for a class party. Holding their breath each time a car turns down the street.In every classroom on Earth, good and bad things happen every day. Working in schools means existing in contradiction: children are resilient. And also, they remember.One in fiveChicagoans is an immigrant.One in 12Chicago households includes someone undocumented.What does it feel like for your child to ask who cares for them if you are taken? To go to school in the morning worried your parents won’t be there when you get home?How can you call an operation targeted when it blankets a city in fear?Since September, federal officers have arrestedmore than 4,000 peoplein Chicago and nearby towns: masked agents, trucks with dark windows, people taken so suddenly at least one left a car in the street with thekeys still in it.Working in schools means existing in contradiction: children are resilient. And also, they rememberAgents detainedchildrenand arrestedUS citizens, say reports. Theykilleda man, andshota woman. They used teargas and other chemical agents49 times, according to a media investigation. Video showed an agent firing pepper balls at apastor.But a report early this month identified just afractionof those detained as having criminal arrests or convictions.None of us knows yet what effect this will have on our children, or their families, or our city. But that’s a reckoning we will have to face soon: here, and in every town that’s next.I don’t begrudge the places Trump so far passed over, but that was never going to be Chicago. Not this city, built by immigrants, where our mayor and governor remain defiant. Not Chicago, where immigrant leaders and allies built a model for fighting back: filing lawsuits, blowing whistles, buying groceries and driving one another’s kids to school.Watching from Australia while Donald Trump targets my home of Chicago with armed troops prompts deep questions | Miles HerbertRead moreBut as hopeful – and difference-making – as those stories are, you can’t feel good in this moment. You don’t tell a child “it’s OK” when it isn’t, and it won’t be.What you say is: this is awful. What you say is: I am sorry. What you say is: we are going to try to make things better.The writer Nelson Algren once said loving Chicago is like loving a woman with a broken nose. I always thought that line was sexist – that Algren meant Chicago, like the woman, was imperfect: less than beautiful.I hear it differently now. A nose that’s been broken means a person who’s been punched.That’s what this was: not a sweep or a strike or a crackdown, but a fist thrown out. A beating. That’s what our city took: a beating.But Chicago is still here.Seth Lavin is a school principal in ChicagoExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionUS immigrationChicagoTrump administrationSchoolsUS educationcommentShareReuse this content"

No wonder voters are turning on himTue 16 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 06.02 ESTShareTrump gave what was billed as a “Christmas speech” in rural Pennsylvania this past week that began with his “wishing each and everyone one of you a very merry Christmas, happy New Year, all of that stuff” and boasting that now, under his presidency: “Everybody’s saying ‘merry Christmas’ again.”He then claimed – contrary to the experience of nearly everyone in the crowd – that he had gotten them “lower prices” and “bigger paychecks”. He alsoassertedthat anyone having difficulty making ends meet should just cut back on buying stuff. “You can give up certain products. You can give up pencils … Every child can get 37 pencils. They only need one or two,” he said, adding: “You don’t need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice. You don’t need 37 dolls.”It’s rich – Trump preaching austerity while raking in billions from his crypto investments.“The only thing that is truly going up big, it’s called the stock market and your 401(k)s,” Trump continued, apparently unaware that 92% of the stock market is owned by the richest 10% of Americans while most Americans own no stock at all. Justover a thirdhave a 401(k), 403(b), 503(b) or Thrift Savings Plan.He was supposed to talk about affordability, but Trump’s narcissistic brain seemed incapable of the minimal empathy to recognize the public’s angst over the cost of living. So he veered far off the affordability script to attack Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota congresswoman, ridicule windmills, mock transgender people, and call Joe Biden a “son of a bitch”.Small wonder that most voters have had it with Trump. Even the Maga faithful are starting to have second thoughts.In Miami this past week, voters delivered the mayor’s office to a Democrat for the first time in nearly 30 years and rebuffed the Republican candidate, whom Trump endorsed – by a whopping 59% to 41%. Miami’s new mayor-elect, Eileen Higgins, said the city is “at the tip of the spear” of affordability concerns in America.In Indiana this past week, Republican senators rejected a redistricting plan that Trump had tried to bully them into accepting. He threatened to primary legislators who didn’t go along and even whipped up supporters to pressure them (including so-called swatting of their homes– hoax reports to provoke a police response – and even some reporteddeath threats).It didn’t work. Twenty-one senators from the Republican majority in the Indiana senate and all 10 senateDemocratsvoted it down.Even congressionalRepublicansare starting to desert him as they see that the wannabe emperor has no clothes: his ability to hurt or help them in next year’s midterms is rapidly diminishing.They’ve rejected his demand to end the filibuster, rebuked his incipient healthcare plan, forced him to cave on the Epstein files, won’t approve his bonkers $2,000 tariff checks for Americans, fret about his boat strikes off the coasts of Central and South America, and are in open rebellion against his hand-picked speaker of the House.Trump won’t steal Christmas, but it’s looking increasingly likely that Christmas will steal Trump.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

How much should big pharma pay your endocrinologist to prescribe a weight-loss drug?Or take something even more ubiquitous such as high blood pressure and cholesterol: of hundreds of brands to choose from, what prompted your cardiologist to prescribe the ones you take? Could it be money?In all these cases, you would hope the only factor in decision-making was straightforward: the specialist paired the right drug with the right patient and called it a day. It is also what every specialist wants to believe.Big pharma is taking aim at Australia’s PBS. Could Trump force us to pay more for medicines?Read moreBut when money influences so many decisions, why not pharmaceutical prescribing?This is an old conundrum with new updates, the latest of which comes fromAustralian researchers.Big pharma has long used payments to doctors to advertise its products. The payments are in the form of consultancy fees, advisory board meetings, educational sponsorship and coverage of travel, accommodation and entertainment.In 2016, Medicines Australia, the peak body representing the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry, mandated reporting of payments to doctors. It took some years (and a lot of courage) to subsequently launch an online repository to disclose the payments although only for three years from the date of first publication and excluding food, beverage and the broad term of “research”.In the three years between 2019 and 2022 (coinciding with the peak of Covid when the world had hunkered down), 6,504 doctors (4.9% of all registered doctors in Australia) received at least one drug company payment. The payments ranged from $30 to $300,000 with the median payment being $1,500. The total tab was over AU$33m.The specialists leading the list were haematology/oncology ($6m); cardiology ($3m) and endocrinology ($2m).There will be no sympathy for the neurosurgeons (we don’t have data on how device companies woo them) and medical administrators at the bottom of the list, but spare a thought for the harried emergency doctors caught in the crosshairs of abusive patients with no monetary frills to make up for it.Why does big pharma pay doctors?A reasonable explanation is that big business is compensating doctors for time which would otherwise be spent earning an income elsewhere. Doctors maintain that consultancy and advisory board roles provide an “in” when it comes to patient access to drugs and clinical trials.But what does the evidence show?Asystematic reviewfunded by the US National Cancer Institute found that drug company payments to doctors had a consistent association with increased prescribing of the paying company’s drug, increased prescribing costs and increased prescribing of branded drugs. However, such observational studies do run the risk of bias.Economists say that when a drug company pays a doctor it deems an influencer there is a spillover effect on the peers of that doctor. What is even more concerning is that payments increase prescriptions to both recommended and contraindicated patients.When it comes to patient care, it is not apparent to me that doctors with “access” to drug companies serve their patients any better. And if they can achieve compassionate access to an otherwise unaffordable drug or obtain exclusive access to a new, yet unapproved therapy, it raises an important question of healthcare ethics.Would you want your doctors to stay at arm’s length from drug company payments and rely on independent sources of information or have them view payments as incidental and unrelated to prescribing behaviour?Despite a lot of hand-wringing and some regulation, the group most opposed to the idea that drug company payments affect prescribing behaviour are doctors who refuse to believe thateven small gifts like pens and Post-it noteswith branding have an insidious impact. This is because, in the end, we are all human and want to reciprocate perceived generosity.The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is a taxpayer-funded gift to Australians.So why doesn’t the public say something?Australia’s medical specialist fees are ‘out of control’, Mark Butler says. Here’s why, and how to fix itRead moreBecause doctors retain enormous trust in society and the transactions happen outside public scrutiny. As a patient, I would be loath to even consider the idea that my doctor was being influenced by anything other than my best interest. When neither the patient nor society feels the impact of drug company payments to a few doctors, it seems safer to ignore the problem.But the truth is that every payment matters. Each time a doctor prescribes a drug that is unnecessary or suggests a brand that is more expensive than the alternative, the cost is borne by the taxpayer. Every dollar misspent on health is a dollar not spent on housing, education or transportation.Where hospitals and regulators have chosen to tread lightly, big pharma and individual doctors have used their discretion to behave as they see fit. To be clear, not all interactions are problematic but what constitutes problematic is highly subjective.Interestingly, when I have written such columns in the past, I have heard from pharmaceutical industry professionals who attest to a problem and report feeling conflicted. I have yet to meet a doctor who accepts money and thinks there could be a problem.Which makes me think that the solution to big pharma payments to doctors requires external oversight because it won’t be enough to say, “physician heal thyself”.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

Only a model that gives them hope will halt the populistsTue 16 Dec 2025 07.22 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 12.15 ESTShareHow much does Europe’s future resemble its gruesome past? That question was already pressing before Donald Trump retook the White House, and turned support for the European far-right “patriotic” parties into US policy. That is, of course, what his newly published National Security Strategy means, committing the US to “cultivating resistance” in European nations against the supposed “civilisational erasure” represented by immigration.With or without US interference, far-right authoritarianism is now an entirely plausible European future, unless there is drastic change. After all, it is already the US’s present reality. American exceptionalism once held that such an outcome was impossible in the world’s oldest continuous constitutional republic, with its system of separation of powers and no history of despotism. Yet the country is now ruled by a self-styled king, centralising executive power, weaponising the justice system,attacking civil societyandneutralising the media.The advance of the far right rests on a simple, corrosive premise. Since the financial crash, western publics have been encouraged to believe they are trapped in a zero-sum game, forced to compete for ever-diminishing resources. The far right’s message is brutally straightforward: if there is not enough to go around, why are “our” scarce resources being handed to migrants? Remove the undeserving competition, it argues, and the “indigenous” population will flourish once more.The facts say otherwise. On average, foreign arrivals are net contributors to European economies.Between 2014 and 2018, for instance, migrants contributed about €1,500 more per capita than European-born citizens. In Germany, without migrants thelabour force would shrink, condemning the country to an even deeper economic malaise.Facts, alas, mean little in the so-called immigration debate, particularly when mainstream politicians respond to far-right advances by echoing their language and demonising migrants – assisted by inflammatory and often deceitful media coverage. Economic pain provides rich fodder for demagogues, especially when people struggling to get by are persuaded that there is no alternative to the system producing that pain.After the cold war ended, the public was told that all plausible alternatives to neoliberal economics had vanished. Rolling back the state, cutting taxes on the wealthy, deregulation and weak unions were presented as unavoidable facts of life. Politicians insisted that globalisation had stripped them of agency: the markets now ruled supreme. Following the financial crash, the German-led eurozone imposed crippling austerity across the continent. When Greece’s Syriza government dared to rebel against this disastrous experiment, it was subjected to a bruising punishment – designed to deter others from following the same path.In France, voters hearPresident Macroninsist that they must work longer to preserve their social entitlements. Little wonder, then, that some are drawn tothe far-right National Rally’s promise to “reserve social assistance for French citizens”, or to“make all French citizens privilegedin their own country”.In Austria, as unemployment rises, claims that migrants steal jobs and drain social security echo ever more loudly. In Britain, a Labour government argues that support for pensioners and disabled people can no longer be afforded.No wonder Nigel Farage’s claimthat “[Keir] Starmer is choosing migrant benefits over winter fuel for pensioners” finds a receptive audience.The German elite long saw the economic travails of other Europeans as evidence of their fecklessness and irresponsibility. Yet Germany itself pursued a model built on wage suppression in the name of competitiveness, an almost religious devotion to balanced budgets, and chronic underinvestment. Add the shock of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the results are stark: growth has evaporated, living standards are under strain and the far-right AfD is surging, finding eager listeners for its message of prioritising struggling “natives”.Europe is a continent soaked in pessimism.Nearly two-thirds of German consumersfeel negative about the national economic situation. As political elites fail to deliver sustained improvements in living standards, security or the public realm, faith in democracy collapses. Just a quarter of voters in Britainare satisfiedwith how democracy works; in France, fewer than one in five feel the same.Across the continent, both the centre right and the centre left have left voters feeling trapped in a zero-sum world. Yet the reality is starkly different. The EU’s nearly 500 billionaires alone control €2.3 trillion in wealth. In thefirst six monthsof this year, their combined fortunes grew by more than €2bn a day. That the wealth created by millions of European workers is siphoned off into the assets and bank accounts of a tiny elite is not a law of nature; it is a political choice. But when it is treated as unavoidable, ordinary people understandably conclude that their survival depends on reducing competition for scarce resources – fuel for the far right’s rise.The stigma once attached to the far right, born of Europe’s nightmarish experience with fascism, has largely evaporated. The so-called cordon sanitaire – the idea that forces beyond the centre right are illegitimate – has been incinerated.The comforting belief that western democratic institutions, culture and history automatically offer a bulwark against authoritarianism should be buried. It is tempting to think that Hungary’s descent – its hollowing-out of democracy, the slow strangulation of independent media and civil society – could only occur in countries with a history of dictatorship. Trumpism bulldozes that illusion. It now seeks to use the power of a flailing hegemon to export the same fate across Europe.We face a stark choice. Either we end an economic model that condemns millions to insecurity and stagnation – or we risk losing democracy itself. The warnings could hardly be more explicit. Our failure to heed them may leave generations to regret the consequences.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsThe far rightOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeMigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

With climate tipping points approaching, time is running outMia Mottley is the prime minister of BarbadosTue 16 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 14.30 ESTShareThe timing is brutal. Just as the world celebrates the10th anniversaryof the adoption of the Paris climate agreement this month, new evidence shows that the world is crashing through the main defence that was constructed against climate catastrophe.The three-year temperature average is – for the first time – set to exceed the Paris guardrail of 1.5C above preindustrial levels. According to theCopernicus Climate Change Service, 2025 will join 2023 and 2024 as the three warmest since the Industrial Revolution, reflecting the accelerating pace of the climate crisis.As temperatures continue to rise – including in the oceans, where the extra heat fuels more powerful hurricanes – far greater catastrophes lie ahead as feedback loops push the planet past irreversible tipping points.We have already passed ourfirst tipping point, the progressive loss of warm-water coral reefs, on which nearly a billion people and a quarter of marine life depend; a development particularly relevant to island countries like Barbados. We are on thebrink of several more, including the death of the Amazon rainforest, the collapse of key ocean currents, and the loss of ice sheets leading to metres of sea level rise.Cutting methane emissions is the fastest and simplest way to slow near-term warming and prevent triggering more tipping points. We must also reduce carbon-dioxide emissions as quickly as possible, although much of the impact on climate will take effect in the medium to long term. In contrast, we couldavoid up to nearly 0.3C of warmingby the 2040s by eliminating the easily avoidable methane emissions, starting with those of the oil and gas sector. Combined with a tripling of renewables and doubling of energy efficiency, this couldcut the rate of warming by a third in 10 years and halve it by 2040, keeping the 1.5C goal in sight.View image in fullscreenFlaring, burning natural gas from oil production, in North Dakota.Photograph: Matt Brown/APThe European Commission helped launch theglobal methane pledge at Glasgow’s Cop26 in 2021, where today it and 159 other countries are supporting emission cuts of 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels. However, this is voluntary, and theUN has reportedthat current measures, even if fully implemented, would only reduce emissions by 8% by 2030 from 2020 levels. The urgency of the climate demands mandatory measures.It is time for a binding agreement for methane, starting in the oil and gas sector. Other leaders have joined this call, including Wesley Simina, president of the Federated States ofMicronesia, and Feleti Teo, prime minister of Tuvalu. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also voiced support for a binding framework and called for a global alliance dedicated to action on methane.Despite many past promises and pledges,methane emissions from the energy sectorcontinue to grow, making a binding agreement essential. Many of the pieces for an agreement are moving into place. Companies representing nearly 40% of global oil and gas productionpromised at Cop28in 2023 to ban routine gas flaring by 2030 and limit leaks to “near zero” by 2030. They include 34 national oil companies, suggesting that their governments should be ready to join an agreement that ensures their promises are honoured. The bindingEU methane regulationbans flaring – and soon will ban leaks – and requires robust measuring, monitoring, reporting and verification, both for domestic fossil fuel production and for imports.The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and leaders of more than 80 other countries will bedeveloping a roadmapto phase out fossil fuels, which should have as a first step eliminating methane waste through a binding agreement among willing nations.TheMontreal protocol, signed in 1987, can provide the inspiration. Besides putting the protective ozone layer on the road to recovery, that binding agreement has done more than any other to combat the climate crisis, mainly because the ozone-depleting chemicals it reduces are also powerful warmers. The protocol is on course toavoid 2.5C of warmingby the end of the century, a massive contribution. It was negotiated by a small coalition of willing countries, andconcluded in less than a yearafter formal diplomatic negotiations opened.The next step is to convene heads of state of willing nations to develop a roadmap in 2026 for binding measures for the oil and gas industry. An ambitious but challenging timeline would be to start negotiations among this coalition of the willing in early 2027, and adopt an agreement as soon as possible thereafter. As shown by the Montreal protocol, transformative change can begin with just a handful of pioneering nations, before spreading worldwide.A legally binding methane agreement for the oil and gas sector can prevent energy waste, while buying time over the next 15 to 20 years to build resilience as research to scale up decarbonising technologies to commercial level builds pace. This will give countries in the south with oil and gas assets the opportunity to use the one thing that can finance their way to net zero.Preventing methane energy waste makes sense for industry, and it makes sense for people and the planet. As Aristotle taught us, waste is a form of injustice. Preventing it is not too much to ask.Mia Mottley is the prime minister of BarbadosExplore more on these topicsFossil fuelsOpinionCop30Oil and gas companiesBarbadosMicronesiaEuropean CommissionClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

Labour’s plans for apprenticeships and training funds will turn this aroundPat McFadden is secretary of state for work and pensionsTue 16 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 11.17 ESTShareNeglect is a political choice, and one with deep human consequences.That is what has struck me in the early months as secretary of state for work and pensions. Graph after graph, slide after slide, all pointing upwards, on young people out of work, on mental health issues among the population, and on the decision by default as much as design that the response should be benefits rather than changing lives.Is this response good enough? It can keep body and soul together but it doesn’t change lives. People don’t live in a spreadsheet. There are human consequences to growing youth inactivity as well as financial ones. The number of young peoplenot in education, employment or training(Neet) grewby almost 50%between 2021 and 2024. The proportion is highest in the north-east and north-west of England, followed by the East and West Midlands, and those citing sickness and mental health problems has increased by 76% since 2019. Doing nothing would be to continue the pattern.Former John Lewis chair Charlie Mayfield – who headed ourKeep Britain Working review– has found that a young person on benefits loses out on around £1m in earnings over their lifetime and it costs the state a similar amount to support them. The work aspirations studypublished earlier this yearshowed that a majority of people on health and disability benefits suffer from low self-esteem and sense of worth.With a million young people locked out of work, the UK’s hidden jobs crisis is only growing | John HarrisRead moreThe bottom line is, we invest too much in failure and not enough in changing lives.And this is compounded by technological change in the labour market. Talk to any group of teenagers right now and you will find a high degree of concern and awareness about the impact of artificial intelligence and what it might do to jobs. Our task is not to hide from technology that is already here, but to try to position the UK as a welcome home for its use and development. AI will both destroy and create jobs, and our ambition should be to make sure it does more of the latter.Nor should we be insular in how we view this. Other countries face similar issues with Neets, but many have attacked the problem with much more vigour than we have, and have a far lower percentage of young people not in training or employment than we do. In the Netherlands, the proportion isjust under 4%– around a third of the UK level.Germany’s rate is 8%– higher than the Netherlands but lower than the UK’s. There is nothing inevitable abouthaving one in eight young peoplein this position.We have made a start on a new response here in the UK, by announcing ayouth guarantee backed by £820min funding to offer training, work experience and subsidised employment to young people out of work.On top of that, we will stop the decline in apprenticeships for young people, which havefallen by nearly 40%in starts over the past decade. Instead, we will make an explicit priority of apprenticeships for young people in our funding, and guarantee to pay all the training costs of their apprenticeships for small- and medium-sized businesses. And we will offer more short courses – known as sector-based work academy programmes – in priority areas that employers say they need.These steps form the biggest statement in years that the government wants to back young people and give them hope, rather than attacking them as shirkers and snowflakes.But to bring the Neets numbers down further, we will have to go further. That is why I have asked the former health secretary Alan Milburnto report on the issueof young people, inactivity and work next year.His task starts today, and is made more urgent as the numbers of young people reporting long-term sickness grow. The system the Tories built has produced the consequences we see now – offering claimants a choice between penury and being declared unfit for work. We need to change it – to move on from the neglect that has allowed the current pattern to take hold, and instead offer a policy answer that gives young people more hope for the future. The prize in changing course could be enormous for the young people involved, and for the country.Pat McFadden is secretary of state for work and pensionsExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionApprenticeshipsWork & careersJob huntingUnemploymentLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

After 46 years in the health service, no better time for an exit interview with a leading NHS trust chief executive, who has seen the best and worst of it. Nick Hulme is in brutal truth mode. He has one foot out of the door of hisEast Suffolk and North Essex NHS foundation trust, just as the resident doctors strike for the 15th time, amid a rampant flu crisis. Buthe’s off, his time is up.“I can’t remember a time when the NHS was at such risk,” he says. Labour has put in more money and staff, productivity and activity has risen a bit, waiting times down a bit, yet waiting listsstay stubbornly high. “That’s dangerous ammunition for Nigel Farage and the Conservatives,” says Hulme, “a narrative for people who want to kill the NHS.”View image in fullscreenNick Hulme. ‘He has survived many a 10-year plan, forgotten in a year or two, but enthuses about Wes Streeting’s 250 neighbourhood health centres.’Photograph: Pagepix LtdPrivate practice is soaring, but it fell steeply when Labour last cut waiting to historic lows. That could happen again. He says that at the “top of Bupa’s risk register is the danger that NHS waits fall”. He scorns politicianspromoting “choice”, when that would require spare capacity, and at the moment the system is running red hot. He’d be tougher on consultants keeping their lists long to fuel demand for their private practice, but the BMA andRoyal Colleges, with their professional silos, are hard to confront. “Look how theyoppose physician associates, used widely across Europe,” he says.He laments how in the pandemic everyone did everything, out of silos, acting up and acting down collaboratively: he thought it was a new dawn, but afterwards they went straight back to their restrictive practices. Once a shop steward for the now defunct National and Local Government Officers’ Association(Nalgo) trade union, he knows about demarcations. He started out as an 18-year-old porter, rising to a brief (unhappy) time inside Boris Johnson’s No 10.Our conversation covers familiar NHS territory of forever dilemmas and paradoxes. He is full of enthusiasm and frustration, strong conviction and infinite exasperation, struggling to make the system work despite rotating politicians with spinning targets, austerity and reorganisations. Hulme is exceptional, yet typical of many of the best public servants, confronted like them with the effects of poverty and inequality beyond his doors. His trust has a delightful cottage hospital in affluent Aldeburgh, worth a fortune if he dared sell it, boasting a dementia-friendly “peaceful sensory garden” kept by its many volunteers, who collected £320,000for a new X-ray machine. But his patch includes the poorest places, too: Jaywick and Clacton. “What couldn’t we do for Jaywick with those scanners. They have fewer GPs, too,” he says. A Clacton family just told him they wouldn’t go for smears or screening, as it took three bus rides with small children.These facts about warpedNHSspending priorities are hard but not impossible to change, he thinks. Poor places get less, the older patients dominate resources, maternity and children are neglected, shifting funds to prevention looks near unattainable when the public always demand more treatment. He says 70% of patients in his beds are over 65, with 75% suffering the diseases of poverty – smoking, obesity, diabetes, missed early diagnoses “and poverty itself”. The NHS spends expensively on the effects of poverty that could be more cheaply prevented. He would run a social priority list, treating “the Clacton postman’s knee, off work for a year, run out of sick pay, before getting the retiree back on the golf course”.Wes Streeting’s gamble with the NHS is greater than any play for Downing Street | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThe day we talked at Colchester hospital, he was bristling over an infuriating Care Quality Commission inspection after an interview checking if his trust is “well-led”. “But whatever their judgment, I’ll be gone!” The last inspection found Colchester “requires improvement”. That grates. He agreed reluctantly to add to his trust a hospital Jeremy Hunt called “the worst in England” and did well to lift it out of “special measures”. Marked down over documentation, he asked the inspector, who had no background in acute hospitals: “But did you encounter any poor care? ‘No’, he said.”Nothing is easy. His gleaming new £90morthopaediccentrehas mostly private-style single rooms, en suite. “But that costs 30% more in nursing than bigger wards.” He is disappointed that fast-flowing throughput hasn’t raised productivity more: some surgeons do four operations when they used to do three, others still only do three but could do five, under scrutiny from the new Epic electronic data system. “Why do some wards turn around an empty bed in 20 minutes, others take three and a half hours?” It relieves stress in a ward to keep beds empty, but people wait in corridors. “NHS work was easier when I began, and more fun,” he says. “Most patients weren’t very sick, staying in for two weeks after a hernia.” Pressure to raise productivity means chasing every unforgiving minute: electronic labels halve the time to take a blood test. “But what do they do with that extra time? Chat or do more tests?” he says.View image in fullscreenNick Hulme with the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, at Colchester hospital during the Covid pandemic, May 2021.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty ImagesThe orthopaedic centre is still not full: that requires the integrated care board – a local control system undergoing yet another interminable restructure – to close units in district generals to send patients here for better specialist treatment. Will that happen? He sighs, recalling a time he closed a dangerous A&E in a small hospital: it took 42 public protest meetings led by a local MP, and many doctors admitted in private the unit was unsafe, but not in public. He jokes that he would be a new Beeching (the man who shut more than 2,000 railway stations) closing district general units, to send patients to further off specialist centres. But others plead convincingly too for the decentralised familiar local.He has survived many a 10-year plan, forgotten in a year or two, but enthuses about Wes Streeting’s250 neighbourhood health centres. However, remembering similarclinic plansin Ara Darzi’s 2008 report, experience makes him wary: “Will hospitals swallow up all the money again?” A rumbling under AneurinBevan’s founding principle worries him most. “Unless the NHS improves fast, people will fall for charlatans offering snake oil alternatives. This is the best system, but not producing the best results.” He departs with hopes and fears – and sharp words for privileged resident doctors. “Not many have such a guaranteed very good job and pension for life, starting at £38,000, £109,000 once fully trained.” He thinks they forget their privileged state, out of touch with what others earn in the NHS.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionDoctorsHospitalsHealth policyHealthWes StreetingPrivate healthcarecommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it is time to let our guard downTue 16 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 11.21 ESTShareIn the early autumn, over pizza and wine, I had a conversation with a dear friend. He’s Turkish. We were in Ayvalık, a small town on Turkey’s Aegean coast, talking about cultural imprints, when he suddenly paused and looked at me. “You know what?” he said. “Whenever I ask you how you are, you never really answer. You go into a meta space immediately – talking about politics or about bigger things that worry you – but you never say how you actually are.”I’ve been thinking about his observation ever since, debating in my mind whether it was true – and I’ve recently reached the conclusion that, unfortunately, he was right.As much as I like to be perceived as an easygoing person, the question “How are you?” stresses me out immensely. I freeze when asked and wish we could just skip it. I’d be ashamed to dive into a deep analysis of my being – which, secretly, is exactly what I’d love to do. But that might be overwhelming for the other person and impolite – not to say unfair to burden them with my inner troubles. (I wasn’t raised by needs-oriented parents. I was taught to squeeze my butt cheeks, keep going, stay rational, and see things for what they are: grim and hard.)The good part: I’m under no illusions that I’m the only one like this. My odd relationship to the question, I suspect, is a German cultural phenomenon. As much as I despise generalisations and vague collective “we” talk – this is awematter.In most countries that I am familiar with – say, Turkey or the UK – people greet each other with a polite: “Hello, how are you?” No one expects much of an answer, just a friendly, harmless: “I’m fine, how are you?” It’s more of a social lubricant or a ritual than a real request for information. But inGermany, “How are you?” is anything but simple. It’s a sort of trick question. “I’m fine” is considered otherworldly, naive, shallow, delulu – and, most of all, dishonest. Who isfine, really? We feel compelled to answer truthfully while simultaneously debating how much to reveal and how honest to be without losing face.A typical exchange therefore sounds something like this:“How are you?”“Ach. I’m OK …” (pause) “Well …” (sigh) “Actually … did you see what’s happening in the news?”We digress, we stumble, we mumble. Why?Here’s my theory: we have a profound aversion to letting ourselves appear vulnerable, and a suspicion of superficiality. We can’t say something just for the sake of good vibes. Everything must be serious.Some might say that this obsession with depth is a good thing: no fake smiles, no empty politeness – and above all, precision. The German language has the ability to capture entire inner worlds in a single word. Who else hasWeltschmerz(a sorrow or melancholy about the state of the world), orGeborgenheit(the feeling of safety and warmth)? But do those words really serve as a display of emotional range – or do they function more like fortresses to hide behind, protecting us from actually showing how we feel?The friend I had pizza with in Ayvalık reminded me of that too. What’s the point of having all these beautiful words if you don’t feel them?To feelandto have, as he pointed out with a straight face, are two very different things.Over the years, as a journalist, I have interviewed many female authors and artists who grew up in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. Many told me that, in their childhood, “How are you?” was an absent question – no one ever asked it. I think our issue with it is an intergenerational inheritance. It is tied to the devastations of the first half of the 20th century, and to what is often called German angst – that collective tendency toward anxiety, pessimism and overcaution. It carries echoes of shame and postwar guilt, and it keeps us from opening up, from taking risks, and – most tellingly – from speaking up when it matters.The irony is that we love to talk publicly aboutVergangenheitsbewältigung– theofficial policy of “coming to terms with the past”. But what we rarely discuss is how that cruel history of Nazi Germany’s crimes and the two world wars has shaped us emotionally to this day. So, in a way, it’s not surprising that I – that we – can’t answer “How are you?” properly. We have issues.The author Heike Geißler,in her recent essay Arbeiten(To Work), also reflects on this loaded question. “The sense of overwhelm I sometimes feel when trying to answer that question – and realising: I don’t know. I don’t even want to know. I’d rather not say. What was once dismissed as a banal question is now burdened with a different accusation: it is impossible to answer – no one can answer it. Responding to it has become an act of effort, a declaration of stance, a confession of beingfororagainstsomething.”It’s a sad status quo. Because our reluctance around the question means we’re perceived to be cold, restrained, always slightly detached. We continue to miss out on those easy, warm, everyday exchanges with others. And those small, ordinary niceties matter. That’s what you sense first about an encounter: not depth, but atmosphere – how a brief interaction with someone makes you feel.My hope therefore lies with the younger generations – those who, thanks to Germany’s still somewhat intact healthcare system, have access to therapy and actually use it. They’re good at expressing themselves freely and at ridiculing the old idea of squeezing one’s butt cheeks and carrying on no matter what.They can’t say “I’m fine” either, but they say everything else – their feelings, worries, self-analyses. From my millennial perspective, that seems a much healthier and more truthful approach. As we reconnect with friends over Christmas and New Year perhaps we should also let our guard down, and admit the flaws we’ve spent generations trying to hide.

Regulars call it “church”, our Sunday ritual. The second class is basically lying down, and if you don’t leave high on Zen and vibes, you haven’t done it right.Leaving on Sunday, I started walking to my sister’s house. It was the first night of Hanukah, the Jewish festival of lights, and we were going to celebrate with family and friends. I’m non-practising in a religious sense, but I love a good cultural ritual, especially one involving doughnuts and fried potatoes.I had barely walked 100 metres when I heard a barrage of bangs, and people started running and yelling.“There’s a shooter!”“Run! There’s a shooter.”My yoga studio is opposite Bondi Pavilion.I started running back, hoping someone was still there. Falling and skidding across the building’s courtyard, a woman helped me up, and we ran together. Knocking on church’s door, I announced my name, and an angel hurried us in. Apparently, yoga teachers remain calm and comforting in crisis.At Bondi, every Jewish person’s worst nightmare came true. Can we still have a safe future in Australia? | Dean SherrRead moreThere were others there too, wide-eyed and ashen-faced. There were women from yoga, women not from yoga, a mother and her teens, four food app delivery drivers and a young man with a toddler whose wife was locked in the supermarket below the studio – a motley and terror-struck crew.“This doesn’t happen here,” the woman who helped me when I fell kept saying through panicking breaths, her American accent barely audible.There’s no phone reception in the yoga studio, which isn’t a problem until you’re hiding from shooters. We took turns calling loved ones from the one corner where a few shaky bars graced our screens. My sister picked up. My 15-year-old niece was missing.She had gone to the beach with friends and wasn’t answering her phone. None of them were. I tried to go out and look for her, but the whole building was locked down, forcing me back into the studio. It was the single most terrifying moment of my life.For a few hours, we waited, trying to leave when there was a lull in the symphony of sirens, only to be commanded back inside. Some lived just blocks away, desperate to go home. Others had wives in supermarkets and toddlers who needed their mamas. I wish I’d gotten more of their names.Before the coast was deemed clear, I learned two things.Distressing videos can have a lasting impact – here’s how to look after yourself in the wake of the Bondi attack | Ahona GuhaRead moreThe good news is my niece and her friends were safe, barefoot in swimmers in a locked-down cafe, their phones abandoned on the sand as they ran from the water.The bad news is my community is not.Shaking in a yoga studio, I imagined whoever was out there could be targeting us – Jews are to Bondi as fish are to, well, Bondi – but remembering the Westfield Bondi Junction stabbing rampage last year that turned out to have a different, still unclear, motive, it wasn’t a foregone conclusion.“They’re saying it was a Jewish party,” said a woman crouching in our reception corner.Did you know you can actually feel your brain rupture the moment your world explodes?After approximately one million years, the fortress reopened, my cousin came to get me and we were reunited at my sister’s house. My niece was still barefoot in swimmers, her trademark teenage nonchalance on full display, her inevitable trauma not yet stinging. I hugged her tight. When my sister embraced me, I burst into tears, unaware I’d been holding them in.1:52Prime minister meets the ‘Australian hero’ Ahmed al-Ahmed in hospital – videoSeveral hours after sunset, the traditional time for such things, we lit Hanukah candles and said prayers. We sat around the dinner table with friends and extended family as news came in about the wounded, the dead, the shooters and the mensches. We watched reels on repeat ofAhmed al-Ahmed, the undisputed MVP and a national hero, disarming one of the shooters with his bare, now legendary hands. My niece found footage of herself on TikTok.We talked, we cried, we had panic attacks in the bathroom. Lucky to be safe, to be together, to be whole.As I write, 15 victims are confirmed dead, among them a 10-year-old child, a Holocaust survivor and two rabbis. Many more are wounded, some critically, and our entire community is distraught, but not surprised.We knew there was an inevitability to this, a historical context for this, but our warnings of such fell on deaf ears. For two years, we’ve often been dismissed, mocked and gaslighted for alleging precisely this would happen. I invite everyone to sit in that discomfort.The horrors of Gaza are not undermined by acknowledging our humanity and right to life. The unconscionable death toll there is not diminished by expressing empathy for our dead and mourning here. It’s actually absurdly easy to hold space for everyone, everywhere, all at once.The story of Hanukah is one of hatred and destruction, but ultimately one of survival and hope. Thousands of years after its literary debut, it is also now about doughnuts and fried potatoes, which I vaguely understand and do not care to question.0:33Woman comforts child she doesn't know as Bondi shooter opens fire - videoHanukah posits that a candle lit in a ransacked temple with only a day’s supply of oil burned bright for eight days straight. While basic maths, ardent secularity and my fancy oil burner indicate this is improbable at best, I choose to embrace the miracle on this one.I need to believe in hope.On Monday, I held my niece’s hand at the site of the massacre, where people sang in Hebrew and flowers covered the ground. Looking back at my yoga studio, mere metres away, I couldn’t reconcile what had happened, how close we had been.Trauma literacy, life experience, and the annals of time say it will take a long time for everybody affected to process and heal, from survivors to first responders and everyone in between.I’m just grateful for my niece. And church.Happy Hanukah, namaste and Amen.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackOpinionJudaismcommentShareReuse this content"

Anything less will fail to honour the lives of those lost at BondiCharles Watson andRoland BrowneThe PM must show the same determination and commitment as John Howard following the Port Arthur massacre and abolish recreational hunting licencesMon 15 Dec 2025 20.32 ESTShareThe Bondi shooting has guaranteed that formulation of new laws to control gun use will be urgently considered at state and federal levels. It is well overdue. New laws in Western Australia provide an excellent model for such laws, and it is time we had informed national oversight of gun ownership and use.Anthony Albanese must now show the same leadership, determination and commitment John Howard showed after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, including a commitment to abolish recreational hunting licences. Anything less will fail to honour the lives of those lost at Bondi.Port Arthur saw the adoption of the National Firearms Agreement (the NFA), which was an important step in sensible gun control in Australia. Those shootings, by a man armed with two semi-automatic military rifles, followed a decade of intransigence from the Tasmanian and Queensland governments at the notion of gun law reform.Data reveals Sydney’s ‘frightening concentration’ of gun ownership ahead of the Bondi terror attackRead moreThe NFA – and the legislation that followed – introduced tougher licensing of guns, tighter gun storage conditions, bans on semi-automatic rifles and registration of all guns. It has been very effective at halting public mass shootings with rifles and shotguns. But while the agreement prohibited access to semi-automatic rifles, it permitted access to single shot high-powered rifles with magazines. This was one of the weapons used at Bondi.Sadly, most states and territories have still not adopted many of the recommendations of the NFA, and in some states, political parties representing shooters have sought to water down gun control laws. Additionally,technological changeshave allowed gun companies to avoid the NFA licence classifications, enlarging the range of rapid-fire weapons that are readily available in Australia.Most troublingly, a national gun registration system is still yet to be implemented some 29 years later. It is expected to be in place by 2028.But one state that has stood apart from the rest – Western Australia. In late 2024, the WA government introduced a comprehensive group of legislative changes to gun laws, which had one aim: to increase community safety. In formulating the new laws, the government was careful to take into account the legitimate needs of vermin shooters and some farmers.The WA law changes have forced other states to reconsider the deficiencies in their own laws, and the process will no doubt be accelerated in response to theBondi attack.The key issues now facing Australia in the wake of the horrific Bondi attack include the justification for getting a licence to own a gun and the type and number of guns that can be owned. These controls need to be backed up by nationally consistent data on guns and gun ownership. A critical issue is the category of gun licences for “recreational hunting”. This ambiguous and undefinable activity allows people to obtain gun licences for no real purpose except to entertain themselves.One failure in the 1996 National Firearms Agreement was that it allowed membership of a target shooting gun club to be a valid reason for obtaining a gun licence. This was a serious mistake. Gun clubs were immediately flooded with applications for new members, and the membership fees have helped to support shooters’ parties in state parliaments and to fund gun lobby groups who have a vested interest in weakening gun laws and promoting the sales of more guns and ammunition.We now know that theolder Bondi shooter held a recreational hunting licence. With that authority, he was able to legally possess six firearms. This form of licence must be abolished, with a buyback scheme like the one introduced in 1996 put in place to compensate affected gun owners.We cannot let more people like those in Bondi become victims of horrific gun violence.The ball is now in the prime minister’s court.Charles Watson is a public health physician and a board member of Gun Control Australia.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.On 19 December 1974, the writerLinda Rosenkrantzwent round to her friendPeter Hujar’s apartment in New York, and asked the photographer to describe exactly what he had done the day before. He talked in great detail about taking Allen Ginsberg’s portrait for the New York Times (it didn’t go well – Ginsberg was too performative for the kind of intimacy Hujar craved). He also described the Chinese takeaway he ate and how his pal Vince Aletti came round to have a shower. And he fretted about not being paid by Elle magazine.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So what did Ben Whishaw, who plays him in the new filmPeter Hujar’s Day, do himself the day before? The actor, on a video call from his home in London, rubbing his hands through his hair in a worried manner, says he could probably describe it in “about five sentences”, but after some persuasion attempts to give a flavour. “I got home from filming and I got the chicken that I’d cooked the previous day and eaten half of and I finished it. Well, not finished it but continued eating it and then had a glass of wine and fell asleep at half past nine. Boring. But, um, maybe there’s no such thing as boring.”Hujar was also acutely attuned to details, from light on the Hudson River to the hair on a drag queen’s shinsThis is a thesis the film tests to the limit. Directed by Ira Sachs, Peter Hujar’s Day consists entirely of 70 minutes of chat between Hujar and Rosenkrantz, played byRebecca Hall. The script is taken from Rosenkrantz’s transcript, which was rediscovered in 2019, when Hujar’s papers were donated to New York’s Morgan Library (Rosenkrantz is now 91, while the photographer died of Aids in 1987, aged 53). Hujar and Rosenkratz talk in his flat, lounging on the sofa and reclining on the bed, her reel-to-reel tape machine clanking and whirring as the sun goes down in what feels like real time.As you’d expect from actors of Hall and Whishaw’s calibre, the accents are impeccable and the intimacy of Hujar and Rosenkrantz is conveyed through the tiniest details: a look, a touch, a comfortable silence. Whishaw describes it as “a portrait of a friendship, almost a love story”. Some critics have acclaimed the film as a masterpiece.Lindsay Lohan recently praisedits “quiet beauty”. Others, however, may find it challenging to view in its entirety – although Whishaw says it can be watched like a video work in an art exhibition, with the viewer dropping in and out. “That would feel equally valid.”Usually Whishaw hates watching his own work, as his memories of making it overwhelm any enjoyment. However, he says, “I really love this kind of film. You can relax into it and there’s space for the viewer to drift. All the people he’s talking about we researched very meticulously, but I imagine that most people will be like, ‘Who the fuck is he talking about?’ So at a certain point, people probably go, ‘I’m just going to let this wash over me.’ It’s a different way of engaging the viewer.”View image in fullscreenIntimate … with Rebecca Hall as Linda Rosenkrantz in Peter Hujar’s Day.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyPeter Hujar’s Day was filmed at Westbeth, an artists’ community on the western edge of Manhattan where Hujar took pictures. Whishaw loves being in New York. “You feel like there’s a lot of libido,” he says. “There’s an energy that feels sexual – it’s something to do with the climate, that island, the people and the way it’s all laid out.” When he’s in the city, he likes to go to concerts, or to Julius, the city’s oldest gay bar. “You can always get a chair at Julius,” he says. “If that existed in London, it would just be rammed the whole time, wouldn’t it?”Sachs told Whishaw not to divulge exactly how long Peter Hujar’s Day took to film, as it was so brief – somewhere between a week and a month. Nonetheless, Whishaw certainly put a shift in. He had 55 pages of painstakingly recreated mundane chat to memorise, while Hall had a mere three. “I really enjoy that in art,” Whishaw says of this focus on the small stuff. “I’m reading these diaries by this brilliant Australian writer calledHelen Garner” – recent winner of the Baillie Gifford prize – “and they’re all tiny observations. But it changes your perception of life, because they point you to how life is really made up of tiny moments, even when enormous events are going on.”Hujar, whose pictures were barely noticed in his lifetime, was also acutely attuned to details, from fragments of light on the Hudson River to the hair on a drag queen’s shins. “I first saw his work on the cover of the Anohni and the Johnsons albumI Am a Bird Now,” Whishaw says. “And I had postcards of his pictures of men in drag. But around the pandemic I started to go, ‘Oh, all these images are by the same guy.’ There wasan exhibition at Maureen Paleyaround the same time, to do with performers backstage, and it was very beautiful.” So much so that Whishaw bought one of the works from the London gallery. “It’s him naked in a chair,” he says. “It’s quite unusual, because he usually stood when he did self-portraits, and he has a thread around his neck. I think he was starting to get into sort of witchy things for his health.”View image in fullscreen‘You could feel how extraordinarily intimate he was with his subjects’ … Hujar in 1986.Photograph: Bob Berg/Getty ImagesWhishaw loves Hujar’s work for the way it captures a long-lost queer New York bohemia destroyed by Aids (“like a portal into a time that might not have been remembered”); for his mastery of monochrome (“he talks about that in the film – the blacks and the greys, and the sorrow in them is beautiful”); and for the psychological insight in his portraits. Earlier this year, Whishaw went toa comprehensive show of Hujar’s work at Raven Row in London. “You could really feel how extraordinarily intimate he was able to be with his subjects,” he says. “I think that’s very moving.”He admires, too, Hujar’s refusal to compromise. “He was always trying to preserve the purity of his work. In the film, he talks about how someone likes something when it looks ‘real arty’, and he hates that – something obviously palatable that will look pretty on your wall.”View image in fullscreenLove triangle … Whishaw with Franz Rogowski in the 2023 film Passages.Photograph: Courtesy of SBS ProductionsWhishaw was working on Sachs’s previous filmPassages, about a man who cheats on his husband with a woman, when the director asked him to play Hujar. He agreed immediately. “I wanted to work with Ira again. I wanted just tobewith Ira again,” he says. “He’s someone whose company I enjoy. We share interests and we like talking to each other. So it just came about that way. And yeah, to work with a gay person is really nice.”Is it different from working with a straight director? “It definitely feels different if you’re making a project that’s about gayness or queerness,” Whishaw says. “And there are lots of beautiful gay directors – but notthatmany. I think it’s hard for them to make films. So it’s precious when you get to be involved with one.”‘He was a born member of the underground’: how Peter Hujar captured the New York demimondeRead moreThere aren’t that many out gay actors either, especially ones at Whishaw’s level of success. “No, not very many,” he says. “It’s complicated and probably different for every individual, but I think it’s still something to do with the fact that if you want to be really successful, you have to conform to what is deemed to be heterosexual taste, or something. Or be sexy in a heterosexual way. I’m always amazed by how much sex is underneath everything, actually. Or desire. There’s still a lot of homophobia and hatred. I mean, it’s better, but it’s still true. Also, who knows what journey people are on with these things? I don’t blame people for being private.”Whishaw is 45. Like a lot of queer people his age, he is somewhat haunted by the absence of the generation of gay men above him, many of whom died of Aids when they still had so much to contribute as mentors, teachers or father figures, and through work they never got to make. “I feel the lack of elders,” Whishaw says. “It’s like this massive gap, which is still so sad and shocking.” Hujar never took a picture again after finding out he had Aids. “He literally stopped the minute he got the diagnosis. Everything in the darkroom was left exactly as it was. It gives me chills to think about what would be behind that.”Peter Hujar’s Day review – Ben Whishaw goes low-key in snapshot of the photographer’s remarkable lifeRead moreIt’s especially sad, Whishaw says, because most artists keep working for as long as they can. The actor is certainly no exception. Next he’s doing a TV series, then a film, then perhaps some theatre, before possibly making something himself. “A dancer can’t keep going, can they? I mean, some people do and that’s extraordinary. But actors and photographers can keep going. And I think you can get better because you have more to offer about what it is to be human.”Peter Hujar’s Day is out in the US.

This is its 19th revival: the performance on 18 December will be its 295th at Covent Garden. Turandot tackles grand emotions and even grander themes: love, fear, devotion, power, loyalty, life and death in a fantastical, fairytale version of imperial China. And, of course, there’s surely opera’s most famous moment, the showstopper aria Nessun Dorma.“If the opera has depths, Șerban is content to ignore them, but for once it doesn’t seem to matter. The three-storey Chinese pagoda set, army of extras and troupe of masked dancers make his cartoon-coloured creation the nearest the company has to a West End spectacular,” wrote the Guardian’sErica Jeal reviewing a 2005revival.View image in fullscreenPuccini’s libretto states that the emperor appears among “clouds of incense … among the clouds like a god”. In this production he does indeed appear as if from the heavens, his magnificent throne lowered slowly to the ground.View image in fullscreen“Puccini wanted opera to be lyrical, and was sceptical of a lot about modernism, but with this he also looked forward – with many moments of dissonance and strange colouristic effects,” says the Royal Opera’s head of opera Oliver Mears, who thinks this epic production is the perfect introduction to the art form. “It’s a colourful, opulent spectacle that’s stood the test of time and after four decades, remains an outstanding showcase for great singers.”In this current revival, the role of Turandot is shared between Anna Netrebko, Maida Hundeling and Anna Pirozzi. Calaf, the unknown prince is sung by Yusif Eyvazov, Arsen Soghomonyan and Roberto Alagna, and Liù is shared between Masabane Cecila Rangwanasha and Juliana Grigoryan. Raúl Giménez is the Emperor.It’s a riotous virtuosic spectacle … visually stunning and theatrically accomplishedTom Service (2001)View image in fullscreenTurandot was Puccini’s 12th and final opera. “Its bones are bigger than in any of his other works: the chorus plays a larger role, the orchestra is larger, and Puccini is constantly reaching for an epic quality. In most of his other operas, it’s the intimacy, the small ensembles, that are most crucial. But here the set pieces with chorus are the main feature and it is these that make this opera so popular – the sheer spectacle of so many people on stage,” wrote Antonio Pappanoin an essay for the Guardianpublished in 2023.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Youth Opera Company, the Royal Opera’s in-house chorus of nine to 13-year-olds.

He’d written much of the third act, up to the death of Liù, but there were only sketches as to his thoughts on how the work should end. His student, Franco Alfano, wrote a completion that gave the tale a hasty and happy – if psychologically unconvincing – ending that reprised the famous Nessun Dorma aria. It is this ending (albeit a shortened version) that has been used in almost every production ever since the work’s premiere at La Scala, Milan, in 1926.View image in fullscreenAzerbaijani tenor Yusif Eyvazov has his hair and makeup done, and does vocal warmups in his dressing room.View image in fullscreenAndrei Șerban’s staging concerns itself less with the complex psychology of a work in which –as some have noted, the hero, Calaf, has a suicidal obsession with Turandot, while she is frigid, guarded and violent – and more with the spectacle.The action takes place amid shadowy watchers,  indifferent to the heartlessness that pervades the work up to its sudden happily-ever-after endMartin Kettle (2025)View image in fullscreenRussian soprano Anna Netrebko sings the role of Princess TurandotView image in fullscreenAnna Netrebko as Princess Turandot and Yusif Eyvazov as CalafAnd what of Nessun Dorma itself? It’s a fiendishly difficult aria with its high As and Bs - right at the top of any tenor’s range. A 1972 recording of Luciano Pavarotti singing it was chosen to soundtrack the 1990 World Cup hosted by Italy and it became a pop culture hit of epic proportions. The Three Tenors album is still today the best-selling classical album ever – some 12m copies were sold.The aria is sung by the unnamed prince (Calaf), who has won the hand of the unwilling Turandot by solving three riddles. But he poses a riddle of his own: if she can find out his name before dawn then he will give up his life thus releasing her from the hateful marriage promise. The princess turns the city upside down and tortures those who she thinks can tell her the prince’s name, but she fails. No one shall sleep (“Nessundorma”) sings Prince Calaf, “I will conquer” (Vincerò-ooo), and he does.View image in fullscreenAzerbaijani tenor Yusif Eyvazov as Calas sings aria Nessum Dorma.The gloriously idiosyncratic Good Opera Guide written by the lateSir Denis Formansummarises Puccini’s opera as “the one where a prince avoids decapitation by winning a word game, and nobody sleeps” and its setting as “Peking, China in the middle ages also fairyland.”View image in fullscreenDancers waiting in the wings.View image in fullscreenThe fantasy version of Peking might be fairyland but that didn’t stop the People’s Republic of China banning it until 1998 because it was felt the opera portrayed China unfavourably.Turandot is unlike Puccini’s other operas.

Debussy and Ravel heard Javanese gamelans at the Paris Exposition of 1889 and incorporated the sounds into their music, Van Gogh and Degas discovered the woodcuts of Hokusai and Hiroshige, Gilbert and Sullivan wrote The Mikado to coincide with a Japanese exhibition in London in 1885, and in drawing rooms bedecked with Japanese prints, Chinese screens and bamboo wallpaper, western hostesses in silk kimonos presided over jasmine tea and games of mah-jongg.”View image in fullscreenAnna Netrebko as Princess Turandot, waits backstage for the curtain call.View image in fullscreenYusif Eyvazov (Calaf) embraces revival director Jack Furness after the show.“Puccini’s unfinished opera is itself an enigma that resists decoding,” says Jack Furness, who has directed the past four revivals of Șerban’s production. “In this staging … each musical gesture of the score is reflected onstage with overt theatricality, imagination and flair, drawing on a range of world-theatre traditions. In recent revivals we have emphasised the deep links of both the story and production to the Italiancommedia dell’arte. And Kate Flatt’s choreography, which ritualises the drama and controls the flow of time, never fails to take the breath away.”View image in fullscreenTurandot is at the Royal Opera House until 4 February.Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It received largely negative reviews but the pair spoke about the important role it played in their lives.“What we tried to do is take the essence of our experience and what we all went through and make a theatrical drama about it, comedy too,” Robsaidat the time. “It’s a piece of fiction but it’s drawn from our lives.” Hecalledit “intense” and “difficult at times” but also “the most satisfying creative experience I ever had”.Nick said the film was “not my life” but that the character’s journey mirrored it in many ways. “I was homeless in Maine,” he said. “I was homeless in New Jersey.

It was not fun.”It details the difficult relationship between the son and his father and how the influence of those working within the rehabilitation system often created more problems. “If your kid is going through rough times then as the parent, your main job is to keep your child safe,” Rob said. “I would do anything.”He also said that while the father was loosely based on him, he hoped that he was “not as much of an asshole”. The father in the movie was played by Cary Elwes, who previously worked with Rob on The Princess Bride.“I wasn’t that shy about including some of the bad stuff,” Nicksaidof balancing the positive and negative aspects of his life.Rob added: “It forced me to have to see more clearly and understand more deeply what Nick had gone through and I think it forced him to see things that I had experienced during this progress. It definitely brought us closer together.”‘Not a second of wasted time’: Rob Reiner’s golden run from Spinal Tap to A Few Good Men was breathtakingRead moreIn the same interview, Nick said that they didn’t bond much when he was a kid but he got to understand him more during the process of making the film.At the time, when asked whether he had found his calling yet, Nick said “nothing’s popped up yet but we’ll see” before saying he had already started writing his next project.Nick didn’t write another completed film and when his father was interviewed by the Guardian last year, he spoke about his children and their difficulties in finding their own careers.“My son is 32 and my daughter’s 26,” he said. “They both want careers, they’re both talented. Should I lean into it? Should I back away from it? They’re confused. I said, once they find their own path, it won’t matter.”Nick supported his father at the premiere of Spinal Tap II: The End Continues earlier this year.Explore more on these topicsRob ReinerUS crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A deft balance is struck, with enough self-mocking silliness to endear herself and keep us entertained, but some arresting thinking too about Singh’s home country and its progress towards female liberation.That’s the subject under interrogation here, albeit refracted through the confusions and contradictions of a woman who grew up wishing to be a man. Few of the female role models on offer in India seemed terribly inspiring – and the one that did, a high-achieving distant relative, undercut her inspo standing with a very unsisterly warning against spinsterdom. No wonder our host swings wildly between pride in her independence well into middle age, anxiety that her descent into “crazy lady” status may soon be irreversible – and therapy sessions advising she reframe her sadness as a colourful personality trait.It’s engaging stuff, even for audiences like me, who could hardly be more of an outsider to the material. Singh also performs in Hindi, and her audience tonight includes many who could watch her in either tongue. I’m sure the material, suggestive as it is of a culture at a slightly different point on its gender-politics trajectory, is even more relatable to Hindi speakers, featuring as it does occasional asides and knowing gags about Bollywood star turned rightwing politician Kangana Ranaut.Singh has mixed feelings about her, just like her mixed feelings about everything else – except the inadequacies of the opposite sex, which can be taken for granted. We leave Singh being persuaded by a self-help podcast to connect with her “divine feminine” and reject the masculine rat race. It won’t go well: we know that by now. But in her heartfelt yet doomed attempts to square the vicious circles of freedom and femininity, singledom and self-improvement, there is plenty to amuse.AtSoho theatre, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsComedySoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Amateur TikTok edits resurrect forgotten gems and turn obscure starlets into sensations; home producers fabricate entire albums if their favourite rapper doesn’t release enough. Such is the case with Doom Xmas, the brainchild of Grammy-winning Spanish producer Cookin’ Soul, which refashions the work of late cult rapper MF Doom intoChristmasmusic. There are filthy Grinch soundtrack flips, hectic Latin Christmas skits and a chopped-and-screwed Nat King Cole that’ll change the way you hear The Christmas Song.It’s an internet cult classic. Every Christmas, a carolling cohort of underground rap fans make their way to the comment sections to write something like: “They playin’ Mariah already, I’m blastin’ Doom!” And although it’s bootlegged, the tape has a strangely festive air: it’s a hit of humanity in the wake of an AI music slopticon, and a reminder that community clings on, especially at Christmas.Archie FordeMF Doom: MF Grinch (Doom Xmas) – videoMariah CareyThe one constant in all my core Christmas memories is Mariah Carey. The earliest is from when we were stuck in traffic, and I was too tiny to see anything through the car windows except kaleidoscopic lights above. Through the radio, Carey is belting out Santa Claus Is Coming to Town – far more exciting than my nursery’s version of Away in a Manger. Years later, I’m back in a car – this time with a friend who’s just passed his driving test. We spend lunchtime cruising around the residential streets near our sixth form, windows down, blasting All I Want for Christmas Is You. That evening, his mum receives an email from school warning that her son “should stop trying to impress girls”. (He’s gay.) And then there’s decorating the Christmas tree with my now-husband for the first time. Carey’s hip-hop-ified version Here Comes Santa Claus was playing; he teased me for only listening to “funky” Christmas songs. What did he expect, the Pogues? It’s been my go-to ever since.Olive PometseyVarious artists – Chante, C’est NoëlVarious artists: Chante, C’est Noël – videoIn 2003, I was 14, my middle brother 12 and my youngest five. That Christmas, we took the latter’s first trip to Disneyland Paris. I remember it being so freezing that returning home with fewer toes seemed like a genuine possibility, the Indiana Jones rollercoaster being so dead that my middle brother and I went on it twice in a row – and this infernal song.There is a daily parade in the park, and from early November, it is Christmas-themed. That year, its soundtrack was the aggressively rousing, major-chord nightmare that is Chante, C’est Noël, which I now recognise to be a sort of schlager-adjacent choral toothache. It became a running joke how much my brothers and I hated the song, one my dad capitalised on by secretly buying the CD and repeatedly,gleefullyblasting it on the long drive home as well as many subsequent car trips, despite our shrieks of objection. To this day, the intro’s jingling bells and rhapsodic cry of “CHANTE!” can still make us significantly bigger kids recoil in horror.Laura SnapesEl Vez – Feliz NavidadMove over, Mariah! The cheesiest, weepiest, silliest, booziest European Christmas bangersRead moreThanks to its prominent placement in numerous Christmas playlists on streaming services, José Feliciano’s Feliz Navidad has become a festive staple in the UK, despite the nation’s general resistance to foreign-language music: it reached the Top 20 here for the first time last year. But growing up in the Midlands in the 90s, the closest to Latin culture we got was gawping at a sizzling platter of restaurant fajitas, and so I didn’t hear Feliz Navidad until a cover version was included on a 2000 Christmas compilation by indie radio station XFM. It’s by El Vez, a Latino Elvis impersonator who sings the “I wanna wish you a merry Christmas” chorus like a man rushing around to individual audience members, grabbing their lapels and leaving them beaded with his own sweat. When I eventually heard Feliciano’s version, it couldn’t help but feel rather stiff and polite in comparison, so I always reach for El Vez’s instead, to charge me up with the giddiness of a child ripping into what Santa has left them.Ben Beaumont-ThomasQueen – Bohemian RhapsodyView image in fullscreenStriking … Queen in the video for Bohemian Rhapsody.Photograph: David Levene/Guardian VideoWe don’t really think of Bohemian Rhapsody as a Christmas song, although it was the Christmas No 1 twice, in 1975 and after Freddie Mercury’s death in 1991. The first time around, I would have been four years old, so it’s testament to how striking Bohemian Rhapsody sounds that I still remember it, albeit entirely jumbled up in my head with the way the Christmas tree in the hall of our house looked at night: a proper 1970s tree – proudly artificial, with silver tinsel branches – with its blue and red lights reflecting in the glass front door and in the baubles, which were mirrored like disco balls. I distinctly recall sitting on the stairs after Top of the Pops had finished, my head still full of Bohemian Rhapsody, staring at the tree, lost in the sparkly wonder of it all, the theme music from The Good Life – which must have been on afterwards – coming from the living room. It felt magical: the way Christmas is meant to feel, but hardly ever does.Alexis PetridisLena Horne – Jingle All the WayThe yuletide soundtrack in our house comes with a huge dollop of cheese – lounge, light jazz, the edgier end of easy listening; laid-back holiday heroes such as Dean Martin, Count Basie, Julie London, Jimmy McGriff, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald, Elvis, Peggy Lee, Lou Rawls and Nat King Cole, easing through various arrangements of the same dozen or so songs. It’s like welcoming old friends back. You won’t get any more Christmas spirited than Lena Horne’s Jingle All the Way, a lively take on Jingle Bells with orchestration best described as “big band in dub”. Try to stand still. Or for the regretfully over-refreshed, there’s always Miles Davis’s superbly cynical Blue Christmas (To Whom It May Concern). Sample lyric: “Sidewalk Santy Clauses are much, much, much too thin …” For years now 1960s lounge songs have covered our festive spectrum and understood Christmas in a way only a dry martini can hope to.Lloyd BradleyChristina Rossetti/Gustav Holst – In the Bleak MidwinterView image in fullscreenA wintry scene.Photograph: Andrew Roland/AlamyIn the 1950s, Christmas with my mum in the rambling old house in which the two of us rattled around meant fireside warmth, mother’s jokes and fears and badly wrapped but cherished presents. We shared superstitious, God-devoid minds, but the beautiful Rossetti/Holst carol In the Bleak Midwinter mesmerised me, for its snowbound atmospherics and the narrator’s childlike desire to please awesome forces. I’ve sometimes played it on guitar at neighbours’ seasonal gatherings, usually with the intro – for a cheap laugh, not a personal revelation – “It doesn’t come much bleaker than my version”. My guitar guru, the great Wes Montgomery, was also my life-changing wormhole into the musical multiverse of jazz – his 1966 Christmas cover of Baby, It’s Cold Outside with Hammond maestro Jimmy Smith is cheesy but for a fan, it doesn’t date.John FordhamExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Christine Hazell is 88, has progressive memory loss, and had never made art until six months ago. She has since created more than 200 drawings, which have rapidly gone viral on Instagram, inspired a following, and will feature in four scheduled exhibitions. She is also Higgs’s mother.It’s the best example of outsider art I’ve seen in Yorkshire – made with real purity and no commercial motivationWhat began in May was an idea of Higgs’s sister Gaby, an architect based between London and York, where Hazell lives in a 17th-century terraced cottage. Discovering coloured pencils and drawing pads left behind by her now adult children, Gaby suggested her mum try to copy some family photos, to occupy her days. Hazell’s first drawings captured the faces of her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and family dog, Kizzy. Since then she has produced new drawings every day. “Mum can spend 10 minutes or two hours on each portrait,” Gaby says. Taken by Hazell’s absorption in this activity, she began sending them in phone messages to her brother.View image in fullscreen‘She says it’s her job to “spoil” perfection’ … Hazell’s portrait of her daughter, Gaby Higgs.Photograph: Christine HazellSince 2004, Yorkshire-born Higgs has lived with his wife, the American artistAnne Collier, in New York, where he is director and chief curator ofWhite Columns, the city’s oldest alternative art space. He was intrigued to discover that drawing had ignited something in his mother.“It struck me that these were significant drawings by an elderly person who had never drawn before. I’d be fascinated by anyone who began making art in their 80s,” he says of his decision toshare them on social media, as we sit at the kitchen table where Hazell creates her drawings. The fact that the artist is his mother – who no longer recognises her family members but is engrossed by the process of drawing their images – makes it all the more meaningful to him.Because of Hazell’s condition, what happens during that process is unknowable, but Higgs observes a certain progression. “She has quickly acquired a distinctive style and an independent view of the world by translating photos into drawings.” When making her portraits, she chooses what to leave out and what to amplify. “I made a video this week of mum drawing my nephews and niece when they were little,” says Higgs, “and she mentions how perfect they look in the photo. She says it’s her job to ‘spoil’ that perfection, which she does by disrupting it in her drawing. She also described her drawing of a cat that looked ‘like a nightmare’. It’s about giving her subjects a different face.”View image in fullscreen‘Never too late’ … Christine Hazell at work.Photograph: Gaby HiggsFor him, it vindicates the idea that we are all inherently creative: “Allow someone the time, encouragement and resources to be creative and it will most likely happen.”There has been a surge of interest among Higgs’ 65.3k Instagram followers, who react with wonder to his weekly posts of new drawings. Attracting praise from Tracey Emin (“Something so good going on here, and shows it’s never too late”), Pulitzer prize-winning art critic Jerry Saltz and Tate Britain’s director Alex Farquharson, the drawings have inspired collaborations with UK gallerists.Florencia Clifford and her partner Hugo Hildyard, who own and runPartisan, a York restaurant and exhibition space for emerging art, will show Hazell’s first selection, depicting 24 subjects from across Yorkshire, under the title Different Faces. “I was amazed when I saw those early posts,” Clifford says. “I knew immediately I’d like to exhibit the drawings if I could. Christine’s art is magical and moving – a freedom of expression without self-consciousness.”View image in fullscreen‘It only gets more interesting’ … a portrait of curator, publisher and gallerist Matthew Higgs, by his mother Christine Hazell.Photograph: Christine HazellNext July, London’sStudio Voltairewill show another group of drawings. “There’s such care and consideration in the line-making and the forms,” says its director Joe Scotland. “The fact that Christine has begun making art at 88 sits within our interests – creativity can come out at any age and we’ve been very influenced by White Columns in terms of broadening our platform of support.”Atthe Blacksmith’s Shop, East Yorkshire’s outsider art gallery, owner-curator Mark Ibson will include Hazell’s art in his August 2026 summer show. “It absolutely meets our criteria,” he says. “It’s the best example of outsider art I’ve seen in Yorkshire, made with real purity and no commercial motivation.” After that, Hazell’s drawings – whose latest subjects include musicians and actors – will cross the Atlantic to hang in White Columns.“It only gets more interesting,” Higgs says. “Mum is becoming more confident, more certain of the way she edits a photo into a drawing. It’s amazing that someone’s ability to visualise things can accelerate so quickly, when in other aspects of their life things are slowing down.”Christine Hazell: Different Faces will show atPartisan, York, from 17 December to 1 MarchExplore more on these topicsArt and designExhibitionsDrawingArtYorkshireAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And why hasn’t the single most calamitous cause of funding reduction been addressed?Tue 16 Dec 2025 13.03 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 13.05 ESTShareThe arts in England are underfunded, and were dealt a blow by Covid from which many organisations have not yet recovered. But that has been only part of the story. The sheer weight of required form-filling, the endless bureaucracy, the impracticable length of time it takes to simplybefunded byArts Council England(ACE) have caused universal frustration among those working in the arts. There is much talk of exhaustion and burnout.Many organisations have felt frustrated, too, by the strictures of ACE’s flagship strategy,Let’s Create, which, though admirable in principle, with its focus on participation in the arts, is perhaps tilted too far from recognising the expertise and individuality of artists and arts institutions. Especially in classical music and opera – where ACE has made crude interventions into the direction of the art form – the body has been widely condemned for overreach of its powers. As with many things in life, though, opinion depends on your perspective. Funding has been diverted to underserved areas, and grassroots organisations, outside the south-east. Unsurprisingly, those who have received support for the first time are better disposed to ACE than those who have had their funding reduced or cut off.Thereport on Arts Council England by Margaret Hodge, Labour peer and former arts minister, urges a bonfire of red tape. That will be welcomed. More controversially, she also recommends binning Let’s Create, the 10-year strategy designed to take ACE all the way to 2030, in favour of a simpler strategy that allows organisations to apply based on their own strengths, rather than endlessly banging square pegs into round holes.With Hodge’s language of “excellence and access to excellence”, those with long memories might remember Brian McMaster’s report of 2008,Supporting Excellence in the Arts, which similarly urged an end to box-ticking and a revival of trust in artists and arts organisations. Those with even longer memories might recallregional arts boards, which were abolished in 2001 in order to streamline the Arts Council’s operations. Hodge is proposing to revive a version of these bodies – once condemned as wasteful – in order to strengthen regional decision-making, though without, importantly, handing off powers to the political control of metro mayors. (Nationally and internationally important bodies, on the other hand, would stay within the purview of the central ACE operation, which could cause some friction.)There is often a sense with the Arts Council that it trundles off in one direction for a few years, only to be pulled back in the opposite direction, before the entire cycle begins all over again. Another revival of an old hit is a recommendation to reboot something like the oldCreative Partnershipsprogramme, which, between 2002 and 2011, put local artists into schools.The report has some sensible ideas to help plug the funding void in the arts, without simply demanding more money be coughed up from the Treasury, which in the current climate is unlikely to happen. These include extending existing tax breaks for touring (arts organisations like these tax breaks – they are straightforward and simply incentivise making things and performing them without adding all sorts of extra prescriptions). Ideas on encouraging philanthropy include increasing tax breaks for givers outside London (the vast majority of giving to the arts is in the south-east of the nation).The report is not exactly a ringing endorsement of Arts CouncilEnglandas it stands: banish your bureaucracy! Strangle your strategy! And still, England has not addressed the single most calamitous cause of funding reduction in the arts, which is the collapse of local authority support. (Though the report does recommend mandating local authorities to at least have a cultural strategy.) But Hodge does insist that Arts Council England is the right body to deliver public funding to the arts and should continue to exist. And she strongly reasserts its most central and fundamental principle, that it should be at arm’s length from government, protected from political interference.Explore more on these topicsArts Council EnglandArts fundingMargaret HodgeEnglandOperaClassical musicanalysisShareReuse this content"

The planet-sized movie franchise of Avatar continues to spin massively in the cosmos – yet without affecting the tides in any other world. Maybe Avataristhe cosmos and its originatorJames Cameronis the new L Ron Hubbard; the creator, or rather prophet, of a new belief system involving big blue creatures with pointy ears that flap and twitch when they talk, to whom we will all one day be required to bow down when they float past. And while the rest of the cinema industry has quietly abandoned 3D without ever quite admitting it, theatres showing James Cameron’s giant new three-hour hunk of nonsense are still handing out the 3D specs to the customers.The first film was about human invaders seeking to exploit and colonise the weird tall blue Na’vi people in another galaxy for their mineral resources by piloting “avatar” replicants into their midst. One of these pilots was Cpl Jake Sully, played by Sam Worthington, who fell in love with Neytiri, played byZoe Saldaña, and stayed behind as a Na’vi – thus infuriating his commanding officer, Col Miles Quaritch, played by Stephen Lang, who since then has died in battle but is now resurrected as a Na’vi avatar, looking scarily as if Vinnie Jones had joined the Blue Man Group. Quaritch’s teen son Spider (Jack Champion) has turned against him and lives with Jake and Neytiri as their adoptive child. In the second film, the Na’vi people found a new world of water. Now in this third film they face the new element of … fire. For the proposed fourth and fifth films, they will presumably tackle earth and wind.View image in fullscreenWitchy … Varang (Oona Chaplin) in Avatar: Fire And Ash.Photograph: 20th Century Studios/PASo the Na’vi have come into contact with a new and apparently quite unexpected leader: Varang, played by Oona Chaplin, who provides the film with a kind of witchy sex interest. She is the leader of the Mangkwan clan, who live in a volcano and are possessed by the spirit of fire and ash, a fierce destructive belief that survival can only be achieved by dominance. The bullish Quaritch makes common cause with Varang in his need to divide and subdue the Na’vi and gain revenge over Jake, whose treachery he can’t forgive, and so he gives Varang weapons. The film makes it clear with a post-coital shot that they are having bedroom relations, to which the only response is a mixture of “wow” and “eww”.As ever, the look of this film is impressive and yet strange. Billions upon billions of pixels have been crunched to create its huge, infinitesimally detailed digital world. Like Middle-earth, it is probably the key to the franchise’s great success but, presented as it is in motion-smoothed high-definition, it looks to me like a “making of” featurette projected on to the white cliffs of Dover. And when ordinary human faces appear, they seem bizarrely out of context, as if Photoshopped in, like seeing American movie stars’ faces on a poster advertising a panto.Edie Falcoagain plays the general, her face set in an unvarying expression of pop-eyed annoyance at everything that presents itself to her senses. As an actor, she probably thinks it’s the only way to get through this. Jemaine Clement has a cameo that oddly humanises the film.What we are heading for is yet another mighty struggle between the Na’vi and the evil human invaders, the “pink-skins”, and (as ever) it needs to be conveniently resolved by calling on the assistance of huge undersea creatures whose presence certainly levels the playing field. There are, admittedly, some dramatic moments that prevent this thirdAvatarfrom being quite the bland screensaver the second one was: we get an Abraham-and-Isaac-type crisis that makes Jake question what leadership really is, and also a Holmes-v-Moriarty-at-the-Reichenbach-Falls-type confrontation. Yet audiences may find Quaritch’s decision-making a touch eccentric, and the beginning of the fourth film is now going to be bogged down with a long and contrived explanation about what happened to him.

Diversity also slipped for performers, with white actors cast in 80% of all roles.In contrast, nearly all other races and ethnicities were underrepresented as leads in top shows or as show creators: among the 222 scripted series surveyed, only 49 were made by women, with creators of color only accounting for 8%. The report overall found decreased opportunities for female actors and people of color in front of the camera, despite minority households and female audiences driving viewerships for top series.The report indicates a sharp reversal from the strides made in the aftermath of the nationwide 2020 Black Lives Matter protests over the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. That year, many streaming companies, as well as broadcast and cable networks, instituted programs to increase diversity or invested in efforts to develop projects by or showcasing more people of color, particularly Black people.Those efforts have been largely abandoned in the wake of Donald Trump’s re-election and his administration’s legal efforts to punish so-called DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs. Disney, Amazon, Paramount and Warner Bros were among the companies that discontinued long-standing DEI programs in the past year.“Unfortunately, this wasn’t unexpected, especially with the election results in 2024,” wrote Darnell Hunt, executive vice-chancellor and provost at UCLA, in the report.Hunt, who co-founded the study, added: “When you shut the door on diversity, you shut out opportunities for more perspectives, collaboration, exploration and growth. Without vigilance and pressure, the industry will continue to invest less and less in these creators and stories to the detriment of their bottom line.”However, despite the continued slip in diversity behind the camera, the study found that underrepresented storylines – regardless of the lead actor’s gender – increased in 2024. It cited numerous shows led by men, such as Apple’s Ted Lasso and HBO’s The Penguin, which devoted rich secondary storylines to female characters.“Even as diversity drops overall, we find that the stories are still there,” said co-author Nico Garcia, a doctoral candidate in cinema and media studies. “When there are good and relatable stories, people watch regardless of who plays the lead.”The study noted that such storylines, particularly among women, netted higher engagement on social media, with HBO’s House of the Dragon and Netflix’s Bridgerton as prominent examples.“If a show features some kind of underrepresented story, such as a women-centered story, the median total interactions for these shows were talked about on social media more than five times than shows without,” said co-author Michael Tran, a sociologist.Thecontentious bidding waramong Netflix, Paramount and others over the purchase of Warner Bros, which owns HBO among other valuable intellectual property, has cast further doubt over the future of diversity efforts in Hollywood. Numerous industry groups, trade unions and anti-trust experts have claimed that a merger between any two major companies, particularly Netflix and Warner Bros, would hurt creative competition.In a statement criticizing Netflix’s proposal to purchase the historic studio last week, the Writers Guild of America’s east and west units warned that “the world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent. The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers.”Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTelevision industryTelevisionRaceTrump administrationGenderWomennewsShareReuse this content"

It also returns him to the world of aliens, previously explored in films such as War of the Worlds, ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.“It’s like old-school Spielberg,” O’Connor recentlysaidin an interview. “I think people will be excited.”Earlier this year, Koepp called the film “a very emotional experience”.“I finished reading the script and I bawled,” Domingosaid. “I thought it was one of the most beautiful scripts about our humanity. I think it was just the most beautiful film about our humanity, and I literally cried because Steven Spielberg believes in the possibility of the human beings we could be.”The marketing campaign has coincided with the success of hit documentaryThe Age of Disclosurewhich alleged a government cover-up over the existence of alien life. It recently broke a record to become the most-rented documentary in its first 48 hours of release on Amazon Prime Video.Billboards have recently cropped up in Times Square for the movie and the trailer will play before the latest Avatar movie this month.Disclosure Day will be out in cinemas in the summer of 2026, a season that will also see the release of blockbusters including Toy Story 5, Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey, Minions 3, Supergirl, a live-action Moana and He-Man: Masters of the Universe.Explore more on these topicsSteven SpielbergEmily BluntColin FirthJosh O'ConnorScience fiction and fantasy filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nick Reiner, 32, was arrested around 9.15pm the same day, and remains in custody without bail.Obama also addressedthe social media post by President Trump, calling Rob Reiner “deranged”, which has drawn widespread condemnation across the political spectrum. Obama said: “Let me just say this: unlike some people, Rob and Michele Reiner are some of the most decent, courageous people you ever want to know. They are not deranged or crazed.”She added: “What they have always been are passionate people who – in a time when there’s not a lot of courage going on – they were the kind of people who were ready to put their actions behind what they cared about. And they cared about their family. And they cared about this country. And they cared about fairness and equity. And that is the truth.”Barack Obama had previouslyposted a statement about the Reiners on social media, saying: “Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired.”Among a flood of celebrity tributesto Reiner,Jerry Seinfeld posted a message on social mediaacknowledging Reiner’s role in the success of his sitcom Seinfeld, which was produced by Reiner’s company Castle Rock Entertainment. Seinfeld wrote: “Our show would have never happened without him. He saw something no one else could. When nobody at the network liked the early episodes, he saved us from cancellation.”Seinfeld added: “That I was working with Carl Reiner’s son, who happened to be one of the kindest people in show business, seemed unreal. I was naive at the time to how much his passion for us meant. Rob and Michele married right as our show was starting and they became an imprint for me of how it’s supposed to work, each one broadening the other. Their death, together, is impossibly sad.”Explore more on these topicsFilmRob ReinerMichelle ObamaBarack ObamaJerry SeinfeldSeinfeldComedyShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Mahmud Turkia/AFP/Getty ImagesIt is hoped the institution can help foster new bonds in a fractured nation, but such optimism will be a stretch for someByPatrick Wintourin TripoliTue 16 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 00.02 ESTShareIt was a night at the museum like no other. As the staccato sound of firecrackers and explosions rang out across Martyr’s Square in the heart of Tripoli, for once it was not Libya’s militias battling it out for a larger stake in the country’s oil economy, but a huge firework display celebrating the reopening of one of the finest museums in the Mediterranean.The National Museum of Libya – housing Africa’s greatest collection of classical antiquities in Tripoli’s historic Red Castle complex – had been closed for nearly 14 years due to the civil war that followed the former dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s downfall. Its ceremonial reopening came at the climax of a lavish show compressing Libya’s rich history and attended by diplomats and Arab celebrities, with a full-size Italian orchestra, acrobats, dancers, arches of fire and lights projected on to the fort. It did not lack for circus drama or cost, peaking with a billowing Ottoman sailing ship arriving high above the port on wires to be greeted by an angelic-appearing Libyan woman.View image in fullscreenA fireworks display during the reopening ceremony.Photograph: Libyan government platform/ReutersAbdul Hamid Dbeibah, the prime minister of Libya’s UN-recognised government of national unity – Libya has two rival governments, one in the east and one in the west – was then taken to the doors of the museum, where he wielded a big stick, as if at the opening of the British parliament, to hammer on them and demand entry. The giant wooden doors drew open slowly and crowds poured in.Inside, Libya’s history revealed itself – a record of a vast country shaped by successive occupations from Greek to Roman, Ottoman and Italian. On its four floors could be found cave paintings worthy of Lascaux; 5,000-year-old mummies from the ancient ​settlements of Uan Muhuggiag ⁠in Libya’s deep south; tablets in the Punic alphabet; and countless treasures from the still largely unvisited Roman coastal cities of Leptis Magna and Sabratha, including spell-binding mosaics, friezes and statues of great public figures and gods. Gone, however, was Gaddafi’s turquoise VW beetle, once given pride of place in the collection and one of the museum’s fewlosses to the uprising.Speaking the next day in offices once occupied by Italian archeologists on the top floor of the Red Castle, Dr Mustafa Turjman, the former head of the department of antiquities, recalled evacuating all the museum’s works to secret hideaways to keep them from robbers and smugglers. He admitted there was hesitation about the reopening, after artefacts from the tiniest coin to giant statues were brought back from hiding.View image in fullscreenVisitors at the National Museum in Tripoli.Photograph: Libyan government platform/ReutersTurjman said the museum showed people what Libya had once been – a region of great cultural and economic self-confidence, well connected to the world beyond the sea. “We are part of the Mediterranean,” he said.This was not just a moment for classicists, or lovers of Libya’s rich history, Turjman said, but a moment for a country riven between its eastern and western regions to come together. “This is a museum about the whole of Libya … the archaeological masterpieces of the whole country. It is a force for unification,” he said. “So when people from Tripoli [in the west] come here they see statues from [the eastern region of] Cyrenaica, and when Cyrenaicans come they see their heritage, so it helps reunify the two regions … We are relatives. Their cousins are here and out cousins are here.”Turjman hopes the museum will help educate Libyans after the distorted teaching of the Gaddafi era, and the first few weeks of the museum’s opening is dedicated to bringing in schoolchildren. “The most important thing is teaching the mind. Teaching how to respect time and history, and how to respect others, and to be involved in the world,” he said. “We have to build the minds. My generation studied the philosophy of the Greeks as part of our heritage, but this stopped. Libya is often an arid remote region, but we kept this heritage: it shows our willpower.”View image in fullscreenStatues in the National Museum.Photograph: Libyan government platform/ReutersPersuading the world to see Libya “through optimist’s eyes”, as the government slogan puts it, could be a tough ask. True, embassies are reopening, as are long-closed luxury hotels. The British oil multinational BP has reopened its office and new oil investments are planned. Luxury waterfront marinas have been built. A drive-in food complex has sprung up. But there is much to overcome.A Libyan passport provides free passage to virtually nowhere and the country remains close to the bottom of world league tables for press freedom and corruption. On the museum’s opening night a notorious people smuggler, Ahmed al-Dabbashi, was reported shot dead in a gunfight with Libyan security forces inSabratha. Australia only last week advised its citizens to stay away; in Tripoli’s al-Madina souq some of the shops say they are open only two hours a day due to the lack of visitors.Dbeibah is disarmingly frank in interview about his country’s failings, including the arrest of three of his ministers in a corruption investigation, even if he insisted spending was transparent down to the last dinar. He admitted the country’s inability to shake off its dependency on the oil economy meant that 2.5 millions Libyans were on the government payroll – roughly a third of the population. Distorting but popular subsidies also mean petrol is cheaper than water, costing less than £1 to fill a tank. The price makes it a target for smuggling that the various auditing agencies seem incapable of preventing.View image in fullscreenThe official reopening came at the climax of a lavish ceremony.Photograph: Mahmud Turkia/AFP/Getty ImagesPressed on why the east and west of the country had set up conflicting parallel institutions since the 2014 uprising, he blamed politicians and not the people.Dbeibah has not been elected to office. Becoming prime minister in 2021 as part of a UN-supervised process, he was due to stay in power only until elections across the country could be held. But a parliament or president with a meaningful mandate remains a distant prospect so long as the political elite in east and west prefer the personal riches disunity brings.The UN Libya mission is organising “a structured dialogue” in an effort to reconcile the country ahead of elections possibly next year, but Dbeibah says he opposes holding a vote until there has been a referendum on a new constitution. The merry-go-round of west and east setting preconditions for elections never stops. One Libyan official said: “Libyans have no clue about politics. Gaddafi prevented that.”View image in fullscreenDbeibah knocking on the museum door.Photograph: Libyan government platform/ReutersOne of the very first visitors to the museum was theEgyptian comedian and TV host Bassem Youssef, who has millions of social media followers and has appeared on Piers Morgan’s TV show to speak about the Gaza war.He said it had taken time to convince his wife it would be safe to visit Libya, and reflected on “the rectangular screen in our pockets that shapes our consciousness and minds”. He said Libya was in the news only when it was embroiled in conflict or other problems, and when things calmed down the media were no longer interested. It was as if for an Arab country to be in the news, something had to be wrong, he said.“The image of any country or society has nothing to do with the reality on the ground, but rather with the lens through which one sees reality,” he said. “Unfortunately, we must admit that this lens, which transmits the image of most of our Arab countries, is broken, cracked and distorted.”Explore more on these topicsLibyaMiddle East and north AfricaAfricaMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

Artists who have opposed any dilution of their copyright include Sam Fender, Kate Bush and the Pet Shop Boys. Campaigners to protect artists’ copyright have voiced fears that ministers have paid too much attention to US tech companies’ interests.The US president, Donald Trump, hassaid: “We have to allow AI to use that [copyrighted] pool of knowledge without going through the complexity of contract negotiations,” and warned international governments not to “make rules and regulations that … make it impossible” for AI companies to do business.Last month Paul McCartneystepped upthe campaign to protect copyright by releasing a new recording, which was almost entirely silent save for some ambient clattering in the studio as a protest against copyright theft by AI companies.Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament on Monday there was “no clear consensus” on the issue and the government would “take the time to get this right”, and promised to make policy proposals by 18 March 2026.“Our approach to copyright and AI must support prosperity for all UK citizens, and drive innovation and growth for sectors across the economy, including the creative industries,” she said. “This means keeping the UK at the cutting edge of science and technology so UK citizens can benefit from major breakthroughs, transformative innovation and greater prosperity.“It also means continuing to support our creative industries, which make a huge economic contribution, shape our national identity and give us a unique position on the world stage.”But campaigners for copyright holders said the consultation response set a clear course for the government to take.“This is an overwhelming show of support for the commonsense position that AI companies should pay for the resources they use, and a total rejection of the government’s ‘preferred option’ of handing AI companies the work of the UK’s creatives for free,” said Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for copyright fairness.“Liz Kendall should listen to the people and rule out changing copyright law to benefit AI companies.”Owen Meredith, the chief executive of the New Media Association, urged Kendall to rule out any new copyright exception and end the uncertainty created by “this prolonged process”.“This will send a clear message to AI developers that they must enter into licensing agreements with the UK’s media and creative copyright owners, unlocking investment and strengthening the market for the high-quality content that is the most valuable ingredient in producing safe, trustworthy AI models,” he said.Last month, Kendall indicated she was sympathetic to artists’ demandsnot to have their copyrighted works scraped by AI companies without payment and wanted to “reset” the debate. “People rightly want to get paid for the work that they do,” she said, and “we have to find a way that both sectors can grow and thrive in future”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingIntellectual propertyShareReuse this content"

But amid the torture there are beautiful moments to treasure in this  much-loved Aussie dramaRachel AroestiMon 15 Dec 2025 19.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 00.06 ESTShareAs a teenager, Oly Chalmers-Davis weathered her fair share of motherhood-related horrors. For a start, the high-achieving 16-year-old went into labour in the school toilets, having not even realised she was pregnant. Not long afterwards, she was forced to tell her boyfriend he wasn’t the father – the baby was the product of a fling with another classmate. Then, unable to entertain the prospect of her perfect grades slipping, she decided to juggle studying with looking after a newborn, all the while navigating mastitis, mockery from her classmates (including some inventively mean-spirited memes) and a rocky on-off romance with her child’s dad, Santi.After five series following Oly (Nathalie Morris) and Santi (Carlos Sanson Jr) as they struggled to adjust to parenthood, hit Australian comedy-drama Bump wrapped things up last December – yet we were left on a cliffhanger. Recently married and with little Jacinda (Ava Cannon) well into primary school, the pair were preparing to welcome another child. Now the show is back for a feature-length festive special, picking up the story eight weeks after the birth of their son.When it came to baby number two, things should have been so much simpler. Unfortunately, Oly and Santi seem to be masochists. Instead of enjoying Christmas at home in Sydney, they opt to fly halfway around the world to Colombia (40 hours in transit, all in all), before embarking on a 10-day cruise. Did I mention they have a newborn baby?View image in fullscreenPaula Garcia as Rosa in Bump: A Christmas Film.Photograph: BBC/Stan/John PlattIf you’re wondering why, well, here’s where things get a little complicated. Over the course of Bump’s existence, it’s not just Oly and Santi who have experienced dramatic upheaval. The former’s parents, Dom (Angus Sampson) and Angie (Claudia Karvan,who co-created the series with journalist Kelsey Munro), took on their fair share of childcare after Jacinda was born, but Angie still found time to have an affair with Santi’s dad, Matías (Ricardo Scheihing Vasquez), a fellow teacher at her daughter’s school. And then, having contributed to the break-up of Matías’s marriage to Santi’s sharp-tongued stepmum, Rosa (Paula Garcia), Angie decided to shack up with Dom’s sister, Edith (Anita Hegh).Claudia Karvan: ‘I’m a hashtag lazy girl … It’s a priority I set for myself’Read moreNo, you’re absolutely right – that doesn’t explain why a two-month-old is on a South American cruise ship. Although I should add that most of the aforementioned characters are on it with him, plus Oly’s freewheeling elder brother Bowie (Christian Byers) and Rosa’s two moody teenage sons. It is, in fact, the melodramatic and hilariously brutal Rosa who has organised the trip back to her much-missed homeland (although why she is taking her stepson’s wife’s father and not her own boyfriend is unclear). For Rosa, this is a chance to show her children the country she loves – and to sell the place to Bump’s viewers in the form of a series of camp, fourth-wall-breaking monologues, in which she outlines the country’s strengths (“the best people, the best food, the best coffee, the best wildlife” and “the best Christmas!”) and angrily brushes off its perceived flaws (cocaine trafficking simply “doesn’t happen any more”).Christmas on a cruise turns out to be hellish. Amazingly tolerant in many ways (especially regarding the relationship between his sister and his ex-wife), Dom is driven to distraction by a ridiculously loud PA system in his tiny room and the captain’s decision to confiscate his alcohol. Cancer survivor Angie has decided to write a memoir, which Oly offers to edit as an escape from parental duties – only to realise it’s full of complaints about her behaviour as a teenage mother. Santi, meanwhile, gets competitive when a dreamboat crew member begins flirting with Oly; Edith gets jealous when Rosa and Angie call a truce; and Rosa is devastated when she loses her miniature baby Jesus, a gift from her grandmother. Elsewhere, multiple people vomit and Oly is utterly exhausted (ever the know-it-all, she furiously informs her husband that breastfeeding is the equivalent of running 11km per day).Ultimately, however, the trip ends up feeling like a success. That will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with Bump’s MO: this is a show about how families can rupture beyond all recognition, and how love can still bloom in the gaps. For all the improbable events that form the foundation of this special (not to mention Rosa’s jarring interludes, which I had to double-check weren’t actually sponsored by the Colombian tourist board; they’re not), Bump remains impressively emotionally resonant. First, because the laid-back Aussie charm offsets the ludicrously labyrinthine interpersonal drama; second, because at the show’s core is a frank and refreshingly realistic depiction of a mother-daughter relationship. This film ends with an understated, jocular and yet quietly devastating conversation between Oly and Angie, in which the latter reflects on the difficult and beautiful lessons motherhood has taught her. In Bump, things are far from perfect – but they’re still good.Bump: A Christmas Film aired on BBC One and is available on BBC iPlayer. In Australia it is streaming on Stan.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV comedyDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

A great populariser and advocate of the humanities in public life, he has done for Dante what his Bard colleague Daniel Mendelsohn did for Homer inAn Odysseyand other books.This short volume tells the story of the Hospital of the Innocents in Dante’s home town of Florence, a building Luzzi has been fascinated by since encountering it in 1987 on his college year abroad. The Innocenti, as it is known, was the first institution in Europe devoted solely to the care of unwanted children. The first foundling, named Agata because she was left by its gates on Saint Agata’s Day 1445, had been nibbled at by mice.At the time, children made up half the population of Florence, and many were abandoned. The church demanded “be fruitful and multiply” and condemned the use of contraception, which was primitive anyway. Babies were left inside church doorways, dumped in rivers and chucked on to rubbish tips. They were, in the lively Tuscan vernacular, thegittatelli– the thrown-away ones. Many were the result of unwanted sexual advances, especially on servants by their masters. In a fiercely patriarchal society, the majority of children deposited at the Innocenti were girls. The mothers would break a coin in two and hang one half round the baby’s neck in the hope of meeting them again.The Innocenti, like the city itself, mixed high-minded motives with utilitarian and cruel onesThe Innocenti was built by the Silk Weavers Guild in an era when the contribution that wealthy Florentines were expected to make to civic life was measured in counting-house ledgers like “a business’s gains and losses”. The building had arches designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, architect of the Duomo, and it housed (and still houses) works by the greatest artists of the Renaissance: Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, Piero di Cosimo, Andrea and Luca della Robbia. By caring for and educating its children, the Innocenti saved many of them from poverty, sex work or trafficking. And it lessened some of the stigma of illegitimacy, which in Renaissance Italy meant to be “born without honor, a status equivalent to a living death”. To suggest, as the book does in its subtitle, that the Innocenti “discovered” our modern idea of childhood feels a stretch. But it did contribute to the now accepted notion that the fate of every child matters, and inspired similar institutions across the world, including Thomas Coram’s Foundling Hospital, established in London in 1739.Luzzi mostly tells the story straight, without the blend of memoir and scholarship that characterises his previous books. He does make brief reference to where his interest in caregiving comes from: he became a father and widower on the same day, when his heavily pregnant wife was killed in a car crash, and his mother and sisters helped him raise his daughter. For more on that compelling story, I recommend his book In a Dark Wood.But this book mostly paints a wonderfully sensual and cinematic picture of early modern Florence in all its grubby, gorgeous detail. The Innocenti, like the city itself, mixed high-minded motives with utilitarian and cruel ones. It farmed out babies to wet nurses, who would use them as cash cows, almost starving them and sometimes even collecting payments after they had died. And it spent its donations on expensive art while feeding its charges on bread and water, the bread made not with flour but with the bran they also fed to the mules. The boys were taught a well-rounded curriculum of maths, Ciceronian rhetoric and music; the girls learned to weave and were pushed into a life of domestic service, even when the hospital’s directors knew that this opened them up to sexual exploitation.The Innocenti emerges as an absorbing case study in how the beautiful frescoes, arching columns and paintings of the Italian Renaissance masked “the sweat and suffering of forced labor, the raping of slaves, the abuse of children”. The words of the German critic Walter Benjamin might have been this book’s epigram: “There is no document of civilisation which is not at the same time a document of barbarism.”The Innocents of Florence: The Renaissance Discovery of Childhood by Joseph Luzzi is published by WW Norton (£23).

It’s the warmest, the saddest and the funniest, too: a lovely, grubby ode to the joys of misspent youth. “I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12,” remarks small-town adventurer Gordie Lachance, who sets off with his pals to find a dead body in the woods. “Jesus, does anyone?”View image in fullscreen‘I stared out the window and tried very hard not to cry’ … River Phoenix and Will Wheaton in Stand By Me.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyCertain films land at just the right moment in life and so it was with Stand By Me, which I first saw as an adolescent, in a Bristol cinema, alongside a schoolmate who had already seen it a few weeks before. We had to skip the last five minutes in order to catch the last bus home to our own small town. This infuriated me at the time, but now feels all of a piece. It means that Stand By Me’s heart-piercing final scene – the four kids ambling back into Castle Rock at dawn – is inextricably bound up with that long, slow bus ride through the night as my friend recounted the movie’s ending, explaining how friendships wane and heroes die, and I stared out the window and tried very hard not to cry.Xan BrooksA Few Good MenView image in fullscreen‘Propulsive and just the right side of preposterous’ … Tom Cruise and Demi Moore in A Few Good Men.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy“They don’t make ’em like this anymore,” is a phrase that is overused to the point of meaninglessness, but it’s one that certainly applies to A Few Good Men, the sort of swaggering, legal drama showdown that, in 2025, ends up being made into a prestige TV drama rather than a film. In 1992 though, it was a drop-everything blockbuster event, the chance to see Hollywood’s coming leading-man force, Tom Cruise, and its biggest, scenery-chewingest star, Jack Nicholson, crashing into each other like rutting stags.A lot of attention inevitably lands on those performances – Nicholson as terrifying bully Colonel Jessep, Cruise as the military defence lawyer attempting to goad Jessep into revealing his complicity in the death of a young Marine – not to mention the verbal pyrotechnics of the film’s script, written by Aaron Sorkin.Rob Reinerusually gets overlooked in all this, but it’s his steady, unfussy direction that makes the whole thing thrum. A great director of actors, usually by just standing back and letting them cook, he also understood, and actually liked, genre movies, and in A Few Good Men his film-making actively leans into all the cliches and conventions of the courtroom drama – third act reversals of fortune, surprise witnesses, stirring, orchestral score and all. The result is propulsive and just the right side of preposterous; I could watch the final 30 or so minutes, culminating of course inthatline, on a loop till the end of time.Gwilym MumfordThis Is Spinal TapView image in fullscreenRock history … Reiner and Christopher Guest in This Is Spinal Tap.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyTap is great on so many levels: crucially (and amazingly) it’s still funny, even though, inevitably, some of it has, er, dated. The performances are across-the-board brilliant, and not just the leads – the sideshows are faultless too, from Fran Drescher’s Bobbi Flekman to Tony Hendra’s Peter Grant-channelling manager Ian Faith to Paul Shaffer’s combover promo guy Artie Fufkin. What stands out now is the level of detail: the early-Status-Quo-esque video for Listen to the Flower People, or the Shrewsbury Town shirt sported by bassist Derek Smalls.But in the end, Tap’s greatest achievement is the way it defanged and repackaged rock stars; in the 70s they were largely seen as sinister, dangerous figures, co-opting the youth into a world of debauchery. But afterwards? Well, rockers didn’t suddenly become cuddly, and there was still plenty of mileage in their reputation for sex and drugs, but the strutting peacocks of the double-neck guitar and four-bank synthesiser were now absurd, even idiotic, and not to be taken seriously. If nothing else, that was a vital service for humanity.Andrew PulverWhen Harry Met SallyView image in fullscreen‘The north star’ … Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally.Photograph: Castle Rock/Nelson/Columbia/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockEarlier this year, working on an article about modern Hollywood romantic comedies, I interviewed screenwriters and producers working in the genre today. I was struck by how oftenWhen Harry Met Sallycame up in conversation – and for good reason. It is still, after 35 years, a standard bearer of the genre, the north star guiding so many others. Nora Ephron’s script brims with wit and intelligence; the fashion and cinematography – all cosy knits and a Manhattan blanketed in crisp vermillion foliage – has come to define autumn; Meg Ryan’s warmth finds a perfect foil in Billy Crystal’s sardonicism. Ephron has been rightfully credited with making the film great, but Reiner’s influence is all over it, too. “Rob’s so funny. He’s also very combative,” Ephron recalled. The clashes between Sally and Harry were often the result of “bitter fights” between her (team Sally) and Reiner (team Harry) in the writers’ room. It was, she said, “as much fun as I’ve ever had”.Rebecca LiuThe Sure ThingView image in fullscreenOld-school delight … John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga in The Sure Thing.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyAmid the 1980s surge of teen movies, Rob Reiner’s second feature as director stood out as a beacon of old-school delight between the bratpack bleating of The Breakfast Club (sorry, not a John Hughes fan) and the grotesque misogyny of Screwballs II or Hardbodies. John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga play mismatched college students thrown together on a road trip from New England to California. He’s a beer-swilling slob on his way to get laid; she’s an uptight prig (“Spontaneity has its time and its place”), planning to join her boring lawyer boyfriend; no prizes for guessing what happens. Stephen L Bloom and Jonathan Roberts’s screenplay reworks It Happened One Night for a new generation, but it’s Reiner’s rapport with his young actors, innate comic timing and grasp of classic structure that weave the zingy one-liners, teenage romance and real feeling into a funny, touching and altogether agreeable little romcom.Anne BillsonThe Wolf of Wall StreetView image in fullscreenComic diamond … Reiner in The Wolf Of Wall Street.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/Allstar“$26,000 worth of sides? What are these sides – they cure cancer?” In a film not short of peppy cameos (Jean Dujardin as a supercilious Swiss banker, Joanna Lumley as a naughty aunt), Reiner’s as Stratton-Oakmont accountant “Mad” Max Belfort is a mini comic diamond that’s tossed out casually and ricochets all over. We’ve already been primed about his hair-trigger temper when he storms into the corner office to pull up his son, Wall Street shyster Jordan Belfort, and fellow reprobates about their $430k expenses tab. Reiner serves as lightning rod for AAA-grade banter, cheekiness and implausible denial from DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and co, mostly improvised: “The IRS, they allow for T&A,” says Hill about a billing to “EJ Entertainment”. “T&E!” Reiner yells back. Hilariously drowned out by the movie’s amoral rollercoaster, he is a sound choice as the doomed voice of conscience of this circus; loosey-goosey satire that revelled in human foibles was very definitely his bag.Phil HoadMiseryView image in fullscreenSuffering for art … Kathy Bates and James Caan in Misery.Photograph: Snap/REX/ShutterstockThat this 1990 Stephen King adaptation combines Rob Reiner’s innate gift for raising laughs with an acute sense of claustrophobia and suspense only makes it more impressive. James Caan is Paul Sheldon, the star novelist rescued from a snowy Colorado car wreck and nursed by his No 1 fan, Annie Wilkes (Oscar-winner Kathy Bates), in her isolated home. Aghast when she finds that his latest manuscript departs from his pot-boiler formula, Annie uses her advantage – Paul is bed-bound for the entire film – to force him to bash out a new book that is more to her liking.A deranged treat when it first opened, the picture now looks prescient in its vision of the parasocial phenomenon: imagine how many Misery fantasies the internet has engendered. It also serves today as a commentary on a consumer-driven society where art is moulded and inhibited by a vocal online public.But while Annie symbolises that corrosive influence, I still cheer her on whenever I watch the film. Even before she breaks Paul’s ankles with a mallet, she is, gloriously,a lot. From her melodramatic hissy fits to her Liberace obsession, she’s a queer-coded avenger giving the smug, rich patriarchy its just deserts. This is one film that only gets better when viewed with a rowdy #TeamAnnie crowd. Company loves Misery, you might say.Ryan GilbeyIt’s Garry Shandling’s ShowReiner was prepping When Harry Met Sallywhen he made his exceptionally sporting (and funny) guest appearance in Dial L for Laundry, a first season episode of Shandling’s postmodern sitcom. Playing himself as a doleful actor-director, he drops by Shandling’s place seeking gainful employment and winds up performing the star’s chores; after seeing off a laundry-room bully (future Twin Peaks villain Chris Mulkey) with a bottle to the head, he walks arm-in-arm with his host – two wily pros, forever on the lookout for amusing business – into a closing credits Stand by Me homage. Reiner recurred in the series’ third season before provoking comic ire as a guest on The Larry Sanders Show. Here, however, Shandling pays fulsome tribute to Reiner’s skill with a scourer, holding up a sparkling dinner plate to the cameras: “Get a tight shot of this. Look at it. Rob, you did a great job.”Mike McCahillNew GirlView image in fullscreenCelebrating love … Reiner, Zooey Deschanel and Jamie Lee Curtis in New Girl.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyRob Reiner was an undeniable genius, both in front of and behind the camera, but my favourite project of his will always be the TV sitcom New Girl. In it he plays Jess Day’s (Zooey Deschanel) dad, Bob, divorced from his wife Joan (Jamie Lee Curtis) and navigating the bumpy road to find love again. Bob is warm, cuddly, fiercely protective and willing to serenade people with Tal Bachman’s power pop song She’s So High in a bid to win them over; very much how I imagine Reiner would have been in real life. It was a brilliant showcase for his comedic talent, and the series even featured a parody of Misery, where Jess aggressively takes care of her dad, cutting his toenails just a little too close for comfort. In the final season, Bob becomes increasingly desperate for Jess’s hapless long-term boyfriend Nick (Jake Johnson) to propose to his daughter, beaming proudly as he finally walks her down a hospital corridor to get married. Sure, Bob isn’t Rob, but to me, this character sums up how Reiner acted throughout his career – he knew the importance of love and the need to celebrate it, and he wanted to spread joy as much as he possibly could.Ann LeePrimary ColorsView image in fullscreenComic cameo … with John Travolta in Primary Colors.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThree years after directing The American President, Reiner had a cameo in another Clinton-era political drama. He plays Izzy Rosenblatt, the host of Florida radio show Schmooze for Jews, who asks presidential hopeful Jack Stanton (John Travolta) softball questions about his mother and Vegas, only for a rival candidate to dial in and have an on-air heart attack. It’s a lovely comic turn – “Go ahead, Governor, be my guest! What am I saying? You are my guest!” – in an entertaining, sharply observed film that has aged well despite now seeming like a despatch from a completely different political era. It was Reiner’s second performance (after Postcards from the Edge) for director Mike Nichols, a figure he resembled in some ways; they fished in similar talent pools, both working with Nora Ephron, Carrie Fisher and Aaron Sorkin, and both were creative powerhouses with protean talents who were to some extent underrated as directors.Chris TryhornThe Princess BrideView image in fullscreenSwoon … Cary Elwes and Robin Wright in The Princess Bride.Photograph: Cinetext/20 Century Fox/AllstarWhat to add to the many millions of words already written about the delights of The Princess Bride? The tale of its slow-burn success is well known but I’m one of a small elite (I like to think) who saw it as a teenager in the cinema on its initial release. I came for the swoon-worthy Cary Elwes but stayed for the witty script and the tenderness of the friendships. I was given the video for Christmas, and I watched it so much that, by the time I was 18, I could recite the entire movie off by heart (and did, on occasion). Back in those days I might have preferred to namedrop Wim Wenders, Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard as my favourite film-makers, but I always kept a place in my heart for Rob Reiner and The Princess Bride. And, as soon as my own daughter had outgrown Pingu and Teletubbies, we watched this together and have returned to it again and again. There are simply no moments you want to fast-forward, each line is delivered with perfect timing, the fairytale setting is unashamedly sumptuous, the performances glorious, sincere and yet given with a lightness of touch that makes Reiner’s film still feel fresh and fun. My daughter is now away at university; the evening before she left for her new life, we watched The Princess Bride. It won’t be the last time, but the terrible events of this past week will now cast a dark shadow over this open-hearted and loving movie.

Benny made wrestling drama The Smashing Machine, starring The Rock; Josh a loose take on the life of Marty Reisman, a shoe-store clerk in 1950s New York, who aspires to table tennis pre-eminence but must hustle to fund his passage to championships in London and Tokyo.The trailer for Marty Supreme.The film – whose score draws significantly from the 1980s – is A24’s most expensive yet and a major awards hopeful for its star, director and writer. It also features one of the wildest and most characterful supporting casts ever assembled, including David Mamet, Sandra Bernhard, high-wire artista Philippe Petit, fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, the British-Indian academic Pico Iyer, Abel Ferrara and Tyler the Creator.Gwyneth Paltrow has been lured out of retirement to play a faded film star, Kay, with whom Marty begins an affair. Meanwhile Kevin O’Leary – a Canadian entrepreneur known as Mr Wonderful on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon’s Den – makes his film debut as her billionaire husband, Milton, with whom Marty shares a dynamic not unlike that between Guy Pearce and Adrien Brody in The Brutalist.View image in fullscreenChalamet in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Courtesy of A24You’ve said that Marty represents the confidence, cockiness and ambition that America expressed in the postwar years. Who represents America today?I think that the victory of the second world war really set aflame the idea of the American dream. That an individual can change the world. You can be anyone from anywhere and you can find glory and there’s a reason to your existence.View image in fullscreenWith Tyler, The Creator.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/Getty ImagesAnd then, in the 1980s, America was coming out of the defeat in Vietnam and the cultural and economic depression. So Reagan tried to resurrect the American dream. But this time, it was in quote marks. The 80s were the first postmodern era – and are really the most lasting era. You walk around and hear 80s music all the time. It was the last truly modern movement. It was then that capitalism won, the past began to haunt the future and the future was just revisiting the past.What is happening now, because of the lasting effect of the 80s, is that the American dream – that quest for prosperity – is in double quote marks. And it might be even harder to achieve.The film feels rooted in the postwar literature ofBellow and Roth;young Jewish men chasing to make their way in New YorkThese wide-eyed determined people who live with a sense of urgency, outside of time, are very attractive to me. I love Budd Schulberg’s What Makes Sammy Run? And Mordecai Richler’s The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz was very influential. That chronicling of the Lower East Side, all these idiosyncratic singular characters living on top of each other in chaos. Me and [co-writer] Ronald Bronstein also read a lot of nonfiction books, which were not very well written. But usually, the worse the writing, the better – for film purposes.View image in fullscreenDirecting Marty Supreme.Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima/APIs there a type of anxiety innate to particular ethnic groups? Could you have made this story about a community that wasn’t Jewish?I do think there is a certain unrest in Jewish culture. Not so much in the text of the Old Testament. But amongst the culturally Jewish there is a sense of constant rebuilding. The idea of ‘we might have to move at any moment’. It’s a nomadic culture that’s been moved around a lot. That impermanence is actually quite spiritual, but I do think there’s a latent anxiety in that lifestyle because of it.Near the end of the film, at the Tokyo championship, Milton says he’s a vampire. What does he mean?What we saw in Japan after the war was so unique: the way they embraced defeat after being such an intense – and pretty violent – culture.

They invented this new bat, which they called the atomic paddle, and with it they obliterated everybody. It was the beginning of passive colonialism and carpetbagging and corporate colonialism and globalism. But there were a lot of protections to prevent American companies moving into Japan. Sony is called Sony because the [Japanese] founder heard GIs calling little kids “Sonny”.A vampire is no different than someone who sucks the oil out of the planet. They’re a parasite who lives off hosts. Milton is a vampire. He’s a cold, corporate, capitalist colonialist. And they’ll be around for ever; I don’t see them going anywhere. There is an art to what they do – obviously a lot of destruction, too – but sometimes a beauty. That’s why I cast Mr Wonderful. Kevin is the asshole on that show; he’s the most crude. And he came up with that line vampire line, actually.Marty’s friend and fellow pingpong champ, Béla (played bySon of Saul’s Géza Röhrig) tells Marty how, while imprisoned at Auschwitz, he came across some beehives. He covertly smeared honey all over his body and let his fellow prisoners lick it off him later.That’s based on a true story. Alojzy Ehrlich was a Jewish guy from Hungary whose life was spared by Auschwitz officers who recognised him and his talents. He was a genius. Like a lot of these players: very high IQ. It’s peculiar the sport attracted a very eccentric type of person: smart, but got bad grades, couldn’t hold a job. But they could dispose of bombs [as Ehrlich did and Röhrig’s character does] and be at a hotel like this [Claridge’s] because they were international, and thought bigger. I learned more about the Holocaust in that little story than from some movies that are only about the Holocaust.View image in fullscreenAt the LA premiere.Photograph: John Salangsang/ShutterstockMilton is angry that he lost his son in the war and he thinks part of the reason why was defending the Jews. In his speech to Marty there is buried some sort of latent antisemitism. That’s his way of coping. I’m not someone who thinks the whole world is looking through that lens, though. I’m much thicker-skinned than that.The honey-licking sacrifice contrasts with the vampiric suckingEven more of a call to the vampiric is the shot of Marty and Kay in the hotel room. [Production designer] Jack Fisk would do silly things like put paintings around which evoked Transylvania and whatnot. Kay is literally biting the neck of young Marty. She’s trying to suck the youth out of this man and get his passion.View image in fullscreen‘That’s why I shoot on film: it preserves’ … a scene from Marty Supreme.Photograph: Courtesy of A24Do older people today do that?There is more of an obsession with youth than there’s ever been. In our lifetimes, I think there will be ways to raise your life expectancy in rich countries by 50 years. And eventually immortality. And that’s scary. Because an end is very important. Narrative is important. Imagine sitting down to watch a movie with no run time.I also fear electromagnetic catastrophe and the loss of everything. Some intelligent life-form finds this planet and we’re all gone: all of the hard drives are dead. Not that [aliens] would have any idea how to get the information off them. But things shot on film they’ll be able see.

It will be the most valuable, because it was the moment when we saw things change.Marty Supreme begins at the moment of a child’s conception – we see sperm swimming towards an egg – and takes place over the next nine months. Is it a repudiation of the idea men don’t do much during pregnancy? And are men programmed, like sperm, to compete?I think that men are lost and women have a very concrete understanding of a purpose for humanity. You see amongst the chaos of the sperm there’s one that’s like: I need to be the person. And then there’s the egg that’s just there. And if you look at the cosmos, those [eggs] are the planets.View image in fullscreen‘A very concrete understanding of a purpose for humanity’ … Gwyneth Paltrow in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Courtesy of A24When my daughter was born, she didn’t need her dad. She needed her mom and that bleeds into this strange existential malaise about what a father is. At one point Marty tells [his pregnant girlfriend] Rachel: “I have a purpose. And you don’t.” And that’s why she laughs. But the beauty of it is that his dream is of the egg, which forms into the [customised Marty Supreme table tennis] ball.

We are back in the sleazy, glossy world of Curtis Hanson’s The Hand That Rocks the Cradle or Joe Eszterhas’s Basic Instinct, but skating quite close, though not too close, to satire.The scene is a bizarrely opulent mansion somewhere in upstate New York, splendidly isolated among a sea of bland suburban housing; it is approached by a drive, once you have got past the electronic gates. And it is down this avenue that Millie (Sydney Sweeney) nervously drives, wearing fake glasses to make herself look more mature, to apply for the job of live-in housemaid to the wealthy couple that lives there; she is hoping her prospective employers will not notice the worrying inconsistencies in her CV. She is greeted with smiley, Stepford-blond blandness by Nina Winchester (Amanda Seyfried), who appears to adore Millie, and explains that the job entails cooking, cleaning and looking after her young daughter, Cece (Indiana Elle).But on her very first day on the job, poor Millie discovers that the house, a perfect Martha Stewart show home when she first saw it, is now squalid chaos, and Nina is screaming with spiteful rage, blaming Millie for everything, the result of apparently having missed her meds. Her husband, Andrew (Brandon Sklenar), as handsome as a young Alec Baldwin, reassures Millie that all is well; Millie finds herself fatally attracted to him, as well as grateful for his kindly interventions to prevent her from being fired from a job she badly needs. The sexual tension is unbearable. But what is going on? Is the behaviour of either what it seems? Is Millie being groomed for something?We get some tastily over-the-top acting and some huge rewind POV shifts to explain what has really been going on – and, of course, the heady whiff of gaslight as Millie can’t quite be sure she really understands anything that’s happening. Silly it may be, but Feig and his cast deliver it with terrific gusto; this is an innocent holiday treat.The Housemaid is out on 19 December in the US, 25 December in Australia and 26 December in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersSydney SweeneyPaul FeigAmanda SeyfriedFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

We met at my then-cinema the Scala – it was a busy, noisy office but a sunny day, so we went up to the roof. Susie, who was already something of a legend having cast Stephen Frears’ Bloody Kids, Laura Mulvey’s avant garde films and Ben Kingsley in Gandhi, unleashed a volcanic eruption of unbridled enthusiasm for Angela Carter and Neil’s script. The collection of explosive expletives and voluble “darlings” almost blasted me to the King’s Cross streets below.View image in fullscreenMicha Bergese and Sarah Patterson in The Company of Wolves.Photograph: Itc/Sportsphoto/AllstarSo began a professional relationship that spanned more than 23 movies. The task we set her for The Company of Wolves was tricky: to find an actor to play the adolescent Rosaleen. She achieved it through painstaking and meticulous methods (her trademark) over the next few months, exceeding our expectations when she discovered the excellent Sarah Patterson. She then topped that with the suggestion of Angela Lansbury for “Grannie” (who flew from Hollywood to shoot with us and had her character’s head decapitated for her troubles) and a superlative supporting cast of dancers, performance artists and veteran actors for our strange, violent woodland fairytale. Her passion for cinema was infectious: not only for the film-makers, but also the agents and actors who read our scripts. Susie demanded an intelligent and thoughtful response to the screenplays so no simple yes or no would suffice.Her acting origins as a member of the 60s/70s avant garde experimental improvisational theatre collective The People Show (alongside her film director cousin Mike Figgis) might appear to be at odds with her consummate belief in professionalism, punctuality and absolute commitment to the director and ultimately the movie. Woe betide any actor that arrived late to a Susie Figgis casting audition!View image in fullscreenThe Full Monty.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarAfter The Company of Wolves she came up with a whole series of brilliant finds for Neil: Cathy Tyson in Mona Lisa, Jaye Davidson in The Crying Game and Eamonn Owens in The Butcher Boy. In parallel she continued her relationship with Richard Attenborough and Frears on numerous films through the 1980s, and was involved in casting Oscar and Bafta winning productions including Heat and Dust, The Killing Fields, The Mission, Local Hero, A World Apart, Scandal and Wish You Were Here. She was, and remained, at the forefront and cutting edge of new British cinema, mixing big budget Hollywood movies and BFI and Film4 productions with equal relish.Her molotov cocktail personality, a mixture of unashamed no-nonsense Brit and subversive leftwing radical, was a unique and unblinkingly honest blend, disarming for some but not always a comfortable combination for others. Most directors who worked with her knew they were in safe, if occasionally delightfully eccentric, hands. In the 1990s her talent was brought to bear on a multitude of films, standouts being Ken Loach’s Hidden Agenda, Jane Campion’s The Piano, Interview With the Vampire, Michael Collins, The Full Monty, The End of the Affair, Todd Haynes’ Velvet Goldmine and Tim Burton’s Sleepy Hollow.View image in fullscreenHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamySusie’s passion for cinema and commitment to her art often led to animated and vociferous discussions to say the least – but she kicked off the 2000s with the first Harry Potter film, The Philosopher’s Stone. Burton worked closely and amicably with her on all of his UK films including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd and Alice in Wonderland, and she continued to make crucial contributions to films as diverse as Colette and Bohemian Rhapsody.Susie gave 100% to her movies and her infectious love and ribald humour added propulsive energy to any film over and above her casting genius. Her presence and inspiration are irreplaceable in the current landscape of timid British cinema.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industrycommentShareReuse this content"

That’s a misleadingly linear description of the film; it’s actually cleaved into two parts which would seem back to front if we were following the stories of specific people. The first section observes life in the squat where the residents support each other as they face eviction threats and the bureaucracy of asylum-seeking, while the second part looks on as other people make the rough sea passage. Time is also spent aboard boats run by organisations such as Doctors Without Borders who seek to help the migrants.All that might make this sound like any number of 21st-century documentaries (Fire at Sea, for instance) and dramas (Io Capitano) about immigrants crossing continents with deadly results. But this one is aggressively non-narrative, composed of a series of long static shots and still images that linger many beats longer than might seem necessary to get the point across. Body parts and faces, what looks like a fuse box, a child being delivered by a rough emergency C-section (gory stuff, be warned), someone’s phone showing text messages, water, sick people laid out like cordwood on a deck; it’s all a jumble of images, unexplained and raw, and sometimes barely visible in the low-lit conditions.Meanwhile, a punchy, scratchy musical score composed by French film-maker Bertrand Bonello (The Beast) rankles away in the background, neither enhancing nor detracting from the images because they’re all so random. The lack of story, structure, or any clear editorial principle is a serious impediment to empathy for these poor, struggling people; the 159-minute runtime feels like four years. The highlight is a minute-long clip in the first section where a woman is seen bopping along to Oumou Sangaré’s delicious banger, Seya, offering one bright moment of joy.Europe’s New Faces is in UK and US cinemas from 12 December, and on digital platforms from 19 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsImmigration and asylumMigrationreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a Travelodge hotel room, a couple wake up after a one night stand. She’s in the shower; he’s devouring a bucket of KFC for breakfast. When she emerges, Glaswegian Mary (Karen Piriestar Lauren Lyle) licks her lips and takes pleasure from recounting their mind-blowing sex while Hoosier Mike (Skins’ Alexander Arnold) reserves his orgasmic delight for the drumsticks. Wasn’t last night amazing, she asks. “It was something else,” he replies – and half an hour later we find out what he means.Far from a casual encounter, this one-nighter is the result of separate missions. Mary has spent months sleeping with different men in order to get pregnant. Mike, whose apparent naivety grows increasingly suspect, reveals himself to have been dispatched for just that job. And it is very much a duty – he has planned the conception like a business trip.View image in fullscreenIntimacy and anonymity … Lauren Lyle and Alexander Arnold.Photograph: Danny KaanBeneath its strange comedy of miscomprehension and some fizzy repartee (mostly from Mary), Ireland considers, albeit far more fleetingly, similar issues of secular and religious faith, affirmation, self-belief and sheer goodwill to his more recent two-hander,The Fifth Step. The lightness of Lyle and Arnold’s rapport means that seriousness doesn’t always surface but they remain a compelling double act as they shift the sands. Each character has moments of touching tenderness, specifically around the gift of Mary’s pregnancy, amid gags riffing on each other’s very different worlds. Together they capture the awkward morning-after mix of intimacy and anonymity, heightened by Ceci Calf’s set, which has the right muted colours and stuffy air (curtains are opened to reveal the charming view of a brick wall).The humour is never as outlandish as Ireland’s black comediesUlster AmericanorCyprus Avenueand Max Elton’s production could perhaps benefit from borrowing more from the discombobulated, wired feeling of the fringe. In what could almost be a TV pilot, the script is delivered with the flourish of a tall tale but makes for an invigoratingly earnest consideration of the divine and the very human. Its origins lie in a series of “dream plays” envisioned by Edinburgh’s Traverse to let playwrights realise ideas that would be otherwise unimaginable. At 45 minutes, the result is funny and chewy but leaves you yearning for a bit more.AtSoho theatre, London, until 24 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreDavid IrelandSoho theatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Yes, Little Bulb’s Olivier-nominated festive show – first staged at Polka last year – features a magical nutcracker toy and young siblings transported to mysterious new worlds. But there’s also a pants-wearing Mouse King, a slab of flying poo, five crooning mice and a Yoda-inspired elder rodent. This is the Nutcracker how your youngest kids might dream it and it’s a wildly imaginative and warm-hearted creation.The action has been relocated to modern-day Wimbledon, where a grieving family face their firstChristmaswithout mum. They’ve moved into a new house – only it’s not very new at all. The sewers are clogged up, there are mouse droppings everywhere and, worst of all, siblings Clara (Lakeisha Lynch-Stevens) and Fritz (Dominic Conway) will be sharing a bedroom.Clare Beresford, Dominic Conway and Alexander Scott’s script – devised with help from the company – is peppered with endless inspired cheese gags (Fondu? How about fon-don’t?), and sly nods to the “big people” in the audience. There’s heaps of excellent physical comedy, a stream of very silly Christmas songs (“Last Christmas I gave you my cheeeeese”) and some expertly choreographed audience interaction. The cast manages a tricky balancing act, committing to the sorrow and shocks in the story but making the young audience feel safe, included and happy.View image in fullscreenCheesy cheer … The Nutcracker at St Martin’s theatre.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe script is consistently entertaining, although it does occasionally feel a little wordy in the first half. However, when the central quest kicks off – with Clara and Fritz hunting down the dastardly Mouse King – it’s utterly inspired. The story of the “Cheesy five” mice is told through a beautiful shadow puppet show, one of the endless lo-fi delights conjured up in Sam Wilde’s simple but evocative set. There are sword fights and magical shields, Pipes of Peril clogged up with monster poos and a Desert of Dust represented by a very sulky woman in a very dusty cloak. To watch this gleeful show is to feel young again, happily playing make-believe with your siblings.

Movies are re-released to mark big anniversaries. Great plays get put on over and over again. But in live comedy, revival isn’t such a big thing. It’s an artform predicated on surprise, the startlement of the new. Recycling old material is not the done thing. But might that be about to change? I saw two shows atSoho theatrerevived to celebrate their 10th birthdays, two comic performers who clearly saw value – and a new audience – in bringing decade-old sets back to the stage. Both are presented by production company Berk’s Nest – who don’t rule out more of the same if these two go with a swing.Both shows could be classified as “theatrical comedy”, arguably more susceptible to this treatment than straight standup would be. But the timing is a coincidence – and the two shows are (re-)presented in quite different ways. Joseph Morpurgo has been working with Berk’s Nest on a brand new show, his first since2017’s Hammerhead. The idea to restage Hammerhead’s predecessorSoothing Sounds for Baby, nominated in 2015 for the Edinburgh comedy award, was a byproduct of that process, presumably with a view to reminding audiences of Morpurgo’s solo pedigree (away fromAustentatious, for which he may be best known) before the release of new material.View image in fullscreenHigh concept … Joseph Morpurgo: Soothing Sounds for Baby in 2025.Photograph: Paul GilbeyConsider us reminded: the show is a potent draught of high-concept comedy – still coy, slippery and ridiculous a decade after its conception. It imagines Morpurgo being interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. Sound clips of Kirsty Young are put together to provide one bizarre half of the conversation. Morpurgo supplies the other, recounting a youthful romance he once had, and stopping to announce this or that beloved song on a soundtrack-to-his-life LP. Each of the records are kitsch charity-shop throwbacks, and each is brought to character-comedy life by our host, playing by turns a dating coach, a posh piano tutor and the narrator of some unexpectedly horrific children’s stories.It’s enjoyable second time around – although for me, not quiteasenjoyable. Which may bring us back to the reasons comedians don’t usually retread old ground. The element of surprise, so key to laughter, is diminished; the delight of novelty dimmed. Maybe there are other factors at play, too? Ten years ago, this brand of creative comedy was less common, and pitching up in that landscape (produced back then by soon-to-be-defunctlive comedy innovators the Invisible Dot) Soothing Sounds for Baby must have seemed more of an out-of-the-blue treat. We’re now more used to theatrical comedy, and qualities I previously admired in Soothing Sounds (the fact that it feels like three different shows in one, say) feel more like imperfections this time around.View image in fullscreenPop-picker … Joseph Morpurgo in 2015.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianIn that context, it’s not surprising that I got a little more out of Jack Rooke’s Good Grief – the show that first launched the talent, and the themes, behindChannel 4’s hit sitcom Big Boys. I didn’t see Good Grief in 2015, when it was billed as theatre, so there was no second-viewing tax on my amusement. What gives Rooke’s show more interest too is that he contextualises it – not only by bookending it with reflections on his experience of making it, its success, and his current relationship to the material, but also by various nods and winks mid-show to the distance he has (and we have) travelled since 2015.View image in fullscreenConvivial … Jack Rooke: Good GriefThat’s easier for Rooke to do than it would be for Morpurgo. He’s a more open and convivial performer, his material has routes in for that kind of backchat – and he’s got a decade under his belt of audience intimacy and (a certain level of) fame. At any rate, it makes Good Grief 2.0 a delightful and still affecting watch, as Jack then and now narrate the story of his dad’s death when he was just a teenager, replete with video interludes from his gran and the passing around of Soreen malt loaf.There’s a more explicit reasoning behind Rooke’s revival, too in that after the final series of Big Boys, he found himself at the end of a decade of grief-related projects, wanting to reconnect with the original impetus behind that – and with the young, grieving man he once was. It’s touching to hear that articulated, and to hear his rousing post-show address about how difficult (impossible, even) it might be for a working-class boy from Watford to get such a show to Edinburgh today.As with Morpurgo, so with Rooke, both these blasts from the recent past give us perspective on comedy then and now, and a respite from the artform’s insatiable hunger for the new. Is heritage comedy the new frontier? Probably not. But we’re all the better, on this evidence, for the occasional backward glance.Joseph Morpurgo: Soothing Sounds for Babyruns until 20 December andJack Rooke: Good Griefruns until 10 January, both at Soho theatre, LondonExplore more on these topicsComedyTheatreSoho theatrecommentShareReuse this content"

By treating horror as an art form rather than a cheap set of jump scares, this thrilling new show, which wears its connection to the world of theParanormal Activityfilm franchise lightly, proves how jaw-clenchingly, arm-clutchingly frightening horror on stage can be. Under the direction of Punchdrunk’s Felix Barrett, the in-the-moment fear is acute. But what is remarkable, thanks to Chris Fisher’s eye-popping illusions, is how that terror is accompanied by a giddy, awe-filled delight at the devilry we just witnessed – and how the hell they made it work.Horror hit Paranormal Activity spawns a West End play – and even its director yelped with fearRead moreIn Oren Peli’s original movie, a young couple set up home video cameras to capture night hauntings. The brilliance of Barrett’s production is in the ditching of screens, too often relied on to scare on stage. Levi Holloway’s script follows Jimmy (Patrick Heusinger) and Lou (Melissa James), who have moved from Chicago to London to escape the “spells” Lou has been experiencing. But places are not haunted, we’re told. People are. So the “spells” follow. Rather than setting up cameras, Jimmy tries to reason his way out of the chaos by bringing in an expert (Jackie Morrison).The only screens we see are their TV, used for video calls from Jimmy’s mum (a glorious, grinning Pippa Winslow) and a few at the back of the audience, giving a monochrome CCTV-camera view of Fly Davis’s glorious sliced-open two-storey set, the home’s every nook and cranny full of potential for fear. Onstage, Anna Watson’s quicksilver lighting smartly directs our attention around the house, with some rooms shrouded in murky grey darkness at night and others sunk into a sinister blackout.View image in fullscreenDexterous … Melissa James and Patrick Heusinger in Paranormal Activity at the Ambassadors theatre, London.Photograph: Johan PerssonThe script may be perfunctory, and some of it is deeply hammy, but its flaws are forgivable for such a dexterous production, with every technical element ramping up tension and toying with expectations. Every jump scare is earned, every trick embedded in the twisted narrative of this poor, doomed couple. And the fear lingers. When I wake at 3am to a strange light in my bedroom, I pull the duvet tight around my head, refusing to reopen my eyes and repeating to myself that it was just a play.AtAmbassadors theatre, London, until 28 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreParanormal ActivityHorror filmsWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

About Flora Crewe, an Edwardian poet who travelled to India, critics get most things wrong, a crassness represented by Eldon Pike, an American academic, editing Crewe’s correspondence and planning a biography that Stoppard makes clear will be disastrously false and gossipy. (He was much luckier withHermione Lee.)In mid-1980s scenes, Pike pesters Flora’s surviving sister, Eleanor Swan, for the letters and poems we see her writing 50 years earlier, while she is painted by a young artist, Nirad Das. Indian Ink grew from a radio play, its title In the Native State a very Stoppardian pun encompassing both the painting of nudes and the regions of British India permitted some self-government – both pivotal to the story.View image in fullscreenNotes of grief and love … Ruby Ashbourne Serkis and Gavi Singh Chera in Indian Ink.Photograph: Johan PerssonIndian Ink shows these radio origins in metronomic cross-fades between places and dates. The double time-scheme and fretting about historical forgetting are better done in Arcadia. However, helped by being a Czech émigré with an Indian childhood, Stoppard fairly referees between the politics and history of coloniser and colonised.Something critics got wrong about Stoppard even in his lifetime was the idea that head trumped heart but, even in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead almost 60 years ago, the key title word was the last. Indian Ink has deep notes of grief and love, which Jonathan Kent’s production sounds perfectly from a cast in which Gavi Singh Chera is powerful as Das, who can love an Englishwoman but not the British. Irvine Iqbal smoothly doubles Indian leaders of two periods and Donald Sage Mackay’s Pike amusingly pops up all around the auditorium, putting his footnotes in it.‘A master of complications’: Felicity Kendal returns to Tom Stoppard’s Indian Ink after three decadesRead moreRuby Ashbourne Serkis is amusing and moving as Flora, doomed with literary and sexual sensibilities ahead of her times, but the core draw isFelicity Kendal, the Flora on Radio 3 and in the stage premiere, who graduates to Mrs Swan (played previously by Peggy Ashcroft and Margaret Tyzack.)Stoppard’s text is dedicated to Felicity’s mother, Laura, a lover of India and theatre, and, at risk of going full Eldon Pike, we may suspect that the daughter’s quick switches between steeliness and sweetness in the role draw on the female clan DNA. A performance that would be formidable in any circumstances is even more so in these. The climax requires Kendal to stand at the grave of a renowned writer and, so soon after the death of the former partner who wrote the scene, this must have risked fiction-fact fracture. But her courageous craft and the skill of the whole team give a fitting first epitaph performance to a dramatist whose loss is keenly felt in theatre generally but particularly at this one now.AtHampstead theatre, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreTom StoppardHampstead theatreFelicity KendalreviewsShareReuse this content"

So why are the major labels embracing it?Companies such as Udio, Suno and Klay will let you use AI to make new music based on existing artists’ work. It could mean more royalties – but many are worriedEamonn FordeTue 16 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 16 Dec 2025 05.01 ESTShareThis was the year that AI-generated music went from jokey curiosity to mainstream force.Velvet Sundown, a wholly AI act, generated millions of streams; AI-created tracks topped Spotify’s viral chart and one of the US Billboard country charts; AI “artist” Xania Monet “signed” a record deal. BBC Introducing is usually a platform for flesh-and-blood artists trying to make it big, but an AI-generated song by Papi Lamour was recently played on the West Midlands show. And jumping up the UK Top 20 this month is I Run, a track by dance act Haven, who have beenaccused of using AI to imitate British vocalist Jorja Smith(Haven claim they simply asked the AI for “soulful vocal samples”, and did not respond to an earlier request to comment).The worry is that AI will eventually absorb all creative works in history and spew out endless slop that will replace human-made art and drive artists into penury. Those worries are being deepened by how the major labels, once fearful of the technology, are now embracing it – and heralding a future in which ordinary listeners have a hand in co-creating music with their favourite musicians.AI music platforms analyse huge amounts of recorded music in order to learn its sounds, structures and expressions, and then allow users to create their own AI-generated music via text or speech prompts. You might ask for a moody R&B song about a breakup sung by a female vocalist, and it will come up with a decent approximation of one, because it’s absorbed hundreds of such songs.Artists and labels initially saw AI as the biggest existential threat sinceNapster-fuelled piracy: if not a replacement for human creativity, then certainly a force that could undermine its value. Gregor Pryor, a managing partner at legal firm Reed Smith, says background music for things such as advertising, films and video games, where you’re not relating to a personality as you would in pop music, “is where the real damage will be done” first of all. “People will ask: why would I pay anyone to compose anything?”View image in fullscreen‘New creative possibilities’ … screengrab from the Suno AI music generator.Photograph: SunoAware of the scale of the shift, last year the Recording Industry Association of America, representing the three major labels, initiatedlegal action against AI music companies Suno and Udiofor copyright infringement, alleging they had trained their AI platforms on the labels’ artists without their permission. But then there was an extraordinary about-turn. They didn’t just settle the matter out of court – Universal Music Group (UMG) then partnered with Udio, and Warner Music Group (WMG) with Udio and Suno. They also have deals in place with AI companyKlay, the first to get all three major labels on board, adding Sony Music (discussions with indie labels are ongoing). WMG chief executive Robert Kyncl has said these recent deals are to ensure the “protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters” and to fuel “new creative and commercial possibilities” for them, while UMG chief Lucien Grainge heralded “a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish and create incredible experiences for fans”.Kyncl made another bold statement as to why these deals are taking place: “Now, we are entering the next phase of innovation. The democratisation of music creation.”View image in fullscreenMonet maker  … AI artist Xania Monet. An AI-generated image from ‘her’ Instagram account.Photograph: xania_monetAnnouncing its Universal tie-in, Udio chief executive Andrew Sanchez has said Udio users will be able to “create [music] with an artist’s voice and style”: so not just create the aforementioned moody R&B song, but one with a specific existing artist’s voice. He also says Udio will allow users to “remix and reimagine your favourite songs with AI … take your favourite artists, songs or styles and combine them in novel ways. In our internal experimentation, the team has gotten some truly remarkable and unusual results that will definitely delight.”Klay meanwhile states that “fans can mould their musical journeys in new ways”, but it’s essentially the same offering: a subscription service where you can manipulate the music of others, or create your own from it. Ary Attie, Klay’s founder and chief executive, says his company will properly compensate artists whose work is used, and won’t supplant the work of human musicians: “This technology is not going to change any of that.”Klay is a rarity in that it signed up all three major labelsbeforeit started training its AI system on their music: “A core part of our philosophy,” Attie says. He argues that rival AI companies – he doesn’t name names – have been “acting in a way that doesn’t respect the work of artists, and then being forced into a corner”. Suno did not respond to an interview request; Udio claimed its executives were “extremely swamped” and therefore unable to answer questions. The current, and synchronised, messaging from labels and gen AI companies with licensing deals is that they all respect both art and artists and that their deals will reflect this.They are also positioning gen AI as the single biggest democratising leap ever in remix culture, effectively enabling everyone to become musically creative. The counterargument is that, by lowering all barriers to entry and by allowing the manipulation of a song or a musician’s character at scale, it vastly devalues and negates the creative act itself.But what do musicians actually think of the prospect of their work being used to train AI, and reworked by the general public? “Everybody should be selling or licensing their voice and their skills to these companies,” Dave Stewart of Eurythmicsargued to me this week. “Otherwise they’re just going to take it anyway.” That view is directly countered by the major labels and AI companies, who have insisted artists and songwriters get to opt in to have their music made available, and if they do, get royalties when their music is used to train AI, or manipulated by users on platforms such as Udio, Suno and Klay.Others take a grimmer view about howthese companies might reshape the industry. Irving Azoff, legendarily forthright artist manager and founder of the Music Artists Coalition in the US, responded to the Universal/Udio deal with biting cynicism. “We’ve seen this before – everyone talks about ‘partnership,’ but artists end up on the sidelines with scraps,”he said. In the wake of the same deal, the Council of Music Makers in the UKaccusedthe major labels of “spin” and called for a more robust set of artist-label agreements. And the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance says there is a disturbing “lack of transparency” around the deals (though more detail is likely to emerge on what users can do with any music they create, and any potential commercial uses of it).View image in fullscreen‘I’m yet to be convinced’ … Catherine Anne Davies performing as the Anchoress in 2024.Photograph: TeeGeePix/AlamyCatherine Anne Davies, who records as the Anchoress and also sits on the board of directors at theFeatured Artists Coalition(FAC), has many reservations here. “Most people don’t even want their work to be used for training AI,” she says. “I’m on the dystopian side, or maybe what I call the realist side of things. I’m interested in the way that AI can be assistive in the creative process – if it can make us more efficient, if it can streamline our processes. But generative AI for me, in terms of creative output, is a big no-no at the moment. I’m yet to be convinced.”Musician Imogen Heap feels that AI itself is not to be feared as a tool – she uses an AI she calls Mogen to listen to every aspect of her life, with a view to it being a creative partner (as exploredin a recent Guardian article). To help address some of the issues, she has created Auracles, an artist-led, non-profit platform she hopes will be the place where the rights and permissions around AI are set out. It’s not enough to say you’re happy with your music being used by AI, she says – instead, what’s needed are “permissions that grow and evolve over time”.Other companies are cropping up with similar offers. “We must protect the artists at all costs,” says Sean Power, chief executive of Musical AI, who aims to give musicians “an exact portion of the influence they’re having on all the generative outputs” – meaning compensation every time even a tiny bit of one of their songs is used by a user of Udio et al.Terms of these deals are undisclosed, but labels are likely to be seeking settlement for any past use of their artists’ copyrights as well as an advance on future use, plus an equity stake in the platform. And while artists will be able to opt out of including their work, they probably won’t be consulted on these partnerships going ahead, with this lack of consultation being something that artist representative bodies such as FAC have been particularly critical of. “The big artists, the labels need to be nice to; those who have a platform will be consulted to some degree,” says a music licensing expert, speaking anonymously. “The very few, who as individual artists are able to make a dent on share price, will have approval.”I approached Universal, Sony and Warner about the specific concerns raised by artists here: namely limited transparency around the deals, their commercial terms and how opt-ins work; if there is a risk of gen AI undermining existing revenue sources; and if there is significant artist refusal to assign their works for gen AI training. None of the companies would comment on the record about the specifics. Though in an internal Universal memo about AI deals, sent to all staff earlier this year and seen by the Guardian, Grainge said “we will NOT license any model that uses an artist’s voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist’s existing songs without their consent.”The Guardian understands that labels are currently having discussions with artists and their managers to better explain how these deals will work and why they believe they can bring in additional revenue, although they will need to convince artists that gen AI will not damage other sources of income, notably from streaming.But it isn’t clear whether consumers will actually pay to play around with music in the way Udio and others hope they will. AI is thesingle biggest hype category in Silicon Valleyright now, with an average of $2bn of venture capital investment going into AI companies every week in the first half of this year. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet (parent company of Google), recently warned of thecatastrophic domino effectacross the tech sector if this AI bubble bursts, a concern theBank of Englandalso recently raised.Reed Smith’s Gregor Pryor argues that AI music could, counterintuitively, end up being positive for human musicians. “By its nature, AI is derivative and cannot create new music,” he says. “Some investors in music catalogues that I speak to say it’s good for artists, because music ‘verified’ as created by humans will have greater value.”Artists will frame their work as having an invaluable human essence, their music speaking entirely from the heart, but it will become incrementally more difficult for the casual listener to distinguish between music created by a human and that created by AI. The Guardian understands that radio stations and DJs are currently extremely nervous about AI-powered music slipping through their quality filters, effectively hoodwinking them and hanging question marks over how their playlists work. The example of Papi Lamour might force them to do much greater due diligence on what they put forward for airplay consideration. Or they could be the first trickles of a flood that roars through radio and streaming services as the boundaries between AI and human-created music crumble.AI, bot farms and innocent indie victims: how music streaming became a hotbed of fraud and fakeryRead moreDavies is especially worried about artists not thinking through the long-term implications of licensing to AI services. “We cannot think of ourselves selfishly as entities that will be unaffected, because the entire ecosystem will experience a knock-on effect financially. What about your fellow composers and creators? But also what about the generations to come after? Are we fucking this completely, just to make sure that we can pay our mortgages now?”AI’s current level of sophistication means it is really producing composites of existing music, creating a Frankenstein’s monster of melodies. However, when AGI (artificial general intelligence) finally arrives, withAnthropic co-founder Dario Amodeisuggesting that could happen as soon as next year, we will be catapulted into an exhilarating and terrifying realm of uncertainty for the future and the purpose of human-created art.“It’s literally happening under our noses,” warns Davies. “We should be so much more concerned than we are.”Explore more on these topicsMusicArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-2130Oklou – Choke EnoughTrance, medieval polyphony and Y2K pop may seem like odd bedfellows, but French singer-producer Oklou cast them all in a dawn-like haze on her gorgeous debut album, flowing these distinct disciplines together until they swooped and soared like a flock of starlings. Choke Enough was no academic exercise, either, with standout pop moments including Take Me By the Hand with Bladee – a winsome conjuring of how Alice Deejay might sound in collaboration with a piping minstrel.LS29Jacob Alon – In LimerenceView image in fullscreenRustling with life … Jacob Alon performing at the ZYN Rolling Stone UK Awards, in London’s Roundhouse.Photograph: Sue Moore/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOne of the star-making moments of the year was at the Mercury prize, as Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon reduced the arena audience to a hush with just a voice and an acoustic guitar (though there were delighted whoops when a call of “free Palestine” was folded into their rendition of Fairy in a Bottle). It hopefully brought a broader audience to their debut album In Limerence, which has shades of Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Buckley and even Paul McCartney’s cadences to its unguarded indie-folk. It would have been easy to make this music blandly beautiful, but Alon and producer Dan Carey keep it rustling with life, as they reach for a burbling synth, trumpet improvisation or dusty-sounding drum kit.BBT28KeiyaA – Hooke’s LawThe title of the Chicago producer’s second album references the law of physics that reflects how stretch is proportional to load, how a spring always bounces back when tested within its elastic limit. The whistlestop Hooke’s Law expands and contracts accordingly as KeiyaA’s trifles with loss and romantic disappointment find their embodiment in racing breakbeats and collagist chaos one minute, gorgeous, soul-weary stillness – as with the liquid Stupid Prizes – the next. Listening can feel like being pleasurably blitzed with sensation, with each repeat revealing new details: an invitation to submit to KeiyaA’s masterful grip.LS27Wet Leg – MoisturizerIn 2022 they released one of the 21st century’s biggest indie debuts, which scored a UK No 1 and Grammy and Brit awards. The pressure was there for the follow-up, but not only did it top the charts again and earn another couple of Grammy noms, it had even more swagger and heart. “You wanna fuck me, I know, most people do,” Rhian Teasdale shrugs on Mangetout, and she actively intimidates a lustful bloke on Catch These Fists – but much of the album is given over to her wonderment at falling in love. “I’ll be your Davina, I’m coming to get you … I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”, she sings: great new vows for millennial weddings.BBT26Wolf Alice – The ClearingView image in fullscreenSomething symphonic … Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice performing at Manchester Arena.Photograph: Andy Von Pip/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” Wolf Alice’s drummerJoel Amey saidas The Clearing was announced – and sure enough, this was a huge step up and out for a band who were already one of British indie’s biggest. There’s something symphonic about the heft of it and not just because of the string sections, thanks to superb production by Greg Kurstin: the bass and toms are heavy yet warm, the piano pounding yet not overbearing. Ellie Rowsell sings about suitably big themes, too, from universe-bending love on Leaning Against the Wall (“it really, really made the room sing, the way you said my name”), invaluable friendship on Just Two Girls, and The Sofa’s uplifting manifesto for being wild and indolent instead of toeing the line.BBT25Wednesday – BleedsThe North Carolina band’s sixth album is littered with endings, some violent – the title of Carolina Murder Suicide tells you all you need to know – some devastatingly mundane, as Karly Hartzman examined the cracks that led to a long relationship’s end. Her unique gaze unites both, noticing the details and dynamics that other songwriters might write off as inconsequential: like the “mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail” at a wake in Wound Up Here (By Holdin On). Full of screaming noise and riffs that evoke knee-sliding through the mud, as well as moments of unexpected sweetness, Bleeds shows the fullest picture of her band yet.LS24Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenUncontainable euphoria … Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta of Titanic.Photograph: Janet ChauThere can be few faster-evolving ensembles than that of Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta, who in just two albums have leapt from sparkling cabaret jazz to … whatever the uncontainable euphoria of Hagen is. It’s a record that vaults from blast beats to choral beauty, eerie splendour to nervy cacophonies, like nothing else you’ve heard. Despite these bold stylistic clashes, it hangs together beautifully, thanks also to Fratti’s spectacular voice, as capable of cirrus-like delicacy as parched sharpness.LS23Cate Le Bon – Michelangelo DyingWhere two of this year’s most prominent breakup albums were savage (Lily Allen) or spectacular (Rosalía), Welsh innovator Cate Le Bon’s hypnotically murky seventh album reflected the circular sadness of love faltering – the catch-22 of wanting to escape heartbreak while knowing that letting go means relinquishing something that was once profound. Michelangelo Dying contains some of her very best choruses and melodies, powerful enough to penetrate the album’s billowing haze of guitar, sax and synths, like a hand reaching out in the dark.LS22Little Simz – LotusView image in fullscreenWider reckoning … Little Simz performing at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianSimz’s sixth album came amid a dispute with the Sault producer Inflo – she has sued him for allegedly failing to repay a loan – and a couple of tracks target him in all but name (“You talk about God when you have a God complex / I think you’re the one that needs saving”). But Simz seems to be having a wider reckoning: she revels in how far she’s come from once just having “a dream and a pushbike”, and reflects on self-preservation, creative frustration and – in a gorgeous, naturalistic back-and-forth with Wretch 32 – push-pull family dynamics.BBT21John Glacier – Like a RibbonFor all that you can link her to trip-hop and cloud rap, what British MC has ever really sounded like this? It would be easy to call Glacier monotone, but in truth her careful, even flow holds so much musicality: her deliberately limited melodic and rhythmic range means that the subtle distinctions in her vocals are fascinating, as she goes from bored to wry to boastful to poignant within one-degree turns on the emotional thermostat. The grainy, faintly corrupted beats are superb, but it’s that delivery, and her lyrics themselves – stoic and even amused as life blows her from place to place – which make this album an all-timer in UK rap.BBT20-1120Aya – Hexed!A series of surreal vignettes confronting addiction, panic and the challenges of growing up queer, Aya Sinclair’s experimental electronic masterwork is a wind-whipped dash around the towns and moors of Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. From the rotor blade-whomp of Peach to the infernal pattering snares on Navel Gazer, her sound design hits you like a ton of feathers: a surreal, destabilising flurry of detail. And the lyrics, done as careful mutters or sarky sing-song, are world-class. Her poetry revels in multiple meanings – is she saying “Flemish” or “phlegmish”? – and in the plasticity of language, rhyme and even lived experience, whether retelling a toxic relationship (“Couple rows so we could pop our cysts / as though the pus’d bust right out of the tryst”) or evoking the feeling of being totally cut adrift: “Abseil away another day supine inside the bag.”BBT19Clipse – Let God Sort Em OutView image in fullscreenRich with wisdom … Malice and Pusha T of Clipse.Photograph: Cian MooreThey may have been outdone by Oasis as 2025’s most anticipated fraternal comeback, but there was still considerable excitement around the return of Gene and Terrence Thornton, AKA Clipse’s Malice and Pusha T. After making two of the best albums in 00s rap, Malice found God and left Pusha to it. But on returning, Malice’s mic tone – which always had a sort of ancient, oaken majesty to it – felt rich with wisdom, while Pusha, who in the interim had beefed Drake to hugely entertaining effect, still had his nose for a scrap, this time with Travis Scott. Together, they advocated for their own brilliance and for what they see as a better class of rap, sometimes at the same time: “They content-create, I despise that / I create content then they tries that.”BBT18Big Thief – Double InfinityAfter their bassist Max Oleartchik left the group, Big Thief pressed on as a trio but brought in a number of auxiliary musicians, resulting in an album that sounds like it could have been worked up around the campfire of a utopian off-grid commune. These are some of the American band’s best, biggest-hearted songs to date, with the type of easy facility with melody – and equally easy access to their emotions – that can’t be taught. Take Grandmother, in which frontperson Adrianne Lenker surveys our collapsing world and flawed humanity, and decides on the singalong chorus: “Gonna turn it all into rock’n’roll.” In many other hands this would be trite, but as with so much of Big Thief’s music, the purity of intention makes it life-affirming.BBT17Alex G – HeadlightsView image in fullscreenA new frontier … Alex G.Photograph: Chris MaggioWhat constitutes integrity? Working for love or money? Freedom or obligation to others? On his first album for a major label, standing at a new frontier of success, Alex G weighs these existential questions in appropriately vast, beautiful indie-rock epics, some breathless with anxiety (Spinning), others sardonic (Real Thing) or severe (Headlights). Despite the very contemporary, very Alex G touches – take the sprite-like voices and distortion of Bounce Boy – there’s a comforting solidity to this record that makes it feel as though it’s existed for ever, sharing the same spooked twilight as the best of Yo La Tengo and REM.LS16Pulp – MoreThe anticipation of a reunion album rarely measures up to the often dismal results. Perhaps the key is to spend a solid chunk of years playing together again, as Pulp did, before risking putting anything down on record. “I exist to do this / Shouting and pointing,” Jarvis Cocker sang on comeback single Spike Island; anyone who’s seen Pulp in recent years can attest that he has lost none of his calligraphic physical flair. Nor, as the magnificent More proves, has his gimlet eye for the grubby disappointments of middle age diminished. Life apparently feels no less of a charade at 62 than early adulthood did back in the 90s, a fact he sells as both anticlimax and a weird kind of comfort: if that’s the case, the unvarnished love songs and heartfelt stands against commodification suggested, you might as well stick it all on the line.LS15Turnstile – Never EnoughView image in fullscreenUncomplicated thrills … Turnstile in concert in Guadalajara, Mexico.Photograph: Medios y Media/Getty ImagesIs it hardcore punk or not? As this dull debate brewed on comment sections and Discord servers, the rest of the world got on with the business of just enjoying the uncomplicated thrills on Turnstile’s latest. Certainly, Seein’ Stars sounds like 90s Duran Duran, the epic title track could be played as NFL teams run on to the field and even the hardcore-paced Dull and Solo have a sheen to them. But for every frowning punk purist, you had 10 more lining up to pile into the pit with smiles a mile wide.BBT14Deftones – Private MusicThis was the US alt-metallers’ first album back after serendipitously getting a huge new following via TikTok, particularly for their sweeter, shoegazier material. But rather than court that audience by cynically remaking Sextape 11 times over, they instead created a balletic cyborg of a record. The riffs could put a dent in concrete masonry, but the groove-metal rhythms are light-footed and, as ever, vocalist Chino Moreno sets out even wider tonal possibilities. It’s as if waves of pain and relief pass across his spirit as he goes from dry croaks to thunderous denouncements to blissful clean singing.BBT13Suede – AntidepressantsThree decades since their debut and five albums into the second phase of their career, Suede sound as impassioned and vital as they ever have. Brett Anderson’s voice is a long way from the nasal sneer of Animal Nitrate all those years ago: it’s now rounder and deeper in colour, reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen’s Ian McCulloch, but the core Suede theme – humanity in all its reckless and sexy brokenness – is still there. Playing post-punk with a Britpop grandeur, Anderson and co reckon with the fleeting nature of existence (“Formless as a cloud / Weightless as a sound”) and the caprices of brain chemistry, but with a sense of optimism, even triumph.BBT12Jim Legxacy – Black British Music (2025)View image in fullscreenMore assured … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranHis previous mixtape Homeless N*gga Pop Music was at No 42 in our 2023 albums list; rapper-producer Jim Legxacy jumps up the rankings as his place in British rap becomes more and more assured. Beats-wise, he defines the joyous anything-goes energy of the current UK underground, expertly applying chipmunk effects to samples, adding funny DJ-style vocal tags (“turn that mediocre bullshit off, we’re listening to Jim Legxacy right now!”) and even making a left turn into high-tempo pop-rock for ’06 Wayne Rooney. There’s more of a mournful cast to the lyrics though, as he works through grief for his late sister, and confronts the lingering effects of his impoverished, fatherless childhood.BBT11Jade – That’s Showbiz Baby!Pop’s trickiest manoeuvre is crossing the divide from successful group to solo career. After departing Little Mix, Jade Thirlwall didn’t so much jump it as pirouette across: her multi-part debut solo single Angel of My Dreams was completely nuts, impossible to ignore and spent 20 weeks on the UK chart. Could a whole album match up? From trashy ballroom house (It Girl) to disco-funk (Fantasy, Headache), Robyn-esque sad bangers (Plastic Box, Self Saboteur) and waltz-time ballads (Natural at Disaster), she certainly has the range, not to mention smart and sweary lyrics – rhyming Edward Enninful with experimental is a neat encapsulation of what moves her. It’s her voice that really sets it all apart, though: as you’d expect of a talent show graduate turned longtime pop star, it remains stunning on a technical level, but Thirlwall also brings a whole West End musical’s worth of emotion.BBT10-610Billy Woods – Golliwog“The English language is violence, I hot-wired it / I got a hold of the master’s tools and got dialled in,” Billy Woods announces at the outset of a rap masterpiece that works both as stunning poetry on the page and thrilling music out of loudspeakers. With intensely vivid lyrics, he picks his way through psychic wreckage wrought by racism, poverty, war and more, menaced by horrible dreams (“Didn’t want the doctor to turn, I knew it’d be something awful on the ultrasound”) and dispensing jaded wisdom: “Amputation how you survive / Can’t get away if you don’t leave something behind.” And then there’s Misery, a vivid romcom about a polyamorous and possibly vampiric lover. Frantz Fanon, Cecil Rhodes, Miles Davis and “Black Thanos” are among the other figures populating these strange, heat-sick tracks, helmed by a diverse and stellar range of production talent including the Alchemist, DJ Haram and Kenny Segal.BBT9Geese – Getting KilledView image in fullscreenOutrageously accomplished … Geese.Photograph: Lewis EvansThe ways that love unravels us and knits us back together are explored on the outrageously accomplished and wise fourth album from the New York garage rock band, who are still in their early 20s. They originally formed as kids at a Brooklyn music school which partly explains the depth of their connection, but there’s something bigger at work: how to explain the way a tiny chord change can carry so much emotional weight, or how these songs can groove so tightly at the waist while their arms flail this way and that. Cameron Winter’s lyrics and vocals are peerless, too, done in a reedy head voice that’s also somehow soulful. He’s trying to live his life on a higher frequency than the rest of us, but so often he’s having his heart broken, “getting killed by a pretty good life”, or hemmed in by his circumstances: “I was a sailor, and now I’m a boat / I was a car, and now I’m the road,” he glumly pouts on Bow Down.BBT8Bad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosWith the absolute integrity that has become his trademark, Bad Bunny shone his inestimable spotlight back on his roots in Puerto Rico for his sixth album, singing of sacrifice, colonial oppression and the importance of preserving tradition. He’s an incredible conduit, synthesising the past – salsa, bolero, perreo – with the present, bringing local artists including RaiNao and Lorén Aldarondo along for the ride. As if it needed stressing, Debí … also underscored his own legacy, and his incredible range: heartbroken that life must one day end on Baile Inolvidable; lovelorn in the rave on Perfumito Nuevo; seemingly cast in moonlight on the heavy Bokete.LS7Lily Allen – West End GirlLily Allen’s divorce album is so lurid in its apparent disclosures (she has said she employed some poetic licence) that it felt as though there was a risk of the carcass being tossed aside once the tabloids had picked it clean for gossip. But the quality of the songwriting and silvery electronic production, as well as the tangibility of Allen’s hurt and her ability to mint viral bits in “who the fuck is Madeleine” and Nonmonogamummy, gave West End Girl not just staying power but a place in the pantheon of great breakup albums. Standout Pussy Palace turned the grottiest of reveals into a kind of cosmic reverie that seems to suggest the elemental rearrangement of life as she knew it; the guttingly powerful Relapse, about the sober musician’s fear of losing her grip after her relationship breakdown, highlighted the temptation of oblivion in numbed-out vocoder. It lands light as icing sugar but lingers deadly as toothache.LS6PinkPantheress – Fancy ThatView image in fullscreenBreathless … PinkPantheress.Photograph: Charlie EngmanTrue to her form for writing the shortest songs in the biz, in just 20 minutes and 34 seconds, PinkPantheress vaults from weed highs to romantic lows, obsessive crushes to gripping paranoia, seduction to confrontation. (“The status cheque is due / So do I still belong to you?” from Nice to Know You, is a classic bluff call.) The music of Fancy That is just as much of a slip’n’slide through British club culture at its most playful and dazzling, from jungle to UKG and the big-tent joys of Underworld, Basement Jaxx and even the hyper-cheesy Just Jack, samples she deploys expertly, and all threaded together by her pointedly sugary voice. It’s a breathless ride, and PinkPantheress’s best case yet for her micro melodramas: why dither when you can pack this much into so little?LSNo 55Lady Gaga – MayhemUnlike the smooth tech-house flavour of her previous album Chromatica, and quite diametrically opposed to the dinner jazz of her albums with Tony Bennett, on Mayhem, Gaga returned to the operatic electroclash that powered her first two albums. There are synths that sound like a Dyson on its last legs. There are the kind of trashy guitars that contractually can only be played by someone sporting a lime mohawk, low-riding leather trousers and nothing else. There is the baby talk of her biggest hit Bad Romance, only where that was “Ro-ma, ro-ma-ma / Gaga, ooh la la” it’s now “Ama ooh na-na / Abracadabra, mutta ooh Gaga”.Read more.BBTNo 44Addison Rae – AddisonView image in fullscreenDreamy synthpop … Addison RaeOnce derided as a former TikTok dancer who made ill-fated attempts to break beyond the platform, Addison Rae’s fortunes changed last summer when Charli xcx invited her to collaborate on a remix, washing away the sticky juvenilia of her social media fame. Her debut album offered up dreamy synthpop that was weirder and more interesting than expected. Opener New York begins sounding floaty and fizzy, but ends in a pummelling explosion of chaos; High Fashion and Times Like These were an experimental hallucination of trip-hop and R&B. The fact that Arca remixed Aquamarine says it all. The pleasures Rae sang about, however, were far simpler. The gauzy, romantic Summer Forever distils the vibe: how fun it is, to be “young, dumb and cute / Nothing to lose”; the record’s mix of hedonism and nostalgia, its proud anti-lore depthlessness and hunger for sensation feel like extremely 2025 techniques for distraction and survival.Read more.Rebecca LiuNo 3 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

After all, few have “the time or attention for a board that needs a lot of explaining”. The trick is to find a balance between styles. “The perfect five would be a hard, a soft, a blue, a sheep and a goat’s,” says Carver, who factors in 50-60g of each cheese per person. “The general consensus is 30-40g, but at Christmas you need more than you can fathomably eat.”As to what those cheeses are, Percival would champion classic regional cheeses that “have languished on the margins for too long”. First up,Stonebeck Wensleydale: “It’s incredibly creamy with a flavour that unfolds long after you’ve eaten it,” she says. “It will make you rethink everything you thought you knew about Wensleydale.” Next up,Appleby’s cheshire, which, Percival notes, is “succulent and mineral, with a gentle crumble and citrus brightness. A big wedge with salted cultured butter and crackers is the perfect cheese course.” Just add a glass of port or kombucha.Mrs Kirkham’s lancashire, meanwhile, would be a dream on Christmas Eve with gingerbread or gingersnaps, Percival adds. Carter, however, is very partial to a sheep’s cheese: “There’s not an awful lot of sheep’s milk cheese made in the UK,” he says, “butWakebridge[made in Derby] is similar to a lancashire or cheddar, and it’s got a nice sweetness to it.”But don’t stop there: you then need to accessorise, Percival says. That might be a plum and red onion chutney, a drizzle of good honey, or some spiced poached quinces, plus those all-important crackers (her go-tos are sourdough and oatcakes). Carter, on the other hand, prefers “something that’s a bit out of the box”. Think a not-too-strong goat’s cheese with rose Turkish delight, say, kimchi with stilton or garlic with brie. “Roast some garlic, then mix it with a bit of honey to make a paste. That, or a simple parsnip puree, would be really nice with a soft, bloomy rind cheese.”While it’s arguably always the right time for cheese, Percival often goes early. “In the US, where I’m from, cheese often appears before the meal. It’s something to nibble with a glass of something fizzy, and its job is to whet the appetite, not finish the meal.” Even so, Carter is firmly in the post-dessert cheeseboard camp: “I like to finishChristmasdinner at about 4pm, eat chocolate for a few hours, then have cheese and port around 6pm. And then that’s Christmas Day done.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Even more delightful is the knowledge that it can be made weeks ahead of time, and whisked out of the freezer and brought to the table as needed. There’s allo a wibbly-wobbly jelly with a soft melt-in-your-mouth set, rather than the more solid, gelatinous variety I so strongly associate with childhood tea parties. Plus, it has sparkling booze in it, which, of course, makes the whole thing feel very grown-up.Salted caramel zuccottoI have a soft spot for salted caramel ice-cream, but you can fill the marsala-drenched panettone shell with whatever flavour ice-cream you like; if you wanted to be extra-fancy, you could even layer different flavours on top of each other, so that, when you slice into the zuccotto, you see stripes of colour down the middle.Prep40 minFreeze1 hr 45 minServes12-142 litres salted caramel ice-cream500g whole panettone120mlmarsala260g dark chocolate, finely chopped150g salted butter150g white chocolate, finely chopped80ml double creamRedcurrants, for decorationTake the ice-cream out of the freezer, open the lid and leave to soften slightly. Line a three-litre bowl with cling-film.Cut the panettone into roughly 2cm-thick slices and press them into the lined bowl so the entire surface is lined with cake; save some for the top. Drizzle most of the marsala over the panettone, again saving a little for the top. Spoon the softened ice-cream into the panettone-lined bowl, then cover the top with the last few slices of panettone, so the ice-cream is sealed inside. Drizzle over the last of the marsala, then cover the whole bowl with cling-film and put in the freezer for an hour, or longer.Melt the dark chocolate and butter in a saucepan on a very low heat, stirring all the while to make sure the chocolate doesn’t burn or catch, then take off the heat.Unwrap the frozen bowl and turn out the frozen panettone and ice-cream cake on to a serving dish, ideally with a lip. Peel off the cling-film, then pour on the hot chocolate so it covers the entire surface of the cake. Return to the freezer for 30–45 minutes, or longer, so the chocolate can harden.Warm the white chocolate and cream in a small saucepan over a low heat, until the chocolate melts, then pour this over the chocolate-covered cake. Decorate with a few redcurrants and return to the freezer until you’re ready to serve.Pomegranate Campari jellyView image in fullscreenSkye McAlpine’s pomegranate Campari jelly.The joy of jelly is that you can (indeed, you must) make it in advance, which in part at least is what makes it such an ideal dinner party dessert. It’s also low-effort, easy to make and both gluten- and dairy-free, so it’s a good option when navigating dietary restrictions.Prep5 minCook15 minSetOvernightServes8-1016g gelatine leaves(about 10 leaves)175ml Campari175ml pomegranate juice400ml prosecco300g caster sugarHandful of pomegranate seeds, to servePut a 1½-litre jelly mould on a small tray, so it’s easy to carry to the fridge once filled; I often use bits of scrunched-up foil to stabilise it on the tray.Put the gelatine in a small bowl, cover with cold water and leave to soak for five minutes. Pour the Campari, pomegranate juice and prosecco into a saucepan. Add 250ml water and the sugar, give it a good stir to help dissolve, then put on a medium heat. Do not stir once the pan is on the heat, because that will kill the bubbles in the prosecco (you want as many of those in the jelly as you can get). Bring to a boil for about a minute, or just under, until the sugar is completely dissolved, then take off the heat.Ladle roughly 250ml of the ruby-red liquid into a measuring jug and add the softened gelatine, giving the leaves a good squeeze first in your hands to remove excess water. Whisk until the gelatine dissolves completely, then pour the remaining liquid from the saucepan into the jug. Carefully pour into the jelly mould, carry to the fridge and leave to set overnight for a gentle, wibbly-wobbly texture. It will now keep happily in the fridge for two to three days.To serve, carefully plunge the mould into a dish of hot (not boiling) water, making sure it doesn’t splash into the jelly. Hold it there for three to five seconds, until you can see the edges begin to separate from the sides of themould, then immediately lift out the mould and put a serving dish on top, taking care to centre the mould on the dish. Using both hands to hold the two together, flip over: the jelly should slip out easily. Sprinkle over the pomegranate seeds to serve.These recipes are edited extracts from The Christmas Companion: Recipes, Crafts and Inspiration for a Magical Festive Season, by Skye McAlpine, published by Bloomsbury at £28.
