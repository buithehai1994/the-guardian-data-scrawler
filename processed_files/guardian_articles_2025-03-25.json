She is also expected to squeeze future Whitehall spending plans to ensure she is on target to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules, despite weaker OBR projections – with full details to be set out in June’s spending review.Since the OBR last gave its assessment in October, government borrowing costs have risen and economic growth has been weaker than hoped. Reeves will underscore her determination to go “further and faster,” to kickstart the economy.Some in Labour had urged Reeves to flex her fiscal rules instead of outlining future spending cuts – but the Treasury fears that any sign of indiscipline would risk spooking bond markets and driving borrowing costs up further.One Labour source said ministers have become frustrated with the way the OBR process works, with last-minute forecast changes significantly affecting policy. “They think the process needs to change, but they can’t go around, for market reasons, shaking it up too much,” they said.With Donald Trump’s administration withdrawing from transatlantic defence cooperation and threatening to impose sweeping tariffs next month, Reeves will repeatedly stress how much the global context has changed.“Our task is to secure Britain’s future in a world that is changing before our eyes. The job of a responsible government is not simply to watch this change,” she will say.But analysts warn that these historic shifts mean that even after promising spending cuts, Reeves may still have to increase taxes to meet rapidly growing pressure for higher defence spending.Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: “Even a small change to the spending plans is going to make this an even more difficult spending review in June, and I think the bigger risk is that we get speculation starting on Thursday about which taxes are going to rise in the autumn – and I think that is really quite politically risky, and economically damaging.”Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: “We just don’t know how they intend to increase spending above 2.5% – that’s the really big one. That’s what’s changed.” He added: “The thing that’s really going to have to shift is her pledges on tax.”Prof Jonathan Portes, of King’s College London, said: “I don’t think they should be making big policy changes now, but I do think over time they will have to reform and increase taxes.”Reeves will tell MPs the move to increase defence spending, which saw the development minister Anneliese Dodds resign in protest at the aid cuts, was “the right decision in a more insecure world”.“This government was elected to change our country. To provide security for working people. And deliver a decade of national renewal. That work of change began in July – and I am proud of what we have delivered in just nine months,” she will say.The chancellor and her Treasury team have been trying to limit the likely fallout from Wednesday’s announcement, aware that both the cuts to Whitehall departments and the welfare impact assessments are likely to cause anger on the Labour benches.One Labour MP said: “Wednesday will be just as important for those impact assessments as for the spring statement itself – that’s when people will start to make their mind up about whether they will vote for these cuts or not.”Officials say they are planning to hold a vote on the changes to personal independence payments in May, with about 30 Labour MPs currently thinking of rebelling.Darren Jones, the Treasury chief secretary, held a meeting with about 100 frontbenchers on Tuesday to lay the ground for the spending cuts to come. People who attended that meeting told the Guardian he had spent much of it insisting that the spending reductions did not amount to austerity, given they are around half the scale of those made by George Osborne as chancellor from 2010 to 2015.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, told the Guardian on Tuesday: “We can’t do everything for everyone, everywhere, all at once. There are lots of things we would like to do now, but we’re having to bide our time so that we can fix the economy, because having those firm economic foundations is the essential prerequisite for everything else we need.”Reeves will announce details of a government transformation fund that Whitehall departments will be able to bid into, to pay for productivity-boosting projects such as overhauling out-of-date IT. Treasury ministers claim this will allow them to do more with less in future years, easing the impact of tighter budgets on public services.She will confirm on Wednesday she will start moving money from the aid budget to defence immediately, dashing the hopes of some Labour MPs who hoped the cuts to the development budget would be delayed until 2027.Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of the international development committee, said: “The government’s statement on cutting aid has had a chilling effect on development projects and staff morale, but it has also had very real consequences. Contract renewals are paused and new projects on hold. Whichever way to pack it, cuts are happening now.”The £2.2bn increase in defence spending from April will bring the country’s military spending up from 2.3% in 2024-25 to 2.36% in 2025-26. Ministers have promised to hit the 2.5% target in two years’ time.The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said Reeves, not global events, was to blame for the slowdown in the economy. “Our national security demands a strong economy. Yet since Rachel Reeves’s first budget, growth is down, borrowing is up and business confidence has been destroyed,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “We have set out a sweeping package of reforms to health and disability benefits that genuinely support people back into work, while putting the welfare system on a more sustainable footing so that the safety net is always there to protect those who need it most.”Additional reportingAletha AduExplore more on these topicsUK newsRachel ReevesSpring statement 2025Office for Budget ResponsibilityBudget deficitEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

It is completely intolerable. It doesn’t serve in Israel’s self interest. It cannot be justified as self-defence, and it has got to stop.”He added: “It’s very frustrating, let me tell you, being a member of the cabinet the United Kingdom and still feeling powerless in the face of this appalling conflict which does nothing for Israelis or Palestinians.”The health secretary’s remarks came in a wide-ranging interview during which he reflected on the flurry of angry emails and messages he received for saying there was an “overdiagnosis” of mental illness.View image in fullscreenWes Streeting at Conway Hall.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverWhile he said he understood why people emailed him with a strength of feeling, he stopped short of apologising, but acknowledged: “We’ve got to handle this in a sensitive way, and I reflect on your feedback … to handle this in a sensitive way”.ThreeNHSpatients who were angry at his comments on young people with mental illness interrupted Streeting as he spoke at the start of the event. They shouted “your cuts will kill” and held a banner which read: “Disability cuts will kill”, as they criticised his support for the planned cuts to personal independence payments to disabled people.Labour is gaslighting disabled people – and that should terrify us all | Zoe WilliamsRead moreReflecting on the government’s unpopular decision to cut disability benefits and foreign aid, Streeting urged Labour’s critical friends to “cut us some slack”.“The government’s been in for five minutes,” he said. “I know it’s hard and some choices we’ve made are unpopular but look at the scale of the challenge.”Defending the growing use of the private sector to tackle NHS waiting lists, Streeting added it is not just the “pragmatic thing to do” but the “principled thing to do” if there is spare capacity in the private sector for the NHS to use, so people can be seen faster.Explore more on these topicsWes StreetingIsrael-Gaza warLabourNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The dispute arose around a decision to focus fundraising in Africa, according to the Times.Harry and Seeiso said in a statement: “These trustees acted in the best interest of the charity in asking the chair to step down, while keeping the wellbeing of staff in mind. In turn, she sued the charity to remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship.“We thank all the trustees for their service over the years and are truly heartbroken they’ve had to follow through with this act.“What’s transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale’s beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.”Sentebale, which means “Forget me not”, was created to help people in Lesotho and Botswana living in poverty and those suffering from HIV and Aids. Former trustees Timothy Boucher, Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, Kelello Lerotholi and Damian West released a statement announcing their decision to unanimously resign as board members.“Today’s decision is nothing short of devastating for all of us, but we see no other path forward as the result of our loss in trust and confidence in the chair of the board.”A spokesperson for the charity said it has not received resignations from either royal patron, adding: “We are pleased to confirm the restructuring of our board on 25 March 2025 to introduce experts with the capabilities and networks to accelerate Sentebale’s transformation agenda as announced last year.”In response, Chandauka said: “Everything I do at Sentebale is in pursuit of the integrity of the organisation, its mission, and the young people we serve. My actions are guided by the principles of fairness and equitable treatment for all, regardless of social status or financial means.“There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.“Discerning readers will ask themselves: why would the chair of the board report her own trustees to the Charity Commission? Why would the high court of England and Wales hear her case and issue an emergency injunction to prevent the same trustees from removing her as the chair of the board?“Well, because beneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to press is the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir – and the cover-up that ensued.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarrySouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It means the initial timeline of two years for implementing the law will now stretch to four.The earliest an assisted dying service is now expected to beoperational is 2029, the year by which the next general election must take place, raising fears among backers of the bill that ministers would be reluctant to push through such a controversial change before voters go to the polls.A spokesperson for Leadbeater said she “hopes and believes the service can be delivered more quickly” but that the changes made to the bill since the autumn meant it would “inevitably take longer to implement”.The delay marks the latest major change to the assisted dying proposals, which have proven deeply contentious in the Commons and beyond.The new four-year timeline will only become official once it is approved by the Commons committee scrutinising the bill, which was due to discuss the proposed change on Tuesday night.Tom Gordon, a Liberal Democrat MP who sits on the committee, said that “delaying implementation risks pushing it beyond the next election, where it could be abandoned altogether”. “We have thoroughly scrutinised and strengthened this bill, ensuring it is safe and robust. Every extra year means more unnecessary suffering for those who cannot afford to wait,” Gordon said.Another MP who supports assisted dying said: “I fear it risks politicising it massively – if it has been through parliament and got support of the public then potentially making it an election issue is not desirable at all. It might have been easier just to not have a deadline at all.” A third supportive MP said they “can’t see Whitehall seeing this as anything other than a chance to delay it indefinitely”.If approved, the bill would allow terminally ill adults in England andWaleswho are expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life. MPs voted in support of the proposal in November.The bill’s supporters had originally intended for it to become law this year and its implementation to begin within two years, in 2027, meaning an assisted dying service would be established well before the next election.Leadbeater’s spokesperson said: “Kim has always been clear that it’s more important to get the assisted dying legislation right than to do it quickly.“The bill now contains even stronger safeguards than when it was first tabled, with a new judge-led voluntary assisted dying commission and multi-disciplinary panels to examine every application. These will inevitably take longer to implement.“But the four-year limit is not a target, it’s a backstop. Kim hopes and believes the service can be delivered more quickly if it becomes law later this year.”Wes Streeting paid tribute to Leadbetter’s “leadership through this process” praising her for constructively engaging with ministers, and her “willingness to compromise through the process”.“I can’t fault the way in which she has tried to engage with people, including critics, on this issue, and that’s been reflected in the decision of the bill committee today,” the health secretary said in an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday night.Jeevun Sandher, a Labour MP supportive of the bill, said: “All of these changes strengthen the bill. Extending the timeline to make absolutely sure we have enough time seems sensible to me. I hope and believe this choice will be available well before the four-year mark.”Pro-assisted dying campaigners expressed disappointment in the change. Andrew Copson, chief executive of Humanists UK, said: “Many other countries already have safe assisted dying laws and none of them has taken more than 19 months to implement them, apart from one that was subject to a court challenge. So it really shouldn’t have to take four years.”Opponents said the delayed timeline was symptomatic of wider problems with the bill. Jess Asato, a Labour MP, said: “Putting an arbitrary timeline on such a complex issue was never a sensible way to make life or death legislation. This last-minute switch demonstrates again just how chaotic this whole process has been with substantial last-minute changes to core sections of the bill.”In a significant change to the original proposals,last month Leadbeater removedthe need for every assisted dying case to be scrutinised by a high court judge after concerns this could overwhelm the court system. Instead, cases will be reviewed by panels including a senior lawyer, a psychiatrist and a social worker.Elsewhere on Tuesday, the Isle of Man’s parliament approved a bill to legalise assisted dying, making it the first place in the British Isles to introduce the change.The legislation, which will now be put forward for royal assent, will give terminally ill people “autonomy and choice” at the end of their lives, said Dr Alex Allinson, a GP and politician who introduced the private member’s bill in 2022.The bill only covers adults resident on the island for five years and who have a terminal illness with a life expectancy of no more than 12 months. They must also have a settled intention to end their life. Doctors will be free to choose whether they want to opt in to providing the service.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingHouse of CommonsEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps she was thinking of the risks of him running into two RAF engineers out on a bender in Berkshire.Fortunately, Paddington’s aunt didn’t have to watch the CCTV footage shown toReadingmagistrates court on Tuesday of Daniel Heath and William Lawrence tearing apart a newly installed statue of her nephew – before absconding with the severed half.The judge seemed to share her love for the famous bear when he said the 22-year-old vandals were “the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for”.“It was an act of wanton vandalism,” district judge Sam Goozee told the pair. “Paddington Bear is a beloved cultural icon with children and adults alike. He represents kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society.“His famous label attached to his duffel coat says, ‘Please look after this bear’ but on the night of 2 March 2025, your actions were the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for.“Your actions lacked respect and integrity, two values you should uphold as members of the armed forces.”To prevent upsetting local children, the remaining half of the damaged statue was hastily concealed, said Trish Willetts, the chief executive of Newbury Business Improvement District, which owns the statue.“We were aware that children would find it upsetting to see the statue completely destroyed,” said Willetts, adding that Michael Bond, the bear’s creator was born in Newbury, which added to the statue’s cultural significance.Heath and Lawrence were arrested at the RAF Odiham base and admitted the offences when interviewed by Thames Valley police. Part of the Paddington Bear statue was later found hidden in the boot of Lawrence’s car.The pair were told to pay £2,725 each towards the costs of repairing the statue. They have also been sentenced to a 12-month community order and required to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.Insp Alan Hawkett, of the Newbury neighbourhood policing team, said “after a short stay at Newbury police station,” Paddington had been handed back to his owners so he could be restored.Hawkett did not say whether the traumatised bear had been offered marmalade sandwiches at the police station.But perhaps Mrs Bird had popped a few extra rounds in his pocket that day – because as Paddington himself is fond of saying: “Things are always happening to me.

However, the chancellor’s message is likely to be defensive after being blown off course in recent months.Last year she promised “no return to austerity”. But after stalled tax receipts denied her the income she expected, and concerns over the global economy and Donald Trump’s anticsraised the UK’s borrowing costs, Reeves is being forced to make cuts to stay within her budget rules. Here is what to expect from Reeves’s speech, which is predicted to be relatively short at just 25 minutes.What spending changes will there be?Reeves is looking to save a further £5bn through public spending cuts, but the details are not due until this summer’s spending review. She had already promised to stay within the spending limits laid out in her October budget. She will say thather fiscal rulesare sacrosanct for the rest of the parliament.It is a rebuke tomany in the economics professionwho argue that such self-imposed constraints unnecessarily restrict the chancellor’s policy options.One of the rules, forcing the chancellor to balance the books for day-to-day spending and borrow extra funds only to support investment, has put pressure on Reeves.At the October budget, Reeves had just £9.9bn in headroom – compared with the average of £26bn over the past 15 years – to meet that fiscal rule.The Office for Budget Responsibility is predicted to tell Reeves that October’s projections have veered into the red, leaving a £10bn shortfall from higher debt financing and aboost to the defence budget from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, at a cost of about £6bn.Several key announcements have already been made: the shuffling of the spending pack meant thatinternational aid took a £6bn hitto cover higher defence costs. The gap from higher debt financing will be filled by£5bn worth of welfare cutsand areduction in civil service jobs that will save £2bn by 2030.Reeves will use the Treasury reserve to fund an extra £2.2bn of defence spending this year, in addition to the £2.9bn agreed last October, pushing spending as a proportion of GDP to 2.36% in 2025-26 – up from 2.3% in 2024-25.How will the OBR revise its forecasts?The spending watchdog’s predicted growth rate of 2% this year is expected to be cut to about 1%. The forecast by theincreasingly powerful arbiter of the Treasury’s sumswas based on ministers spending lots of the extra funds set aside for investment and a rise in consumer spending, which hasn’t happened yet.A rate of growth of 1.8% and 1.6% in the subsequent two years could be upgraded to compensate. Inflation will be slightly higher than previously forecast this year and unemployment roughly the same.October’s forecasts for tax receipts in 2026 and 2027 were upgraded from Jeremy Hunt’s March budget, and these could now be downgraded if growth is seen to be weaker. The potential impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs are a significant unknown.Will Reeves address the spending review?Reeves is likely to talk about the tough choices ahead, but without setting out specific government budget changes planned in the three-year spending review, due to be announced in June.In a move some will say is akin to reinstating austerity, spending reductions will mean that unprotected departments such as justice, transport and the Home Office coping with a smaller amount of money than previously expected over the second half of the parliament.Cuts to the Department of Justice will come at a time when the prison population is set to rise. Potential cuts could leave the government’s building programme at risk, given how it expensive it is to run and build prisons.What tax changes will there be?Labour’s election manifesto pledged no changes to income tax, national insurance and VAT. So, tax changes are off the agenda.Speculation that a freeze on income tax thresholds introduced by Reeves’s Tory predecessor Rishi Sunak, and extended by Jeremy Hunt, will be extended again were last week dismissed as untrue by Treasury officials.What will help reduce the overall deficit is another crackdown on tax avoidance and evasion. After a period of success that has clawed back hundreds of millions in tax, Reeves will say she plans to go further, generating an extra £1bn by 2029-30. This project will involve recruiting an extra 600 staff to HMRC’s debt management teams.Changes already announced in October’s budget mean some taxes are due to rise steeply, including inheritance tax. The income from IHT, after private pensions were brought within its scope, is projected to rise from £7.5bn in the current financial year to £9.7bn in 2029-30.Will borrowing go up?There will be an increase in debt financing after a rise in interest rates on government debt. Reeves will blame the deteriorating public finances on the global rise in borrowing costs.Most governments have suffered an increase in their borrowing costs since January, when Trump began threatening trade tariffs on many of Washington’s biggest and most important trading partners.In the UK, the yield on 10-year gilts – effectively the cost of government borrowing – has risen from 4% a year ago to 4.7%, with some blaming domestic factors as well as the global trend. In 2020, it was exceptionally cheap to borrow after the yield on 10-year gilts fell to 0.3%. Reeves will be keen to keep bond markets calm with memories still fresh ofthe meltdown following Liz Truss’s mini-budgetin 2022.How are Labour’s investment plans working?Reeves will spend a large chunk of the statement talking about initiatives to promote growth and how there are many more to come.She will champion thenewly approvedLower Thames Crossing – a road tunnel joining Essex and Kent – as well as other projects noted in January’sgrowth speech.There will also be more cash for 18,000 new social and affordable homes, which Reeves willallocate £2bn to build.Will local government spending be covered?Reeves is not expected to directly address the extreme pressure on local government budgets. Services are struggling after years of underfunding from previous governments. Local authorities are concerned that the looming cuts could strip adult and child social care provision, which are already facing high levels of demand. Cuts to road maintenance budgets would affect rural communities.Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025Rachel ReevesLabourBudgetOffice for Budget ResponsibilityTax and spendingEconomic policyexplainersShareReuse this content"

In its readout, the Kremlin said that it would only implement theBlack Sea ceasefireonce the US delivers sanctions relief on Russian agricultural products and fertilisers, as well as delisting a major state-owned bank called Rosselkhozbank that services the Russian agricultural industry.That would be the first significant rollback of sanctions on Russia since the war began, and indicates that Moscow will seek a dual price to halt its war against Ukraine: political and military concessions fromUkraineas well as an escape from the international isolation that began after its full-scale invasion in 2022.Russia and Ukraine agree to ‘eliminate the use of force’ in Black SeaRead moreAnd, so far, it looks like that is a deal that theTrump administrationis willing to make.“The ‘Russian art of the deal’ is selling Russian demands as Russian concessions to the Americans, and then demand sanctions relief on top,”wroteDr Janis Kluge, a researcher who focuses on the Russian economy at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a thinktank. “The demand here is that Ukraine is not allowed to attack Russian warships any more and Russia gets to inspect Ukrainian ships.”Any sanctions relief onRussiawill be limited by the readiness of Europe to take similar steps – but Tuesday’s deal still reflects a serious reorientation of the diplomacy around Ukraine and leaves Europe more isolated in restraining Russia.Ukraine had opposed any rollback on sanctions against the Kremlin. PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid that he considered it to be a “weakening of our position and the easing of sanctions” against Russia, a position that was not compatible with an “unconditional ceasefire” against energy infrastructure and at sea.It also appears that either the White House hid the plans to ease sanctions – or US negotiators were themselves surprised by the Russian demand that limits on trade and finance be eased in order to achieve the main deliverable that the White House wants: the ability to declare even a partial ceasefire in Ukraine.“This wasn’t in the agenda before the meeting,” Zelenskyy said on Tuesday. “The Russians, as far as we know, have raised the issue of the American assistance to transport their agricultural products … We didn’t agree to that so that it would be in our common [statement].”Zelenskyy sought to sound upbeat during his remarks, and said that at least now Kyiv could appeal to the White House if Russia chose to violate the ceasefire against Ukraine in the coming month. Ukraine could also demand new sanctions against Russia if that happens, he said.But there are considerable doubts that Trump would be ready to slap further sanctions on Russia. And Steve Witkoff, his envoy, has spent “really a lot of time in dialogue with Putin”, said Zelenskyy, explaining why the White House messaging on the war sounds so much like the Kremlin narrative.In negotiations, a deal that does not work for both sides will collapse sooner or later. Tuesday’s agreement – and the separate statements that have emerged – will raise further questions of whether the US can mediate a conflict in which it appears to clearly sympathise with the Kremlin.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

A former Army National Guard officer, Pete Hegseth, 44, has faced allegations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement and alcohol abuse.His contributions to thegroup chatinclude suggesting that because Americans were unfamiliar with the Houthi armed group in Yemen that messaging could instead focus on the alleged failures of the former US president Joe Biden.He also appeared to be one of the most gung-ho participants, warning: “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza ceasefire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms.” Hegseth also makes references to enforcing “100%” operational security in the event the action was paused, despite the fact it was already compromised by a journalist’s presence in the group.Most alarming, however, was Hegseth’s sharing of a “TEAM UPDATE” the Atlantic decided not to publish because of the risk it said that it posed to US servicemen and operations in the Middle East.JD VanceUS vice-presidentView image in fullscreenJD VancePhotograph: APThe 40-year-old served as a press officer in Iraq for six months in a non-combat role before studying law at Yale and beginning his political career after the success of his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.In the chat, Vance, who has often appeared as Trump’s tag team partner, not least in the Oval Office pile-on of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, displays more independence of thought in the conversation.“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with hismessage on Europeright now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate-to-severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”Later in the chat he reinforces his animus towards Europe, previously seen at the Munich Security Conference, in a message responding to Hegseth: “If you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.”Stephen MillerSenior Trump adviserView image in fullscreenStephen MillerPhotograph: ReutersMiller, 39, a longtime bete noire for liberals due to his incendiary views on immigration and other issues, was also seen as an intellectual architect of efforts to block the election of Joe Biden in 2020, suggesting publicly that slates of “alternate” electors be sent to Congress.Identified by the Atlantic as SM in the conversation, he intervenes to insist that the president has already been clear about the decision to attack Yemen, suggesting that he speaks for Trump and with his authority.“As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. Eg, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”Michael WaltzNational security adviserView image in fullscreenMichael WaltzPhotograph: EPAA former Republican member of Congress and special forces soldier who served overseas, Waltz, like other former military personnel in the chat, including Vance, Hegseth, and the director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, should have been aware of the breach of operational security involved in the chat.It was Waltz, the Atlantic suggests, who erroneously invited Jeffrey Goldberg on Signal to take part in the war planning group.Other significant individuals on the chatView image in fullscreenSteve WitkoffPhotograph: APSteve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, is also involved in negotiations with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, over a Ukraine ceasefire plan.

That is until her hapless husband showed up to drag her home. Noooooo! Don’t do it, Linda!!! Series two, fear not, picks up right where we left off. Linda (Christie) has still only used up 4,320 minutes of her time accrued from 3.5m minutes of domestic drudgery. She is still refusing to go home. Steve (Omid Djalili), her husband, still has jam on his face. And The Change is still the best (and probably the only) TV comedy series ever written about menopause.Of course, like “the change”, this is about so much more than menopause. Christie’s glorious feminist sitcom is a meditation on witchcraft and witch-hunts, paganism, veganism, activism, community, the climate emergency, mushrooms, misogyny, the importance of wringing out a cloth before using it to wipe surfaces, and our national identity. If the first series tracked Linda’s journey to find herself, the second is about what roots that newly uncovered self might put down, and how they might grow an entire movement. By the final episode, stationers “from Gloucester to Bristol” have run out of “Linda’s ledgers” as an army of incensed women start logging chores, wearing “Je suis Linda” T-shirts, and playing pool in the pub before midday. The men, eventually, let them get on with itandsign up to the mandatory housework programme “For Men Who Wipe” with Pig Man. And the mother oak tree felled at the end of the first series grows a fresh green shoot. Hallelujah!Before all that tree-huggery, though, there is deep discord. Enraged by Linda’s new role as “the Mick Lynch of dusting”, the Verderer – surely the best-named angry white Englishman in TV history – orders a town trial at Sarah’s Cafe. Enter judge Joy (Tanya Moodie), who following Linda’s genuinely moving defence – “Did you know it takes three minutes and 12 seconds to shake crumbs out of a toaster?” – casts a vote as to whether she should “leave” or “remain”. The result is close: 48% to 52%. Linda remains! Brexit never looked so farcical, or on the nose.View image in fullscreenAngry white Englishman … Jim Howick as the Verderer.Photograph: Jon Hall / Channel 4Each episode is named after a natural phenomenon, ancient ritual or modern concept. Like “Mycelium” – the thin fungal threads connecting plants and trees via underground mycorrhizal networks – in which Linda’s chore ledger goes stratospheric and the newly radicalised townswomen start plaguing her with questions: “Does sex go in the chore ledger, Linda?” “What about the hand jobs? And the mouth jobs? And the bum jobs?” Her answer? If it feels like a chore, it goes in. Wise woman.Or “Psilocybin”, in which the eels feeding the men at The Eel Cafe since 1850 become critically endangered, Linda forages for a vegan alternative and the menfolk end up on the trip of a lifetime, producing scenes “like something out of a Ken Russell film”. Inevitably, they claim they have been “eelmasculated”. And the Eel Sisters (whose configuration has changed this series, one of them now being Theresa, fresh out of jail) hold a silent supper for some dead spirits and Linda, who – spoiler alert! – as it turns out is their half-sister. The women go on strike, Steve and Siobhain (Liza Tarbuck), Linda’s domineering sister, have full-blown midlife crises of their own, and, worst of all, the men start using one cloth to wipe everything. Retch!The Change is ambitious, surreal, moving, and above all hysterically funny. It is unlike anything else on TV. Partly that is because Christie is a powerhouse of a standup immune to trotting out tired old tropes. Pig Man, for instance, may be a literal caveman but he is the most highly evolved character of them all, and he loves housework. Christie’s absurdly British humour is also key, with hyperspecific jokes about, say, the zoologist and ethnologist Desmond Morris v the Welsh TV presenter Johnny Morris, and she can nail the national character with an observation as neat as a placard scrawled with “Public castration is not a good idea”. But there is a seriousness at the soft heart of it: her bucolic vision is of a Britain that may not exist but very much could if we just ringfenced local funding to pay women “chore benefit”, and learned from the mushrooms. Oh, and gave more women their own TV shows.The Change series two trailer – videoIt concludes with another (gentle) cliffhanger, maintaining the possibility of a third series. (And if there isn’t one, we now have the how-to manual for enacting the feminist uprising.) It also ends, like the first series, in a state of unfettered jubilation as Linda guides a hippy celebration round the mother tree and makes yet another inspirational speech: “Every living thing has a natural life cycle and every living thing dies, and that’s the natural order. We fear it but we can live a life of purpose, like truffles.” It’s not easy to weave an ecstatic, rousing and laugh-a-minute TV show out of a toxic patchwork of midlife despair, domestic inequality, sexism, misogyny, culture wars and ecological and political crises, but Christie has gone and done it again. What a joyful transition.The Change is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewBridget ChristieTelevisionMenopausereviewsShareReuse this content"

Should Netflix have hidden its stars away in a safe house?Mark LawsonTue 25 Mar 2025 11.29 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 11.32 EDTShareStrangers turning up at your house, a vehicle vandalised, violent commentary online, eyes tracking you as you shop –the last episode of Adolescencechillingly shows the modern consequences of sudden public attention.But the creators of the Netflix show – already seeming certain to sweep the prizes in next year’s TV awards – have, in an upsetting case of life imitating drama, experienced something of this attention (although without, we hope, the criminal elements).Along with star Stephen Graham, Jack Thorne co-wrote this extraordinary four-parter about the impact on the Miller family of 13-year-old Jamie stabbing to death a classmate, apparently under the influence of misogynist “incel” rhetoric imbibed online.Thorne reports a digital backlash, telling GQ: “I went on Channel 4 News, and I talked about what I’d seen, and where I’d been, and why we were telling this story, and the comment stream afterwards was all about how I looked. It was all about my oestrogen levels, and my testosterone levels, and who I was as a man.”‘The younger me would have sat up and nodded’: Adolescence writer Jack Thorne on the insidious appeal of incel cultureRead moreOthers involved inAdolescencehave spoken privately about their alarm at the level of comment and attention as they go about their lives in public. In Los Angeles and New York – creative cultures more experienced in the toxic possibilities of publicity – actors in hit shows or films have bodyguards and gated mansions. But the cast of Adolescence may plausibly be seen on a bus or in a shop; the younger performers have to go to school.Such excessive receptions to drama are becoming more common. This intensity of attention has happened three times in the last 15 months: with Mr Bates vs the Post Office (shown on ITV in January 2024),Baby Reindeer(on Netflix last April) and now Adolescence (released by Netflix on 13 March this year).In the case of the drama about the false prosecutions of post office operators for fraud, some cast members were relieved to be filming other shows abroad after it aired, as colleagues texted accounts of being mobbed by the public while shopping or travelling. While this attention was friendly and supportive of the drama’s whistleblowing on corporate cruelty, that distinction may not always be reassuring to those on the receiving end.View image in fullscreenMedia storm … Richard Gadd as Donny and Jessica Gunning and Martha in Baby Reindeer.Photograph: Ed Miller/APRichard Gadd’s TV adaptation of his solo stage show, Baby Reindeer, started a loud conversation because of media and social media attempts to identify the real-life models of a stalker and a rapist in the fictionalised story. This led to a man complaining to the police of false identification and a woman telling Piers Morgan on TV that the stalking storyline was based on her. Last year, a US judge threw out the woman’s claims against Netflixfor punitive damages due to negligencebut allowed a case for defamation to continue.That Adolescence seems to represent a further rise in public scrutiny is unsurprising, given its subject matter of the violently sexist, digital radicalisation of young men. Whereas we cared about post office operators and were gripped by comedian Gadd’s distressing personal life, every parent, teacher and student is more intensely invested in the story of a pubescent child-killer.When the Baby Reindeer controversy happened, the dramatist Russell T Davies suggested inan interview with the Timesthat such a crisis would not have occurred at the BBC, which would have been “much stricter” with editorial checks. While there is no proof that Netflix’s processes failed in regard to Gadd’s drama, Davies’s comment reflected a feeling in British TV that streamer shows can take advantage of being outside the regulatory system led by Ofcom.However, perhaps the greater problem for the corporation is that the three recent drama hits – Adolescence, Baby Reindeer and Mr Bates – were all produced by other broadcasters. That may be one reason why its chief content officer, Charlotte Moore, recently announced that she isleaving the BBC to become an independent drama producer.‘Unnervingly on-the-nose’: why Adolescence is such powerful TV that it could save livesRead moreIn the case of Adolescence, Netflix and the production company (Brad Pitt’s Plan B) had two separate duties of care. The first was during shooting, and applied especially to the 15-year-old Owen Cooper, who plays Jamie, to protect him while repeatedly rehearsing and performing traumatic material. By all available accounts, such support was impeccably dispensed on set.The second obligation of producers, though, is post-transmission. And here there might be questions. Everyone in the media wants a piece of a hit, but I have been surprised by the level of publicity commitments carried out by Cooper – given his age and this being his first role – and Thorne, whose charmingly unguarded personality can make him vulnerable to gotcha interviewing. That, though, is not only a matter for Netflix and Plan B; the media should also think about who they interview and how, and the framing of the coverage.View image in fullscreenShould he have had so many publicity commitments? … the 15-year-old actor Owen Cooper in Adolescence.Photograph: NetflixThe biggest lesson, though, is that we tend to think of the arts as soft and safe, a haven from the heavy issues of news and tribalisms of sport. But because fiction often interrogates events and beliefs, culture is on the frontline of ideological tensions. Fiction is dangerous.SoSalman Rushdie is half-blindedand otherwise mutilated for his defence of free writing and speech. Audiences at last year’s open-air staging of Fiddler on the Roof in Regent’s Park walked though heightened security apparently deemed necessary for a Jewish show with Jewish actors. A theatre producer recently told me about having quietly dropped a planned production of a play about neo-Nazis because of security advice – that the theatre would not be safe for audiences and performers. And actors in a TV show must plead to be left alone.From now on, producers will have to think hard about how to protect creative teams from the device and real-life attention that Adolescence, among other things, so brilliantly dramatised.Especially with Netflix shows – which have a coordinated global drop that can make the vulnerability of those involved universal – recognisable creatives in standout series should probably go to a metaphorical or actual safe house when transmission begins. (Again, this is complicated with streamers by the period of weeks or months in which a show may be first seen.) If the subject matter is controversial, the producers should probably strongly recommend that those involved neither post on nor read social media, especially if young or vulnerable.Great drama reflects society, but Adolescence has found a terrifying reflection staring back at it.Explore more on these topicsAdolescenceTelevisionBaby ReindeerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pickett’s award-winning new play takes a sideways look at her downfall – by imagining its impact on everyday womenTue 25 Mar 2025 12.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 13.04 EDTShareLike many British schoolchildren, Ava Pickett chanted the “Divorced, beheaded, died” rhyme about Henry VIII’s six wives – and it has stayed in her head ever since. So much so that her play 1536 pivots around the last days of the second wife, Anne Boleyn. Pickett’s history lessons covered Boleyn’s magnificent rise – which sparked a passion so great the king bent constitutional law to marry her – as well as the torrid details of her downfall and beheading. Pickett believed the “facts” (that Boleyn committed treason, that she slept with her brother) until she didn’t. “The older I got,” says the 31-year-old, “the more I thought, ‘I don’t buy that.’”Named after the year of Boleyn’s death, 1536 comes at the queen’s story sideways. She is not seen on stage but is talked about by three young women who meet in an Essex field, in between work, to quibble and gossip about men, haircuts and the king’s bride. Their predicaments gain chilling resonances as the local men become more puritanical, mirroring the patriarchal violence of Henry’s court.Men can change the air in a room – but it’s hard to name, hard to call outThis is not Pickett’s first foray into historical drama – she has also written for Hulu seriesThe Great,based on the life of Catherine the Great. She says 1536 grew from her interest in “the whispered conversations between women” about Boleyn. “‘Do you think she did it, though?’ ‘Do you really think he’s going to kill her?’” Another oblique question was what the king’s marriage has to do with them. “That’s something I really care about,” says Pickett. “The way it permeates day-to-day lives.”By “it” she means misogyny and the trickle-down effects of patriarchy, which, she makes clear, is not just the stuff of historical drama. “For me it’s absolutely about now,” she says. “Of course it is. We still lower our voices and say, ‘He did this thing – do you think that’s weird?’ We still question ourselves … There are men in positions of power who have done absolutely terrible things to women. What does it mean to watch them get elected or re-elected?”View image in fullscreenElle Fanning as Catherine in The Great, to which Pickett contributed.Photograph: Gareth Gatrell/HuluWhile writing the play, the misogyny around her became so glaring that she couldn’t unsee the way it filtered through society. “I’m interested in the subtlety [of it] and the way that men can change the air in a room,” she says. “It’s hard to name, hard to call out.”1536 wonthe Susan Smith Blackburn prize for female, transgender and non-binary playwrights in 2024. At the ceremony, Pickett called it “a love letter to friendship”. She has a circle of female friends, some of whom she has known since school. This isn’t as cosy as it sounds. These friendships, as glorious as they are, come with prickly edges: “I feel so known by them and it can feel dangerous when you’re fighting with someone who has known you since you were 14.”This is the side of “sisterhood” that is not always acknowledged, she continues, because as women “you’re meant to be on the same side”. In 1536, Pickett felt “a need to explore the ugliness of friendship. I think this idea that ‘We’re best friends and we’ll always be best friends’ in sisterhood is so untouchable. But it just isn’t true. You have to really work at your friendships. That’s beautiful, but it does also means that there are moments of real savagery.”View image in fullscreen‘I have been incredibly lucky’ … Pickett.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianPickett started out wanting to act. Born in Essex, she was one of the first in her family to go to university (at Middlesex), and followed up her theatre degree with a master’s from the Central School of Speech and Drama. “That was great but when I came out it went so badly. I was one of the only people not to get an agent, I didn’t know anyone in the industry, I was working in a cinema and had no money, so eventually I had to move back to Clacton. I wassoembarrassed. I had made such a big deal about going to uni and wanting to be an actor.”And yet, at her lowest ebb, she started to write a sitcom, Essex Girls, about an eldest daughter who goes to London to realise her dreams and comes back having failed. “I’d auditioned for a producer a couple of years earlier and still had his email so I wrote saying, ‘Could you read it?’ He read it and said, ‘You have to come back to London.’”She did, and Pickett has straddled the worlds of theatre and TV ever since. She currently has a satire in development with Derry Girls’ Lisa McGee. “I have been incredibly lucky in that I have benefited from people holding the door open,” she says. “It’s so easy to back people when they’ve had some success. If you believe in someone’s talent, you should get behind them. A producer got behind me with Essex Girls and it changed my life. My agent got behind me and it changed my life. Think about how many people would have kept going if someone had got behind them early.”1536 is at theAlmeida theatre, London, 6 May-7 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreAwards and prizesAlmeida theatreMonarchyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But Hammond has also written a boisterous comedy about teenage girls who take feet pics for OnlyFans and share TikTok dance crazes and Las Vegas pipe dreams in a Swansea chicken shop. As director Hannah Noone’s well-calibrated, 75-minute production switches from humour to terror, the rush from a soundtrack featuring Charli xcx is replaced by gnawing silence.Hot Chicks is the name of the WhatsApp group that 15-year-old besties Ruby and Kyla start with the smooth Sadie who walks into their fast food spot one day and becomes … what, exactly? She’s too old for their friend group, could just about be their mother, but assumes both roles before also becoming their boss. In front of the pair, who can’t afford a box of chicken and chips between them, Sadie casually flaunts her designer labels and brings in a bag of last season’s clothes as hand-me-downs. Ruby’s eyes widen as she picks up a sparkly jacket – soon she and Kyla are trying on Sadie’s lifestyle, too, with the rewards of drug running.View image in fullscreenSmooth … Rachel Redford in Hot Chicks.Photograph: Kirsten McternanBetween them, Londiwe Mthembu (Ruby) and Izzi McCormack John (Kyla) convey a spectrum of teenage innocence and experience akin to the characters in Sophie Ellerby’s slow-burning 2019 playLit. Ruby clowns around with the abandon of a child relieved to not be at home, where the fridge is empty and her father is unpredictable. Kyla has more front, openly suspicious of Sadie (Rachel Redford) yet similarly enticed by her wealth.At this final preview performance, the shifting dynamic between the trio is horribly compelling as Sadie flatters, cajoles, scolds and sympathises with the girls, learning intimate details of their lives in order to exploit them. Only two scenes – a command to lick the floor and a lesson in kissing – require some fine-tuning for full impact. Richard Elis is equally good as Cheney, who runs the shop, sketches in some local history and is both foil and father figure for the girls yet ultimately proves as vulnerable too.Tic Ashfield’s sound and Katy Morison’s lighting set a stark tone, the harsh neon glare a cut-price equivalent of the Vegas glitz the girls crave. Similarly exposing is Hannah Wolfe’s traverse set design, with the glass shopfront at one end and Cheney’s counter at the other. All of it evokes a hollowness the girls feel, exacerbated by chasing likes and social media comparisons, duly exploited by Sadie.This is an alarming drama, even if the coda to theShermanandGrand Ambition’s co-production frames the cycle of abuse a little too neatly. The scene that immediately precedes it has a devastating power and gives another sense to the play’s “chicks”. When one of the characters makes their final exit, I was reminded of what Arthur Miller said about the end of A Streetcar Named Desire – that when Blanche leaves the stage in Williams’s play, we go right along with her.AtSherman theatre, Cardiff, until 5 April.

Feel safe? Me neitherTue 25 Mar 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 14.19 EDTShareOnce again, we find ourselves having an anguished debate about mobile phones and online safety, in this case asking: should we ban the devices for US national security advisers under the age of 60? Do you know what your national security adviser isdoing on his device? Is he using it to stay in touch with other guys in the big-man-osphere to talk about bombing Hooters? Or did he maybe add the editor-in-chief of a leading general interest magazine to a Signal group in the crucial period running up to a highly sensitive US military operation in Yemen, seemingly committing so many alleged crimes that he should have a full-body orange jumpsuit tattooed on him for ever?By now, you will have caught up with the tale of one of the most idiotic breaches of security imaginable – seemingly executed, regrettably, by the actualUS national securityadviser. Mike Waltz seems to have been aided and abetted in his full-spectrum fatuity by other ultra-senior figures, including the vice-president, JD Vance, and the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, who shared detailed operational and strategic information in a chat to which Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg had been accidentally invited. Is Hegseth OK? Has he returned to being – how to put this delicately? – someone you probably don’t want to give important tasks to “after lunch”?On another tangent, meanwhile, was there some extremely senior military or government official with either the first name Jeffrey, or the second name Goldberg, whom Waltz actually meant to add? And did that intended Jeffrey or Goldberg wake up the next day, see theYemennews, and feel a deeply wounded sense of Fomo? “Wait, you guys bombed Yemen without me? I hate you ALL. I demand you put me in the group chat NOW, just so I can immediately flounce off and leave the group chat.”The breach exposes so many things that it is difficult to know where to start. It certainly highlights the almost immeasurably rich lexicon of emojis. You realise that a certain type of guy deploys the same three emojis for taking out a Houthi target as they would if Bryson DeChambeau nailed a slightly tricky putt on the 14th at the West Palm Beach Pro-Am. Punching fist, USA flag, flames emoji. Let’s GO, Bryson!That said, the emojis are obviously the best of it. Less easy to scroll past is the bit where Vance, or his proxy, says: “I just hate bailing out Europe again.” Then Hegseth replies: “I fully share your loathing of European freeloading. It’s PATHETIC.” Mm. Three weeks ago, we hadVance offering a blanket disparagementof European forces as “some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years”. Now we have this Signal chat – yet another sweet memorial to all the European service personnel who gave their lives in the US Republican party’s endlessly stupid 9/11 wars. We never asked to be reimbursed for that military assistance – very BAD! very Wrong! – and are now repeatedly hearing that it meant nothing to Marine-adjacent shutterbug Vance, who remains the most unbearably loud and rude American at the luxury hotel breakfast. They really should make a darkly satirical TV show about these absurd, degenerate, unpleasant people. Call it The White Potus.Needless to say, the first instinct of the Trump administration has been to insult the journalist, when in less responsible hands than Goldberg’s this could have been catastrophically endangering information for involved US service personnel and intelligence operatives. At time of writing, Hegseth’s sole comment on the bed he and the guys just shat was to attack the man to whom they personally served this scoop, calling Goldberg “a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist”. Is he though? Come on, Pete! Given the same information in real time, your boy Joe Rogan would have livestreamed it and you know it. At least Donald Trump would have been up to speed with it that way. “I don’t know anything about it,” was the president’s sleepy verdict yesterday, a day he spent wetting his pants about some oilpainting of himhanging somewhere in the Colorado state legislature.As for consequences, do please remember that we are dealing with the biggest hypocrites on the planet. Consider their own thunderous statements on infosec. Here is the chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, just last week: “If you have a private that loses a sensitive item, that loses night vision goggles, that loses a weapon, you can bet that that private is going to be held accountable. The same and equal standards must apply to senior military leaders.” Also last week, here is Trump’s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard: “Any unauthorised release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such.” Was Tulsi on the Signal chat? Course she was! If you still want more, here’s Hegseth mining the seemingly endless potential of Hillary Clinton’s careless use of a private server for classified information back when he was a Fox News host: “If it was anyone other than Hillary Clinton, they would be in jail right now.” “When I’m president of the United States, neither she nor any of these other people are going to be above the law,” was the previous verdict of one Marco Rubio, last seen on the Houthi chat appearing in the role of secretary of state of the United States.We’ll have to wait and see if these clowns will hold themselves to their own very high standards. In the meantime, please enjoy European diplomats declaring that as far as the relationship between the continent and the US goes, this is “the writing on the wall”. If only it HAD been written on a wall – that would actually have been more secure and secretive. Come to that, it would genuinely have been more secure and secretive to hire a skywriting plane.

Absolutely no judgment if so, but anyone who isn’t into that sort of thing may want to avoid a holiday to the US at the moment. Although I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that. Unless you’ve been hiding under a news-blocking rock (in which case: what’s the address? And can I join you?), you’ll have noticed that Donald Trump’s America hasn’t exactly been rolling out the red carpet for visitors. There have been a number of recent incidents where white westerners – people who aren’t normally targeted by overzealous US immigration authorities – have been detained, deported ordenied entryfor obscure reasons.Take the 28-year-old Welsh artistRebecca Burke, for example. She was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) for 19 days in what her father described as “horrendous conditions”. Now, to be fair, Burke had the wrong paperwork: she hadn’t realised that she needed a working visa instead of a tourist visa in order to exchange domestic chores for accommodation with a host family. But getting imprisoned for almost three weeks over a mix-up and then being led on to a deportation flight –in chains!– back to a country that is supposedly a close ally, is obviously extreme. A Canadian woman alsomade headlinesafter being detained by Ice for two weeks when immigration enforcement officers flagged her visa application paperwork. And two German tourists were similarly held for almosttwo weeks in a detention centre.In response, some countries havebeefed up their adviceabout travel to the US. Last week, Germany updated its UStravel advisoryto emphasise that a visa or entry waiver does not guarantee entry. Meanwhile,the UK’s Foreign Officehas revised its guidance to emphasise that you should comply with all requirements as “the authorities in the US set and enforce entry rules strictly [and] you may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules”.The Trump administration is descending into authoritarianismRead moreForget being careful about following the rules – just don’t come here. Why spend your money in the US, which is threatening to annex its neighbours and rapidly descending into authoritarianism? I don’t say any of that lightly, to be clear. The US government is not synonymous with the American people. The majority of those didn’t actually vote for Trump: onlyabout 32% of eligible voters cast a ballot for him. There will be plenty of people in the tourism industry who are horrified about what’s happening and who may be hurt from a drop-off in international travel.Nevertheless, choosing how we spend our cash is the greatest power most of us have. And choosing to deploy it in Trump’s America helps normalise an abnormal situation. If I (a British-Palestinian with a US green card) wasn’t based in Philadelphia already, I absolutely wouldn’t be thinking about travelling stateside right now.I’ll tell you what I am thinking about a lot at the moment, however: whether it’s wise for me to do any sort of travel that involves interaction with US border authorities. When I got my green card 10 years ago, after spending more than $11,000 on legal fees and huge amounts of time on paperwork, I thought I’d finally be able to stop worrying about my US immigration status. Now, of course, as the high-profile detention ofMahmoud Khalilover his pro-Palestine activism shows, not even permanent residents are secure.

Heck, you’re not even safe if you’re an American citizen. Trump recently threatened to send anti-Tesla protesters to anotorious prison in El Salvador.

Depriving 2 million pensioners of the winter fuel allowance. Refusing to scrap the two-child benefit cap to lift nearly half a million children out of poverty. Raising tuition fees for students by more than the rate of inflation. Cuttingoverseas aidto the poorest people across the globe by half. Cutting£5bn from benefitsfor disabled people. Introducing a new round of cuts to government department spending andlaying off 50,000public sector workers.I very much doubt even 12 months ago you would have thought that this would be theLabourparty in government.It is expected that in the spring statement, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will seek to justify this effective return to austerity by the necessity to maintain “iron” economic discipline through a rigid adherence to her fiscal rules. The chancellor’s argument will be that the world has changed, which is true, but this prompts the question: why, then, doesn’t the government’s strategy change to meet the situation it now finds itself in? Even Germany’s iron laws welded into its constitutionare being adaptedto the new economic realities.Media briefings suggest that in her spring statement speech on Wednesday Reeves wants to be upbeat about Labour’s achievements so far. She is likely to cite the welcome rise in the minimum wage, but may fail to acknowledge that even working full-time on the minimum wage means a person is nearly £10,000 below the annual income, after tax,calculated by the Joseph Rowntree Foundationas necessary to secure an acceptable standard of living.In recent interviews Reeves has already claimed this year’s above-inflation rise in wages as a government success, but has failed to mention that even with this long awaited rise, wages remain so low that37% of peoplehaving to claim universal credit are actually in work.At least she will have some big numbers to cite on investment in the NHS and infrastructure. The problem is that much of the new NHS money could be drained away by the strains placed on it as disabled people find they are unable to cope without the support that has been taken away from them. This will include elderly people without adequate physical care and younger people without mental health support.The problem with the increase in infrastructure investment is also that the memory of the cut in Ed Miliband’sgreen investment budgetlingers in the mind and, as Reeves has repeatedly been warned, infrastructure investment takes a long time to feed into growth on any scale in the economy, and any benefit is likely to land after the next election.The danger now is that the government’s standing could be irretrievably damaged as the Labour party is branded just another austerity party. This will provide the key that opens the door to the populist Reform UK. Nigel Farage’s party doesn’t need to present a rational, implementable alternative economic policy programme. It will simply go full Trump to distinguish itself from both Conservatives and Labour by portraying itself as anti-establishment, the defender and voice of the working class – while targeting immigrants, wokeism and even some corporations.The polls and council byelection results are showing that there is a crisis of confidence in the government, reflecting the reactions and worries about recent policies among our supporters and even party members. But it is not too late to turn things around. In the very short term, a relaxing of the fiscal rules would enable the chancellor to raisesufficient taxesfrom those with the broadest shoulders to prevent a return to ongoing austerity.It is not rocket science to implement a programme of marginal tax rises that would end cuts and fund the progressive policies any Labour government would aim to pursue. The list is obvious: equalising capital gains tax with income tax rates; a realistic rise in corporation tax; afinancial transaction tax; the introduction of a small wealth tax on multimillionaires, called for by thePatriotic Millionaires group.There are also many non tax measures to help people who are still struggling with the cost of living, such as fair rent controls, service charge caps, stricter controls on energy and water price rises, and reviews of food price rises to prevent price gouging. However, the spring statement and the subsequent public spending review in June should define what the long-term strategy of the government is rather than responding to the short-term political and economic mess it has created for itself. For this I urge the chancellor to look beyond just stabilising our economy and managing the existing system slightly more efficiently than the Conservative chancellors before her.Labour’s economic strategy is outdated. I can fix that | Jagjit ChadhaRead morePeople want long-term change that provides everyone with a decent quality of life and addresses the grotesque levels of inequality in our society and the environmental crisis. Over the past 25 years, I have followed the work of Richard Wilkinson and subsequently his colleague Kate Pickett at theEquality Trust. Their detailed research has forensically revealed the impact of inequality on our society and economy. To quote thetrust’s reporttimed to coincide with the election of the new government last year: “Biased public policies and flawed economic systems are serving a few wealthy people at the expense of the wellbeing of people and planet.”The report went on to outline how the duty that was enacted in the Equality Act 2010 to reduce inequalities resulting from socioeconomic disadvantage could be implemented by redistribution power and wealth in our society. This includes new policy-making mechanisms that empower communities to identify and design the services to address their needs, wealth taxes to fund these, universal social security programmes and community wealth-building.I thought and hoped, maybe naively, that this was the sort of programme that the incoming Labour government would implement. The track record of the government so far is, sadly, remarkably distant from this progressive approach. The spring statement could be the opportunity to change that narrative, not just by bridging the short funding gap with redistribution but more importantly to narrate and launch the longer term progressive path we need to achieve true Labour goals.My remaining hope is that the chancellor will seize that opportunity, for I fear that if she doesn’t it will be impossible to recover the ground we have lost.John McDonnell is the independent MP for Hayes and Harlington.

Most now accept the need for closer tiesTue 25 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 07.49 EDTShareAs the chancellorekes out every last billionthis week, it’s worth stepping back and remembering one key reason why Britain fares worse than its neighbours: Brexit. On Monday,MPs debatedwhether to rejoin the EU following the success of a public petition that gained 134,000 signatures. Don’t hold your breath. The government replied by quoting its not-until-hell-freezes-over manifesto pledge: “there will be no return to EU membership”. But the global Trumpquake has shaken all certainties, upended all that seemed solid. The European defence emergency has made talk of Brexit and its future less taboo on both sides of the Channel. Close observers note the ice breaking. “Things are moving in the right direction,” says Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform (CER).Nonetheless, Labour is so paralysed by Brexit that despite its hunt for growth, it has said nothing about the monumental sums that leaving the EU have cost the economy. Estimates vary, but the CER sets ourlosses at 5% of GDP. That’s a vast sum: 1% of Britain’s GDP is worth£25.6bn. Goldman Sachs’scalculations are similar. Researchers at the London School of Economics found that theUK lost £27bn in exportsto the EU in the first two years; the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) reckons Britain has seen a15% reductionin trade.Last week Policy Exchange, a pro-Brexit thinktank, tried to salvage some shred of Brexit’s reputation, but to no avail. Sifting through the statistics, even it couldn’t find any Brexit advantages. Try as it might to produce a positive narrative, its reportLess Than Meets the Eyecould only attempt to limit the damage. It concluded that the OBR’s 15% trade reduction was “greatly exaggerated – and that the real impact is only a small fraction of what has been assumed”.Out tumbles more bad Brexit news. This month the Food and Drink Federation reported that its exports to the EU, much its biggest market, weredown by 34%. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research found that businesses now invested12.4% lessthan they would have done if Brexit hadn’t happened. The City lost 40,000 finance jobs soon after Brexit: those high earners who have departed Britain lost the Treasury£1bn a year in tax.You want more? Brexit is a key factor in the worst UK medicine shortages in four years, the Nuffield Trustreported this month. I have folders full of similar figures, but let’s leave it with this from the thinktankUK in a Changing Europe: “Five years on and Brexit still defines the UK economy … and will continue to.” In the long term, forget budgets picking over a little taxing and cutting here and there as Britain falls further behind. Rachel Reeves is right to call growth our only hope. But Brexit is a great drag on that ambition. Even if the UK schmoozes itself into avoiding Donald Trump’s very worst tariffs, the EU is still our biggest market.“The world has changed,” the chancellor told the BBC. The doubt is whether the government is changing fast enough to repair the pain caused by Brexit. Now is the moment to speak honestly about Brexit’s colossal harm. Most know it already, according to the polls. Even 54% of Britons who voted leave, including 59% of voters in “red wall” seats, say they would accept free movement for UK and EU citizens in exchange forsingle market access.Most politicians shudder at any rerun of the poisonous referendum, but it’s good to keep preparing the ground, as with this latest Westminster debate, even while the government fails to follow changing public attitudes. Keir Starmer has called for an “ambitious UK-EUdefence and security partnership”, butFrance has blocked British defence companiesfrom accessing a €150bn (£125bn) European defence fund. How the Brexiters celebrated.“So much for the Brexit reset!”sneered the Mail. Grant of the CER is optimistic that the French will fall in with the rest of the EU, and that Britain will get access the fund. Behind the scenes, UK ministers and their EU counterparts have beenshuttling across the Channelfor meetings.The three asks in Labour’s manifesto are important: a veterinary deal to let food cross the border, a mutual recognition agreement for professional qualifications and performing artists free to travel, not yet agreed by the EU. Youth mobility looks likely to be agreed for the 19 May EU-UK summit. But these measures won’t yield much economic benefit. The CER’sJohn Springford calculatedthey will only add 0.3-0.7% to UK GDP.Labour is jumpy at even mentioning youth mobility, but it’s time to resist the Home Office and take all students and young temporary residents out of migration numbers.Starmer’s adept handling of Ukraine has won goodwill for Britain, but the EU will stay dubious about a country that assaulted it – and all it stands for. It would help restore trust in UK good faith if they saw him facing down the Brexiters and their noisy media, now barely more than a minority cult, so mad they even explode with fury at the UK aligning with the EU’s universalphone chargers.There is a destination Britain should aim for: Switzerland. It hasjust renegotiatedits complex patchwork of EU agreements, partly in the single market, for goods only. It has food and product safety agreements dynamically aligned, keeping up with changes and covering electricity trade, which Britain wants too. It’s inside the Horizon and Erasmus funding programmes (for research and education and training respectively). It allows freedom of movement, with the same “emergency brake” that Cameron originally agreed. However inflexible the EU seems, Switzerland shows painstaking deals of mutual advantage can crisscross the apparently rigid single market rules.Making the Blair/Brown mistake of never explaining to voters the value of the EU, Starmer doesn’t dare make bold speeches to Britain about his EU reset. It’s time he did. He might find he attracts great respect for telling the truth about whatBrexithas done to us, by daring to confront the Brexiters head on.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionEconomic policyBrexitEuropean UnionEconomic growth (GDP)Foreign policyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Whether it will prove strong enough to protect Europe’s liberal democracies and deter Russia without US military support may be tested all too soon.Nato was created under US leadership to keep the Soviet Union at bay while suppressing centuries-old rivalries among European powers. The alliance stayed united through the cold war and attracted new central European members after communist rule collapsed. But the spectre ofUS disengagementnow threatens to leave Europe without its nuclear-armed protector.As Trump races to seek an accommodation with Putin at the expense of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, European leaders have discovered to their dismay that neither Nato nor the EU is in a position to provide security guarantees for Kyiv. Trump has nixed any Nato role in Ukraine and Hungary’s Viktor Orbánhas blockedany EU consensus.A “coalition of the willing” has brought nations together in varying configurations to try to bolster Volodymyr Zelenskyy and pull together a possible security force for Ukraine in case of a ceasefire. At its core is a group of five European powers – the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Italy – dubbed the E5, which has the makings of a durable if informal security council.Between them, these five nations have most of Europe’s economic output, military forces and political clout. Britain and France are Europe’s only nuclear powers and permanent members of the UN security council. Germany has Europe’s biggest economy and has just loosened its constitutional debt brake to unleash a massive surge in defence spending. Poland is Nato’sbiggest defence spenderproportionate to gross domestic product and will soon have Europe’s biggest army.The E5 is not an ideal format. The eight Nordic and Baltic states that are leaders in European defence and resilience deserve a voice. On the other hand, Italy’s seat at the top table owes more to its legacy status as a southern founder member of the EU, and to the prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s political ties to Trump, than to Rome’s willingness to take any military risks forUkraine.The French president, Emmanuel Macron,first raisedthe need for a European security initiative in 2017 to mitigate the geopolitical damage from Britain’s vote to leave the EU. Nothing came of it then because the wounds of Brexit were too raw. Macron tried again after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, leading to the creation of a 44-nationEuropean political communitythat brought together leaders of “free Europe” for strategic discussions. Without executive powers or a secretariat, the forum has so far been more a photo opportunity than an effective continent-wide security body, but at least it gathers the European family.In a Guardian column last September, I noted thatEurope appearedto have settled into a holding pattern of helping Ukraine just enough to keep its head above water but not enough for it to prevail. A Nato official told me it may take a “second shock” of the magnitude of Russia’s full-scale invasion to jolt Europeans out of their complacency and spur them to take more radical collective steps to boost their own defences.Trump’s return to the White House has delivered that shock. Within a few short weeks, he adopted Moscow’s narrative on the origins of the war,branded Zelenskyy a dictator, subjected him to ahumiliating ambushin the Oval Office, and cut off arms and intelligence for Kyiv. He riled allies with demands that the US take over Greenland, part of EU member Denmark, retakecontrol of the Panama canaland absorb Canada as the 51st state of the US.Europe is crying out for leadership. After years of drift, Germany is finally ready to answer | John KampfnerRead moreTrump undermined Nato by saying he would not defend countries that did not meet their defence spending targets. His vice-president, JD Vance, excoriated European democratic values in ahostile speechat the Munich Security Conference, and his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, told European allies the US wasshifting its military focusto Asia and they would need to take care of their own security in future. The shock sits deep and some European governments are still in denial, at least publicly.London and Paris have taken the lead in trying to moderate Trump and prevent him selling out Ukraine while organising a European mobilisation to support Kyiv. The European Commission has put forward a collaborativerearmament plancentred on €150bn in EU loans. There are now reports that the UK, France, Germany and Nordic countries are working on a plan for aphased European takeoverof US Nato responsibilities over five to 10 years, to be put to Trump before a Nato summit in June.All this suggests that a de-facto European security council is already at work trying to limit the damage from Trump’s geopolitical wrecking ball and prevent a security vacuum in Europe. However, reports that his administration is alsoconsidering vacatingthe top Nato military post of Supreme Allied Commander Europe, which has embodied the transatlantic security guarantee since 1951 (with Eisenhower in the role), suggest the transition may be sudden, unilateral and chaotic rather than gradual, consensual and negotiated.That would be a true stress test of whether Europeans can handle their own security in an increasingly lawless world of predatory great powers.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A blinding, unwashed, entirely distracting relationship that I turn to when everyone else in my house is asleep. My new bedmate whispers in my ear when I’m supposed to be sleeping and leaves imprints on my neck in the morning. That’s right: I’m talking about my new sleep mask with built-in wireless speakers.When I got pregnant last year, my body appeared to forget, entirely, how to sleep. Which was fun, as everyone around me started to joke rather grimly about precisely how tired I was about to make myself for the next 18 years. But then my husband presented me with a small, padded strip of grey velvet fabric, through which I can play precisely the sort of soporific audio that quells even my most brutal insomnia.Perhaps it’s a hangover from being lulled into unconsciousness by audiobooks as a small child, but nothing sends me off like talking. However, when you share a bed with someone, it can be difficult to crank up the volume on, say, James Herriot’s If Only They Could Talk without rousing the rabble.Have you ever been tired enough to put your shoes in the microwave? This is my world: welcome! | Nell FrizzellRead moreWhich is where the sleep mask comes in. For less than £20, I can enter a one-woman sensory deprivation chamber every night, in which I can’t see and can’t hear anyone snorting, snoring, coughing or calling for attention at 11.27pm. The story is piped directly into my ears – I have resolutely refrained from looking up the potential medical effects of Bluetooth speakers positioned so close to your brain, and I’d appreciate it if nobody enlightened me. And, as long as I remember to set the timer, they will turn off after half an hour, 45 minutes or even two hours.In the middle of the night, after changing a nappy, I often forget to do this last bit, and so have the slightly disorienting experience of falling asleep listening to Frank Skinner discuss the works of Seamus Heaney, only to wake up three hours later with a programme about the infiltration of the IRA by British intelligence or theDesert Island Discs of Clarissa Dickson Wrightblasting away against my skull.But that’s the thing about love – it’s unpredictable.Nell Frizzell is the author ofHolding the Baby: Milk, Sweat and Tears from the Frontline of MotherhoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On paper, Amelia’s one of theluckier ones:she has a stable job and lives in a city where rents are 35% lower than the national average. Yet for three months, Amelia has failed to find a single alternative home she could afford.Though she is theoretically eligible for social housing, joining the1.3m householdsalready trapped on waiting lists won’t fix her immediate crisis. Neither, it seems, will Labour’s flagship pledge tobuild 1.5m new homes.Last month, the government promised a£350m increasein affordable housing funds. But what does “affordable” mean in practice? It’s defined as a rent of no more than80% of market rate. In a market where house priceshave risen to nine timesaverage wages in England and Wales, 80% of any such amount has clearly becomecompletely unaffordablefor most people.Of the 2,800 new affordable homes to be built with the extra funding, the government has said half will be social rent (homes that are either owned by housing associations or local authorities, available at 50% of market rate and meant for people on low incomes); the money will alsofund an additional 250 council homes. These promises come on the back of ministers consistently acknowledging theunabating lack of social homes. This raises the question: why are Labour’s interventions not commensurate with the scale of the problem we are facing, and the opportunity it has to fix it?Successive governments have exacerbated rather than solved the crisis, with policies solidifying housing as a commodity rather than a right. The housing crisis experienced by people such as Amelia is a direct result of the selloff of social housing. This has been caused, in part, by thefailure to endordevolvethe right-to-buy scheme, which has seen more than100,000 social homes lostsince 2015, four in 10 of which are now rented out for profit in the private market.This loss of social homes is also directly contributing to astronomical increases in temporary accommodation costs – a staggering89% over the past decade. In 2023-2024 alone, councils in Englandspent £2.3bn on temporary accommodation. In some regions, such as Yorkshire and Humber, councils are payingabout three timesthe rate of private rent on temporary accommodation.Hard-hit councils are trying entrepreneurial fixes to housing shortages, looking for homes far outside their areas. Last week, the London borough of Enfield beganlooking for homes around Liverpool. Simultaneously, from 2021 to 2026, councils willhave paid £70bnin subsidy to landlords through local housing allowance.Call it Thatcher’s timebomb: the great council housing selloff, a crisis hidden in plain sight | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreThe real solution is providing council housing that protects individuals’ right to shelter and brings in revenue to fund public services. While Labour’s stated aim is to prioritise growth, its inaction means that public and private money is being haemorrhaged on housing costs. If households were not being forced to spend almost half of their incomes on housing, they would have disposable income to spend locally. Shelter has recently shown that investment in 90,000 social homes could bring£51bn into the economyover 30 years.But so far, the government’s interventions seem to primarily serve the interests of developer-landlords. These perpetual winners continue to reap the financial rewards of building new homes, while wriggling out ofsection 106affordable housing commitments, too often on the grounds of depleted profit margins. Asresearchfrom the University of Sheffield shows, in Manchester between 2012 and 2020 only 151 affordable homes were built – quite a slump from themandatory20% affordable housing target of 4,583 homes. This is theextractive development modelin practice.The new planning and infrastructure bill is set to bolster this system, through a focus on “cutting the red tape” to build faster and bigger. Bulldozing the planning system is being celebrated by the developers and the building sector, a tell-tale sign of whois set to winfrom these changes. It is no coincidence that the build-to-let firms have, in 2025, become the UK’slargest single type of business, increasing more than fourfold from 2016. The developer-led model will never prioritise social and genuinely affordable housing.With Labour’s current plans, renters will not see their lives improve. Instead, they need the government to shift its focus and take seriously the opportunity that social housing offers – for people’s lives and the economy – complemented by mechanisms to deal with unfettered rent increases. Unless this government takes action on social housing, anyone who rents privately in this country might soon be facing the same crisis as Amelia.*This name has been changedAbi O’Connor is an urban sociologist who researches the political economy of housing, land and regional inequality at the New Economics Foundation and the University of LiverpoolExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionPlanning policyRenting propertyHousingPropertyLabourAngela RaynercommentShareReuse this content"

But the fundamental issue is that 18high-ranking individualswere happy discussing extremely sensitive material on a private messaging app, highlighting the administration’s extraordinary amateurishness, recklessness and unaccountability.The visceral hostility to Europe spelt out again by the vice-president, JD Vance, was glaring. So was the indifference to the potential civilian cost of the strikeson Houthi targets in Yemen, designed to curb attacks on Red Sea shipping. The Houthi-run health ministry said that 53 people including five children and two women were killed. The response by the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, to the attacks was to post emojis: a fist, an American flag and fire. The lack of contrition for this security breach is also telling. Individually and together, these are far more than a “glitch”, in Donald Trump’s words. They are features of his administration.Mr Waltz appears to have organised the Signal chat andinadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg,editor in chief of the Atlantic. The magazine says that the secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, posted details of the timing and sequencing of attacks, specific targets and weapons systems used, though the administration denies that classified information was shared. Other members included Mr Vance; the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard; the CIA director, John Ratcliffe; Steve Witkoff, special envoy to the Middle East; and “MAR”, the initials of the secretary of state, Marco Rubio.These conversations would normally take place under conditions of high security. While Signal is encrypted, devices could be compromised. Foreign intelligence agencieswill be delighted. Legal experts say using Signal may have breached the Espionage Act.The hypocrisy is glaring. Mr Trump’s first presidential campaign – and several members of this Signal group – lambasted Hillary Clinton for using a private email server to receive official messages that included some classified information of a far less sensitive nature, and for the autodeletion of messages. These Signal messages too were set to disappear, though federal records laws mandate the preservation of such data.In many regards, this leak hammers home what US allies already knew, including this administration’scontempt for Europe, which the chat suggests will be expected to pay for the US attacks. The vice-president characterised an operation carried out to safeguard maritime trade and contain Iran as “bailing Europe out again”. Mr Hegseth responded that he “fully share[d] your loathing of European free-loading”. Concerns about information security are familiar territory too. In his first term, the president reportedlyshared highly classified informationfrom an ally with Russia’s foreign minister, and after leaving office hefaced dozens of chargesover the alleged mishandling of classified material, before a judge he had appointedthrew out the case against him.The UK and others cannot simply walk away when they are so heavily dependent on and intermeshed with US intelligence capabilities. Their task now is to manage risk and prepare for worse to come. It may be that this breach is not chiefly distinguished by its severity, but by the fact that we have learned about it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But concerns backed up by evidence should be addressedTue 25 Mar 2025 14.40 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 14.51 EDTShareNew research showing thatboys in English schoolsoutperformed girls in maths and science tests offers a corrective to a narrative emphasising the extent to which boys have fallen behind in their learning. The analysis, from the UCL Institute of Education, found that the gender gap in England was the widest in any of the 72 countries where it was measured. Boys in year 9 (age 13-14) overturned a lead by girls in 2019, outperforming them in science tests for theTrends in International Mathematics and Science Study. One of the authors, Dr Jennie Golding, pointed to boys’ greater confidence in maths as a possible explanation.Recent challenges to the idea that girls are in the ascendant have tended to be based on a longer view and a wider range of information. Men, after all, still earn more than women. Earlier this month, a Women in Work index pointed to the“sluggish” pace of changeon the gender pay gap, with the UK slipping behind other countries. Pay and progression in many female-dominated sectors, including early years and social care, remains poor.While the earnings of younger women may have matched or evenovertakenthose of male peers, the “motherhood penalty”, which sees women’s incomes shrink more than men’s when they become parents,is worsening. Analysis last year showed that mothers earned on average 24% less an hour than fathers in 2023. The pensions gap also places women at asignificantdisadvantage, making them more likely to experience poverty in old age.Gender is not the greatest determinant of academic success. In relation to school test results across the age range, the biggest attainment gaps are not between the sexes but between socioeconomically advantaged anddisadvantaged groups– particularly those with special educational needs and disabilities, and those from some ethnic groups. Some experts believe thatsmaller differencesbetween the results of boys and girls can function as a distraction.But it ought to be possible to find a balance between overemphasisingconcernsabout boys’ declining academic performance and participation, and dismissing them as scaremongering. Boys are more than twice as likely to be excluded from school as girls. In 2022-23, three UK women enrolled at university for every two men (with 1.28 million female and 880,000 male students). This is a huge disparity in outcomes from schooling, and while it is true that, based on current data, any female advantage looks likely to be reversed in adulthood, the future is unpredictable.Female students now outnumber male ones in medicine and law as well as arts subjects – while the reverse is true in physics, maths, engineering and computing.Persistent stereotypingis one explanation, a view supported by research into parental attitudes andgirls’ lack of confidencein these areas. More research is needed, but given the importance of the male-dominated digital technology sector in all our lives, and rising concerns aboutonline harms, it makes sense to advocate strongly for girls’ access and opportunities to relevant qualifications.Simultaneously, evidence thatfewer boys are school-readyaged four, as well as their lower levels of participation in higher education – which some experts think is linked totuition feesand differing attitudes to debt – must also be taken seriously. The contrasting as well as shared difficulties of boys and girls are worthy of attention.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They just need mentorsReaders on Gareth Southgate’s Richard Dimbleby lecture, the Netflix show Adolescence and modern masculinityTue 25 Mar 2025 13.47 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 13.50 EDTShareAs Sir Gareth Southgate has pointed out, boys today are let down by the empty promises of grifting influencers who sell them a vision of masculinity grounded in dominance, materialism and disdain for women (Editorial, 19 March). However, if we are to pull boys away from these figures, we need something meaningful to offer them instead.Often, boys end up susceptible to those voices because they are hurting. Like Jamie in the Netflix dramaAdolescence, they are profoundly lonely, disconnected from their peers and families, searching for a place where they belong. Having delivered more than 5,000 workshops in secondary schools across England, we have heard gen Z boys express deeply felt worry about how they look and how their peers perceive them.Heterosexual boys are profoundly anxious about “what girls want”, relying on sexist “rules” about what women like – rules that often have their roots in the misogynistic manosphere. Boys roll their eyes at girls who effusively big up their friends, but when we ask them how they support one another, there is an uncomfortable silence. Too often, they are told that it’s shameful for men to care for each other.Boys need support to develop emotional literacy, media literacy and skills for healthy relationships – and that takes time, trust and expertise. Adults, including teachers, parents and carers, need help to know how to support boys.Boys aren’t a ticking timebomb or a lost cause. They are children, growing up into men, who need and deserve our guidance.Jamie BaleSchools team coordinator, Beyond EqualityHolly GreenHead of quality, learning and impact, Beyond EqualityI watched Sir Gareth Southgate’s Richard Dimbleby lecture with mounting relief and respect. At last a “real man” was telling us what we have needed to hear for decades – that success is not just about wealth and domination over others. It is about learning inner strength and resourcefulness. It is about feeling safe enough to be kind. It is about giving respect rather than demanding it. It is about being the best “you” that you can be.Boys need a father figure, not necessarily a father. A father figure is someone who you can respect and who respects you, someone who doesn’t preach or impose but who listens, who demonstrates and lives the right values.But in the absence of someone like that, boys will turn to someone who will give them a sense of security, however bogus. They are naturally frightened of what is happening inside them and around them. That need to feel a sense of security is paramount. Listening is vital. As the US author Stephen Covey once wrote: “Seek first to understand, then to be understood.”Christopher HouseHertfordCredit to Sir Gareth Southgate for highlighting the lack of mentors for young men today. The news that a group ofLabour MPs are seeking to tackle the problem of toxic influencersis also welcome. As well as government support, we need to restore the practice of boys being guided into manhood by trusted men in their own community.Generations of men have now been without this. Organisations such asThe ManKind ProjectandAbandofbrothersdo amazing work that affirm positive masculinity. We need men of all ages everywhere to get involved so that we can learn how to be the elders that our boys so desperately need.Simon BubbLondonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

As a group of cross-party politicians from the UK – the birthplace of Nutrition for Growth in 2013 – and the summit’s current host, France, we believe that the fight against malnutrition is an issue on which every policymaker should unite.As official development assistance budgets diminish, it becomes increasingly essential for governments to invest funds strategically. Given that investments in nutrition are low-cost and high-impact, they should be prioritised and elevated on the international development agenda. We urge our governments – and other governments around the world – to make strong pledges on nutrition at the summit to save lives, reduce inequality and enhance global security.The case for action is compelling. Good nutrition is foundational to human development. Yet today, three billion people cannot afford a healthy diet, and malnutrition remains the leading cause of death among children under five.Malnutrition in childhood has devastating and generational impacts. Deprived of nutrients at the start of life, hundreds of millions of survivors are physically and mentally impaired, harming their learning and lifelong earning potential, as well as undermining economic development and destabilising societies. This destabilising effect holds huge geopolitical significance, with consequences that extend beyond borders.However, malnutrition is preventable and treatable.Nutritionfor Growth presents a prime international opportunity to disrupt its insidious cycle. Commitments from the UK, France and governments around the world can change the trajectory and improve the lives of millions of people, especially women and children. This summit is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.Éléonore CaroitRenaissancepartyMP, FranceDavid MundellConservative MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale; co-chair, all party parliamentary group on nutrition for developmentSteve RaceLabour MP for Exeter; co-chair, all party parliamentary group on nutrition for developmentDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

He has looked to hit the ground running, just as he did when he won the Champions League four months after joining Chelsea, but building rhythm in international football is not easy. The players are not around for long and some games drift into irrelevance. Tuchel has started with two straightforward wins butneither set the pulse racing. The awkward reality is that qualification lacks jeopardy these days.Thomas Tuchel admits he took off Jude Bellingham as he was a red card ‘risk’Read moreEngland were under no threat of losingagainst AlbaniaandLatvia, so all eyes were on the quality of their performances. Tuchel, having delivered a searing critique of the team’s displays under Gareth Southgate at Euro 2024, was after identity, intensity and excitement. He has talked about imposing an aggressive Premier League style. The issue is that doing so is challenging against opponents who arrive at Wembley focused on damage limitation. It was pass, pass, pass from England but both games were pretty turgid. Tuchel will see room for improvement. He must consider, too, whether gung-ho football is possible against good opponents, particularly in the heat of an American summer. He could do with the Football Association organising some tough friendlies before the World Cup.Bellinghamcould define England’s World CupThe sense that it was too easy against Latvia, who are 140th in the Fifa rankings, was heightened by Jude Bellingham producing an unfocused display. He played with desire but wanted too much time on the ball.Tuchel wants him to be more tactically and mentally disciplined. He will not have liked Bellingham earning a booking for a foul moments after sloppily losing possession. Bellingham still needs to direct all that energy into more positive areas. He was hugely fortunate not to receive a second booking for a rash tackle in the second half. Would he enjoy such leniency in a tournament game? Unlikely. England need Bellingham to be more mature. He has to be more efficient and less impetuous. England need the Bellingham who carved Albania open with a superb assist for Myles Lewis-Skelly. That player can drive a team to glory. The petulant version could drag them down.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi, one of England’s best players at the Euros, was dropped against Albania.Photograph: Dave Shopland/ShutterstockUps and downs in defenceTuchel has food for thought at full‑back. There was a debut goal from Lewis-Skelly and plenty of evidence that the 18-year-old is an asset at left-back. There was also Reece James making his first start forEnglandsince September 2022, scoring his first international goal. He is back from injury and Tuchel, unlike Enzo Maresca, regards the Chelsea captain as a right-back rather than a midfielder. The question is whether James possesses the physicality of old. A lovely free-kick against Latvia underlined the brilliance of his right foot but there were some rusty moments in defence.Ultimately the back four is far from set. Dan Burn, the Newcastle centre-back, did not convince against Albania and Tuchel does not seem sure on Marc Guéhi. He dropped Guéhi against Albania and the Crystal Palace defender, one of England’s best players at the Euros, was involved in an early mix-up with Jordan Pickford against Latvia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were up against deep defences, limiting their space to go round the back. Even so Tuchel wanted more. He felt that Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford did not make a big enough impact against Albania and there was a quiet display from Jarrod Bowen against Latvia. Morgan Rogers did well but Bukayo Saka was missed on the right. Eberechi Eze had a good cameo against Latvia, scoring his first goal, but the sense is that some of the biggest winners were those who were not selected or not available. Noni Madueke will have a chance of a recall once he returns from a hamstring injury and Tuchel has given Jack Grealish hope of a recall. Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri, who has been with the under‑21s, will also have a chance if he maintains his rise.England 3-0 Latvia: player ratings for the hosts from the World Cup qualifierRead moreGet Wharton in next timeIt must be pointed out that the wingers need help from their teammates. Tuchel was frustrated that the ball often did not reach Foden and Rashford quickly enough. England have to raise the tempo. It comes back to the state of their midfield. They still lack a player who can link defence and attack; a player capable of fizzing risky early passes into the forwards. Adam Wharton is worth a look next time. The Crystal Palace midfielder does not have a high pass completion rate but that suggests he is trying to make things happen. England should have a proper look at him. The fact that Tuchel is getting his full-backs to invert suggests that England are again having to adjust to their lack of control in midfield. They need a specialist. Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson is also pushing.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelJude BellinghamWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld Cup 2026World CupanalysisShareReuse this content"

Probably shock. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions. It was a game we were more in control of than I thought we’d be. I really liked us. We were really good. We didn’t deserve to lose.”North Macedonia v Wales: World Cup 2026 qualifier – liveRead moreGiven thatNorth Macedoniahad won their six previous games without conceding a goal and Wales were unbeaten in seven matches under Bellamy, something had to give. When Bojan Miovski scored a fine 91st-minute goal the visitors looked set to lose a qualifier they really should have won and the relief at the final whistle prompted untrammelled Welsh celebrations.The night had begun on a much more sombre note. For the first time since taking charge, Bellamy wore a suit. It was a mark of respect to the 59 people whodied in a nightclub firein the North Macedonian town of Kocani, a tragedy remembered by an impeccably observed minute’s silence before kick-off.Blagoja Milevski’s decision to switch his formation to a back five seemed sensible as Wales enjoyed prolonged periods of fast-paced possession on a slick surface as they dominated an initial 90 minutes low on clearcut chances.There were moments when Bellamy could have done with turning back time and joining his attack. But, obdurate as the home defence proved, that rearguard almost cracked when Sorba Thomas could not quite make the most of a fine cross from the Leeds winger Dan James.View image in fullscreenSorba Thomas cannot quite direct his shot on target for Wales.Photograph: Georgi Licovski/EPAIn an intriguing subplot featuring Elland Road regulars past and ­present, James sporadically ­tormented Ezgjan Alioski, North Macedonia’s former Leeds left wing-back. Alioski plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Ahli these days but he could conceivably have beaten Karl Darlow – currently the second-choice goalkeeper at Elland Road – had his audaciously ambitious first-half volley been a ­little better weighted.With North Macedonia increasingly double marking James, Bellamy’s creative players struggled to turn territorial domination into material advantage.The moment when Brennan Johnson’s quick feet and faster brain conjured a fine chance Nathan Broadhead could only send swerving over the crossbar appeared emblematic of his manager’s technical area frustration.Yet if the more pessimistic among the 2,000 Wales fans who had travelled to one of Europe’s most interesting, least generic capitals feared their team could come undone against skilled counterattacking opponents, such anxieties were assuaged by a commanding central defensive performance on the part of Joe Rodon and his sidekick, Chris Mepham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It almost brought swift reward when Alioski shot narrowly wide.Then Joe Allen lost concentration and permitted Miovski to intercept a tired pass backwards intended for Rodon.Little did Miovski know that Kieffer Moore’s headed flick and Brooks’ instinctive connection would shortly combine to remind everyone that Bellamy’s Wales do not know the meaning of surrender.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersNorth MacedoniaWalesmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In a sport as prohibitively expensive as elite tennis, her family wealth – her billionaire parents own several sports franchises, including the NFL’s Buffalo Bills – afforded her unfettered access to equipment and knowledge. Her career, however, has come to signify something else altogether.At the age of 22, Pegula was still fluttering in and out of the top 150, stuck on the lower rungs of the ITF circuit and simply trying to figure things out. Pegula did not break into the top 100 until a couple of weeks before her 25th birthday in February 2019 and even then it seemed as if she was light years away from ever becoming a top player. She failed countless times before she began to soar.Tim Henman: ‘I told Andy Murray to take his time … the next week he was coaching Djokovic’Read moreToday, Pegula has established herself as a veteran top 10 player and one of the most reliable members of the sport’s elite. Her success was not the result of a dramatic overnight shift – she built her confidence and convictions through her daily work and resilience over a significant period of time.On Wednesday in Miami, Pegula will faceEmma Raducanuin what is now undoubtedly the best tournament of Raducanu’s career outside her fateful US Open title run in 2021. After defeating one top-10 American player in Emma Navarro, Raducanu now has the opportunity to measure herself against one of the best in the world in her first WTA 1000 quarter-final.Although she remains a clear underdog, the Briton should not be afraid. Their two previous matches have both been tight. Pegula won their first and only hard-court meetingin two tough setsat the Cincinnati Open in 2022, but last summer Raducanudefeated Pegula in three gruelling setson home soil in Eastbourne to finally clinch her first top‑10 win.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu chats with her support team in Miami, trainer Yutaka Nakamura (left) and temporary coaches Mark Petchey and Jane O’Donoghue.Photograph: SMG/ShutterstockThe pair share some similarities. Both possess smooth, compact strokes off each wing, effortless two-handed backhands and excellent timing, which they use to take the ball early and take time away from their opponent. Both relish smothering rivals with vicious early service returns. Only one of them, however, has come close to directing those assets into consistent winning tennis over a long period.Pegula particularly thrives in fast conditions and few players are as adept at deflecting the power generated by her foes. One of the biggest ­challenges for Raducanu will be to find the right balance between imposing herself by ­playing ­offensive tennis and also keeping Pegula uncomfortable by mixing up the speed and trajectory of her ball.The 22-year-old has done a great job this week of frustrating opponents with her backhand slice and defence, but Pegula is a level above them all.Alongside improvements to her serve, forehand and movement, Raducanu’s three months of work with her new fitness coach, Yutaka Nakamura, the one person who has accompanied her throughout the year, appear to be paying off. She looks like a considerably stronger and more durable athlete.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For so long, Raducanu was always the player breaking down on the court. She now looks physically prepared for all possibilities and she recovered well from a gruelling,attritional second-round win over Navarro. Against those struggling opponents, she made her own luck by refusing to allow them back into the matches.As she faces off against Pegula, there are also lessons that Raducanu, at 22 years old, can learn from her. Successful tennis careers are a marathon and each is completely different. Some players fulfil their potential at a young age but others must reckon with a far longer journey.While the past three and a half years have at times been brutal for Raducanu, mere match wins often hard to come by, players who work hard each day will always have opportunities to turn their fortunes around. With that in mind, it is notable that Raducanu has competed more frequently this year than ever before. Even as she struggled through numerous bitter losses in recent months, to her credit she kept on ­rolling with the punches and showing up. This week at least, she is finally landing some of her own.On TuesdayNovak Djokovic– a six-time tournament winner in Miami – stormed into the men’s quarter-finals after thrashing Italy’s 15th seed Lorenzo Musetti 6-2, 6-2 on a rain-affected day of play.

That Madrid are Liverpool’s nemesis in terms of European Cup/Champions League wins and, in recent years, two finals of that same competition, will hardly sweeten the pill, either.If Steven Gerrard resisted such temptations, feted forebears and contemporaries were tempted and succumbed. The aristocratic hubris of Madrid has regularly robbedLiverpoolof its prime talents. Not just those loved and lost. Jude Bellingham might be two years into his Anfield career by now, such a plan mooted in Liverpool’s front office, only for him to opt for the Bernabéu.Real Madrid close to deal to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold on a free transferRead moreAlexander-Arnold’s move is most regularly compared with Steve McManaman’s departure on a Bosman free transfer in 1999. Within Liverpool’s depressed late-90s period, “Macca” had remained a shining light only to turn down a fresh contract. McManaman was accused of treachery during his closing months in Liverpool red. That a lack of a transfer fee left Liverpool financially short was the common complaint, one shared with Alexander-Arnold, though the parameters are now rather different.The right-back will very likely be departing England’s champions, having won a previous Premier League title and the Champions League in 2019; whereas McManaman could look only to 1992’s FA Cup, won as a youngster, and the 1995 League Cup, where he had been the match-winner. Liverpool in the summer of 1999, after a half-season under Gérard Houllier, were rebuilding but miles behind Manchester United and Arsenal. Madrid, meanwhile, were adding McManaman on £65,000 a week, big money then even for a team of European champions during a period when their rivalry with Barcelona had become a matter of global rather than national significance.The common view isEl Maccawas an unqualified success, not least because of the goal against Valencia in Paris that helped clinch the2000 Champions League final. Liverpool’s soloist had been converted into Madrid’s ball carrier, leaving the pyrotechnics to more skilful types. It was not quite that simple. The summer of 2000, when Madrid snaffled Barcelona’s Luís Figo, paying a world-record fee, proved a difficult crossroads. Doing that deal helped along Florentino Pérez’s accession to the club presidency.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold has won it all at Liverpool.Photograph: Franco Arland/Getty ImagesParis’s hero was sidelined, an early victim of Pérez’s continuing ruthlessness, the hope being a sale back to England. Lazio were also linked, only for McManaman’s reinvention as a luxury water carrier for Figo – and soon after Zinedine Zidane – to extend his stay until 2003, collecting another Champions League title, when not coincidentally David Beckham arrived to end up playing a similar role.“Liverpool was great, but it’s not as though I left when I was really young,” McManamantold the Observerin 2001. “I came here when I was 27, after more than 10 years at the club. Liverpool is a tiny city compared to Madrid.” Alexander-Arnold will be 27 in October.McManaman, who eventually developed a decent grasp of Spanish, made the most of Madrid. Michael Owen followed that same route in 2004, just as vilified for running his contract down by Liverpool fans, as Pérez snared him for £8m. The 25-year-old, less worldly than McManaman, struggled to assimilate himself and his young family while living in a hotel. Owen has admitted driving every day to the airport to buy English newspapers at a time before new media could take the strain of his thirst for news from the racetracks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Rafa Benítez demurred, an ill-fated move to Newcastle was set in train. Owen later revealed an annual hotline to Jamie Carragher: “‘Does Rafa want me?’ I’d say. ‘Does Kenny want me? Does Brendan want me?’ It was circumstances that stopped it happening … by the end I wasn’t the player I had been before and they simply didn’t fancy me. I wasn’t good enough.”If losing two locals was painful, Xabi Alonso’s departure in 2009 was another to make Reds fans wince. “We’ve got the best midfield in the world,” rang the Anfield chant, celebrating the triumvirate the Basque signing from Real Sociedad formed with Gerrard and Javier Mascherano. Alonso’s departure, for a fee of £30m, was not a case of Liverpool being sold short, though it was another Pérez pincer move made in the knowledge that the club needed to sell, the American ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett’s finances beginning to creak.Álvaro Arbeloa also headed to Madrid in 2009, for £5m, where the one-time full-back now works as an acclaimed youth coach, but Alonso’s loss was an exposure of damaging fissures at Liverpool. Benítez’s pursuit of Gareth Barry the previous year had led to Alonso becoming unsettled. “Another season would have been too much for me,” he said in 2011.Playing his best campaign in 2008-09 for Liverpool as they went close to a Premier League title left fans wanting more. Alonso becoming a key foundation of Madrid’s next, dominant era was little consolation. Like McManaman, like Owen, like Alexander-Arnold now, the pull of Madrid was too great for the player – and Liverpool – to resist.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolReal MadridTrent Alexander-ArnoldfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When his sons, Jakob, Filip and Henrik, stormed to Olympic, world and European titles, the reality television cameras were there to capture many of the steps, squabbles and medals along the way. Little wonder that Team Ingebrigtsen became the most popular TV show in Norwegian history.But on Tuesday a courtroom in Sandnes, in the south-west of the country, heard that the reality inside the family home was far bleaker, with harrowing stories of violence, threats and manipulative behaviour from Gjert towards Jakob, the double Olympic champion, and his younger sister, Ingrid.Over four hours of testimony, Jakob detailed how he had been punched and kicked by his father when he was at primary school and been threatened with being beaten to death, and outlined multiple other incidents which he said had left him emotionally damaged.Jakob told the court that he and his brothers had finally decided that enough was enough in 2022, when Ingrid was hit in the face with a wet towel, leaving a red mark, because she did not want to go for a run. It was at that point they split from their father and coach and told their story to the Norwegian newspaper VG.Gjert, who faces up to six years in prison if convicted, has denied any allegation of violence.Such was the interest in the trial that the live blog of Ingebrigtsen’s testimony was followed by nearly 200,000 people on VG. The Norwegian superstar, who holds four world records and the Tokyo 2020 1500m and Paris 2024 5,000m gold medals, was calm as he outlined the allegations against his father – whom he referred to throughout as “the defendant”. They included being punched when he was as young as seven or eight after Jakob’s school phoned the family home asking to speak to his mother, who was at work. Jakob told the court that his father had asked him why they had called, and when he told him he didn’t know he was punched in the head “many times”.“I’m just standing in the kitchen and looking down at the ground,” he added. “The defendant is standing over me and screaming at me that I’m a liar and I’m lying for what feels like a very long time, before he starts hitting me in the head … I try to protect myself from violence, before he takes my hands and puts them down on my side, before he starts to continue hitting me in the head.“I don’t know exactly how many times I was hit, but when I stand there it feels like a very long time. Somewhere between 10 and 20 times, where I try to just protect myself.”In another incident, which allegedly occurred when Jakob was eight or nine, he said that he had been playing in the street on a scooter when his father jumped on him and kicked him in the stomach. “I remember trying to get up, and lying on all fours, before I get a kick in the stomach which I remember was a strange experience,” he said.In middle school, Jakob said his father had threatened to “shame him and beat him to death, or something similar” when he was sitting with several of his family members in a car together.Jakob told the court he and his brothers had finally decided to go public with their father’s behaviour and to sack him as their coach after he saw a photograph of his sister with the mark. Jakob said the photo, which was shown to the court on Monday, was just one of “many episodes she has been in”.“She is a young, small girl who is in a physical confrontation with a grown, large man,” he said. “I have been in that myself, but I am not her and can only imagine how traumatic that and those experiences have been for her. It was about her wanting to stop running and training. She wasn’t allowed to do that.”Jakob said his father had tried to stop the relationship with his now-wife, Elisabeth, after they had met when they were 16 and had reacted angrily when they wanted to move in together when they were 18. “In that context, we were called terrorists by the defendant”.The court also shown a 24-minute video of Gjert aggressively arguing with Jakob when he had asked to use the PlayStation after training when he was 19.His father’s alleged behaviour had affected Jakob’s ability to show and feel emotions, he told the court. “If I was happy or did something nice, it could be used against me if I was a little tired at training the next day,” he said. “I was very conscious about showing emotions. I ended up not doing it. I have a hard time letting people in and I have a hard time trusting people.”Asked why he had stopped calling his father “Dad” when he was about 11, Jakob said: “I no longer saw this person as a father. I thought that the things he says, the things he does and has done, are not worthy of a father.“You have become a father yourself, what would you expect from the father you no longer call Dad? What is missing?” asked Larsen.“Empathy, caring,” Jakob responded.The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsNorwayEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That tournament determines qualification for the World Cup and Olympic Games.“Players want to play for their country, they want to represent the women of Afghanistan and they want to be a voice for those who are on a voiceless journey,” the national team player Mursal Sadat said. “The Taliban took that platform from us. Not only us: it’s worth mentioning that it’s the fourth educational year that women are not allowed to go to school. How can we expect the Taliban to negotiate about sports if they’re not even allowing education for women? They would never negotiate. They are traumatised by women, they don’t like women, they are afraid of women’s rights and women’s voices and what they can do.“Unfortunately, Fifa’s inaction took our platform away from us for four years. We sacrificed four years, youthful years, four years that we could have represented, four years that we could have advocated, four years in which we could have pushed the world towards bigger change for women of Afghanistan. We watched the 2023 Women’s World Cup from the sidelines. Yet, in two days we have another draw for the Asian Cup qualifiers and we’re still not allowed to play.”Khalida Popal, a founder of the Afghanistan women’s national teamand the first woman to work for the Afghanistan Football Federation, said: “Fifa’s letter is a positive step towards collaborative action and recognising the sacrifice of Afghan women and Afghan women football players. Today more than ever, we want the leadership from governing bodies of sport. Afghanistan should be a case study and used to show how the governing bodies of sport have to create systems so women don’t lose opportunities.”View image in fullscreenMelbourne Victory Afghan women’s team captain, Fatima Yousufi (left), Malala Yousafzai and Khalida Popal, director of the Afghan women’s team.Photograph: Kelly Defina/Getty ImagesThe SRA and others, such as Popal, Malala Yousafzai and Human Rights Watch, have consistently called for Fifa to recognise the exiled team.

Under Fifa rules the organisation of an Afghanistan women’s team has been the responsibility of the Taliban-controlled AFF.Fifa said in its letter that it was “committed to developing practical and sustainable measures that promote access to football for all Afghan women and girls to the greatest extent possible” and that it had developed a strategy and implementation plan to ensure opportunities exist for Afghan women inside and outside the country.It also said it wanted to focus on activities to promote the wellbeing of women and girls in Afghanistan and to take part in diplomatic dialogue with organisations and governments inside and outside the country to “explore ways to reduce the exclusion from sport of women and girls in Afghanistan over time”. Fifa pointed out that it had played a role in helping women’s footballers, associated staff and their families to get out of Afghanistan.Andrea Florence, the SRA’s executive director, said: “Afghan women footballers’ ability to play internationally depends entirely on intervention from Fifa. Fifa’s letter in response to our report laid out their strategy to support Afghan women. It is great to hear that Fifa is working to promote playing opportunities for the players, but we remain hopeful that they will decide to officially recognise the team and allocate financial support as it does to other member associations.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Alongside him have worked the head of women’s football, Paul Green, and, until last summer, Emma Hayes, who spent 12 years as Chelsea’s head coach before taking charge of the USA women’s team.Jacob has said farewell to Chelsea in a LinkedIn post, writing: “The last 11 years have provided some of the most incredible experiences and memories of my life.

In relation to the meeting, the spokesperson said: “Kemi Badenoch has been raising concerns about net zero 2050 since 2019. Families and businesses in Britain are suffering with the most expensive energy bills in Europe. It is not responsible for politicians to simply ignore the huge costs of Ed Miliband’s green zealotry.”Record is chair of Net Zero Watch, a lobby group that argues policies to deal with the climate emergency are too expensive. He isknown to have fundedthe Global Warming Policy Foundation, another climate sceptic group.He has written frequently for the Telegraph about hisscepticism about action on net zero. Record has been approached for comment through the Net Zero Watch campaign.According to the MPs’ register of interests, Badenoch estimated the costs of the “residential” with her family at £14,350 for six days, while Julia Lopez, her parliamentary private secretary, and Alex Burghart, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, each declared the same value of £14,350 for a three-day stay.In Badenoch’s declaration, she said: “Provision of workspace, accommodation and associated hospitality for a series of work meetings in Gloucestershire over six days with colleagues and others who attended different sessions during various times of the week. My family attended as it was half-term week so we could spend time together outside the formal meeting part of the residential.”It is understood that most of the shadow cabinet were not invited to the residential event, with Conservative MPs underlining a resentment that is beginning to grow about the tight circle around Badenoch. Others aides known as part of her “Quad” include Lee Rowley, a former MP and chief of staff; Rachel Maclean, a Conservative peer and her director of strategy; and Henry Newman, her deputy chief of staff.The disclosure comes amid a fresh row about politicians taking freebies, with Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, defending her decision to take£600 of tickets to a Sabrina Carpenter concert.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will have little meaning if multibillion-dollar corporations can sue peaceful protesters out of existence for their speech. Yet, that’s exactly what was decided in a small courtroom in Morton county, North Dakota.Energy Transfer – a Dallas-based fossil fuel company that is responsible for the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) – sued two Greenpeace entities in the US (Greenpeace Inc and Greenpeace Fund), and Greenpeace International. Energy Transfer was awarded more than $660m in a highly watched, month-long case. Greenpeace will appeal the verdict.The company sued Greenpeace entities simply for peacefully supporting the Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access pipeline back in 2016-2017. At issue in the North Dakota case are nine statements made by Greenpeace that are alleged to be defamatory.All of the statements at issue are legitimate expressions under the first amendment, and none of the statements in question were original to Greenpeace.Energy Transfer also claims that Greenpeace made alleged false statements to financial institutions involved with financing the Dakota Access pipeline – and that based on those statements, the financial institutions took action that cost Energy Transfer hundreds of millions of dollars. The financial institutions, however, had their own commitments and conducted their own due diligence regarding the Dakota Access pipeline.An initial lawsuit was filed in 2017 in federal court but it was dismissed in 2019. Energy Transfer immediately refiled a virtually identical suit in state court in North Dakota, a conservative state with strong ties to the energy sector. It is a jurisdiction where public sentiment ran against the DAPL protests – which were organized by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Indigenous water protectors.The ruling in the Energy Transfer case could have wide ranging consequences on first amendment rights in the US. By attempting to hold Greenpeace liable for everything that happened at Standing Rock, the case attempts to establish the idea that, for any participation in a protest, you can be held liable for the actions of other people, even if you’re not associated with them or if they’re never identified. It’s easy to see how this win for Energy Transfer could chill speech and silence future protests before they even begin.Greenpeace USA was one of many organizations that supported the Indigenous-led resistance. Answering a request for trainings in de-escalation and non-violence, Greenpeace USA supported a delegation from the Indigenous Peoples Power Project (IP3) to travel to Standing Rock and run non-violence trainings. In no way did Greenpeace direct the Standing Rock protest movement, or engage in (or encourage others to engage in) property destruction or violence.The legal tactic being used against the Greenpeace movement is a classic example of what’s known as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (Slapp). Slapps are frequently used by wealthy people and corporations – in this case, the oil and gas industry – to silence constitutionally protected free speech.Rather than a good faith attempt to seek remedies for harm, the goal of these lawsuits is often to bury the defendant in legal fees and waste their time on frivolous litigation. When used to silence criticism – including from whistleblowers, journalists and environmental advocacy organizations like Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International – they essentially function as a tax on free speech by making it too expensive to speak truth to power. These abusive legal tactics can be used to sue critics into bankruptcy, and they serve as a threat to anyone who may want to speak up in the future.Although 34 states and the District of Columbia have passed anti-Slapp laws, North Dakota is not one of them. And, while support for federal anti-Slapp legislation is growing in the US, there is currently no federal law on the books. That means that corporations can continue threatening abusive lawsuits in federal court or in states without protections. Without any provisions protecting public protest, corporate operations that harm the social good can proceed without restraint.Perhaps equally worrisome, this case is an attack on the type of ordinary advocacy that organizations like Greenpeace and the ACLU – alongside many others – rely on to do their work. Everyday actions like attending a protest, signing a letter of support, or supporting communities at risk should never be considered “unlawful”. Otherwise, the future of everyone’s first amendment rights could be at risk.If corporations can weaponize the court system to attack protesters and advocates for their speech, then any political speech or cause could become a target. And in an environment where theTrump administrationis regularly leading dangerous attacks against our basic rights and liberties, including against the press and activists, this threat is all the more serious.The right to protest and speak out must be embraced as a core pillar in a functioning democracy – even when that speech threatens the rich and powerful, and even when it’s speech we don’t agree with.Sushma Raman is the interim executive director of Greenpeace USAAnthony Romero is executive director of the American Civil Liberties UnionExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionProtestTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Those abstaining on principle included Marie Rimmer and Rachael Maskell.China dominates the solar energy market and between 35% and 40% of polysilicon, the key raw material for solar panels, is produced in Xinjiang where the Muslim Uyghur population has been subject to arbitrarydetentionandforced labour.Michael Shanks, the energy security minister, said the government would strengthen its efforts to tackle forced labour including by convening cross-Whitehall meetings involving the business department, Foreign Office and Home Office.He announced that “a senior individual” in GB Energy would be appointed specifically to lead on ethical supply chains including modern slavery, and that the company’s strategic priorities would include working proactively to tackle it.Government sources argued that the GB Energy bill was the wrong vehicle for this change because tackling modern energy required a cross-government effort across multiple sectors of the economy.Shanks told the Commons on Tuesday this was a “question right across the economy, rather than dealing with this on a company-by-company basis”. He also argued that there are existing provisions in the Procurement Act that would allow GB Energy to reject bids and terminate contracts which are known to use forced labour.Critics, including the former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith, said that the Procurement Act only applies where a company has been convicted of modern slavery in the UK or faced equivalent action abroad, and that the Chinese government would not take action against Chinese companies.A handful of Labour MPs called for stronger measures. Sarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, told the Commons that “the public deserves a guarantee that their money won’t be used to fund human rights abuses”.Rimmer, the Labour MP for St Helens South and Whiston, said that “the Modern Slavery Act doesn’t work on this and the Procurement Act doesn’t work”, while Maskell, Labour MP for York Central, said ministers should “switch the burden of proof” so that companies are required to demonstrate they have no association with forced labour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am no hawk and believe we should keep up diplomatic exchanges on trade and climate change and ways of collaborating to end wars but we cannot continue to purchase solar panels which are the product of slave Labour.“If China says this is not true let us come and visit the factories. Our whole history as a party is about protecting workers from exploitation. I am afraid I stand firm on this. Our moral position should guide us.”David Alton, the cross-bench peer who drafted the amendment, said he would seek to have it re-inserted once the GB Energy bill returned to the Lords. “Both the last government and this one have been reluctant to move, despite the obvious moral imperative to avoid a slave-made green transition,” he said.“Existing regulation isn’t working, and the Procurement Act could only bar companies if there had been a conviction either in the UK or China. It’s ludicrous to assume that Beijing is going to convict companies for participating in its own labour transfer schemes.

Council believes that disciplinary proceedings should not be initiated on such grounds,” Smith wrote.“The challenges that science is facing today go much wider than any individual and it was felt by many of those present, as well as others who have expressed their concerns separately, that we should focus our energies in making the principled case for science.”The email follows a torrid period for the academy:last summer, Musk’s conductprompted a number of fellows to write to the society calling for steps to be taken, with a subsequent lack of action resulting in two eminent scientists resigning their fellowships in protest andmore than 3,400 members of the scientific communitysigning an open letter expressing similar dismay.Some fellows, including the Nobel laureate and AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton, have evencalledexplicitly for Musk’s expulsion.However, others haveraised concernsabout such a step, noting it could be politically difficult and raise questions about the fellowship of others who have expressed controversial views. Some have also argued revoking Musk’s fellowship could underminetrust in science.Smith’s letter said a decision not to go down the road of formal disciplinary proceedings should not be taken as meaning that the council condoned attacks on science or scientists, and reiterated concerns about cuts to science funding in the US, the spread of misinformation and disregard of important scientific evidence by the new US administration.Smith added a letter had been sent to Musk by the president-elect, Sir Paul Nurse, although the contents were not revealed, and stressed the academy will “step up advocacy for science and challenge attacks on science and scientists, particularly in the United States”.Royal Society urged to expel Elon Musk as fellows sign open letterRead more“We will also be seeking to engage directly with our fellows in the US, who are the ones most directly affected, and who are best placed to understand exactly what is going on in their fields of expertise and what interventions, if any, on their behalf, would be most effective,” Smith wrote, adding engagement with Fellows in the UK would also be expanded.Hinton was among the fellows who confirmed he had received a communication from Smith, but said its confidentiality prevented him from commenting upon its contents.“I can repeat my own opinion, which is that if the [Royal Society] gives fellowships for promoting science they should take them away for demoting science,” he said.Stephen Curry, an emeritus professor of structural biology at Imperial College London, who is not a fellow of the Royal Society but organised the open letter, said he welcomed efforts to reach out to researchers in the US and the UK, but noted the content of Nurse’s letter remained a mystery and that Smith’s email made no mention of the academy’s code of conduct.“How can the Royal Society claim to act in a principled way when it’s turning a blind eye to Musk’s unprincipled scientific behaviour, spreading misinformation, or failing to speak out against the anti-scientific actions of the administration of which he is a part – and that is something I think he’s required to do by the fellows’ code of conduct,” Curry said, adding the academy had not said Musk had not broken the code.Curry added that the academy was continuing to harm itself by not being open and robust about an issue that had caused concern among fellows.“While they continue to refuse to address Musk’s contraventions of their code of conduct, their authority to speak for the UK scientific community is undermined at the minute,” he said. “I don’t feel that they speak for me.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskRoyal SocietynewsShareReuse this content"

Now, a judicial review has found that the then-home secretary “wrongly misunderstood how immigration law, including the immigration rules in force in 1999, would have applied to the claimant”, and that his case should go back to the Home Office to be reconsidered.TheHome Officerefused Lee’s compensation with the claim that at the time he was detained his indefinite leave to remain had “lapsed” – despite the fact that under the rules at the time, he could be re-granted leave to enter or remain on return to the UK.The ruling is expected to have implications for other members of the Windrush generation whose claims have been refused. “For years, I have lived with the pain and injustice of being turned away from the UK,” Lee said after the ruling. “No one should have to fight this hard just to be recognised and treated fairly. I hope this decision forces the Home Office to do right by others who have suffered as I have.”In the judicial review hearing, the deputy high court judge Michael Ford KC found the then-home secretary had failed to recognise that under immigration rules then in force, Lee had a right to seek readmission to the UK as a returning resident. While the timeline of Lee’s case covers Priti Patel and Suella Braverman’s periods in office, it is Braverman’s final decision in December 2022 that is covered by judicial review.The Windrush scandal wasrevealed by the Guardianin 2017 and 2018. It concerned thousands of Black Britons who were wrongly detained and removed, having settled in the UK lawfully from former British colonies in the Caribbean, often as children, who were never provided with documents “proving” their status.Lee was born a“British subject”in Jamaica. He came to the UK in 1971, attended school, married, worked as a builder and raised a family in south London with indefinite leave to remain.However, in July 1999, on returning from a trip to Jamaica, he was stopped at Heathrow. At the time, Lee was travelling on a Jamaican passport, as he had always done, and visas were not needed to enter from Jamaica. But immigration officials refused him re-entry.Lee returned to the UK in 2000 and was again granted indefinite leave to remain. When the Windrush compensation scheme was set up in April 2019 to compensate members of the postwarWindrush generation, who, like Lee, had suffered after officials began insisting they prove their status in the country, he made an application, but the claim was rejected in 2021 and upheld twice.After the review, in which the judge concluded “legal error” led to the decision that Lee was “ineligible for compensation”, his lawyer, Stephanie Hill, described the judgment as a “significant victory for Raymond and others affected by the Windrush scandal”, urging government “to take swift action to properly compensate Raymond and ensure the Windrush compensation scheme operates fairly and lawfully”.The Home Office has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWindrush scandalCommonwealth immigrationImmigration and asylumHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Sources at Ofwat told the Guardian they are near-certain to ban some water CEO bonuses this year.New powers under theWater(Special Measures) Act mean the regulator can ban bonuses of water company executives under criteria of Ofwat’s choosing, subject to consultation.However, campaigners have said the proposed measures are not fit for purpose. Ofwat said bonuses will be banned if water companies are given a one-star rating by the Environment Agency. Butunder this criteria, no bonuses would have been blocked in the 2023-24 financial year as every water company achieved a more than one star rating.Environmental campaigners have said the EA’s rankings scheme is not functioning properly, as it potentially gives companies who illegally dump sewage full marks.Under the rankings, companies are judged on seven metrics including drought resilience and transparency: if they score highly on some of these, they can get top marks, whether or not they have also had high levels of sewage spills.Feargal Sharkey, water campaigner and former Undertones frontman, said that the EPA rating is not a good enough measure of environmental performance.He said: “The last time anyone had a one-star rating it was Southern Water in 2021, yet these companies continue to illegally dump sewage – how bad do you have to be? They are basing their bonus rules on a failed environmental scheme which has been in place for 15 years and has not stopped companies from sewage dumping.”Bonuses for water company bosses in England and Wales rose to £9.1m last year. More than a third of that total was at Severn Trent, which wasfined £2mthe same year for “reckless” pollution but lifted itsbonuses to £3.36m.The other criteria for banning bonuses are if a company is fined for a principal statutory consumer duty, if it breaches its licence requirement to hold a sufficient credit rating and/or subsequently fails to comply with a enforcement order or undertaking, or if it is convicted of any criminal offences.Companies have said theycan circumvent bonus bansby increasing executive pay.James Wallace, CEO of River Action, said: “The idea that limiting executive performance-related pay will reduce pollution is laughable. Water company bosses will simply increase their multimillion-pound salaries to side-step new rules. The only way to bring about rapid and radical improvements in this corrupted industry is to end the privatisation experiment and for the government to enforce the law.”Ofwat said: “We know that public trust in the water sector is at an all-time low, and believe it is in the public interest to apply the rule as soon as possible. We have proposed to implement our new rule for bonuses paid from 1 April 2024 onwards.”Water UK, which represents the water companies, declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsRiversWaterWater industryEnglandExecutive pay and bonusesnewsShareReuse this content"

The group subscribed to militant accelerationist ideology, which is an extreme rightwing view that believes in rapid capitalist growth, technological advancement and radical social change.Officers found in Finnigan’s bedroom a large tapestry depicting the satanic beast or Baphomet goat head, a defaced Bible with red writing on referencing 764, a black notebook containing an assortment of statements, pentagrams and swastikas and red writing on the floor and door, referencing his internet persona ACID.One Telegram chat recovered from Finnigan’s Chromebook showed communication with an individual believed to be a young female, who told him she was considering suicide, which he encouraged her to carry out. He asked her to stream it so he could share it with “764”, then boasted about this in his chat group.Finnigan was also found in possession of an 11-page pdf document outlining how to carry out “truck attacks”, which gave information on attack planning including knife and firearm mass casualty attacks. He had also filmed himself damaging a nearby parked car.On a Telegram group chat Finnigan posted a photo of a red tent in a field near his home with messaging suggesting he wanted to kill a homeless person. The tent was found with graffiti associated with the 764 group at both entrances to the field, matching the red spray paint found in his room.DCS Claire Finlay, the head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, said it was a “complex case interlinking terrorism and serious criminal offences”. Although Finnigan claimed the statements he made online were fantasy, his actions had real-world implications, she added.Richard Ehiemere, 21, was convicted in February for two fraud offences and three offences related to possessing and sharing indecent images of children, linked to his membership of an online criminal group that blackmailed young teenage girls. He is due to be sentenced in May.Ehiemere, from Hackney in east London, was convicted four years after an initial referral from the online platform Discord, which was concerned about the activities of the CVLT group he belonged to. CVLT is a form of “Com” network, where young men share harmful content and commit online offences.The investigation into Ehiemere established that his online moniker “Retaliate#1337” had logged on to Discord channels connected to CVLT 383 times, where he had disclosed stolen email addresses and passwords. The profile is also believed to have shared indecent images of children.Police also found conversations relating to hacking, selling unlawfully obtained material and how to avoid detection on his mobile phone.Steve Laval, the senior investigating officer at the NCA’s National CyberCrimeUnit, said: “Ehiemere was a key enabler for this harmful online group, providing stolen data which they could use to defraud hundreds of victims.”Explore more on these topicsNCA (National Crime Agency)CrimeInternetYoung peopleMalwareViolence against women and girlsInternet safetyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s in the house, I’m outside.” Asked if anything similar had happened before, she said: “No, it’s the first time,” adding that she had been hit “in the face”.After police arrived at about 11.30pm, an officer offered to use an ice pack for the bump on her head. Georgia Barton told them: “I’ve been pushed down and kicked about and stuff. He said he was going to fight with my brother and my dad.”Prosecutor Helena Duong said during the trial: “There had been a verbal disagreement about a family matter.”Barton “grabbed her and pushed her to the ground and kicked her in the head”, Duong said, adding that as a friend tried to intervene, Barton “threw” him off and said: “Don’t disrespect me.”He was arrested at about midnight in his bedroom, where he had been asleep, and was still drunk, the trial was told. He did not comment when questioned by police.Giving evidence, Barton said he had argued with his wife after their friends got into a disagreement.“That led to us having a disagreement. I stupidly took my mate’s side, I said his wife was out of order,” he told the court. “We just got into petty name calling. We ended up getting a bit more agitated and were close to each other.”A friend had come between him and his wife to separate them, said Barton, but he denied that anything “physical” had happened.Duong asked Barton: “Are you someone that on occasion might lose your temper?”“Yep,” the former footballer replied.Asked if he had kicked his wife, he said no, before adding: “If I kicked someone in the head there would be a lot more damage than what’s alleged in this case.”The court heard that the couple are still married and living together. An original trial scheduled for 2022 was adjourned after Georgia Barton wrote to prosecutors and said her injuries had been caused by accident when a friend moved in to separate the pair.“I’m not a victim … I want to move on with my life,” she said.Prosecutors said they did not plan to ask her to give evidence in court, and a judge paused proceedings citing concerns that a trial would be unfair to Barton.The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Stephen Parkinson, appealed against the decision at the high court in London. In a judgment in June, two senior judges ruled in the DPP’s favour and said Barton should face a trial over the allegations in front of a different judge.Explore more on these topicsJoey BartonnewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t think he should be around young women in any industry.”Powell, an assistant producer with Unstoppable, said initially Clarke was like a “big brother” who helped her career. But she said she was so traumatised by her subsequent experience of working with him that she was quitting the industry.In her witness statement, she spoke of her “guilt” at not stopping Clarke’s behaviour towards other women when she worked for him, but said she was scared of the actor.Powell’s allegations, that Clarke exposed his penis to her in a car and groped her in a lift during a 2015 business trip to Los Angeles, were included in publications in 2021-22 alleging sexual misconduct that form the basis of Clarke’s libel claim against the Guardian.Powell said of the alleged car incident: “I was just so shocked when I looked round and realised. He looked into my eyes and then looked at his penis and said, ‘Go on’. I moved away from him towards the window and said something like ‘What are you doing? Put it away’. I said to him: ‘We’re on the way to your wife and kids’ … It hadn’t crossed my mind until that moment that he might be dangerous.”She said that in the lift Clarke “grabbed me in the genitals, through my dress and underwear”.When Williams accused her of lying, Powell replied: “I was so shocked and heartbroken, someone I called my big brother, that he would do that to his little sister. I felt so heartbroken, so violated. I remember sitting in that office and thinking that part of me had died that day.“It was awful. It was one of the worst moments of my life.”Powell said in her statement that she saw Clarke’s sexual impropriety towards other women and felt “guilt about things I have witnessed and the fact I didn’t do anything at the time to stop Noel, or felt I couldn’t”.She said: “I used to placate Noel rather than confront him because I was scared of him. I feel that Noel used me as a shield, to help women feel comfortable around him.”Powell said she could not “simply walk away” from Unstoppable because Clarke would tell her what happened to people who “crossed him”, including the actor Adam Deacon. “He would tell people Adam had lost his mind or make out Adam was volatile or dangerous,” Powell said. “I therefore knew what might happen if I left on bad terms.”Deacon was found guilty of harassment of Clarke in 2015.Williams suggested that a recording, played in court, of Powell talking about her sex life with Clarke and messages she sent to him proved she was not “timid” as she claimed.Powell said such behaviour was always in response to pressure from Clarke as she attempted to “people please” and “keep him happy”.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

The second matteris being examinedby the Metropolitan police and formed no part of Perry’s report.Her report details complaints made by two of Lowe’s staff: one, his Westminster office manager, who had spent 14 years previously working in parliament; and the other a case worker in his constituency office.It said the first woman alleged that she was “the subject to constant criticism meted out unpleasantly and harshly” by an aide to Lowe. When she raised her worries with the MP in December 2024, the report said, he was “dismissive”.A further attempt to raise her worries with Lowe were “met with hostility and disdain”, the woman said. The report quoted her as saying Lowe “simply made clear that the staffer was ‘his man’ and if she didn’t like it, she could ‘make other arrangements’”. Her formal complaint relates to both the staffer and Lowe.The case worker in the Great Yarmouth office was, the report said, “subjected to unacceptable remarks made about her from the very inception of her job”.It said these involved WhatsApp messages from another staffer, calling the woman “weird” and referencing autism. Perry said she had seen the messages “and they do not make for comfortable reading”.Both women complained they had faced “considerable stress and suffering” through their treatment, the report said.Perry said she had been asked to look into the issue on 3 March, four days before Lowe lost the whip. Lowe has argued that the investigation and action against him began in response to an interview he did with the Daily Mail criticising Farage, which was published on 5 March.The KC said she had been told by Lowe’s solicitor that the MP would not formally respond to the allegations, because of the police investigation into the alleged threats. Perry said she could “see no nexus” between the two sets of claims.In the report, she said she spoke “at length” with the two complainants, whose names are redacted from the report, and that both statements were made separately with no knowledge of what the other was saying.She concluded: “There is veracity in the complaints from both women which amounts [to] credible evidence” of their claims, adding that Lowe seemingly failed to act on their concerns.“Mr Lowe has to be responsible for setting the tone in his office and constituency office and thus he is responsible for the acts of both [the staffers] … as well as looking at his own conduct towards [the Westminster staffer],” Perry added.In a series of lengthy tweets sent on Tuesday afternoon, Lowerejectedany wrongdoing, calling the women’s statements “filled with hearsay, and outright lies based on zero evidence”.He said the WhatsApp comments were “mildly inappropriate”, taken out of context and did not constitute bullying.He also disputed the timeline implied in the report, saying he carried out the Daily Mail interview on 25 February, and that Farage’s team knew about its content the next day.Headded: “Reform has deployed woke HR lawfare to smear not only my name, but the reputation of my innocent and decent staff – going as far as to publicly name them. Unprecedented wickedness. It is truly despicable behaviour. I am ashamed to have been part of such a rotten organisation.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKRupert LowenewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the Met said in a statement: “Following enquiries to date, officers have found no evidence to suggest that the incident was suspicious in nature. As such, we are no longer treating this as a potentially criminal matter, although we continue to support other partners, including colleagues from National Grid, London fire brigade and SSEN, with whom we remain in close contact.“Should any relevant new information or evidence come to light it will be looked at and considered as appropriate.”The fire resulted in no planes being allowed to take off or land, causing diversions which affected about 1,300 flights. Some flights resumed on Friday evening but airlines faced difficulties and passengers were disrupted due to airline crew being in different parts of the world.The decision to close the airport was questioned by the head of the National Grid who said that there was enough power forthe airport to remain openduring the entire period it was shut down.John Pettigrew said two other substations that served Heathrow were working and could have supplied the airport with all the power it needed to remain open. “There was no lack of capacity from the substations,” he said. “Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow.”The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has ordered the National Energy System Operator to investigate what happened and provide its initial findings within six weeks. An internal review of the airport’s crisis management plans and its response will be undertaken by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, who is an independent member of Heathrow’s board.Heathrow’s chief executive Thomas Woldbye will be grilled by MPs on 2 April at a one-off session investigating the closure of the airport. A spokesperson for the airport told the Guardian on Monday: “This was an unprecedented issue which began with a fire at an off-airport substation, in less than 24 hours the entire airport was rebooted from a standing start and we delivered a full schedule from Saturday onwards.“There are two reviews into the systems and response both at Heathrow and with the wider grid infrastructure. We will support these and lessons will be learned where needed.”Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

He said he was held at an army base, blindfolded, for 24 hours and forced to sleep under a freezing air conditioner.“All my body is pain,” he told the Associated Press. “I heard the voices of the soldiers, they were laughing about me … I heard ‘Oscar’ but I didn’t speak Hebrew.”Tsemel, representing the three men, said they received only minimal care for their injuries from the attack and said she had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.View image in fullscreenHamdan Ballal being detained on Monday night.Photograph: Raviv Rose/APEarlier this month Ballal and the other directors ofNo Other Land, which looks at the struggles of living under Israeli occupation, appeared on stage at the 97th Academy Awards in Los Angeles to accept the award for best documentary film.Tsemel said Ballal and the other detained people had been accused of throwing stones at a young settler. They deny the allegations.All three Palestinians were driven to a hospital in the city of Hebron.The film’s co-director Yuval Abraham posted on X: ‘‘After the assault, Hamdan was handcuffed and blindfolded all night in an army base while two soldiers beat him up on the floor, his lawyer Leah Tsemel said after speaking with him just now.’’‘Like a punishment’: witnesses describe Israeli settler attack on No Other Land directorRead morePalestinian residents said about two dozen settlers – some masked, some carrying guns and some in military uniforms – attacked the West Bank village of Susya on Monday evening as residents were breaking their Ramadan fast.Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones, they said.The Israeli military said on Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in “a violent confrontation”. On Tuesday, it referred further queries to police, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Lamia Ballal, the director’s wife, said she heard her husband being beaten outside their home as she huddled inside with their three children. She heard him screaming, “I’m dying!” and calling for an ambulance. When she looked out the window, she saw three men in uniform beating Ballal with the butts of their rifles and another person in civilian clothes who appeared to be filming the violence.“Of course, after the Oscar, they have come to attack us more,” Lamia said. “I felt afraid.”West Bank settlers are often armed and sometimes wear military-style clothing that makes it difficult to distinguish them from soldiers.View image in fullscreenPalestinians show damage to a water tank the day after the attackPhotograph: Mussa Issa Qawasma/ReutersOn Tuesday, a small bloodstain could be seen outside their home, and the car’s windshield and windows were shattered. Neighbours pointed to a nearby water tank with a hole in the side that they said had been damaged by the settlers.Witnesses and residents in Susya said one of the settlers who took part in the attack, from the outpost “Ancient Susya”, has participated ‘‘since 7 October in dozens of events in which Palestinians were attacked, expelled from their land, or had their property damaged. In many of these events, he was also documented wearing military uniform or accompanied by others in uniform”.Abraham posted avideo on Xshowing one of the masked settlers throwing a stone at what appeared to be a CCTV camera. He wrote: ‘‘The group of armed KKK-like masked settlers that lynched No Other Land director Hamdan Ballal caught here on camera.’’MapHe added: ‘‘Hamdan Ballal is now free and is about to go home to his family.”No Other Land, which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages.The joint Israeli-Palestinian production has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International film festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad. Miami Beach in Florida proposed ending the lease of a movie theatre that screened it.View image in fullscreenBasel Adra checks a damaged car after Israeli settlers’ attack.Photograph: Mussa Issa Qawasma/ReutersBasel Adra, another of the film’s co-directors who is a prominent Palestinian activist in the area, said there had been a massive increase in attacks by settlers and Israeli forces since the Oscar win.“Nobody can do anything to stop the pogroms, and soldiers are only there to facilitate and help the attacks,” he said. “We’re living in dark days here, in Gaza, and all of the West Bank … Nobody’s stopping this.”Masked settlers with sticks also attacked Jewish activists in the area on Monday, smashing their car windows and slashing tyres, according to Josh Kimelman, an activist with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence. Video provided by the group showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night.Israel captured the West Bank in the six-day war in 1967 , along with the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal.0:56Moment Israeli settlers attack activists in West Bank – videoIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, home to more than 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centres.The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. About 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive groves – and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.The Palestinians also face threats from settlers at nearby outposts. Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usually turn a blind eye to settler attacks or intervene on behalf of the settlers.The war in Gaza has brought a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widespread military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and displaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaNo Other LandIsraelShareReuse this content"

And it is pressure that we will resist.”The Danish leader also dismissed the idea of the trip being a private visit, saying: “You cannot make a private visit with official representatives from another country.”Trump’s threats to acquire Greenland, she said, should be taken seriously. “President Trump is serious … He wants Greenland. Therefore, it cannot be seen independently of anything else,” she told Danmarks Radio (DR).Trump’s expansionism threatens the rules-based order in place since second world warRead moreShe said: “It is clearly not a visit that is about what Greenland needs or what Greenland wants from a visit. Therefore, no matter how we twist it, it is a completely unacceptable pressure on Greenland, the Greenlandic politicians and the Greenlandic population, but it is also on Denmark and thus the kingdom.”Copenhagen, Greenland’s former colonial ruler, retains control of security and foreign policy in the autonomous territory, which is still part of the kingdom of Denmark. Trump has repeatedly stated his desire for the US to gain control over the island, which he has said is crucial for American security.Greenland’s prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, has accused Washington of“foreign interference”in relation to the planned visit, amid political uncertainty in the territory as coalition talks continue less than a fortnight after a general election.The US president responded by saying the delegation had been invited by “officials” on the Greenlandic side. “People from Greenland are asking us to go there,” he told reporters on Monday.The Nuuk government, however, disputed that. “For the record, the Greenlandic government has not issued any invitations for visits, either official or private,” it said in a statement. “The current government is acting as an interim government pending the formation of a new coalition, and we have kindly requested all countries to respect this process.”Also due to participate in the visit from Thursday to Saturday are the White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, now embroiled in an embarrassingsecurity leak, and the energy secretary, Chris Wright.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Locals say it could alter their way of lifeRead moreKuno Fencker, a member of parliament for Naleraq, which came second to the Democrats in the election, said the party had been “thrown out” of coalition talks, in part because of the upcoming US visit.“It has an effect because many of the members think that we, especially me, are selling the country to the US,” he said, adding that it was not in his authority to do so.Accusing the Danish media of “fear-mongering” over the US and Trump, he said: “Divide and rule is being used extremely towards Greenland and fear-mongering about the United States. And especiallyDonald Trumpis framed as the big villain, big bad wolf, here.”The White House has said Waltz and Wright will visit the US space force base in Pituffik, in the north of Greenland, for briefings from US personnel, and they are expected to join Vance to visit historical sites and attend a dog-sled race.The White House National Security Council has said the delegation aimed to “learn about Greenland, its culture, history and people”.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsArcticEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Voice-based chatbots initially appeared to help mitigate loneliness compared with text-based chatbots, but this advantage started to slip the more someone used them.After using the chatbot for four weeks, female study participants were slightly less likely to socialise with people than their male counterparts. Participants who interacted with ChatGPT’s voice mode in a gender that was not their own for their interactions reported significantly higher levels of loneliness and more emotional dependency on the chatbot at the end of the experiment.In thefirst study, the researchers analysed real-world data from close to 40m interactions with ChatGPT, and then asked the 4,076 users who had those interactions how they felt.For thesecond study, the Media Lab recruited almost 1,000 people to take part in a four-week trial examining how participants interacted with ChatGPT for a minimum of five minutes each day. Participants then completed a questionnaire to measure their feelings of loneliness, levels of social engagement, and emotional dependence on the bot.The findings echo earlier research, for example in 2023MIT Media Lab researchersfound that chatbots tended to mirror the emotional sentiment of a user’s messages – happier messages led to happier responses.Dr Andrew Rogoyski, a director at the Surrey Institute for People-Centred Artificial Intelligence, said that because peoplewere hard-wired to to think of a machine behaving in human-like ways as a human, AI chatbots could be “dangerous”, and far more research was needed to understand their social and emotional impacts.“In my opinion, we are doing open-brain surgery on humans, poking around with our basic emotional wiring with no idea of the long-term consequences. We’ve seen some of the downsides of social media – this is potentially much more far-reaching,” he said.Dr Theodore Cosco, a researcher at the University of Oxford, said the research raised “valid concerns about heavy chatbot usage”, though he noted it “opens the door to exciting and encouraging possibilities”.“The idea that AI systems can offer meaningful support — particularly for those who may otherwise feel isolated — is worth exploring. However, we must be thoughtful and intentional in how we integrate these tools into everyday life.”Dr Doris Dippold, who researches intercultural communication at the University of Surrey, said it would be important to establish what caused emotional dependence on chatbots. “Are they caused by the fact that chatting to a bot ties users to a laptop or a phone and therefore removes them from authentic social interaction? Or is it the social interaction, courtesy of ChatGPT or another digital companion, which makes people crave more?”Explore more on these topicsChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)LonelinessComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Accountability for killing hundreds, protecting millions of lives, and ensuring aviation safety should be policies any executive branch should get behind regardless of any larger agenda.”Boeing’s previous plea deal, struck last year under the Biden administration, included spending $455m to improve safety and compliance practices over three years of court-supervised probation, as well as supervision by an independent monitor for three years.Relatives of the victims of the two crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019, have argued the agreement failed to adequately hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of their loved ones.“We urge the Department of Justice to stand on the right side of history, reject any further plea negotiations, and move forward with a full prosecution,” Erin Applebaum, a lawyer representing 34 families of those killed in the 2019 Max Ethiopian Airlines crash, said. “The families deserve their day in court, and this opportunity for justice must not be squandered.”Last May, the justice department found Boeing had violated a 2021 agreement that had shielded it from prosecution over the crashes. Prosecutors then decided to criminally charge Boeing and negotiate the current plea deal.Officials in the Trump administration have publicly argued that regulators must be firm with Boeing after a series of missteps, includinglast January’s cabin panel blowout. “We need to be tougher on Boeing,” said Steve Bradbury, who was confirmed as deputy transportation secretary this month.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsBoeingLaw (US)Plane crashesAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He suffered four breathing crises during his stay in hospital,the most critical episode being on 28 February, when he inhaled his vomit.“We were all aware that the situation had further worsened and there was a risk that he would not make it,” Sergio Alfieri, a general surgeon at Gemelli hospital, said in an interview with Corriere della Sera published on Tuesday.“We had to choose whether to stop [treatment] and let him go, or push forward and try [to save him] with all the drugs and therapies possible, running the very high risk of damaging other organs. In the end, we took this path.”It was the pope’s personal nurse, Massimiliano Strappetti, who instructed the team to continue treatment, telling them: “Try everything, don’t give up,” Alfieri recalled.The pontiff was fully aware that he might not make it through the night. “We saw a man who was suffering,” Alfieri told Corriere. “But from day one he wanted us to tell him the truth about his condition.”During the episode, Alfieri said he “saw tears in the eyes of some of the people” around him. “People who, I understood, sincerely love him, like a father.”The pope suffered subsequent respiratory attacks, including another critical one while he was eating, which again caused him to inhale his vomit, putting more pressure on his lungs. “In these cases, if not promptly helped, you risk sudden death,” said Alfieri. “It was terrible, really we thought he wouldn’t make it.”The pope’s health started to improve and doctors declared on 10 March that hewas no longer in imminent danger. As he started to feel better, the pontiff moved around the ward in his wheelchair and on one evening offered a pizza takeaway for all those who had assisted him.At his own insistence, Francis returned home to Casa Santa Marta inVaticanCity, where he must convalesce for at least two months as he continues treatment. Alfieri told reporters on Saturday that it would take time for the pope’s body to fully heal.Meanwhile, it was announced that King Charles’ state visit to the Vatican has been postponed by mutual agreement after medical advice suggested the Pope would benefit from extra time to recuperate.Charles and Camilla were due to visit Pope Francis in the Holy See in just under two weeks’ time.

Colorado Republicans had raised more than $10,000 to commission the oil painting that was the target of the president’s ire.By Tuesday morning, the portrait was no longer hanging next to those of other US presidents.‘Insecure baby’: Trump draws ridicule after throwing fit over Colorado capitol portraitRead moreDemocrats in the state legislature did not object to the painting’s removal.“If the GOP wants to spend time and money on which portrait of Trump hangs in the capitol, then that’s up to them,” they said in a statement.Republicans have not said how they will pay for a new portrait or who might paint it.In his post on social media on Sunday, Trump had said he would prefer no picture at all over the one at theColoradocapitol. He expressed discontent with how the portrait there of his presidential predecessor Barack Obama – which was painted by the same artist – “looks wonderful”.Trump said “nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves” and said he believed the one of him at the Colorado “was purposefully distorted a level even I, perhaps, have never seen before”.The presidential portraits are the purview of the Colorado building advisory committee.

An Istanbul court initially ruled the journalists should be released before reversing the decision and issuing an official arrest order, according to their lawyers and representatives.Among the detained are Yasin Akgül of Agence France-Presse and the former AFP photojournalist Bülent Kılıç, who wasnamed Guardian agency photographer of the year in 2014for his coverage of Ukraine, events on the Turkish border with Syria and the deadly crash of flight MH17.They were held after photographing mass anti-government demonstrations that have sweptTurkeyfor the first time in years, prompted by the arrest of Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu last week. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in connection with the protests.The journalists were all charged with “taking part in illegal rallies and marches and failing to disperse despite warnings”, court documents showed.Akgül’s arrest drew a sharp rebuke by AFP chairman Fabrice Fries, who said his detention was “unacceptable”.“This is why I am asking you to intervene as quickly as possible to obtain the rapid release of our journalist,” Fries said in a letter addressed to the Turkish presidency.“Yasin Akgül was not part of the protest,” he wrote. “It is the job of a photographer to be where the events are occurring, including getting between protesters and the forces of order.”People in Turkey: share your views and experiences of recent protestsRead moreThe court decision was also slammed as “scandalous” by Reporters Without Borders, with the Turkish Photojournalists Union denouncing it as “unlawful, unconscionable and unacceptable”.İmamoğlu is a longstanding rival of the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the lone candidate seen as capable of challenging him at the ballot box in an upcoming election. On the same day that İmamoğlu was sent to a high-security facility on the edge of Istanbul, he was also nominated as a presidential candidate by his opposition Republican People’s party.Demonstrations that began outside Istanbul city hall have quickly grown, with tens of thousands gathering each night to vent their frustration at decades of rule by Erdoğan and his Justice and Development party (AKP).The protests have drawn an increasingly fierce response by the Turkish authorities. Turkish interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said 1,418 people have been arrested in connection with demonstrations in the past week.“While there are currently 979 suspects in custody, 478 people will be brought to court today,” he said. “No concessions will be made to those who attempt to terrorise the streets, to attack our national and moral values, and our police officers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you use it without permission you’re breaking the law. It’s so simple.”In January, it emerged that Mark Zuckerbergapproved his company’s useof The Library Genesis dataset, a “shadow library” that originated in Russia and contains more than 7.5m books. In 2024 a New York federal court ordered LibGen’s anonymous operators topay a group of publishers $30m(£24m) in damages for copyright infringement. Last week, the Atlantic republished asearchable databaseof the titles contained in LibGen. In response, authors and writers’ organisations have rallied against Meta’s use of copyrighted works.“It’ll be incredibly difficult for us, and for other affected industries, to take on Meta, but we’ll have a good go!” said Osman.Fellow authors expressed support for his statement. “THANK YOU! You are right,”wrote the novelistAlice Jolly. “We need to fight – now. Our work has been stolen. There are laws to protect us against this and they need to be enforced. Six of my books have been stolen. That’s my life’s work.”Many writers posted screenshots of their books appearing in the LibGen database. “91 results,”wrote novelistEmma Donoghue. “That’s every book I’ve published since 1993, in multiple languages, scraped without permission to train AI. They’re robbing us in hopes of replacing us.”“As a matter of urgency, Meta needs to compensate the rights holders of all the works it has been exploiting,” the Society of Authorssaid in a statement. “This is yet more evidence of the catastrophic impact generative AI is having on our creative industries worldwide.”‘OpenAI’s metafictional short story about grief is beautiful and moving’ | Jeanette WintersonRead more“From development through to output, creators’ rights are being ignored, and governments need to intervene to protects authors’ rights,” the trade union added. “In the UK, and globally, we need to see strong legislation from governments to uphold and strengthen copyright law, ensure transparency and fair payment, and to penalise big tech companies who ride roughshod over the law.”In January, acourt filingby a group of authors suing Meta for copyright infringement – which includes Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jacqueline Woodson, Andrew Sean Greer, Junot Diaz and the comedian Sarah Silverman – says that company executives, including Zuckerberg, were aware that LibGen is a pirated database.Quoting from Meta internal communications, the filing claims that company engineers discussed accessing LibGen data but hesitated to start because “torrenting from a [Meta-owned] corporate laptop doesn’t feel right [grinning face emoji]”.A Meta spokesperson told the Guardian that the company “has developed transformational GenAI open source LLMs that are powering incredible innovation, productivity, and creativity for individuals and companies.

Now, after a ravishing $300m revamp, it is even more welcoming. Our writer revels in its silk-clad walls and the freshly trickling fountain of its light-filled sculpture courtCharlotte HigginsTue 25 Mar 2025 11.11 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 13.04 EDTShare‘If I could have a pound for every person who’s told me that the Frick is their favourite museum, I’d be able to retire already,” says Axel Rüger, the new director of theNew Yorkinstitution, who has just moved there from leading the Royal Academy of Arts in London. Part of the Frick’s appeal is that it is a great museum that hardly feels like a museum at all. Even more than, say, the Wallace Collection in London – one of the inspirations behind the 5th Avenue landmark – the Frick has the feeling of being someone’s home, its contents selected by a singular eye.That’s because it was and they were. Both home and eye belonged to one man, the Pennsylvania-born coke and steel magnate Henry Clay Frick, who was rich beyond imagining. It is not, though, a place frozen in time. The collection has doubled in size since his death in 1919. The building, which remained the family home until 1931, was altered and enlarged to convert it into a museum that opened in 1935. Nevertheless, “It has such an intimate feel,” says Rüger. “And there’s also an element of fantasy. People think, ‘What would it be like if I lived here?’”It's goodbye to the charming old ladies’ powder room – and hello to the all-gender lavsThis place on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a Gilded Age mansion of remarkable opulence, is on the verge of reopening after a four-year, $300m renovation – its biggest tune-up and renewal for 90 years. For three of those years of closure, the collection was on view at a temporary premises, the former Whitney Museum HQ on Madison Avenue, a bracingly brutalist building by Marcel Breuer that offered a completely different backdrop for the Frick’s Vermeers and Holbeins, its Boulle and Meissen. But now it is back home: the Old Masters are again on the silk- and velvet-clad walls, the chandeliers cleaned and rehung, the fountain in the central sculpture court trickling afresh.View image in fullscreenBig changes … the Fifth Avenue facade of the museum.Photograph: Nicholas VeneziaThe result of the renovation, overseen by German-born, New York-based architect Annabelle Selldorf and her team, is a Frick Collection that is both comfortingly the same (who would want it to feel radically different?) and substantially altered, as paradoxical as that may seem. Much of what’s new is behind the scenes: a state-of-the-art conservation studio, brightly lit from three sides; new offices; necessary but invisible work to the electrics. The connected FrickArtResearch Library, set up by Frick’s daughter Helen Clay Frick, has a renovated reading room, its 1930s Windsor chairs freshly buffed up. There’s also a new education room and facilities for school groups.Much more obviously to the regular visitor, Selldorf has carved out a more spacious entrance hall, moved the coat check and toilets downstairs (goodbye charming old ladies’ powder room, hello more numerous and practical all-gender lavs), and created an intimate, curvaceous 218-seat chamber-scale recital hall for the museum’s music series and lectures in the basement. She wanted her interventions, she said, to be “a good friend to everything that is already there”. She has also created a simple but luxurious marble-lined staircase that ascends to the upper levels from the new entrance hall. Up on the first floor, one can find a 60-seat restaurant. Opening in June, it will end the Frick’s long reign as the only major New York museum where you couldn’t get a cup of coffee.View image in fullscreenPool of light … the central sculpture court.Photograph: Joseph Coscia JrThe upstairs is the biggest obvious change to the Frick. In the past, visitors would pass through the south hall of the museum on the ground floor, with its Vermeers and Bronzino, beside a tantalisingly roped-off grand staircase that ascended to unseen areas beyond an elaborately gilded organ screen on the half-landing. “There was always this very Frick thing,” says deputy director Xavier Salomon, “that only the director and senior curatorial staff were allowed to use those stairs – so naturally we used to love doing it as much as possible, especially during opening hours.” As he descended the staircase on one occasion, Salomon heard a French family whispering among themselves: “That must be a young member of the Frick family.”There’s no more velvet rope. Now those upstairs rooms – where the Fricks had their bedrooms, boudoirs, guest rooms and breakfast room – are open to the public, accessible either from the mansion’s grand old staircase or from Selldorf’s new marble steps. In the 1930s these rooms were converted into offices, which have now departed to light and modern new quarters adjacent. With the exception of Frick’s former sitting room, which remains the director’s office, they now form a sequence of small, intimate spaces for art.For example: one of the joys of the Frick is itsBoucher room, lined with a series of allegorical panels by the French 18th-century painter, bought by the magnate for the amazing price of $500,000. Originally the panels were upstairs in Frick’s wife Adelaide’s boudoir. But in 1935, when the upstairs rooms were designated offices, they were moved down to what had been a butler’s pantry. Piece by piece they have now been reinstalled in their original upper room, with its airy views over Central Park.View image in fullscreen‘Holy of holies’ … the living hall with its twin Holbeins.Photograph: Joseph Coscia JrFrick’s bedroom is now home to an early portrait ofEmma Hamilton by George Romney, back to its old place where he hung it above his fireplace – “the last picture he saw at night and the first he saw in the morning, and since he died here, probably the last he ever saw in his life,” says Salomon.After her father’s death, Helen Clay Frick collected early Italian gold-ground pictures by artists such as Cimabue and Duccio. Previous visitors to the Frick will remember these occupying a space at the very end of the large west picture gallery downstairs. Now they have their own room, appropriately Helen Clay Frick’s former bedroom. And the breakfast room has its original paintings back: French landscapes, including by Corot and Millais, among which the family began their days. No table and chairs though: this is definitely a museum, not a stately home. “We didn’t want to do Downton Abbey,” says Salomon.The result of the expansion is that more of the Frick’s collection is on view in the museum. In place of the gold-ground Italian paintings, the little room at the edge of the West Gallery is now devoted to enamels. There is a special exhibitions gallery in what visitors knew as the Boucher room. The first show is of drawings in the collection, including the only Pisanello drawing in the US –a study of a hanged man– and a delicious Goya of men fishing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Take the living hall, what Salomon calls “the holy of holies”, with its remarkable twin Holbeins – of Sir Thomas More, sporting the best painted velvet sleeve in the history of art, and Sir Thomas Cromwell. In these downstairs rooms, though, the less obvious work included matters such as reweaving velvet or silk wall coverings, often in the French ateliers where the originals were made 90 years ago – a labour of research and love.In the same room as the Holbeins is the Bellini ofSt Francis, “arguably the greatest painting in the collection”, according to Salomon. It is, he points out, unusual for Frick’s taste: he did not purchase many religious paintings. There are no grim pictures of martyrdom – flayings and beheadings are not in evidence – and violent mythological moments are rare. Frick’s taste was for the gentle, the conversational, the elegant. Beautiful women, handsome and efficient-looking men, rendered by the greatest artists. Helen Clay Frick said he liked “pictures pleasant to live with”.View image in fullscreenHe adored money … Henry and Adelaide Frick.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveLooking at these works, which Frick wanted to be seen by the public after his death, it is tempting to make a comparison between the robber barons of his generation – names now indivisible from American culture, such as Mellon and Carnegie – and the super-rich tech billionaires of today.It would be hard to argue that Frick led a life of untarnished virtue. His brutal tactics in breaking strikes in Pittsburgh make for grim reading: privately employed Pinkerton agents opened fire on striking workers at the Carnegie steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania, duringa notorious encounter in 1892. His appetite for buying the best of European fine and decorative art was sensational. He moved through galleries “like a streak of lightning”, recalled Helen Clay Frick. He vacuumed up a great deal of cultural heritage from countries that might have thought to hang on to it before it was too late: his purchase of an El Greco of St Jerome that previously hung in Valladolid Cathedral inspired Spain to enact laws on the export of art. He adored money. In the library, there is a large 10-volume work titled The Book of Wealth. For all this, he left something good to the public: a museum intimate in its atmosphere, gracious in its furnishings – and teeming with knockout artistic masterpieces.The Frick Collectionreopens on 17 AprilExplore more on these topicsMuseumsArtNew YorkArchitectureDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But her reputation has been tarnished by accusations of racismCatherine TaylorTue 25 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 11.59 EDTShareAmonth before she died aged 39, on 3 August 1964, of complications from the autoimmune disease lupus, the American writer Flannery O’Connor wrote from her home in Milledgeville, Georgia to a regular correspondent, the academic and nun Sister Mariella Gable: “The wolf, I’m afraid, is inside tearing up the place.”The “wolf” that O’Connor refers to is her illness, the name of which derives from the Latin. The disease can be mild, but in its worst form it is systemic, causing not only inflammation, chronic fatigue, muscle weakness and skin rashes, but also permanent tissue damage. In her last years, O’Connor could only move around by means of crutches, tending to her beloved pet peacocks. “I can write for one hour a day, and my, my, do I like my one hour. I eat it up like it was filet mignon.”Before diagnosis at the age of 25, O’Connor had been a talented graduate student with an MFA from the prestigious University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop and had completed a coveted Yaddo artists’ colony residency in upstate New York. A draft of her first novel, published as Wise Blood in 1952, and filmed by John Huston in 1979, won a prize; she had become involved in the New York City literary scene, acquired an agent, and was close friends with the poet Robert Lowell and others of his circle. She also lived for a while in Connecticut with the classicist Robert Fitzgerald and his wife, Sally, who would go on to edit of The Habit of Being (1979), a vast volume of O’Connor’s correspondence. Venerable publisher Robert Giroux had her in his sights early on: he remained her editor throughout her life.View image in fullscreen‘The wolf is inside’ … O’Connor in 1952, with her novel Wise Blood.Photograph: Apic/Getty ImagesHer illness meant that in 1951 O’Connor moved back to what she termed the “Christ-haunted” south, to live with and be cared for by her widowed mother, Regina Cline O’Connor. They eventually settled at Andalusia, the O’Connor family summer home, a working farm just outside Milledgeville, Georgia, presided over by a large white classic Southern house straight out of a Tennessee Wiliams play, complete with veranda for rocking chairs. It that is now a museum preserving O’Connor’s work and legacy. The land was formerly a cotton plantation; O’Connor satirised her upbringing in the Jim Crow-era segregated south in sardonic stories of hypocritical, racist and godless southerners, while at times revealing unpalatable personal views in her letters – “the habit of bigotry”, as critic Paul Elie wrote, in a2020 New Yorker essaytitled “How Racist Was Flannery O’Connor?”.Mary Flannery O’Connor was born on 25 March 1925 in Savannah, the oldest city in Georgia, the only child of real estate agent Edward Francis O’Connor and Regina Cline, who was from an old southern family. Of Irish descent, the O’Connors’ Catholicism made them a minority in the heavily Protestant south. Her first taste of fame was atfive years old, on a Pathé newsreel, featuring a chicken that “Mary O’Connor” had taught to walk backwards. “I was just there to assist the chicken, but it was the high point in my life. Everything since has been anticlimax,” she joked. The determined chicken, walking backwards to go forward, is a tempting metaphor for O’Connor’s own endurance. It instilled in her a “love affair” with birds that seemed to transcend most human interactions. Ever self-deprecating, she described herself as a “pigeon-toed child with a receding chin and a you-leave-me-alone-or-I’ll-bite-you complex”, an attitude apparent in her acerbic, droll letters, her wry fiction and the cartoons she drew for her student newspaper at Georgia State College for Women (now Georgia College & State University), where she obtained a BA in sociology and literature in 1945. By this time O’Connor’s father had died, in early 1941, of the lupus that his daughter would inherit. Mother and daughter were left to their ambiguous, interdependent relationship. Notably, none of O’Connor’s letters to Regina has ever been published.O’Connor’s novelistic ambitions would not entirely fold with the progression of her illness, but ironically it was her limited energy that made her into one of the most original short story writers of the 20th century, her acute and disturbing moral vision of humanity driven by a devout, if unconventionally expressed, Catholic faith. “When you can assume that your audience holds the same beliefs you do, you can relax a little … when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock – to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the almost-blind you draw large and startling figures,” she wrote.O’Connor’s frequently brutal fiction, with its distorted, unnatural characters, is usually categorised as “southern gothic”, a term initially coined dismissively by the novelist Ellen Glasgow in 1935 to describe the “backwoods” and “eccentric” fiction of writers such as William Faulkner. Faulkner was undoubtedly a great influence on O’Connor (and he admired Wise Blood), as was master of the grotesque Edgar Allan Poe, the Catholic French novelist François Mauriac, and her near-contemporary Katherine Anne Porter. O’Connor’s own influence can be traced in later writers such as Shirley Jackson, CE Morgan and Joyce Carol Oates.View image in fullscreenMaya Hawke as the author in 2023 biopic Wildcat.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyHer characters hover somewhere between victim and villain: their fates are ordained; they do not appear to have free will. In what is probably her best known and most anthologised story, A Good Man Is Hard to Find (1953), a prattling, controlling grandmother meets her appalling match in the Misfit, the homicidal leader of an escaped convict gang. The elderly woman and her son’s young family – each objectionable in their own way – are shot dead in turn by the gang when they crash their car on a road trip through Georgia – all because the grandmother insisted on having one last look at a house she remembers from her past. “The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee … Behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth.”“It should elicit from you a degree of pity and terror, even though its way of being serious is a comic one,” O’Connor said of that story, urging readers to ignore the “dead bodies” and focus on the transformative “action of grace” when the grandmother reaches out, fatally as it turns out, to the Misfit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Her reputation has been clouded since that 2020 New Yorker essay, although it has been argued that Elie’s disclosures were not new; the letters have been in the public domain since the late 70s.Hilton Als wroteof her Black characters in 2001: “She didn’t use them as vessels of sympathy or scorn; she simply – and complexly – drew from life.” Yet a major biography by Brad Gooch (Flannery O’Connor: A Life, 2009) admits her to be, in private, as Joy Williams put it in aNew York Times review, “a connoisseur of racial jokes”.O’Connor could be perversely contradictory, arguing both for and against integration, while lampooning racist white characters in stories like Revelation and Everything That Rises Must Converge. It was this deeply problematic aspect that caused director Ethan Hawke to hesitate over filming recent biopic Wildcat, which stars his actor daughter Maya as Flannery, alongside Laura Linney as Regina. Hawke and Linney also play most of the roles in the dramatisation of a selection of the stories. The performances are compelling, and Hawke ably transforms into O’Connor – bushy hair and eyebrows, steely spectacles, tell-tale lupus “butterfly” rash blazing across her cheeks. Disappointingly Wildcat sidesteps the question of the author’s racism, while delving into the mystery and conflict of her religious belief. In a 1959 letter she wrote: “What people don’t realise is how much religion costs. They think faith is a big electric blanket, when of course it is the cross.” O’Connor defiantly carried that cross to the end.This article was amended on 25 March 2025. An earlier version said that Flannery O’Connor graduated in 1945 from “Georgia Women’s College (now Georgia State University)”; in fact, the institution’s name in 1945 was Georgia State College for Women, and it is now known as Georgia College & State University.Explore more on these topicsBooksFlannery O'ConnorShort storiesFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why is it such an effective shock tactic?Michael HoganTue 25 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 10.45 EDTShareWarning: the below article contains spoilers for episode six, season three ofThe White Lotus.Talk about a hangover from hell. In the latest episode of The White Lotus, Saxon Ratliff woke up dazed and dishevelled from the previous night’s Full Moon party. It had been a long, messy day-and-night of booze, edibles, “lasers and shitty music”. Oh, and being pleasured by his own brother.The blender-obsessed nepo baby, played by Patrick Schwarzenegger, regained consciousness on a superyacht, next to his naked younger brother Lochlan (Sam Nivola). Despite both Ratliffs insisting they’d blacked out, flashbacks kept floating to the surface.First the siblings snogged for a drunken dare during a Spin the Bottle-style game. Ex-model Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) breezily admitted she’d “hooked up with both brothers”. Toxic jock Saxon had a hazy memory of Chloe and Lochlan having intercourse while he masturbated next to them. Hang on. Was that definitely his hand beneath the bedsheet?Eventually, a queasy image came into focus. The women matter-of-factly reminded Saxon that Lochlan “jerked you off”. Saxon was disbelieving at first, before blaming the drugs. “I don’t think there’s a drug in the world that’d make me get with my brother,” deadpanned Chelsea. At which point Saxon stumbled off to throw up again. The power balance between the brothers seems to have tipped. Is little Lockie now the alpha bro?‘Stolen off a donkey’: why is The White Lotus so obsessed with graphic penis footage?Read moreHBO’s super-rich spa satire had been dangling this taboo-busting prospect for the previous five episodes. There was a distinct whiff of dysfunction between the Ratliff siblings since they touched down in Thailand. When first escorted to their villa, the family of five were informed there were only three bedrooms. “You can sleep with me,” sister Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) told Lochlan. “I don’t mind.” Saxon promptly made it even weirder: “Brothers and sisters don’t sleep together after they have full-grown, you know, genitals.”The priapic protein shake enthusiast has a habit of making suspiciously over-sexualised remarks. “Dude, long plane rides make me so fucking horny,” he said poolside, ostentatiously adjusting his trunks. Piper, a gap year Buddhist, was understandably upset by her brothers grilling her about whether she’s still a virgin. In their adjacent beds that night, Saxon called his sister “pretty hot”, insisting that Lochlan must have noticed too.He proceeded to browse porn on his iPad, before heading butt-naked to the bathroom. Lochlan ogled him before Saxon caught his eye and closed the door. Social media blew up with speculation about an incoming incest plotline. And now writer Mike White has finally gone there. Schwarzenegger has acknowledged the “very odd and weird” dynamic between the brothers, adding that certain scenes were “uncomfortable to watch with my family”.White has deployed sexual shock tactics in all three seasons so far, with eye-popping male nudity and graphic gay romps. In the Sicily-set second series, Leo Woodall’s Jack was caught mid-coitus with his “uncle” Quentin (Tom Hollander). This familial cliffhanger was resolved with the revelation that they weren’t actually related. This time, though, The White Lotus did it for real.View image in fullscreenClive Owen and Saskia Reeves in Close My Eyes.Photograph: Beambright/Four Four Int/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockSibling incest has long been a TV taboo. Nearly 50 years ago, the BBC’s Roman epic I, Claudius – sort of Succession in togas – showed John Hurt’s Emperor Caligula fathering a child with his sister Drusilla. Playwright Stephen Poliakoff’s 1991 film Close My Eyes portrayed the obsessive love between Clive Owen’s town planner and his elder sister, played by Saskia Reeves. A few years later, scouse soap Brookside caused a stir by depicting a sexual relationship between siblings Nat and Georgia Simpson. “We’re adults and we love one another,” Nat told their parents after they were found in bed together. There was tabloid uproar. MPs waded in. Producer Phil Redmond admitted it had gone too far and the Simpson family were written out.But HBO dramas have continued the troubling trend. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros are a veritable hotbed of icky inbreeding. Game of Thrones began with 10-year-old Bran Stark sneaking a peek at Queen Cersei having sex with her twin brother, Jaime Lannister. “We shared a womb, we came into this world together, we belong together,” said the defiant Cersei when confronted. In prequel House of the Dragon, most of the Targaryens end up inter-marrying to keep their bloodline pure and their peroxide mullets intact.During the first and best series of True Detective, viewers glimpsed multiple murderer Errol Childress, AKA The Yellow King, in flagrante with his half-sister. Last year’s Prime Video reboot of Cruel Intentions ramped up the incestuous vibe between step-siblings Lucien and Caroline. And the 2021 Gossip Girl remake saw twins Grace and Jake hook up in a New York hotel room. “Even I didn’t see ‘twincest’ coming,” quipped their trans frenemy Luna.Screenwriter Andrew Davies insisted that the incestuous affair between siblings Hélène and Anatole Kuragina (Tuppence Middleton and Callum Turner) was “crucial” to his 2016 BBC adaptation of Tolstoy’s War & Peace. And in Tom Hardy’s aptly titled 2017 BBC show Taboo, the mud-spattered protagonist’s feelings for his half-sister Zilpha (Oona Chaplin) progressed from love letters to groping in church pews and ultimately the bedchamber. Chaplin told Vanity Fair: “There’s a sexual libertarianism right now. Girls are walking around with their asses hanging out. Guys are just as much. Sex has become a very public-display type of thing, so very few things have remained taboo. Where does the taboo lie now? I think it’s in incest.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Parker Posey’s viral White Lotus accent is a gift to us allRead moreLast year, there was a backlash against an incestuous scene between the Menendez brothers in Netflix’s true-crime dramatisation Monsters: The Lyle & Erik Menendez Story. Critics claimed the “sick” showrunner Ryan Murphy had “made up” the storyline. Murphy pushed back, arguing that it was important to “present points of view from many people involved in the case”. He pointed out that journalist Dominick Dunne, played by Nathan Lane, “wrote several articles about that theory”.With their roots in classical literature and the Bible, incest stories are certainly nothing new. In the prestige TV era, however, they’re definitely becoming more frequent. For audiences hardened online, it’s a way of upping the ante in terms of sexual transgression, a shortcut to shocking a seemingly unshockable generation. Drugs and violence are so last century.When it comes to TV incest, it’s usually villainous characters who are the culprits. Saxon certainly falls into that category in The White Lotus. By invoking the ultimate taboo, White isn’t just breaking boundaries and baiting controversy, then. He is pointing out the deep-rooted corruption of the moneyed elite.The show’s executive producer, David Bernad, told the New York Post last week that the scenes weren’t just for shock value and will pay off in the climactic two episodes: “There’s a specific reason in terms of the narrative storytelling and the larger thematic idea. As the season wraps up, you’ll see their purpose. The brother story culminates in a very satisfying way.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Then you simply wrap it up into a parcel and pop it in the oven for 10-15 minutes.Punchy flavours are another good idea with frozen seafood, which is why Toogood often goes for curries or tomato-based stews. Frozen prawns, however, tend to be destined for noodle soups: “Fry some veg, such as tenderstem broccoli, then add noodles and stock. Chuck in a handful of prawns at the end, then spruce it up with chilli, coriander and spring onion.”Defrosted mussels, by contrast, are worth steaming and chopping to stir throughgribiche, McIlroy says, but Scott warns they can “lose their flavour” by being frozen. That’s why, if fresh mussels aren’t an option, she tends to seek out tinned ones instead: “They’re lovely on toast with avocado.”A bag of frozen fish pie mix is also a boon. Toogood puts his to work in fishcakes: “Roast the defrosted fish with herbs and some seasoning until cooked through, then flake it into mashed potato with a load of fresh parsley, or massaman curry paste or lime pickle.” Shape that into patties, then flour, egg and breadcrumb them, and shallow-fry until golden. “Fish pie mix is also great in shakshuka or in a tomato- or white sauce-based stew,” Scott says. Or try it in her simple take on fish pie, which involves mixing the defrosted pie mix with creme fraiche, mustard and herbs, putting that in an ovenproof dish, topping with sliced new potatoes and baking.And let’s not forget the great unifier, fish fingers. Happily, Toogood says, they really don’t need much messing with: “Just a good spoon of crispy chilli oil, plus some chips and peas, and you can’t go far wrong.” You’ll find no arguments here.Got a culinary dilemma?

Not a single hiker, dog walker or shepherd. Instead, golden eagles have circled lazily overhead, stags have boldly held our gaze, and rare blue butterflies have flitted around our booted feet. The silence here is deep and dense, broken only by birdsong.This is the Madonie national park, also known as the Sicilian Alps, home to many of the island’s highest mountains and rarest plants. It’s a landscape of 200 million-year-old rocks, rich in fossils. Of raptors and the tiniest of songbirds. Of wild boar, fallow deer and porcupines. Of cyclamen and crocuses. Of the largest holly trees on the planet, and of 65 varieties of orchid. A landscape that is void of tourists, ramblers and Sicilians. For anyone in search of wilderness, solitude and sunshine, I can’t think of a better place.Summer here would be too hot to wander. Spring – when the lush green landscape is dotted with sweet peas and poppies, and villages come alive with religious festivals – and autumn, when we visit, with its pink prickly pears hanging from cacti and rutting stags, are the best times to explore.View image in fullscreenAnnabel Abbs in the Madonie natural park.Photograph: Annabel AbbsThe 40,000 hectare park was created in 1989, when its biodiversity and geological rarity were recognised by Unesco as possibly the richest in the Mediterranean. My partner and I are here to walk from its hinterland to its rim on the northern coast of Sicily, not far from the capital, Palermo. Our route follows a section of the newly restored 166km Via dei Frati (The Way of the Friars), a trail once used by itinerant friars, pilgrims, beggars, mystics and missionaries. We shall be walking about 90km of sharp ascents and descents over seven days, starting from the village of Gangi (with views of Etna on a clear day). And yes, a century back, some of the Madonie’s medieval hilltop-perching villages were infamous mafia strongholds – all of which makes for a landscape as rich in history as it is in flora and fauna. Today, these villages – depopulated, dusty, replete with romantically ruined castles-on-crags and ridiculously ornate churches – are where we sleep.We dip and dive past monumental oak trees rumoured to be a thousand years oldWe booked our guesthouses – in Petralia Sottana, Gangi, Geraci Siculo, Castelbuono and Cefalù – in advance, but could have saved ourselves the effort as we were the only guests. Each day, we head out on quiet country lanes that gradually turn into cattle tracks and then into hidden, winding paths. Here, we must keep a careful eye on the yellow arrows and red-and-white stripes, daubed on rocks and trees, that indicate the Via dei Frati. As we climb, we leave behind the horned cattle, shaggy goats and timid ponies that roam the Madonie’s verdant pastures. Now, skittish deer and their fawns clatter over the scree that often replaces grassland. Raptors soar. We dip and dive, through steep beech forests, past monumental oak trees rumoured to be a thousand years old, around woodlands of wild pear, ash and juniper.In these most remote locations, we often stumble across tiny deserted chapels – and wonder how they were built, and by whom. These were vital places of refuge for the friars who once followed these routes, seeking alms in exchange for work.View image in fullscreenThe village of CastelbuonoPhotograph: Interfoto/AlamyThe Via dei Frati was rediscovered by a Sicilian psychotherapist called Santo Mazzarisi. After walking several well-known pilgrim routes and wondering why Sicily had no trail of its own, Mazzarisi began researching, and then restoring, this ancient path. In 2017, it opened to the public, starting at Caltanissetta in central Sicily and ending at Cefalù on the coast. In the past, pilgrims then crossed the sea from Messina before heading to Jerusalem, but today’s route has been designed as eight stages, each ending in a village where food, accommodation and, of course, a beautiful church can be found. For atrue pilgrim experience, Mazzarisi suggests visiting during holy week – 13-20 April this year – when Caltanissetta hosts processions of life-size statues re-enacting the Resurrection.It’s as though we’re inside a Renaissance painting, with grazing goats, wooded valleys and divinely slanting lightWe join the trail at Gangi because this is where it hits the Madonie mountains. The park contains none of the usual trappings of civilisation so, of necessity, we carry a daily picnic, prepared by our guesthouse, and eat our focaccia sandwiches on sun-warmed rocks. Having explored Gangi’s museum, which is chock-full of geological and archaeological treasures unearthed from the park, we walk 14km to Geraci Siculo. We are not walking at our normal pace – there’s too much to distract us. Instead, we pause regularly to note the birds (buzzards, firecrests, buntings, tits and yellow-feathered serins), to examine the curiously striated rocks that are everywhere, and to exclaim over the remarkably “biblical” scenery. We feel as though we’re inside a Renaissance painting: grazing goats, wooded valleys, divinely slanting light.In Geraci Siculo, we are beckoned into a library by its wizened curator, who proceeds to unlock glass cabinets stacked with 15th-century religious manuscripts. We cannot understand what he is telling us, but the odour of dusty pews drifting from the pages adds to the peculiar sense of time travel.We continue to hike, upwards, through clouds, to Petralia Sottana, where we spend an additional day climbing Monte San Salvatore, following the scuffed tracks of rootling boar, clambering over granite boulders, and getting pleasantly lost.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re heading to the region’s world famous giant holly trees, 20 metres high and thick with scarlet berries, when we hear voices, dogs barking, cars reversing. The sound is such an affront to our ears we pick up our pace, almost running to return to the unpeopled wilderness we’ve fallen in love with. Minutes later, we are happily alone again until we reach Castelbuono. A taxi is planned to take us to Gibilmanna for the final 9km descent into Cefalù on the Tyrrhenian Sea. Although the route becomes increasingly urban, we are mollified by repeated glimpses of sparkling ocean and the knowledge that Cefalù has not only beaches but a Unesco-listed Norman cathedral among its many treasures.In the past, we have hiked all over Europe, but – thanks to the strenuous ascents and silent nights – never have we slept so well. And never have we felt so deliciously solitary. If crowds are your thing, this park and the pilgrim route just won’t do. But if you like a landscape all to yourself, or a terrain so rich in geological history and so abundant with rare plants, insects and birds that you’re forced to walk at an unfamiliarly slow pace, the Via dei Frati will surpass all expectations.Annabel travelled independently.

Just as there are some wines that are best with curry, cheese or seafood, there are bottles whose characteristics – the flavours they call to mind, or simply something about the way they’re put together – seem to fit a specific moment or even a season.At this time of year, for example, when whatever pared-back beauty winter might have possessed has long since lost its austere allure, I start looking for wines that can both echo the scents and keep step with the rising spirits of spring. I find myself craving what I think of as the paradigmatic springtime wine: whether it’s the unashamedly herbaceous and gooseberry-exuberant classic New Zealand style, or the river-cool, grassy mode perfected in Sancerre in France’s Loire Valley, good-quality sauvignon blanc always feels full of new life.Other whites that have an affinity with springtime flavour and feel include England’s own hedgerow-herbaceous still wine speciality, bacchus; the gentle blossomy floral tones and dancing acidity of youthful off-dry German riesling; and the coursing spring-melt Alpine-stream freshness of northern Italian whites such as Piedmont’s gavi or pinot grigio from Trentino-Alto Adige. Many sparkling wines have the requisite quicksilver tingle and friskiness, not least the foaming freshness of new-vintage pet nat, which has none of the biscuity tones of age you find in classic champagne-method fizz, and moscato d’asti, an aromatic dance of gentle bubbles, spring meadow flowers and muscat grapes.White grapes don’t have the monopoly on spring wine. New-vintage rosés are beginning to emerge across the northern hemisphere, full of fresh, first-cherries-of-the-season charm. And there are youthful red wines filled with crunchy, subtly herbaceous tones that are every bit as redolent of the new season. Cabernet franc, particularly from the Loire, but also in increasingly convincing form from South Africa, Argentina, coastal Tuscany, Hungary, California and Australia, is perhaps the most spring-like red, and certainly the red wine style I drink more of than any other at this time of year. But lighter reds such as the berry-bounty of beaujolais and mencía from Ribeira Sacra in Galicia, northern Spain, the earthy red berries of new-wave cinsault from southern Chile and South Africa, and the black-pepper-sprinkled blackberries and cherries of Austrian zweigelt will all have their chance to catch the mood.Six wines to put you in the mood for springView image in fullscreenSix wines to put you in the mood for springPhotograph: PRTesco Finest Viñas del Rey Albariño Rías Baixas, Spain 2023(£12.99, Tesco)A streak of chamomile (flower and grass) brings the spring allusions, combining with a tickle of citrus and some fuller, succulent peachy fruit. Add Rías Baixas’s salty, sea-spray hallmark for a wine that is full of energy and refreshment.Dr Loosen Ürziger Würzgarten KabinettMosel, Germany 2022(£16.25, Waitrose)The depth and vivacity of the ripe peach, melon and lime belies this classic Mosel kabinett riesling’s 8% alcohol, which comes with a slight hit of sweetness. But it’s the lively, dancing feel of the acidity that gives this white its joys-of-spring vibe.Greywacke Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc Marlborough, New Zealand 2024(from £20.45,ndjohn.co.uk;nywines.co.uk;haywines.co.uk)Made by Kevin Judd, the founder of the original cult Marlborough sauvignon blanc, Cloudy Bay. This is a gorgeously fleshy, spring-heeled expression of this most exuberant of dry white wine styles, filled with elderflower, blackcurrant leaf and passion fruit.BEST BUYDomaine de la Noblaie Chinon LeTemps des CérisesChinon, France 2023(from £12.95,thewine society.com;hhandc.co.uk)A late-spring wine with flavours, as its name suggests, of the first harvest of juicy but slightly crunchy cherries, as well as blackcurrants and a certain leafy-sappy freshness. An absolutely ideal Loire cabernet franc for drinking slightly chilled.Domaine Jean-Louis Tissot PoulsardJura, France 2023(£17.50,yapp.co.uk)The Jura in eastern France may be best known for its savoury, comté-matching white wines, but its reds from the local variety poulsard can be just as distinctively delicious, with, in this case, a wonderful beetroot and cherry-fruit quality and supple tannin and a pulse of seasonal energy.Triangle Wines Sanha TintoBairrada, Portugal 2021(£20,gnarlyvines.co.uk;cavebristol.co.uk)Made from the baga grape variety in the central Portuguese region of Bairrada by the great Douro Valley-based winemaker Dirk Niepoort, this is a delightful lighter style red with just enough tannic nip for Easter lamb.Explore more on these topicsFoodDavid Williams on wineWineSpring food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, with some trepidation and a notional trigger warning, I present the villains of the cutlery drawer. These items seemed like a good idea at the time and have ended up being totally useless, at least in my opinion.Silicone-tipped tongsView image in fullscreenSilicone tongs: ‘The thick silicone coating blunts their edges.’Photograph: Elizabeth QuinnI have a particular hatred for silicone-tipped tongs. The thick silicone coating blunts their edges, making them less effective for picking things up. Give me cheap aluminium tongs every time, and a dozen of the smaller versions. Plain tongs may not be things of beauty but they are so much better for serving salads or charcuterie platters than anything else I’ve come across.Silicone spatulasView image in fullscreenMoulded plastic spatulas outdo the silicone variety (pictured) – if you can find one.Photograph: Michael Burrell/Getty ImagesSilicone spatulas don’t scrape the cake bowl as cleanly as those wafer-thin moulded plastic spatulas that tragically seem to have gone out of production. I can’t pass an op-shop without combing through the used cutlery section in the hope of adding to my already impressive collection.Glass chopping boardsView image in fullscreen‘The feel of blade on glass is bone-jarring.’Photograph: Tatiana Gorbunova/AlamyAnother shining example of style over substance, the feel of blade on glass is bone-jarring and the sound reminds me of fingernails on a blackboard. There is no “give” in glass, so your knives are more likely to be blunted.Seven kitchen gadgets I can’t live without: ‘How does anyone make a salad without one?’Read moreThe only advantage of glass boards – and I’m reluctant to concede even one – is that they may be washed (and therefore sanitised) in a dishwasher. Give me a wooden chopping board with its imperfections and battle scars any day. No, they can’t be washed in a dishwasher or even immersed in water for a handwash, but with aminimal amount of effortthey won’t pose a threat to your health. I know there are people with serious allergies out there who need the reassurance of a germ-free cutting surface. But the obsession of the rest of the population with minimising exposure to germs baffles me. I am one of those naysayers who thinks exposure to germs in childhood makes for a more resilient constitution in adulthood.Ceramic knivesView image in fullscreenAre ceramic knives really superior?Photograph: nevarpp/Getty Images/iStockCeramic blades are rust resistant and their density renders them more sanitary, but I have yet to be convinced of their superiority and it seems I am not alone in my scepticism. In a recentGuardian interview of 16 chefs, all of them nominated a stainless steel knife as their favourite. Ceramic blades have no flex and are less porous than stainless steel blades, making them – like glass chopping boards – less giving. You can’t cut anything with them that isn’t easily sliced, such as gourds and other thick-skinned fruit.Pineapple peelersView image in fullscreenThe Ashdown Pineapple Peeler was first demonstrated in 1972.Photograph: Elizabeth QuinnFor the uninitiated, this plastic yellow gadget dominated the pineapple-loving market until as recently as the 1990s. The Ashdown Pineapple Peeler was first demonstrated on the telly in 1972. It has since had copycat designs from other brands but the original earned a place in the social history department of theQueensland Museumand can be found on eBay in its original box for the bargain price of $12 plus postage.My partner’s aunt, Wendy, still has one. After removing the spiky green top, the device is affixed to the flat, exposed top of a pineapple and rotated around, circle by circle. Her advice is to save your money: “A good knife would do it just as well.” And she didn’t mean a ceramic one.Walnut crackerView image in fullscreenA walnut cracker is ‘quite effective if you like your walnuts smashed to smithereens’.Photograph: PictureSyndicate/Getty ImagesAnother much-hyped device taking up valuable real estate in my second drawer down is a heavy-duty walnut cracker – with studded steel “collar” to inflict maximum damage and sleek handles to complement the decor. It is quite effective if you like your walnuts smashed to smithereens.Pasta, faster: Alice Zaslavsky’s quick and easy pantry puttanesca recipeRead moreMy research into the art of cracking walnuts led to a world of pain for the unsuspecting walnut. I’ve put them through various instruments of torture that involveturning screws,leveraging adjustable jawsand evendropping a cannonballfrom a great height.In my experience, the most effective way to crack a walnut is using a table knife to pierce the soft membrane dividing the two halves, then twisting gently to open it. The walnut meat can be removed whole or in large pieces, with minimal trauma to the nut, cheeseboard and dinner guests. Sometimes the most effective kitchen gadget is the simplest.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleAustralian food and drinkGadgetsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Are the risks worth it for the chance of a thicker, fuller beard?Simon UsborneTue 25 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTShareOf all the teenage anxieties that can take root, beard growth – or the lack of it – was the one that really got to Vikram Arora. His facial hair was patchier than a drought-hit lawn and by the time he went to college he was very self-conscious. “You’d have older guys coming in with a bit of stubble and it was almost this guilty secret where I’d be thinking: ‘I wish I could have that,’” he says.It was the 90s and George Michael’s sculpted goatee was everywhere. Arora, who is 47 and lives in Essex, remembers being racked with envy as he admired Tom Ford’s designer stubble in a photo in a clothes shop. At one point, he took to stealing his sister’s mascara wand in an attempt to fill in the gaps.When Arora started a career in finance in London, facial hair wasn’t permitted in his workplace, but in the early 00s, he says, beards started to creep into the City as part of a wider outbreak of pogonophilia (love of beards). By 2010, Jason Statham, Idris Elba and David Beckham had become beard guys. At one point, three-quarters of Take That were bearded.“Beards were even more trendy and I still had these sort of patchy whiskers,” recalls Arora, who resented having to shave every day, lest his sparse coverage reveal itself. “Through most of my teens and early adulthood, I was left feeling that I didn’t look mature enough – and definitely not masculine enough.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Michael with signature sculpted goatee.Photograph: Ron Wolfson/Getty ImagesI feel as if I almost don’t need to ask Arora what triggered the decision to do something about his facial hair deficit. For millions of people, the pandemic lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 created the compelling combination of spare time and disposable income, along with the harsh mirror of endless video calls. Demand soared for a whole gallery ofaesthetic tweaksand surgical interventions.Arora had heard about beard transplants a few years earlier. As much as he longed for facial hair, he also feared what might go wrong and that he would be judged for having had surgery. Come lockdown, which also prompted a surge in bigger, fuller beards, he was researching them obsessively. “Eventually, I said: ‘I’m going in for a consultation.’”Arora ended up meeting Nadeem Khan, whose Harley Street Hair Clinic in central London has been doing hair transplants for more than 15 years. Beard procedures follow the same principle: surgeons use a needle to pull hairs, or “follicular units”, typically from thicker areas of hair at the back of the head. These grafts can then be inserted into less hairy areas of the scalp or face via tiny cuts in the skin.Khan, the clinic’s chief executive, says follicular unit extraction was initially used only for beards on victims of trauma, such as soldiers with shrapnel wounds. His clinic would have half a dozen such patients a year. But as awareness of hair transplanting grew, thanks in part to celebrities such as Wayne Rooney, who restored his hairline in 2011, interest in beard restoration started to rise, before booming in the pandemic.There are no industry stats, but Khan says inquiries from beard patients have tripled since 2020. His surgeons now do up to 100 transplants a year, 90% of which are aesthetic (the rest are fixes for scars or burns). Costs at his clinic range from £3,000 to £7,000, depending on the number of grafts. “I think there’s this new form of masculinity where the beard has become important and now every man wants to be like Gerard Butler in 300,” he says, citing the 2006 film.Arora met Khan and one of his surgeons, Greg Vida, in 2022. In early summer 2023, Vida moved 780 follicles from the back of Arora’s head and planted them in his face. Just over £5,000 poorer, he went home with slightly reddened, swollen features and waited to see the results.Arora’s fears about what could go wrong were well-placed. Rising demand for hair restoration has created a minefield for prospective and often vulnerable patients. Slick websites and social media accounts can obscure dodgy practices and sometimes scant observation of the regulations governing this type of work. Meanwhile, clinics in transplant-tourism hotspots such as Turkey have mushroomed, offering package deals that can cost a fraction of procedures in the UK.Any hair restoration clinic in England must be registered with the Care Quality Commission. (Healthcare Improvement Scotland, Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority in Northern Ireland cover the rest of the UK.) Registration includes inspections, but there is no formally recognised training, nor any law that prohibits, for example, a clinic bringing costs down by allowing one doctor to oversee multiple transplants carried out by less qualified technicians.“It’s still a wild west, this industry,” says Spencer Stevenson, a prominent mentor for balding men, who is known online as Spex. Stevenson says beard transplants are technically challenging. Head hair can be finer and softer than facial hair, requiring careful blending of hairs in thin or patchy areas to achieve a uniform look. The stakes are higher. “You can have a bad hair transplant and sometimes get away with it, but with a beard it’s a whole new kettle of fish because it’s on your face,” he says. “You can’t put a hat on it.”View image in fullscreen‘Every man wants to be like Gerard Butler in 300.’Photograph: Courtesy of Warner Bros EntEvidence of male insecurity around facial hair abounds online, where any prospective transplant patient starts his journey. Reddit’s public“beards” message boardhas 1.2 million anonymous members. Most posts feature images of fabulously bushy beards and maintenance tips, but it’s also a place where the less hirsute seek advice. In one typical post, a man with a big beard asks if he should get a transplant to fill in a gap below his lower lip. “I like my beard, but I’m always insecure about this area. I am 24,” he says. (Dozens of men tell him his beard is great already.)Some posters move on to Reddit’s HairTransplants forum, where there are frequent pictures of completed procedures. One post includes a selfie of what looks like a great beard. Its owner is worried it creeps too high up his cheeks. “Am I stuck like this for ever? Is there anything I can do to help myself?” he asks. Again, the replies are supportive. “Dude, it looks fantastic!” one man says.In a separate post, a man asks desperately about transplant reversals. It’s possible to pull out or laser bad grafting, but there is a risk of scarring. He lists dozens of problems with his surgery, including scars and poorly matched hair. “I literally don’t recognise myself any more,” he writes. “For the first time in my life I suffer from severe mental health [problems] … The stupid thing is I was always happy clean shaven. I just got greedy and tried to cheat my look.”In March last year, Mathieu Vigier Latour, a 24-year-old student from France, travelled to Istanbul for a beard transplant. For just over £1,000, he received 4,000 grafts from the back of his head. “When it started to grow out, it looked like a hedgehog; it was unmanageable,” his father, Jacques Vigier Latour, told the French broadcaster BFM TV.Stevenson says perfecting the growing angle of transplanted hairs to achieve a natural-looking pattern in a new beard requires skill. Latour’s growth was badly mapped and haphazard. His surgeon turned out to be a moonlighting estate agent.Latour took it badly. “He was suffering, he wasn’t doing well,” Latour’s father said. “He was in pain, suffered from burns, and he couldn’t sleep.” While a Belgian transplant specialist was in the process of trying to fix Latour’s beard, he developed a kind of post-traumatic shock and body dysmorphic disorder, according to his father. Three months after the botched transplant, he killed himself. “He had entered a vicious circle from which he could no longer escape,” his father said.View image in fullscreenBeard guy … Idris Elba.Photograph: Taylor Jewell/Invision/APGreg Williams, a former burns surgeon who switched to hair transplants in 2012, says surgery is often not a good option for men with a significant lack of coverage. “There’s a very high risk that a transplant won’t look natural if you’re talking about doing a full face,” says Williams, a specialist at the Farjo Hair Institute, which has branches in London and Manchester. He also warns men with alopecia against seeking a quick fix for new bare spots, given the risk that transplanted hair will also fall out.Williams is a former president of the British Association of Hair Restoration Surgery, which promotes better practice. As well as the risks involved with transplant tourism, it has warned of the rise of illicit clinics in the UK, and hard-selling agents who take commissions for procedures without offering patients a chance to meet surgeons. The specialists and experts I speak to advise prospective patients to check the credentials of a surgeon directly, seek out patient testimonies, attend face-to-face consultations, view heavy discounts with suspicion and ensure that any transplant won’t be one of several supervised on the same day.“It’s clear there is a black market and that there are untrained people who just use patients to make money,” says Özlem Biçer, a hair restoration surgeon who has been operating in Istanbul since 1998. She and her team treat only one patient a day and her prices are comparable with those of surgeons in the UK. “But the black market is a problem all over the world, not just in Turkey.”Biçer performed her first beard transplant 20 years ago, on a man with facial scarring. She, too, has noticed a rise in demand, although she works on only half a dozen or so beards a year. She agrees that beard transplants are more challenging, partly because of all the nerves in the face, and says only experienced hair-transplant surgeons should take them on, after additional training. “If you’re not aware of what you’re doing, the complications can be more aggressive,” she adds.Biçer says she has learned to gently advise vulnerable men not to go ahead. “If it’s about attractiveness or beauty, it’s OK,” she says. “But if it’s because he doesn’t feel like himself, or doesn’t feel like a man without a beard, you may not be able to make him happy.”Like Arora, Franck Fontaine, one of Biçer’s patients, wished as a teenager that he could grow a fuller beard. He says it was largely an aesthetic problem, but that ideas of masculinity were in the mix. “For me, a man who didn’t have a beard didn’t look as virile as a man with a thick one,” he tells me from Réunion, the French island in the Indian Ocean, where he works as a nursery school teacher.View image in fullscreen‘I feel much more confident now’ … Franck Fontaine before and after his beard transplant.Composite: Courtesy of Franck FontaineInitially, Fontaine, 32, felt that surgery wasn’t for him. But his father’s death in 2021 sparked something and he decided to make a change. Research led him to Biçer’s clinic; in 2022, he paid more than £5,000 to have 3,100 grafts moved from the back of his head over 12 hours. Three years later, the results, which I can see in our video call, are impressive. His full moustache is original, yet perfectly in keeping with the new hairs that now comprise his generous beard.Fontaine kept quiet about the operation and says most people assumed he had just let his facial hair bloom. “Everyone was telling me how much it suits me and asking why I hadn’t grown it before,” he says. His six-year-old daughter, Maya, is the only naysayer. “I feel much more confident now, but she still tells me to shave it off every day,” he adds, laughing.Back in London, Arora says that Vida deliberately introduced some asymmetry while placing his grafts, to avoid the forestry-plantation look that can give away a hair transplant. A few weeks after the procedure, he met some friends in a restaurant, having not told them what he had done. “I played it cool and didn’t want to say anything and they were just like: ‘What?!’” he says. “They were just staring at me, saying: ‘Bloody hell, that looks great.’ I’ll never forget that reaction. I was sitting there thinking: ‘Yeah, I pulled it off.’ One of them has always had a good beard and even he was saying: ‘Do you think I can make mine denser?’”Arora now wears his beard proudly in the office. He regrets the way insecurity can lead men to take such drastic, costly action, but he sees his own transplant as an investment. “I invested in feeling good and you can’t beat that,” he says. His wife, however, couldn’t understand the fuss. “It makes no difference to her, but she can see that I’m happy now. A beard is a small thing for some people, but it has made a really big difference to me.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They refer to their land as Munaaquestevut, or “the one who cares for us”.“We depend on the land to put food on the table, to keep our tribe healthy. We have a subsistence economy with a cash overlay,” said Emily Murray, a resident of Elim and vice-president of Norton Bay Watershed Council, a non-profit tribalorganizationfocused on regional water quality.“We’ve been doing this for generations upon generations.”Now, an intensifying global competition for critical minerals and the priorities of a new administration threaten to put their land, their fishery and their lives at risk, members of the community say.This summer, the Canadian mining company Panther Minerals is set to start exploration for a uranium mine at the headwaters of the Tubuktulik river, adjacent to Elim’s land. David Hedderly-Smith, a consultant to Panther and the owner of mining claims for the property, hassaidthe site could become the “uranium capital of America”.The people of Elim have opposed the mine since last May, when Panther Mineralsannouncedits intention to apply for exploration permits. In interviews, they said they feared for their health, and spoke of the cancer and contamination thatfolloweduranium mining on Navajo land in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.View image in fullscreenThe Elim community protested the uranium mine using the Iditarod, Alaska’s annual sled dog race.Photograph: Jasmine Jemewouk“If [the river] becomes contaminated, it will have an impact on the whole Bering Sea. That’s the way I see it,” said Johnny Jemewouk, a resident of Elim.Last summer, Elim successfully pressured the Bureau of Land Management, which manages a small portion of the claim, todenyPanther Minerals’ exploration permit on the land. In December, a regional tribal consortium passed aresolution“categorically” opposing the mine.However, Alaska’s department of natural resources (DNR), which manages most of the land, has so far refused Elim’s requests for a consultation – and brushed aside over a hundred comments from the community over plans for the mine. In October, they granted Panther Minerals a four-year exploration permit, which will allow the company to start drilling wells and taking uranium core samples this June.Elim has appealed against the permit. But with time running out, the community has gone one step further, protesting against the mine using the largest international forum available to them: the Iditarod, Alaska’s grueling annual sled dog race, which passes through their village on its way to Nome.As musher Jesse Holmes approached Elim’s checkpoint and the 1,008thmileof the race, more than 70 students and community members waited for him in the Arctic night. They held signs saying “Protect our future”, and “Keep the uranium in the ground.”It was their chance to tell the world what their way of life means to them.“I want to protect our future,” said Paige Keith, an eighth-grader from Elim. “If they go through with this, it’s going to affect our animals and our water. I want to help try to stop the mine.”‘A race for resources’As global competition for critical minerals intensifies, theTrump administrationis eyeing Alaska.An executive order issued on Trump’s first day in officecallson the US to “fully avail itself of Alaska’s vast lands and resources”. The order wasapplaudedby the state’s mining industry.‘A place to heal’: Native tribes urge Biden to protect sacred lands before leaving White HouseRead moreThe orderreverseda number of Biden-era protections for Alaskan land, opening oil and gas drilling in the Arctic national wildlife refuge andendingrestrictions on logging.Several of these reversals put the administration at cross purposes with the Native communities that subsist off Alaska’s land. For example, one of them enables plans for a mining access road in Alaska’s Brooks Range, which a tribal network hascalled“one of the biggest and most destructive” projects in the state’s history.“We’re in an age of green transition. We’re looking for other forms of energy. And, with the new administration, there is this push to mine domestically,” said Jasmine Jemewouk, an activist from Elim.“It’s a race for resources and they’re looking at Alaska.”The coming years are likely to see continued conflicts between Alaska’s powerful mining industry and Native communities – especially as the US seeks to onshore its critical mineral supply chain. And while Panther Minerals’ exploration permit is up to the state of Alaska, and not the federal government, advocates and community members said the Trump administration may further embolden Alaska’s DNR to brush aside Elim’s concerns. Alaska’s governor, Mike Dunleavy, haswelcomedTrump’s executive orders, saying: “Happy days are here again.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If it ain’t nailed down, sell it,” said Robert Keith, president of the native village of Elim.Alaska’s DNR did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Lack of consultationIn interviews with local media, Hedderly-Smith, the project’s consultant, has said the people of Elim have “been misled and they’re spreading mistruths”, regarding the dangers of the uranium mine.Robert Birmingham, Panther Minerals’ president, did not respond to queries regarding Elim’s health concerns, saying the company had yet to finalize its mining plans and could not comment.“We are positive about the uranium opportunity in Alaska, as it has been underexplored,” he wrote, and said the company would “continue outreach and the conversation with the Elim community” once its plans were finalized.Hedderly-Smith has also said the company would “like to be friends” with Elim if it develops the mine. But while Birmingham said the company had made an attempt to contact Elim in early 2024, Keith, the president of Elim, said that Panther Minerals had never come to their village or attempted to contact the community since they first applied for the permit.For Elim, the plans for the mine raise a history of state and federal failures to safeguard native communities from the harms of mining. In 2008, the community successfully rallied against another Canadian company, Triex Minerals, which had started to explore for uranium near their village. While organizing their opposition, the students of Elim researched the effects of uranium mining elsewhere in the US.They taught the community about the example of the Navajo, and the cancer risks and health problems that came after they allowed uranium mines on their land.Should a mine be built in Elim, Panther Minerals hassaidit would probably use in situ leaching to extract uranium – a technique said to be less disruptive than conventional methods to mine the material, including those used on Navajo land. Shepherd and the community, however, have said that the project’s proposed use of groundwaterthreatensto contaminate the fishery and ecosystem.Keith said the community had a reason to be cautious about government promises. Closer to home, he gave the example of Moses Point, a fishing village next to Elim which hosted a military airfield during the second world war. The military had buried or left a lot of material at the site, he said, including thousands of drums of high-octane fuel.“Most of those people where the concentrations of drums were, including my mother – the majority of them survived or died of cancer,” he said. “So we’re kind of sensitive.”Jasmine Jemewouk, the activist, added: “What they’re not realizing is that the community bears the burden. Whatever they leave behind, whatever is contaminated in the process … We’re not being consulted at all.”Her grandfather, Johnny Jemewouk, agreed. He said the time to act is now.“People, the way I see it here, they don’t realize what the future holds for them once they start getting sick. Either they start getting sick, or the food they can’t eat, or the water they can’t play in,” he said.“When that starts taking effect, they’ll want to say, ‘let’s do something.’ But that’s too late.”Explore more on these topicsAlaskaTrump administrationDonald TrumpMining (Environment)Mining (Business)US politicsIndigenous peoplesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My parents would open the door in the morning and say, “come back for meals.” I would disappear into the forest and wetlands. I loved the constant stories around me that I didn’t understand: the stories of animals.When I was about seven there was a litter of kittens in the house, and a board crushed one of the kittens. The vet examined her mouth and said, “she’s not going to make it”, and minutes later she died in his hands. I couldn’t understand how he knew that – I wanted that superpower to understand animals, and that is why I wanted to become a vet. I got a degree and have been working as an environmental health scientist for more than 25 years.In 2017, because of concerns about antibiotic resistance in humans, theUS government changed the rules, which meant beekeepers could no longer buy the drugs over the counter. So they needed a veterinarian to prescribe them, and that’s why I decided to create a veterinary practice for bees.View image in fullscreenElizabeth Hilborn checking hives in Orange county, North CarolinaPhotograph: Kate MedleyThis may make me unique in the US – I don’t know anyone else who is just a bee vet. I’ve been growing fruit my whole life, and I wanted to support bees and the people that keep them. I work evenings, weekends and holidays around my day job. I love pollinators; it is such a pleasure and privilege to work with them, so it doesn’t seem like work.I have clients who have worked with bees for a long time. They say: “I’m seeing brown larvae, it doesn’t smell right, can you come look?” I suit up and I look at their healthy hives first – I’m examining the whole area, looking at bees coming and going, getting a sense of how they look. Then we go to the ones we suspect to be diseased. To avoid stings, I go in there quietly and respectfully, and that makes the bees comfortable. A common disease is European foulbrood. You can often smell it – it’s almost sweet and musky.View image in fullscreenHilborn with her hive checklistPhotograph: Kate MedleyOnce I’ve settled on a diagnosis, I give them something which is like a prescription – the beekeepers get the antibiotics and mix it with powdered sugar, which the bees eat.We’ve had terrible weather here. If bees are struggling to find food that can put them at risk of disease. European foulbrood kills the babies. The queen survives, but over weeks or months the colony fails.Thejetstream is much less stablethan it used to be. For example, last February was really warm, and wild bees were coming out of hibernation and there was nothing there for them to eat. This is one of the leading risks to bee health – this mismatch in timing. They need access to flowers, but the flowers are not out. This is a huge stressor on animal populations in general.View image in fullscreenChecking on the health of a hive. Honeybees are protected in their hives in a way that wild bees aren’t, which Hilborn says is a worryPhotograph: Kate MedleyMy first approach to learning this profession was books, but books can only take you so far. I started hanging out with beekeepers and apiarists and then I joined my local bee club.‘Unique and important’: Tongue-biting louse is wonderfully gruesomeRead moreHoneybees are protected from some environmental pressures because we house them, we feed them, we care for them. It is the wild bees I’m extremely worried about: they don’t have anyone to care for them – they depend on how well the environment is supporting them. I’m concerned about the erratic weather; we have some trends which make it very difficult for honeybees and wild bees.I feel like every bee is so precious now, especially early in the year. That is often when the wild bee queens are outand may be distressed. And by saving her, that can save a whole colony. So there’s a lot resting on that one bee: if I can help her, I will.As told to Phoebe WestonBetween 24 March and 2 April, we will be profiling a shortlist of 10 of the invertebrates chosen by readers and selected by our wildlife writers from more than 2,500 nominations.

Curious visitors often wander through the church doors, attracted by its gothic exterior, and instinctively start to whisper.The space on Colorado Boulevard – a busy thoroughfare that doubles as part of the Rose Parade route every New Year’s Day – has always felt holy, said the Rev Amy Aitken, the pastor. Now she wants it to feel like a safe space for two other religious groups that are sharing the facilities for worship: the Islamic Center of SouthernCaliforniaand the Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center.Conflicts in faraway lands and ideological differences make these three religious groups unlikely cohabitants in a shared space, but here the groups form a microcosm of peaceful coexistence united by tragedy. In January, the Pasadena synagogue burned down in the Eaton fire leaving its Jewish congregation in need of a place to grieve and worship.‘That was my home’: faith communities without worship spaces after LA firesRead moreThe Methodist church, already a host to Islamic Center members as a satellite worship location, welcomed the Jewish congregation.“We are trying to cultivate an ‘island of grace’ in the midst of differences that we are told should divide us,” said Aitken.Under this arrangement, all three Abrahamic faiths are worshiping under one roof at 500 East Colorado Boulevard.“I can’t think of another church that can say the same,” said Aitken.‘You won’t feel good if your neighbor is suffering’Midday on a Friday in February, Islamic Center members lay out prayer rugs in the church’s Fellowship Hall for their weekly Jumma service, a communal prayer session.“Friday is our religious day,” said Roohi Siddiqi, who has been attending Jumma services here for two years.For her, it’s a weekly chance for spiritual renewal.View image in fullscreenThe Islamic Center of Southern California in Los Angeles, on 10 April 2023.Photograph: Myung J Chun/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesThe service lasts just an hour, and the Islamic Center’s mosque and cultural center is more than 13 miles away inLos Angeles. This satellite location in Pasadena provides a convenient site for local members to worship, said Omar Ricci, an Islamic Center spokesperson.It’s an interfaith partnership forged out of Steelers Nation.In 2017, Dr Rizwan Bhatti, an ophthalmologist and former board member of the Islamic Center, connected with a patient – a former Methodist church pastor – through their mutual interest in the Pittsburgh Steelers. Bhatti was helping in the search for a satellite location for the center’s weekly prayer service. The church’s meeting room was available. That summer, the first Jumma prayer service was held at the Methodist church.The church is not just a space of worship, said Bhatti. It’s a place of connection between interfaith partners.Now, there is a third partner.“It’s just a great blessing for the entire community that people with different faiths are able to come together and help each other in difficult times,” said Bhatti.The arrangement reminds Ricci of a quote by the Irish writer Sebastian Barry: “There is seldom a difficulty with religion where there is friendship.”Yes, there are differences in belief systems in what’s happening betweenPalestine and Israel, said Ricci. “It doesn’t override the loving demeanor that I think we should be dealing with each other.”On this day, the Islamic Center’s Khutbah, or lecture, focused on unity – both within their community and now with the new Jewish group that share the same space, but at different times.After the Jumma service, Dr Syeda Ali, a kidney specialist, said the message resonated.“No matter how you reach out to your creator, we all have a common goal of doing the best for the community,” said Ali. “We want our families to be good. We want our community to be good. You won’t feel good if your neighbor is suffering.”‘We are people that play well with others’The church’s campus – with its meeting rooms, sanctuary, chapel and a restaurant-grade kitchen – is a place of God, said the Rev Mina Nau-Mahe, an associate pastor. “And so, if it is a space of God, then it needs to be open to all people.”Now the campus is full, which calls for a lot of coordination between the groups – and a lot of grace, said Aisha Williams, the facilities manager. This also applies to church members, who are accustomed to having the entire campus to themselves.The Methodist congregation was overjoyed when they learned that the Jewish Temple congregants were worshipping on the same campus, said Aitken. “We are people that play well with others.”View image in fullscreenInterfaith partners Aisha Williams, Rev Mina Nau-Mahe and Dr Rizwan Bhatti.Photograph: Lynda Lin GrigsbyFridays are especially busy. Jumma services take place at midday. In the evening, the campus buzzes with Shabbat services. On Saturday mornings, the Jewish temple holds its service in the sanctuary, a cavernous room with fan vault ceilings where the cantor’s voice soars. Kids giggle in the pews while parents have personal moments of prayer.Then on Sunday mornings, the home team takes the space.“I think that this has been such a great reminder that all faith communities have the same goal. It is to support and make ourselves better humans, so that we can make the world just a little bit better together,” said Melissa Levy, Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center (PJTC) executive director.Where do you see God in all this?The Jewish temple held services the same week the synagogue burned down. They needed to nourish their beleaguered community. More than 70 of their families were affected by the Eaton fire, including Heather Sandoval Feng, a high school principal, whose Altadena home burned down.After two months, Sandoval Feng has settled into the phase she describes as the “temporary permanent” – the quiet space after the disaster that allows the mind to reckon with the loss and the unexpected beauty of finding a new interfaith community.Her daughter Hannah Sandoval, 13, had been preparing for her batmitzvah before the fire took their family home and synagogue. The Methodist church offered its space for the rite of passage. A month after the fire, Hannah ceremoniously read from the Torah scroll – which weresavedfrom the ravages of the blaze – in front of the congregation and a stained-glass window depicting the transfiguration of Christ.View image in fullscreenRemnants at Heather Feng-Sandoval’s home.Photograph: Lynda Lin Grigsby“I couldn’t think of a better place,” said Sandoval Feng. It was the first batmitzvah for the church and the interfaith family – Hannah’s dad, Oscar Sandoval, is Catholic. For months now, their family has been returning to the site of their home to pick through remnants. A broken mug emblazoned with the Star of David here. Charred Hanukah decorations there.Kids at Sandoval Feng’s school often ask:where do you see God in all this?Her answer: God is the community in action.During Ramadan this month, a holy time for Muslims to fast, pray and reflect, members of the Islamic Center gather at the church on Tuesday nights to break their fast together. Church members have previously joined them.Interfaith outreach between all the groups will happen in time, said Aitken. For now, she’s giving the Jewish congregation grace and space to settle in.“It’s a big deal for them to be worshiping in a Christian space,” said Aitken about PJTC. “And it’s enough.”The arrangement is an opportunity to practice compassion.“I don’t know how to change things on the global macro level,” she said. “But on this corner, I can try to create a kind of community and a house of worship that God would recognize.”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaLos AngelesReligionWest CoastUS wildfiresWildfiresfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The pungent odour wafts into passing vehicles, persisting long after they have left theCaribbeanisland’s coves, where the ocean has deposited masses of the seaweed, which turns red then black as it rots.Many residents of Soubise, one of the areas worst affected, say they have learned to live with the problem, which has plagued the island, and others like it, for years. Last week scientists in Florida said they thought they hadidentified a weather phenomenon in 2009 as the “tipping point”of the problem, which they said is caused by shifting winds churning up the ocean and bringing deepwater nutrient concentrations to the surface.Every day, Lindon Marast, 30, feels the ill effects of the sargassum invasion when he goes out to fish. “It gets caught in the boat’s propeller,” he says. “Then we can’t pass through the water because it stops the propeller from accelerating.”View image in fullscreenLindon Marast says the seaweed clogs the engine of his boatBut now Grenada’s government says it has found a way to turn the curse of sargassum into a blessing. It isworking with the European Unionand is looking for companies that could partner them in creating a multibillion-dollar market for the Caribbean.The aim is to rebrand the seaweed as a revolutionary solution to the climate crisis that could power homes and businesses with clean energy and boost agricultural yields.“We have had to deal with this problem for quite some years now,” says Emmalin Pierre, a local MP and leader of the opposition New National party. “It has been a major problem for not just the fishermen in the area but also residents.“The fishermen will tell you it’s challenging to even access their boats when it’s really bad. You also have the issue of the scent, which sometimes becomes unbearable even for passersby.”Soubise’s residents, who are facing severe coastal erosion as well as the invasion of the sargassum, have also expressed concerns about the effects of methane and other gases emitted by the weed, which they say cause skin rashes, tarnish jewellery and damage household appliances and boats.View image in fullscreenThe fishing village of Soubise, where some say the rotting seaweed causes skin rashesThe sargassum issue has blighted the island for more than a decade, but now UK-based aquaculture business Seafields has created a water-based farm to catch the sargassum before it reaches land, preventing it from rotting and releasing methane.Seafields claim its solution could save Caribbean governments and hotels hundreds of thousands of dollars in sargassum removal and support a lucrative market in bioplastic and similar materials.As well as its use in creating bioplastics, sargassum can be used as a fuel and as crop fertiliser. It is much cheaper to farm than most other seaweed, says John Auckland, founder and chief executive of Seafields. Unlike other macroalgae, it does not have a complicated reproductive cycle that requires hatcheries and lots of space, money and infrastructure to farm. This makes sargassum a valuable resource for the Caribbean.Used as a fertiliser, he says: “It stimulates crop growth by about 10% to 14% and can significantly increase yields for farmers.Some people say you get accustomed to the smell, but you can never get accustomed to itMark Nedd“It has slightly different applications than traditional bio-stimulants. So it’s a potential $200bn [£150bn] export market – and the Caribbean has the best product for it.”Some hotels inGrenadaare already using sargassum as a clean energy source. Benjamin Nestorovic and Renatta Fielden, from the Grenada-based bioenergy company SarGas, have proved the technology works and have installed a biodigester, which uses micro-organisms to break down the seaweedinto biogas and fertiliser, to fuel the ovens at the True Blue Bay Resort’s House of Chocolate bakery in St George’s.“You can eat chocolate with a good conscience,” Nestorovic says. “Our process produces clean energy and digestate – a valuable organic fertiliser – giving us two products in one.”View image in fullscreenBenjamin Mestorovic and Renatta Fielden.

We are providing a reliable, cost-effective and sustainable alternative,” Nestorovic says, adding that the company plans to expand across the Caribbean.View image in fullscreenAs well as fertiliser and biofuel, sargassum seaweed can also be turned into bioplasticGrenada’s prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, held a conference last year to explore innovations around sargassum weed. Speaking at the event, he said: “We believe that we have a unique opportunity in Grenada and in the Caribbean basin to turn the tide on what is viewed as a problem into a solution – and into a solution that can have ripple effects to all of the stakeholders that it has thus far negatively impacted.”Mitchell set up a taskforce to work with the EU, and has promised to collect10,000 tons of sargassum by 2026. Last month, he told the Guardian that he had launched an expression of interest process for companies to propose projects to make his goal a reality.Meanwhile, farmers and fishers on the island have already discovered positive uses for the weed. “Sometimes it comes in with a lot of fish like mahi-mahi,” says Mark Nedd, 30, who started fishing at 14 and has grown up battling the sargassum invasion. Farmers, he says, collect it to use as fertiliser.Hotels and the rest of the tourism industry are equally keen to find a way to deal with this persistent threat. Kirl Grant-Hoschtialek, chief operations officer of the Grenada Tourism Authority, describes the painstaking process of removing the weed from beaches.Paradise lost? How cruise companies are ‘eating up’ the BahamasRead moreTeams of people, she says, work from one end of a beach to the other to remove the weed by hand because heavy machinery is likely to deplete the sand and organisms within it, worsening coastal damage.“Our beaches are our pride and joy,” she says. “Some have received accolades year after year. So we are very proactive when it comes to protecting them.”For those who live in Soubise, such as Nedd, any effort to tackle the weed cannot come soon enough. “If you pass here in a vehicle, the vehicle will automatically take that scent and carry it for a good way,” he says.“Some people say you get accustomed to the smell, but you can never get accustomed to it.”Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansGrenadaCaribbeanOceansMarine lifePlantsAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But I had to make art,” says Htein Lin from his home in Myanmar’s Shan state. “I befriended the prison guards to smuggle in paint, scavenging for materials wherever I could.“The prison uniform became my canvas, the wheel of a lighter my ruler, as I repurposed everyday objects as my tools.”Even after his release, he continued improvising with different techniques.View image in fullscreenA self-portrait, painted in 2000 with syringes, bowls and his fingers in the absence of brushes.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistHtein Lin’s first full retrospective, Escape, at Birmingham’sIkon Gallery, centres on a series of prison paintings, 000235, named after the number assigned to him by the International Committee of the Red Cross during his incarceration in Myanmar from 1998 to 2004.The exhibition spans the period before his imprisonment, for allegedly plotting opposition protests, through more than six years in jail, seven years in the UK and his life back in Myanmar since then.His most recent work includes textile paintings, monoprints, video and performance, while an offsite display at Grendon prison in Buckinghamshire was formed from his collaborations with inmates at the UK prison and its artist-in-residence,Simon Harris.View image in fullscreenSitting at Iron Gate from 2002, which reflects on the artist’s feelings of isolation in prison.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistOne of the standout pieces in the 000235 series at the Ikon is Sitting at Iron Gate (2002), which features interlocking limbs and swirling patterns, symbolising “the confined and restricted nature of prison life”.He describes how he and fellow inmates, often in solitary confinement or small cells, would sit near the prison’s iron gate in the evenings, communicating with each other through songs, poetry and storytelling. “It became our secret to survival,” he says.Several self-portraits, painted by the artist using only his fingers, are also on display, along with Biology ofArt(1999), which was created using the tops of toothpaste tubes, medical bottles and pill packets.View image in fullscreenBiology of Art. Htein Lin’s 1999 depiction of human anatomy was created with the tops of toothpaste tubes, medical bottles and pill packets.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistA series of plaster casts of the hands of former political prisoners, called A Show of Hands, was influenced by the artist’s experience of recovering from a broken arm after a cycling accident.“Our society was broken, and political prisoners became its strength – like a plaster cast holding fractured bones together,” Htein Lin says.Every brushstroke was a risk. But I knew my art had to reflect what was happening in my country“It took about half an hour to cast each hand – time in which they recounted their experiences in prison and the story of their sacrifice – I’ve done this for nearly 500 political prisoners.”Thousands of protesters were arrested during the 1988 pro-democracy uprising and the years that followed. The number ofprisoners surged again after the 2021 coup, in which the military seized power from Aung San Suu Kyi’s democratically elected government; more than 28,000 people have reportedly been arrested since the takeover and thousands are still imprisoned, including Aung San Suu Kyi herself.Born in 1966 in Ingapu, south-west Myanmar, Htein Lin was involved in the 1988 pro-democracy student movement leading to his arrest. He was then given a seven-year prison sentence.View image in fullscreenA former political prisoner from Myanmar has a cast made of his hand.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistView image in fullscreenThe work A Show of Hands allowed former prisoners to share their memories of detention and honours their sacrifices.Photograph: David Rowan/Ikon GalleryOne of his lowest points came in Mandalay jail, where he was held from 1998 to 2000. “They handcuffed me, blindfolded me, and took me out of the cell,” he recalls.“I couldn’t see who was beating me, but they lined us up and we had to walk between two rows of guards who struck us from both sides.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 230 paintings survive, with many now held at theInternational Institute of Social Historyin Amsterdam.The 58-year-old artist is unable to attend his solo show in Birmingham because he cannot get a passport. In 2022, he and his wife, Vicky Bowman – Britain’s ambassador to Myanmar from 2002 to 2006 – weresentenced to a year in prison by the military juntafor allegedly failing to register their new address, although they suspect the real motivation was Bowman’s work on corporate transparency.It’s not that the world misunderstands Myanmar – it’s that the world doesn’t pay attentionThough they were released after three months, Bowman was then deported. Htein Lin has had to remain in Myanmar as the authorities refuse to renew his passport. The couple have been separated for two years.“After my release in 2004, I never thought I’d end up in prison again,” he says, “but history repeats itself.”Reflecting onthe escalating situation in Myanmar, Htein Lin notes that the conflict is far more intense than previous uprisings.“Most of my work is reacting to, and reflecting on, what is happening,” he says about his 2024 painting Fiery Hell, inspired by the devastation wreaked by the civil war. Htein Lin believes the world largely ignores the crisis.“It’s not that the world misunderstands Myanmar – it’s that the world doesn’t pay attention.”View image in fullscreenThe 2022 video work When I was a Lousy Millionaire starts with an account of head lice in his village and draws a parallel to his body lice while detained.

Astudyby Rio’s Centre for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship (CESeC) found that residents of conflict-ridden areas are more likely to develop high blood pressure, chronic insomnia, depression and anxiety disorders.The burden is even heavier on people with autism, who are more prone tohypersensitivity to loud noises.“In 2020, during the pandemic,there was an operation herewhere the gunfire was so heavy that a nine-year-old autistic boy jumped out of a window because of the noise. Fortunately, he wasn’t hurt,” said De França, who is among the 54,000 people living in the 13 favelas of the Alemão complex, a population larger than 88% of Brazilian cities.Heitor, who has Autism Spectrum Disorder and lives in the Rocinha favela in Rio de Janeiro, and Mary, who has Autism Spectrum Disorder and lives in the Morro dos Macacos favela in Rio de JaneiroHeitor, who lives in the Rocinha favela in Rio de Janeiro, and Mary, who lives in the Morro dos Macacos favela in Rio de Janeiro, both of whom have autism spectrum disorder.After speaking with dozens of other mothers of autistic children in the community, she realised that their children’s suffering during shootouts was a shared struggle, so in 2022, she founded the Star of Maria Stimulation Centre to support neurodiverse families in favelas.Their husbands and sons were killed by the police. But Brazil’s grieving mothers are banding togetherRead moreThe group hasdistributed 500 earmuffsto families with autistic children, and during police raids, its headquarters in the Alemão favela becomes a safe haven where parents and children can seek refuge.“Hearing these mothers’ stories shook me,” said sociologist Julita Lemgruber, who coordinates CESeC and is one of Brazil’s leading public security researchers. “The shootouts’ toll on autistic children is yet another consequence of the country’s drug policies, which not only cause suffering, pain and death but also have an enormous economic cost to society,” she added.A 2023 CESeCstudy of seven Brazilian states– including the two wealthiest and most populous, Rio and São Paulo – found that they spent R$7.7bn (£1.03bn) on the so-called “war on drugs”. This sum includes judicial costs for prosecuting drug-related cases and expenses for incarcerating those convicted, for example.View image in fullscreenA member of the Brazilian military police frisks a suspect during an operation in the Morro do Banco favela in Rio de Janeiro in January 2022.Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty ImagesWith the same amount, 954 new schools could have been built or 396 public healthcare centres maintained across those states.“Supporters of drug prohibition often claim they do so to protect families and make society safer, but we know that the ‘war on drugs’ hasn’t reduced consumption or protected people,” said Lemgruber, who in the 1990s served as the director of Rio’s prison system and as the police ombudsman.“Security forces aren’t going after the major drug traffickers. Instead, they’re using brutal force in areas where only street-level drug dealing takes place – poor communities where most of the population is Black,” she said.View image in fullscreenÂngela, who has autism spectrum disorder and lives in the Chapadão favela complex in Rio.Photograph: c/o Star of Maria Stimulation CentreOn Wednesday, Brazil’s supreme court will resume hearing a case aimed at reducing the number of deaths caused by police during operations in favelas.After a 2020 court ruling set rules for police operations – such as the mandatory use of body cameras and the presence of ambulances – thedeath rate fell by more than half. But Rio’s state government and city hall are trying to overturn the ruling, arguing thatit is “limiting” police operations.Psychologist and physiotherapist Monica Cirne Albuquerque, 57, runs a physiotherapy centre in Alemão and describes her work as “dealing with what’s left after violence.“People in the favelas live in constant agony … a daily reality of uncertainty and fear,” she said.During the 15-hour police raid in January, Albuquerque spent the timing making video calls to comfort patients. “One mother spent hours under the bed with her child … because it was the only place in the house where they could take cover from the bullets,” she said.Enzo, who has Autism Spectrum Disorder and lives in the Alemão favela complex in Rio de Janeiro.

Could the wisdom of wildlife be the next frontier in medicine?Patrick BarkhamTue 25 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 11.33 EDTShareIn Mexico City, house sparrows and house finches are picking up cigarette butts and weaving individual fibres into the lining of their nests. When researchers first discovered the butts – while studying what plastics end up in nests – they assumed it was simply a fluffy material being used as insulation. But through a series of ingenious tests, they discovered that the butts were actually medicinal: the birds actively collected them because the toxin nicotine reduces mites and other blood-sucking parasites. The birds are treating themselves – and their offspring.It’s one of many fascinating examples of animals medicating themselves revealed inDoctors By Nature, a new book by the US-based Dutch academic Jaap de Roode. Apes deliberately swallow leaves to dislodge intestinal worms. Caterpillars switch diets to repel parasitic flies. Bees incorporate sticky resins in their homes to combat disease.View image in fullscreenJaap de Roode with his dog Tukkie.Photograph: Herbert KuperOur medicinal skills were once considered a key difference between humans and other animals. “In western society, we love being unique,” says De Roode, speaking from his home in Atlanta, Georgia, where he is professor of biology at Emory University. “We come up with all sorts of characteristics – it’s tools, it’s walking upright, it’s big brains, it’s language, it’s culture, it’s medicine. And all of those things we debunk, one after another – and discover that we’re just another animal. I’m cool with that. I think what makes us unique is the wish to be unique.”In fact, as De Roode points out, our knowledge of medicine probably began as mimicry – by observing and copying animal teachers. And today, a greater understanding of how other animals use natural medicines may in turn help us to find new cures for human diseases, as well as keep our livestock healthier and more productive.The sparrows and finches in Mexico City are De Roode’s favourite example because they have adapted so quickly to a human environment. “Instead of collecting plants like a lot of wild birds, finches and sparrows found a shortcut and went for the cigarette butts littered around their nests, and it keeps these bloodsuckers like lice and ticks away. It’s an example of the birds helping their chicks rather than themselves.”De Roode began his studies by making a similar discovery inmonarch butterflies. These large orange butterflies are famed for their epic migrations between Mexico and northern America, but they are afflicted by a single-celled parasite called ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE). Millions of black parasitic spores form on their skin, causing weight loss and dehydration. Many afflicted butterflies die on their migrations.View image in fullscreenProtective diet … a monarch butterfly taking nectar from tropical milkweed.Photograph: Sue Zellers/Getty ImagesThrough a series of experiments, De Roode discovered that monarch caterpillars eat a toxic class of chemicals called cardenolides in the plant milkweed. The variety of tropical milkweed has more cardenolides than its sister plant swamp milkweed, and tests found that 20% fewer of the caterpillars that ate tropical milkweed became infected with OE. Further studies revealed that female butterflies infected with OE laid more eggs on the medicinal tropical milkweed than on the non-medicinal plants. De Roode believes that they are trying to protect their children by doing so.“When you think about how evolution and natural selection works, there’s so many things that parents do for their offspring – maybe it’s not that strange,” says De Roode. As he writes in the book: “Animals with brains smaller than a pinhead can be just as good at medicating as those with brains like our own.”All medicine begins with plants and fungi. Most plants can’t move, and so need to produce chemicals that will defend them from attack. Cocaine, for instance, is a substance deployed by coca plants to repel hungry insects by messing up their nervous systems and causing tremors and death. “Plants and fungi provide a vast pharmacy that humans and other animals can use to find drugs to battle their parasites and pathogens,” writes De Roode.One of the first known human medics wasÖtzi the Iceman, whose 5,300-year-old body was discovered in the Alps in 1991. His gut contained the eggs of a parasitic worm, and he carried two cork-shaped fruiting bodies of thebirch polypore fungus, well known to have antibiotic and laxative effects, suggesting that the neolithic man was treating his infection. Since then, it’s been discovered that Neanderthals were using medicine 50,000 years ago.View image in fullscreenÖtzi the Iceman.Photograph: Gianni Giansanti/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesThe early humans may have made their medicinal discoveries by following the examples of other animals. The modern scientific field of animal medication began in the 1980s when the primatologist Michael A Huffman and Mohamedi Seifu Kalunde, a Tanzania national parks ranger, observed a chimpanzee, Chausiku, fall ill. Chausiku stopped at a shrub Huffman had not seen the chimps feed on before and chewed on the pith of a branch. Kalunde told Huffman that the local people used the leaves of the plant, bitter leaf, as a traditional medicine treating stomach upsets, diarrhoea and intestinal parasites.They kept following Chausiku, who built herself a nest and rested. The day after she ate bitter leaf, to their amazement, she got up and was leaping about with her daughter again. Huffman took plant samples back to his university and found they contained a class of chemicals known for their medicinal value against parasitic worms, bacteria and even cancerous tumours.Huffman’s further studies of other individual chimps proved beyond doubt that they were using this plant – and others – deliberately for medicine. As scientists such as Michael Singer, a professor of environmental studies at Wesleyan University, point out, one of the definitions of medicine is that it comes with a cost: drugs have side-effects, and this bitter leaf was unpleasant to take. Since then, primatologists have found that 25 different wild primate species across 26 countries use plants with well-described medicinal properties.Domesticated animals are still smart enough to possess what scientists call “nutritional wisdom”: they listen to their gut. Worm-infested livestock seek out tannin-rich shrubs, which, when eaten, can kill worms. In another revealing experiment, two groups of calves were given different foods. One was given a ready-mixed portion of grains and hay. The other was allowed to choose from a buffet of the same foods. The buffet calves actually ate less but gained just as much weight as the calves given a ready-mixed ration. So the cost of producing a kilo of beef fell by 20% when animals were given a choice. In the wild, free-ranging ruminants may eat up to 50 plant species a day. It’s not hard to see the health (and productivity) benefits if livestock are given more naturalistic management – in cows’ cases, a more varied diet and, ideally, outdoor grazing in plant-rich pastures with hedges, rather than grass monocultures. For instance, the organic farmer Rosamund Young has noticed that, if sick, herfree-ranging cowsseek out willow bark or buds, a source of salicylic acid, a chemical compound altered by chemists to produce aspirin.De Roode finds similar lessons with honeybees, which seem increasingly afflicted by deadly mites and other pathogens. Bees use propolis – a glue-like substance they collect from plants – to stick things together, smooth surfaces and fill up crevices. Beekeepers have, over time, selected bees that don’t produce as much propolis, as it is so sticky it becomes a nuisance for them. However, this was a bad move.View image in fullscreenBeehives made of rough wood encourage the bees to produce propolis.Photograph: Oliver Rossi/Getty ImagesHumans have used propolis as a medicine for thousands of years (most recentlyagainst HIV) and, unsurprisingly, it is deployed by bee colonies to protect themselves from pathogens. Experiments byMarla Spivak at the University of Minnesota and Michael Simone-Finstromfound that bee colonies infected by a fungus dispatched more bees to collect propolis for their hives. When hives were afflicted bychalkbrood, a disease that affects honeybee larvae, the adult bees incorporated more of this medicinal resin in their nests.Modern hives with smooth wooden interiors have discouraged the production of propolis, but De Roode explains how simple experimental tweaks in hive design in the US are encouraging honeybees to produce more of it again. Using rough wood instead of smooth, and adding internal grooves to the wood, encourages bees to produce more propolis, leading to bigger, healthier colonies.“Humans have used propolis for so long as a health supplement but didn’t make the link that maybe it helps bees. That stems from the idea that we’re the only ones who know medicine,” says De Roode.Alcohol consumption abundant in the natural world, study findsRead moreHe hopes his book will challenge that mistaken sense of superiority. It’s also a powerful message to halt the extinction crisis. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a research group is following chimps and bonobos and extracting chemicals from the plants they use. “We need all sorts of creative ways to find new drugs, especially with all the antibiotic resistance,” says De Roode.Destroying biodiversity means losing not only plants and fungi with valuable future medicinal uses, but also losing our teachers. “For every lost plant species, we lose another potential drug for infectious disease or cancer. For every lost animal, we lose another potential pharmacist or doctor,” De Roode says. “You can protect nature because you think it’s the right thing to do. Or you can do it because it also helps us, and those things come together.”Doctors by Nature – How Ants, Apes and Other Animals Heal Themselves by Jaap de Roode is published by Princeton University Press (£22).

Could he also have somehow sensed the moment of his father’s death?His dad was “Chairman” Fred Hampton,leader of the Illinois chapter and deputy chairman of the national Black Panther Party, who was sleeping beside his pregnant fiancee when 14 Chicago police officers burst into the apartment. They shot him in bed, striking him twice in the head. Hampton, who was 21, was killed on the spot.The attack – up to99 incoming gunshotsand only one fired by the Panthers from inside – also claimed the life of Panther Mark Clark in what later emerged was a meticulously planned, FBI-backed operation.Twenty-five days later, on 29 December 1969, Akua Njeri (then Deborah Johnson), gave birth to a baby boy. From that moment on, the child’s life was to be defined by the father whom he never met.25:54Watch now25:54The Black Panther CubsWhen the revolution doesn't comeThey are the children of the Black Panther party – the self-styled\n\t\t\t\tPanther cubs. Born into the 1970s revolutionary movement for Black\n\t\t\t\tequality and self-determination, they have lived in the shadows of a\n\t\t\t\tpromised land that was never attained. We join them as they continue to\n\t\t\t\twrestle, 50 years later, with the dichotomy of their extraordinary\n\t\t\t\tchildhoods: the enormous pride and love it gave them as members of the\n\t\t\t\tBlack Panther family, and the booming loss they endured – of parents, of\n\t\t\t\tsecurity, and of the hope for radical change that did not materialise.\n\t\t\t\tThat hope lives on in the cubs, and their reflections on America’s\n\t\t\t\tcurrent crisis offers burning lessons for todayDirector: Aurora BrachmanProducer: LaTajh Simmons-WeaverOriginal Journalism: Ed PilkingtonExecutive Producer: Ekaterina OchagaviaHead of Documentaries: Lindsay PoultonEditorial Creative Director: Chris ClarkeGraphic Design: Harry FischerMotion Graphics: Alex PurcellNow 55, Fred Hampton Jr self-identifies as “chairman” in his own right. Not of the Black Panther Party, but of the Panther cubs – the children of the movement. As he put it: “I am a Black Panther cub by birth, as well as by battle.”The Guardian has talked to nine Panther cubs across the US over the past two years. All have shared intimate stories about their exceptional childhoods, born to parents who challenged America’s white establishment in a bid for what they saw as Black self-determination. They talked about being witness to a seminal period of Black history, from the late 1960s onwards. And they also articulated a painful truth: that radical change does not come for free. It commands a price that so often is paid by the children of the revolution.Hampton Jr has a particularly poignant way of encapsulating the emotional roller-coaster of his 55 years on Earth. “This is a blessing and a burden,” he said. “There is heat that comes with this. I don’t regret it. I’m not crying the blues.”Over many hours of interviews in Oakland, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington DC, New York and Philadelphia, the cubs traced the arc of their lives – a journey that can be sketched out in six distinct stages. It begins with Black pride.PrideView image in fullscreenChairman Fred Hampton Jr outside his father’s childhood home in Maywood, Illinois.Photograph: Christian K Lee/The Guardian‘Don’t you ever be ashamed of what you are / It’s ya Panther power that makes you a star’Tupac Shakur, rapper and son of New York Panther Afeni ShakurFor a child of the revolution like Ericka Abram, 55,a Panther education began before the age of two.From infancy, she lived in dormitories for Panther kids set up in big creaky old houses in Oakland and Berkeley. There were three separate dorms, divided by age: toddlers to six years, six to 10, and a teenage dormitory up to 16. Girls slept in bunk beds in one room, boys in another. Apart from sleeping arrangements, life was entirely communal – even to the point of sharing clothes.Both Ericka’s parents were on the party’s central committee – her mother, Elaine Brown, went on to become the only woman to lead the party; her father, Raymond “Masai” Hewitt, was minister of education in charge of weapons training and political teaching.Abram calls her parents 24-hour Panthers. “The revolution never stopped,” she said. “I saw my mother maybe on weekends.”The Black Panther Party had been founded in October 1966 by two Oakland, California students, Huey P Newton and Bobby Seale. It emerged at a volatile moment for America: anti-Vietnam war protests were erupting, feminist and gay liberation movements were proliferating, and Black communities were reeling from an epidemic of police killings of young African American men.As its original name indicated, the Black Panther Party for Self Defense began as a response to police brutality. The Panthers’ first venture was CopWatch – patrols of party members who recorded and disrupted violent police actions on the streets. They went fully armed, in a challenge both to law enforcement and to the non-violent ethos of the civil rights movement.From those early roots, more than 40 chapters of the Black Panther Party sprung up across the US, with international outposts in the UK, north Africa, Australia and India. The scattered branches were united by the Black Panther newspaper, which at its peak sold 140,000 copies a week, and by a common commitment to community “survival programs”. They provided free school breakfasts, medical treatment for uninsured patients, legal services for those in trouble, and prison transport for families visiting incarcerated loved ones.The party was eventually to fall apart in 1982, ground down by the relentless hounding of the FBI and J Edgar Hoover’s Cointelpro program – the covert surveillance used to infiltrate, disrupt and destroy a range of Black power groups and other radical movements deemed subversive. But by then, its young leaders had inspired a new conversation around politics and community.And they had conceived something else: children.View image in fullscreenPanther cub Sala Cyril holding a photograph of herself and her sister sitting on the lap of their mother, Janet Cyril.Photograph: Ashley Peña/The GuardianAs the number of Panther cubs ticked up, thoughts turned to how to care for them – both for the sake of the children themselves, and to free up their parents for the struggle. A radical Black approach to education became a pillar of the Black Panthers’ world view.Every morning, Abram and her peers would be bussed in a beat-up Volkswagen van to their school. Opened in 1973, the Oakland community school supported 150 kids at its height.It was led by Ericka Huggins, a Panther leader whose fellow Panther husband, John Huggins, was assassinated on the campus of UCLA in 1969 in a feud with a rival Black organization. Ericka Huggins herself was arrested on suspicion of murdering an informant, and imprisoned for two years in Connecticut, where she had founded a Panther chapter. She was acquitted at trial and released in 1971.On her return to the west coast, she turned her energy to creating a new school. Her aim was to forge a model of Black education that would put to shame the often abysmal learning Black kids received in poorly resourced and low-performing public schools.The school was constituted as a private institution, with costs covered from party fundraising and the donations of rich supporters and open to all regardless of income. Its private nature freed it from constraints on how it selected and taught its pupils (not all children were Panther cubs), and gave Huggins license to devise a curriculum that was both ambitious and progressive, with an emphasis on Black history and pride.View image in fullscreenEricka Abram.Photograph: Kendall Bessent/The GuardianThe kids received three square meals a day. They were tested for hearing and eyesight, and those who needed them were supplied with glasses to ensure they could study effectively.“I never was hungry, I never felt scared, I never felt unloved,” Abram said.The school day began with calisthenics in the yard, followed by meditation in the afternoons. At morning assembly, they sang the Black national anthem,Lift Every Voice and Sing, instead of reciting the pledge of allegiance, and on special occasions they wore mini-Panther uniforms – black jackets and berets – marching energetically in two straight lines.Gallery | Black Panthers and cubs 1960s-1970sView image in fullscreenElaine Brown and her daughter at a Free Bobby rally in Defermery Park.Photograph: Stephen Shames/PolarisView image in fullscreenBlack Panthers at the California state capitol in Sacramento, in 1967.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveView image in fullscreenFred Hampton speaks outside a rally outside the US courthouse in Chicago while Dr Benjamin Spock listens.Photograph: ESK/APView image in fullscreenThe Black Panther free food drive.Photograph: David Fenton/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenHuey J Newton, right, and Bobby Seale at party headquarters in San Francisco in 1967.Photograph: Ted Streshinsky Photographic Archive/Corbis/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenThree Black Panthers are led into court in Los Angeles in 1969.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveView image in fullscreenLauren Watson, an early Black Panther leader, in 1968.Photograph: The Denver Post/Denver Post/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenBlack Panthers demonstrate outside the New York City courthouse, in April 1969.Photograph: New York Times/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenA bullet hole in the window at the Black Panthers headquarters in Oakland, California in 1968.Photograph: San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenBlack Panthers demonstrate at Foley Square, New York, in 1968.Photograph: FPG/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenBags of groceries are given away at the Black Panther-organized Black Community Survival Conference in San Francisco, 1972.Photograph: San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenA Black Panther liberation school.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveView image in fullscreenA Free Bobby rally in Defermery Park, Oakland in 1971.Photograph: Stephen Shames/PolarisView image in fullscreenKathleen Neal Cleaver signs autographs at a Free Huey rally in April 1972 in San Francisco.Photograph: Robert Altman/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenDoor to a Black Panther office after a police raid in Chicago in 1969.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveView image in fullscreenProtest outside the Alameda county courthouse in Oakland during Huey Newton’s trial for murder in July 1968.Photograph: San Francisco Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenA Black Panther free clothing drive in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1969.Photograph: David Fenton/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenProtest in New York in January 1970.Photograph: Images Press/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenChildren of Panthers at the Children’s Institute in Oakland, 1971.Photograph: Stephen Shames/PolarisView image in fullscreenAfeni Shakur, a member of the Harlem chapter of the Panthers and mother of the rapper Tupac Shakur, at the Revolutionary People’s Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1970.Photograph: David Fenton/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenAustin Allen helps Malik Seale, Bobby’s son, write at the Intercommunal Youth Institute in Oakland, in 1972.Photograph: Stephen Shames/PolarisView image in fullscreenPanther cubs at the National Headquarters office in Berkeley, California in 1971.Photograph: Stephen Shames/PolarisView image in fullscreenPanther cubs at the National Headquarters office.Photograph: Stephen Shames/The GuardianView image in fullscreenA woman reads the Black Panther newspaper on the New York subway in 1970.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveView image in fullscreenClassroom at the Intercommunal Youth Institute in 1971.Photograph: Stephen Shames/PolarisView image in fullscreenThe Black Community Survival Conference in 1972 in Oakland.Photograph: Stephen Shames/PolarisView image in fullscreenFilm-maker and Black Panther Austin Allen wrestles with children at the Intercommunal Youth Institute in 1972.Photograph: Stephen Shames/PolarisView image in fullscreenThe Panthers advocated armed self-defense to counter police brutality, and initiated a program of patrolling the police with guns and law books.Photograph: Stephen Shames/PolarisView image in fullscreenBobby Seale with his six-year-old son Malik Nkrumahy Stagolee.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveThere were no grades, only levels for aptitude, and classes were no larger than 10 kids. The curriculum included reading, writing, math and science, all taught so assiduously that when some of the children entered their teens and were transferred to ordinary public schools, they often went into classrooms two years above their age.Rigorous academic classes were melded with more overt political teaching. “We would sing ‘Black is beautiful, off the pigs!’” Abram recalled. “That’s an interesting chant for children, but I didn’t know they were called police until I was much older.”Friday was movie night, with a curated selection of anti-war or anti-capitalist films. Abram, who was named after Ericka Huggins, remembers their teacher Donna telling them to avoid contact with anything colored red, white and blue. “America doesn’t care about you,” Donna would tell them.“America is not your friend.”Unlike other children of Black Panthers, Abram does not identify as a “cub” on grounds that she never had any intention of becoming an adult revolutionary. Instead, she regards herself and the other dorm children as “comrade siblings”. “The Panthers are a political group, but to me we were family because that’s how we lived. We went to school together, ate together, bathed together, slept in the same room.”‘We love ourselves, we love our culture, we love our people. Black history wasn’t just a February thing’She remembers spending hours playing castle with sandbags stacked in one of the Panther homes. Only later did she learn that the bags were used by her father to hide firearms stashed under the floorboards. Paradoxically, the one thing the kids were never allowed to do was play with toy guns. “In the 1970s, everyone had a cap gun, a zip gun, but we weren’t allowed them,” Abram said. “Huey would say: ‘Guns are a tool, not a toy.’”Huggins, who ran the school between 1973 until it closed in 1982, liked to say that her aim wasto teach childrenhowto think, notwhatto think. Creativity and curiosity were encouraged, as were music, drama, art and all forms of self-expression. When a child transgressed, they were brought before a “justice court” where they were disciplined by other kids – a far cry from theschool-to-prison pipelineso common to this day in regular public schools.Girls in particular were protected from negative gender and racial stereotypes. “Black women have been shamed in so many ways – from the auction block to the way our bodies are policed,” Abram said. “We didn’t have that same shaming; as a girl I was not taught to think of myself as weak.”Teachers looked to Black luminaries to instill pride in the students. Maya Angelou came twice to the Panther school to read poetry to the children, the second time with James Baldwin in tow. Other visitors included the comedian Richard Pryor and, on one memorable day, the civil rights legend Rosa Parks.The Hispanic labor leader Cesar Chavez also came by. Abram recalls that they went without eating lettuce or strawberries for a year in support of hisfarmworkers’ protest.View image in fullscreenSharif El-Mekki.Photograph: Shan Wallace/The GuardianMore than 3,000 miles away on the east coast, Sharif El-Mekki, 53, shared many of the same experiences growing up. Panther cubs did not have their own dedicated school in his city, Philadelphia, but there were radical liberation schools imbued with a similar accent on Black pride.His parents, Aisha El-Mekki and Hamid Khalid, were both Panthers. His mother and step-father sent him to a school in Germantown named Nidhamu Sasa (“Discipline Now” in Swahili). There, he practiced an African form of martial arts. Classrooms were known by the titles of African liberation movements:Tanu,Swapo,Frelimo,MPLA.“Black pride was everything,” El-Mekki recalled. “We love ourselves, we love our culture, we love our people. Black history wasn’t just a February thing. It wasn’t even Black history, it was history.”At home, El-Mekki’s family did not celebrate birthdays. Instead, their calendar would be punctuated by the martyrdom of revolutionary heroes, such as 21 February, the day Malcolm X was killed in 1965. “My mother would say: ‘You know, you don’t really do anything to be born, it’s more important to commemorate those who died for something’.”Into the StormView image in fullscreenK’Sisay Sadiki with her letters from her father, Kamau Sadiki.Photograph: Ashley Peña/The Guardian‘I will never forget the haunting scream of that child’When Sharon Shoatz was 12, her school was suddenly evacuated. It was September 1977, and as police helicopters whirred overhead she realized that the emergency might be related to her family.Her home stood directly over the road from the school, and she could see her mother, Thelma, looking distraught as a swarm of police entered her family’s house. Could this have something to do with her father, Russell Shoatz? She knew that he was in prison, but she had no idea why. “He didn’t explain the Panthers to me when I was young, not at all,” she said.It was only the day after the police raid that she learned her father had escaped from a correctional institution in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. “It was in every newspaper, on every TV screen. That’s when it really came to me what was going on with my dad.”Russell Shoatz had been a Philadelphia Panther, and went on to become a member of the Black Liberation Army (BLA), an underground organization of largely former Black Panthers that regarded itself as the clandestine military wing of the party. With a strong presence on the east coast, it was often at odds with Newton and the west coast Panthers, who were increasingly focused on community welfare programs and running for elected office.By contrast, the BLA was implicated in several 1970s bombings and prison break-outs. The US government claimed it was responsible for the deaths of 20 police officers.Shoatz, nicknamed “Maroon” after the escaped enslaved people, was given a life sentence having been accused of taking part in the 1970 killing of a police sergeant, Frank Von Colln, in retaliation for a police shooting of a young unarmed Black man. A few days after the officer was murdered, police raided the Philadelphia headquarters of the Black Panther Party and rounded up all the men inside. They handcuffed them, stripped them to their boxers, and lined them up against a wall.The photograph of this humiliation of a group of Black Panthers – none implicated in Von Colln’s death – was one of the searing images of the 1970s liberation struggle. It left an enduring impression on one young Panther cub, Sharif El-Mekki, even though it was taken before he was born.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Philadelphia Black Panther Party are handcuffed and stripped during a police raid.Photograph: Dominic Ligato/Courtesy of the Special Collections Research Center. Temple University Libraries.His mother showed him the photo when he was six years old. She pointed out his father, Hamid Khalid, standing naked except for gray boxers, his face turned away from the camera, his arms cuffed behind his back.At first, El-Mekki was bemused when he saw the photo. “I kept asking my mother: ‘Why? Why would you make someone strip?’ I couldn’t wrap my mind around it.”Later, it made the young boy all the more determined to live up to his parents’ values. “Seeing that picture didn’t give me trepidation or fear,” he said. “It gave me resolve. I was going to join the army against injustice.”He also started wearing boxers, because that’s what revolutionaries did.Though their parents tried to shield the cubs from the gathering storm, in the end there was no escaping the epic clash between Panthers and law enforcement. In 1969, the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover, declared the Black Panther Party “the greatest threat to internal security of the country”, and by the end of that year 30 of its members were in jail facing the death penalty and another 40 looking at life imprisonment.The omnipresence of police informants became a fact of daily life, along with the paranoia that came with it. Fred Hampton Jr grew up knowing that his father was killed in that massive assault in Chicago with the aid of an infiltrator – William O’Neal, the Judas of the 2021 movieJudas and the Black Messiah. “I’ve studied the dynamics of betrayal,” he said. “The internal attacks, how it impacts every aspect of your existence, even to this day.”Being a Panther became a very dangerous proposition. The number of fallen Panthers grew, killed by police or in increasingly violent internal disputes fomented by the FBI.Byone count, 28 Panthers were killed by the turn of 1970. In the estimation of Billy X Jennings, a former Panther who curates one of thelargest archivesof the party’s history, at least 35 members lost their lives. That’s a devastating proportion of an organization that is thought to have had, at most, a few thousand members.“People say the children weren’t in danger, but I beg to differ,” said Meres-Sia Gabriel, 51, the daughter of the Panthers’ celebrated artist and minister of cultureEmory Douglasand the Panther artist Gail Dixon. “If our parents are in danger, even if we the children are not specifically targeted, then we are in danger.”Though they didn’t understand the context at the time, the cubs had security drilled into them. They were trained to be alert, spatially aware, suspicious of outsiders, and constantly mindful of the perils around them.As a young girl, Abram was often accompanied by a man named Aaron Dixon, a member of the Seattle Panthers. She recalls being vexed by him. “Why did he have to come everywhere with me? Why did he always have to open the door first before me?”‘He wanted me to be a soldier, to have that discipline, to be prepared just in case’Only later did she realize that Dixon was her mother’s bodyguard. His annoying insistence on opening doors was to avoid them being shot by an assassin lurking on the other side.Ksisay Sadiki, 53, recalls being woken up early every morning by her Panther father, Kamau, to follow a strenuous exercise regime, including three different types of press-ups. “He wanted me to be a soldier, to have that discipline, to be prepared just in case.”One of her earliest memories was of her mother, Panther Pamela Hanna, braiding her hair in pigtails for a visit to court in Queens. She remembers sitting in the back, on painfully hard seats, playing peekaboo with a woman who was in the dock.That woman was Assata Shakur, a close comrade of Sadiki’s parents. Shakur, dubbed by police the “Black Joan of Arc”, was convicted by an all-white juryof the 1973 killing of a police officer on the New Jersey turnpike. Sheescaped from prisonin 1979, went underground, and is thought to be in hiding in Cuba. The FBI has offered a reward of $1m for her capture and lists her as one of itsmost wanted terrorists.In her autobiography,Assata, Shakur details an incident that happened when Ksisay, aged two, was brought to court to see her jailed father. “As Kamau walked near her, [Ksisay] held out her arms to him,” Shakur writes. “Kamau took two steps toward her and the marshals jumped him and began beating him … I will never forget the haunting scream of that child as she watched her father being brutally beaten.”View image in fullscreenSala Cyril.Photograph: Ashley Peña/The GuardianConstant security awareness was a theme of many of the cubs’ childhoods. Sala Cyril, 48, and her older sibling Malkia, 50, whose mother, Janet, was in the Harlem Panthers, were brought up to be what they call “hyper vigilant”. At dusk they had to close the shutters of their home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, so nobody could see inside. If they got into trouble on the streets, they were told to ask a community member for help, never a police officer.When the family ate out at a diner, the children habitually sat on the outside of the booth in case they needed to make a quick getaway. The rules were simple: never have your back to a door, check all exits when you enter a public space, be wary of anyone who you do not know.FBI agents would frequently call at the Cyrils’ home. The interventions continued right up to a couple of weeks before Janet died of sickle cell anemia, aged 59, in 2005 – 23 years after the Panthers’ demise. Janet was already in hospice care at home, yet agents still insisted she would have to testify in a reopened 1971 case involving the murder of a San Francisco police officer.Sala said such confrontations have left her with a sense of creeping threat that pursued her well into adulthood. “There is no end for the children,” she said. “Nothing ended, not for us.”To this day, Sala will conduct a thorough background check on any new friend or acquaintance, trawling public records and making inquiries. Did she do a background check on me before we met for a two-hour interview in Brooklyn?“I certainly did,” she said. “I wouldn’t have talked to you if I hadn’t.”LossView image in fullscreenAlprentice Davis in Kissena Park, New York.Photograph: Ashley Peña/The Guardian‘Daddy, was the cause more important than your children?’When Ericka Abram was a toddler, her mother, Elaine Brown, traveled the world making connections with other revolutionary leaders. She visited the Soviet Union, China, North Korea and Vietnam.For the Panthers, Brown’s frenetic global dash was a sign that the party was making waves. For Ericka, not yet a year old and left in the care of a Panther minder, it had other, less lofty implications.“She was not there when I learned to walk. And she was not there when my teeth came in,” Abram said.In the grand revolutionary scheme of things, does it matter that Abram’s mother was absent when she learned to walk? Wasn’t the fight for Black self-determination more important than witnessing a child’s developmental milestones? Those are questions with which Abram grapples to this day.One of Abram’s first memories was being taken to an Ike and Tina Turner concert with her grandmother. Her mother also came along, wearing a flowing pink Halston dress. “I thought my mother was so glamorous and beautiful. And strong,” Abram said. “But we didn’t know each other.”Abram has reflected a lot on her mother’s choices. “I can’t imagine what it would be like trying to change the world and change a diaper. I know that sounds simplistic, but that’s really what she was trying to do. Everyone’s not meant to be a parent. And everyone’s not meant to be a Panther. Sometimes you have to choose – and my mother chose being a Black Panther.”View image in fullscreenOakland Community School students, 1973. The school was set up by the Black Panthers and most of its students were children of party members.Photograph: Stephen ShamesWhen Abram was three, her mother ran unsuccessfully for a seat in Oakland city council. A year later she became chair of the Black Panther Party – the only woman ever to lead it. Abram remembers seeing her mom on TV and on billboards, and how happy that made her.“Two weeks would have passed and I wouldn’t have seen her in person, so I would be happy to see her on television – ‘Oh, she looks great, everything’s OK.’”Brown has publicly expressed sorrow for being distant from her young child as a result of her Panther calling. Her autobiography,A Taste of Power, which Brown dedicates to her daughter, contains a photo of Brown tying little Ericka’s shoelaces, with the caption: “I found it difficult to be a real mother to Ericka, whose love for me remained constant nevertheless.”When Brown was interviewed for a 2004 book on the kids of civil rights leaders,Children of the Movement, she said: “We didn’t know how to be parents, we knew how to be revolutionaries. I feel sorry for Ericka, but I can’t make myself over. She suffered in life because of me, and I don’t know how to deal with it.”When I read that passage to Abram, her eyes welled up and she looked emotionally overwhelmed. “It’s very difficult to hear her say that, even now,” she said, her voice breaking.Did she ever hear her mother express such feelings – not quite an apology, but a recognition of how hard it was for her daughter – to her directly?“No,” Abram said.Other cubs did. Sharif El-Mekki’s father, Hamid Khalid, who spent 17 years in prison, apologized to him for being absent. “Not for the work that landed him there, but for its consequences,” El-Mekki said.“I told him: ‘I don’t think you need to apologize for anything. People make sacrifices. I don’t know a single revolutionary that spends every moment they want with their family.’”Sharon Shoatz, who is now 59, also wrestled with the loss of a parent to prison – her father Russell “Maroon” Shoatz spent 49 years behind bars, 22 in solitary confinement. She said there were times when she felt mad about it all. “I would think: ‘You know, Daddy, how do you explain yourself? Was the cause more important than your children?’”In December 2021, just days before her father died having been released from prison a month earlier with end-stage colorectal cancer, he called her. “I just want to say sorry, for anything I did to you,” he said.Shoatz replied: “Dad, it’s good. It’s all good.”View image in fullscreenSharon Shoatz.Photograph: Shan Wallace/The GuardianOf all the varieties of loss that come with being a Panther cub, prolonged imprisonment of a parent is perhaps the hardest. Shoatz was seven when her father was arrested, 56 when he came home to die.From the age of 10, she traveled long distances to visit him in umpteen prisons. For manyyears,she had no idea why her father was incarcerated other than that he had been convicted of killing a police officer. Then in 1990, when she was in her late 20s, she attended an event in New York to publicize the plight of long-term Black prisoners and came across a man carrying a placard proclaiming: “Free Russell Shoatz”.It made her question everything she thought she knew. “I asked myself: ‘Who are you, dude? I don’t even know who you are. You’re like my dad, but whoareyou?’”She started to exchange letters with him, asking for details. In one of them, she invited him to explain what bugged her most: how could he have put Black struggle before his own children?He explained that when he was a child, he had watched the brutal treatment of Black people by Philadelphia police and had grown disgusted by how his own father merely looked out the window and stayed silent. He came to think of his father as a coward, and vowed to be different.Those exchanges helped Shoatz see her own father in a new light. “There was a wide range of emotions, from anger, to feeling I lost out on having a father, to finally growing to appreciate his politics.”Shoatz uses the same word as Hampton Jr to describe the impact of those years – burden. “We didn’t have a father in the home and my mother struggled. Then there was the burden of freedom that weighs heavily on you – the fact that we were free, and he was not.”And there was the sense that her life had never been truly hers. “I would like to livemylife, because I’ve lived the life of trying to support my father. So much of my life has been dedicated to that.”Ksisay Sadiki has been through the bereavement of losing her father to prison twice. Kamau Sadiki was arrested and imprisoned for robbery in 1972 when he was living clandestinely in Atlanta, Georgia, and was incarcerated for the first eight years of his daughter’s life.Following release, her father lived an ordinary New York life for more than 20 years, going back to school, working for a phone company, providing for his family. He had come home, “and I thought that was it,” she said.View image in fullscreenPanther cub K’Sisay Sadiki at her home in Harlem, New York.Photograph: Ashley Peña/The GuardianThen in 2002, when Ksisay was 31 and had children of her own, it happened again. In the heightened tension after the 9/11 terror attacks, her father was arrested in Brooklyn on gun charges and investigated for the 1971 murder of an Atlanta police officer, James Green. He was sent down to Atlanta for trial, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment plus 10 years.“My world collapsed,” Sadiki said. “I couldn’t wrap my heart and head around it.” From his new prison cell, her father would send her letters telling her not to worry, he’d be coming home soon. But this second time, that wasn’t true. Kamau remains locked up in Georgia today.Sadiki has spent the past 20 years trying to get him out. There are times when she feels angry, others when she feels an unbearable responsibility. But despite it all, the bond remains fierce. “You know, I still call him Daddy,” she said. “My father’s my world.”Recently, her father has become very apologetic. “He’s like: ‘I don’t want to burden you.’ And I’m like, ‘Daddy, please stop. You never ever, ever, burden me.”ImplosionView image in fullscreenEricka Abram.Photograph: Kendall Bessent/The Guardian‘I wasn’t acknowledged as a Panther child, I just happened to be born’Ericka Abram’s last moments asa child within the Black Panther Partyoccurred in the middle of the night. The eight-year-old was shaken awake in the dorm by her mother’s bodyguard, Aaron – the irritating man who opened doors for her. She was told to be quick and pack a suitcase with just her most prized possessions.What Abram didn’t know then was that her mother had decided to quit the Black Panthers and relocate overnight from Oakland to Los Angeles.As she describes in A Taste of Power, Elaine Brown had become dismayed by the treatment of women in the party. An assistant principal of the Panther school, Regina Davis, was subjected to a severe beating and had her jaw broken by male Panthers after she tried to reprimand one of them for refusing to perform an assigned task. Huey P Newton had authorized the assault.The departure of mother and daughter was sudden and jolting, and what came after it even more unmooring. They moved into an apartment in Malibu provided for them by the Motown executive Suzanne de Passe, with whom Brown had recorded an album. De Passe found Ericka a place in an elite French lycee by calling in a favor from one of the school’s patrons, Diana Ross.Within the space of three weeks, Abram’s universe switched from the Panther dorm to an almost all-white school for the kids of the Hollywood jetset (fellow students included Lisa Marie Presley and Jodie Foster). How did she get her head around the change?“I didn’t. Thankfully, at the Malibu house I could walk down to the beach and sit there for hours digging up sand crabs and looking at the water.”For Meres-Sia Gabriel, the final collapse of the party in 1982 also came as a wrench. Her father, the artist Emory Douglas, created many of the most memorable Panther images replete with strong lines, bright colors and police officers depicted as pigs. Gabriel has several of her father’s original Panther works on the walls of her apartment in Richmond, California.View image in fullscreenMeres-Sia Gabriel in Richmond, California. Gabriel is the child of Emory Douglas, the former minister of culture for the Black Panther Party.Photograph: Marissa Leshnov/The GuardianWhile the Black Panther Party was in existence, Gabriel and her parents had all their basic needs met. But when the movement formally folded, her mother, the Panther artist Gail Dixon, abruptly moved her from her grandmother’s small but safe and predictable home where she had spent much of the Panther era into a run-down corner of Oakland.In contrast to Abram’s move to rich white Malibu, Gabriel woke up one morning in a Black neighborhood that felt disjointed and violent. “It was a shock. Looking back, that was a traumatic, stressful, chaotic time,” she said.Suddenly, she was living among other kids who knew nothing of the Panthers or their cause. Her parents told her not to reveal to anyone that they had been in the party.A couple of years ago Gabriel wrote a poem that describes that painful transition, capturing the sense of loss, isolation and fear:In 1982 when the revolution was over,We woke to a soiled mattress in our front yard and a pair of beat up sneakers hanging from the telephone wires.The kids down the street wanted to fight me …They had no idea my parents fought for them to have free breakfast in school,Neither did I.After the Black Panther Party formally collapsed, many of the cubs went through a prolonged period of introspection that, for some, continues to this day. “You are told you were born for revolution,” Abram said. “So what do you do with your life when the revolution doesn’t come?”As they’ve confronted these existential questions, the cubs have found comfort and mutual support in their own collective identity. The first cub event that Sharon Shoatz attended was a retreat in the early 1990s outside Rye, New York.The cubs made an instant connection. They had been through so many common experiences that they understood each other instinctually, without the endless explanation that non-Panther friends required. “We found we could come together, and share our stories, and our pain,” Shoatz said. “It was a form of healing.”View image in fullscreenThe Black Panther Party Museum in Oakland features the only public mural dedicated to the women of the Black Panther Party.Photograph: Marissa Leshnov/The GuardianSince then, groups of cubs have convened every few years for reunions that Shoatz has found part-cathartic, part-empowering. The most recent was in August 2024, when about 20 cubs came together in Portland, Oregon.Individually, the cubs continue to ask tough questions about their pasts. Meres-Sia Gabriel has probed deeply into the contradictions of her Panther childhood, and is writing a one-woman show that seeks to tell her story of that struggle in poetry and music.She sees the process as a form of learning to love the “inner child” in her who was ignored when she was young. For her, the children of the Panthers were the most overlooked members of the party.“I felt I wasn’t acknowledged as a Panther child, I just happened to be born. They said they were serving the people. Well then, am I the people, am I a person? If you’re committing everything to serving the people, the child born to you wonders, where do I fit in?”In her 30s, she legally changed her name. She discarded her birth name, Cindy Douglas, which her parents had given her as an homage to Cindy Smallwood, a Panther who had joined the party when she was 16 and was killed in a car crash three years later.She replaced it with Meres-Sia Gabriel. Meres-Sia is drawn from ancient Egyptian meaning “beloved one with insight”. Gabriel is after the Abrahamic archangel. “It was part of me reclaiming self-love,” she said.Over time, Gabriel has come to be proud of her parents’ revolutionary work. She now emulates them, by pursuing her own activism of sorts. “It’s a different revolution, to get to know and soothe this wounded inner child and to understand how to love her, and how to love the Black Panther Party.”To love them both?“My intention is to honor what was good about the party, and to be courageous on this journey of deep healing for my own self.”Shock and AweView image in fullscreenK’Sisay Sadiki at her home in Harlem.Photograph: Ashley Peña/The Guardian‘This is an escalation. The executive orders made my heart begin to beat a little faster, fear begin to grow.’The explosive return of Donald Trump to the White House in January, and his instant carpet bombing with incendiary executive orders, did not take Malkia Cyril by surprise. They had long been tracking the erosion of neoliberal democracy and the rise of authoritarianism, in the US and around the world.What did unnerve Cyril was the scale and speed of it. “This is an escalation. The shock and awe of the early weeks, when so many executive orders dropped, it made my heart begin to beat a little faster, fear begin to grow.”Trump’s attack is personal. Cyril came out as queer when they were 12. They were just in the throes of changing the gender marker on their official documents to X when the president issued anexecutive orderdeclaring that the government would henceforth only recognise a person’s sex assigned at birth. “I am feeling extraordinarily distressed and in some pain as I witness the onslaught.”Nor was it coincidental, in Cyril’s view, that Trump made federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs one of his first and biggest targets. Cyril hates the term “DEI”, because in their view it obscures what is really going on. “This is an attack on the fundamental civil rights that have been gained by Black folk since emancipation. It’s a demonstration of power that is meant to terrify us into silence.”Has the shocking start to 2025 given Cyril clarity on what it is to be a Panther cub? No, they said. “I’ve always been a Panther cub. I live, read, walk, talk, Panther cub. The Panther Party is the water, I’m a fish.”What it has done, rather, is give them greater clarity on what their role is to be at this critical juncture. “What I have to offer as a Panther cub is unique and necessary in this moment,” they said.View image in fullscreenMalkia Cyril at home in Oakland in 2024.Photograph: Marissa Leshnov/The Guardian“There is a clarity to my mandate: to help rebuild the left, to show that it is not a dirty word, that the left is not a space that should be hidden from view. That life can be breathed into it. That’s my mandate: to breathe life back into the left – and I’m not the only one.”Many of the cubs are struck by the parallels between the volatility of their parents’ Panther days in the early 70s and the present day. Ksisay Sadiki keeps referring back to the 10-point manifesto written by Newton and Seale when they set up the party. “They address the same issues we’re talking about today: education, housing, policing, mass incarceration.”The first iteration of the 10 points written in 1966 did not directly address healthcare, though a second version produced six years later did call for free medical treatment for all Black and oppressed people. That strikes a chord with Sadiki.Both her parents are facing ill health – her father is in prison hospital and her mother is regularly admitted to community hospitals in New York.“What upsets me so much about my parents is that they’re sick and they’re not getting the medical attention they need. And that makes me think about land. If we had our own land, our own resources, to grow our own food, to be healthy, not to have to sacrifice your life for other people, that would be progress.”Just a few statistics illuminate how the basic inequities to which she is alluding continue to tear at the fabric of American society. Black women aretwo to three timesmore likely to die from causes related to pregnancy than white women. A Black kid receives on average$2,700 less in state fundingin their school district than a white kid. Black families account for more than50% of the totalof all families with children who are homeless, when Black people form only 13% of the general population. And a statistic that lands with a thump: despite the convulsive churn of Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of Michael Brown’s shooting in Ferguson in 2014, and George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis in 2020, Black Americans continue to be killed by police at almostthree timesthe rate of white Americans.‘This moment we are in, it’s a threat. It’s terrifying. But it is also an opportunity.’Alprentice Davis, 54, cites his own personal data point, based on 30 years working as a football coach for at-risk kids in poor Black neighborhoods in New York and Washington DC. By his estimate, on average one of his students has been shot to death every seven years.View image in fullscreenPanther cub Alprentice Davis at Kissena Park.Photograph: Ashley Peña/The GuardianDavis is the son of Thelma Davis from the Queens, New York, chapter of the Panthers, and Robert Bay, a top adviser to Huey P Newton in Oakland. In Davis’s memoir,Urchin Society: Memories of a Black Panther Cub, he ponders what would have happened if the government, instead of pummeling the party to the point of extinction, had worked with them.“Black communities would be totally different,” Davis said. “There’d be less drugs on the streets, the police wouldn’t be like an occupying army and there would be real community policing. There’d be a whole lot less Trayvon Martins and Michael Browns.”Malkia Cyril was deeply involved in the founding of Black Lives Matter after the shooting to death of the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida gun owner in 2012. Cyril could draw a direct line between the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter that was going viral on social media and the trigger behind the formation of the Black Panther Party: both were a response to the killing of Black people. “Every Black movement in this country began with a death,” Cyril said, “and this was no different. There absolutely was continuity, because there was continuity of conditions.”Today, as Trump proceeds to tear up the hard-won victories of the civil rights movement, Cyril is having to contend with the limits of protest as a political strategy. “There has definitely been a shift in what protest alone can do. The lesson here is that while protest movements are important, they’re insufficient.”Their hope is that out of the fear and instability instilled in Trump’s America will come something more positive: a whole new strategy centered around building community, a new collective action.“It’s very important to understand this,” they said. “This moment we are in, it’s a threat. It’s terrifying. But it is also an opportunity.”LegacyView image in fullscreenAlprentice Davis with his daughter in Kissena Park, New York.Photograph: Ashley Peña/The Guardian‘It’s a quintessential Black love story’Forty-two years after the official end of the Black Panther Party, the cubs’ childhood experiences remain seared into their DNA. Though they have responded in diverse ways – some with boundless pride, others seeking self-healing – they can all agree on how deeply it touched them.One of the most striking aspects of the legacy of the Black Panther Party is how its progeny have gone on to be leaders in their own right. In addition to Tupac Shakur, there is a long list of cubs in the public spotlight that includesFani Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, who brought indictments against Donald Trump; the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates; and Ericka Huggins’ daughter Mai Lassiter, an LA-based music executive and philanthropist.The nine cubs the Guardian spoke to have all gone on to lead adult lives imbued with the creativity and skills they acquired during the Panther years. Sala Cyril, who was taught by her mother to be “hyper vigilant” in the face of FBI surveillance, is the national security co-ordinator of the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, an organization that promotes self-determination for the Black community. She also works as a community safety liaison, advising other Black groups.View image in fullscreenKsisay Sadiki and her daughter at a park in Harlem in 2024.Photograph: Ashley Peña/The GuardianDrawing directly on what she learned from Panther elders, she teaches the groups best practice on vetting, how to recognize when you are being targeted, and how to defend against infiltration and smear tactics of the sort Hoover wielded so successfully against the party.Several of the cubs have applied their inspirational learning to careers in education. Sharif El-Mekki went on from his Philadelphia freedom school to work as a teacher and principal for almost 30 years and now runs a group that seeks to train the next generation of motivational Black educators.El-Mekki’s respect for his parents’ revolutionary activities knows no limits. “I think the Black Panther Party was one of the Blackest, most incredible social justice movements America has seen. Being a cub for me is a deep badge of pride. It’s a quintessential Black love story.”He has six children. He calls them “grandcubs”.Several others have channeled the Panthers’ belief in the power of the written word to become writers. Ericka Abram is writing a memoir of her surreal journey from the Panther dorm to Malibu, titled Black Panther Princess. Sharon Shoatz has helped disseminate her father’s recently published posthumous autobiography,I Am Maroon.View image in fullscreenSala Cyril with her daughter in 2024.Photograph: Ashley Peña/The GuardianHaving been conflicted for so long over the absence of her mother, Abram is finally learning to forgive her. “I now appreciate her for what she did. She was incredibly brave – a fighter, and a survivor.”She is also learning to forgive herself. “I thought for many years that I was useless, because I wasn’t a revolutionary. Now I think that if you contribute in any positive way, that’s OK. I’m not gonna beat myself up any longer.”25:55The Black Panther Cubs: when the revolution doesn't come - videoAll the cubs feel a responsibility to keep the memory of their parents’ sacrifices and achievements alive. Fred Hampton Jr feels that keenly – he is working to preserve Hampton Sr’s childhood home in Chicago,the Hampton House, as the legacy of his father slain 25 days before he was born.“It’s a way of life for me, this is my calling,” he said. “And so we pass the baton. We keep moving, we keep going.”"

In turn, she sued the charity to remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship.“We thank all the trustees for their service over the years and are truly heartbroken they’ve had to follow through with this act.“What’s transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale’s beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.”Sentebale, which means “Forget me not”, was created to help people in Lesotho and Botswana living in poverty and those suffering from HIV and Aids. Former trustees Timothy Boucher, Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, Kelello Lerotholi and Damian West released a statement announcing their decision to unanimously resign as board members.“Today’s decision is nothing short of devastating for all of us, but we see no other path forward as the result of our loss in trust and confidence in the chair of the board.”A spokesperson for the charity said it has not received resignations from either royal patron, adding: “We are pleased to confirm the restructuring of our board on 25 March 2025 to introduce experts with the capabilities and networks to accelerate Sentebale’s transformation agenda as announced last year.”In response, Chandauka said: “Everything I do at Sentebale is in pursuit of the integrity of the organisation, its mission, and the young people we serve. My actions are guided by the principles of fairness and equitable treatment for all, regardless of social status or financial means.“There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.“Discerning readers will ask themselves: why would the chair of the board report her own trustees to the Charity Commission? Why would the high court of England and Wales hear her case and issue an emergency injunction to prevent the same trustees from removing her as the chair of the board?“Well, because beneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to press is the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir – and the cover-up that ensued.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarrySouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Ninety per cent of those in favour of financial reparations said they should be directed toward long-term education, health and infrastructure projects.Bell Ribeiro-Addy, a Labour MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group for Afrikan Reparations, said she was “not surprised” about the lack of understanding about the scale of slavery, and that reparative justice also required education.“People point to reparations and think merely in financial terms, but one of the most important things is correcting the record – because until people learn what happened there will not be that widespread, public will to make reparation possible,” she said.The Labour governmenthas said the UK will not pay cash reparations, but is working with Caribbean partners on issues such as security, growth and climate change.UK shipping firm used enslaved workers in Caribbean after abolition, study findsRead moreRibeiro-Addy said there had to be a “willingness to listen” from the UK government, which is yet to makea formal apology for slavery, faced with a “large chunk of the world” that was unified on the need for reparative justice. “For us not to listen is disgraceful and could have consequences of its own,” she added.Walker Syachalinga, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day, which is investigating claims against institutions, companies and families, said of the survey’s findings: “They speak to what has been a feature of English law and commerce – this idea of offshoring the more unpalatable aspects of our history while retaining the benefits.”Denis O’Brien, Repair Campaign’s founder, said the poll showed “heartening” growth in public support for an apology and reparations, but also “how little people in Britain really know about the country’s past.”Dr Hilary Brown, a programme manager at Caricom Secretariat, said: “Our shared humanity demands justice for the horrific crimes committed. Addressing the knowledge gap in the UK on the country’s history of trading and enslaving Africans is urgent.”Explore more on these topicsSlaveryReparations and reparative justiceColonialismAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He said it would be critical to see “how people react to those mistakes and how they tighten them up”.Canada is one of the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network, alongside Australia,New Zealandand the UK and the leak of classified information is likely to put further strain on the group as it weighs how seriously the current American administration takes the handling of top secret information.Democrats demand answers over White House’s ‘careless’ Signal blunderRead moreThe revelations came asCanadagrapples with a rapidly deteriorating relationship with the United States, its largest trading partner and closest military ally.“My responsibility is to plan for the worst, is to think about the most difficult evolution of the new threat environment, what it means for Canada and how do we best protect Canada,” Carney said during a campaign stop on Tuesday. The prime ministercalled a snap electionon Sunday.“Part of that response is to be more and more Canadian in our defence capabilities, more and more Canadian in our decisions … We have to look out for ourselves.”Asked about the incident on Tuesday, the UK’s armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, told the Commons Defence Committee that no British service personnel had been put at risk as a result.He added: “All UK service personnel are covered by our normal approach to operational security, and the committee will understand that I won’t go into the details of how we keep our involvement in any support for military operations in the Red Sea or anywhere else [secure].“But we’ve got high confidence that the measures that we have got with our allies, including the United States, remain intact.”A spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke at length at a briefing about the contribution the UK makes to joint military operations with the Americans. However, the spokesperson refused to directly criticise the two figures who were most critical of Europe’s record on defence, JD Vance, the vice-president, andPete Hegseth, the defence secretary. The spokesperson also insisted that the UK remains happy to share intelligence with the US despite the leak.The government of New Zealand declined to comment on the matter. When asked by the Guardian if the security breach had raised concerns about the sharing of sensitive intel with Trump’s administration, the offices for New Zealand’s prime minister, Christopher Luxon, and the minister for defence, Judith Collins, said the situation was “a matter for the US administration”.Behind closed doors, senior government officials would likely be discussing the risks of sharing intelligence with the US, amid what could be viewed as a lowering of protocol standards, but the breach would not be a dealbreaker, said Andrew Little, whose ministerial roles covered security, intelligence and defence under New Zealand’s last Labour government.“Our relationship transcends individual administrations and individual political leaders. There will be things that – like everybody – members of this government, will be looking askance at. But I think it’s about managing the relationship in the long run,” Little said.Lives at risk if UK fails to review intelligence sharing with US, say Lib DemsRead moreSo far, New Zealand has been managing its US relationship responsibly, Little said, but it was now “a relationship that requires constant vigilance”.Robert Patman, a professor at the University of Otago in Dunedin who specialises in international relations, called the security breach “extraordinary” and “cavalier”. “It does confirm what many of us felt, that Mr Trump has picked people according to loyalty, rather than competence, and this was almost a perfect storm waiting to happen,” Patman said.But the wider issue for New Zealand and other Five Eyes countries was knowing how to respond to the Trump administration’s “radical departure” from the rules-based order, which included making territorial claims against liberal democracies and siding with Russian president Vladimir Putin over negotiations in Ukraine.“We should be friendly towards the Trump administration where our interests converge, but this administration is doing things which are fundamentally a challenge to [New Zealand’s] national interests.”In Australia, the department of foreign affairs and trade said: “This incident is a matter for the United States. Australia and the United States engage regularly on implementation of mutually recognised standards for the protection of classified material.”Ben Doherty contributed additional reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationMark CarneyDonald TrumpYemenUS politicsUS foreign policyCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

The filing said the case deals with Trump’s complete and absolute authority to remove “designated terrorists participating in a state-sponsored invasion of, and predatory incursion into, the United States”.US deportees face brutal conditions in El Salvador mega-prison: ‘Severe overcrowding, inadequate food’Read moreIn response to the Trump administration’s invocation, the federal judge in the case said that if the administration would like to provide more information about the Alien Enemies Act operation, they should do so by 31 March.Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act on 15 March to expel Venezuelan immigrants in the US. That day, 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadoran men were placed on planes and sent to El Salvador, where they were then quickly detained in a massive “terrorism” prison run by the Salvadoran government. For over a week, a federaljudge has attempted to compel the Trump administrationto release information about the operation.The Trump administration has said all of the Venezuelans expelled are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, and has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that the gang “infiltrated” the US at the direction of the Venezuelan government. An intelligence document contradicts the Trump administration’s allegations. News reports, identifying some of the Venezuelans expelled toEl Salvador, have published evidence and claims from family members that they are innocent and not members of the gang.After the expulsion of the immigrants, federal judge James E Boasberg temporarily blocked the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act for further renditions. In a later court order, Boasberg doubled down on the block, instructing the federal government to conduct individualized hearings for immigrants set to be expelled via the act, to see if it even applies to them at all.As a result of Boasberg’s pushback, the Trump administration and its allies have attacked the judge, seeking to impeach him and engaging in a further battle against the judiciary. On Monday, a federal appeals court held a hearing on the Trump administration’s request to remove Boasberg from the case.The rapid expulsion of nearly 300 immigrants came about via a “nonpublic, sensitive, and high stakes negotiation”, secretary of state Marco Rubio said in a separate Monday declaration. The “sensitive” negotiation was likely with the Salvadoran government headed by President Nayib Bukele.For over a week, Boasberg has been attempting to compel the government to provide information about the use of the Alien Enemies Act, to no avail. Disclosing information about the operation, Rubio claimed, could place further pressure on US allies involved and jeopardize their relationship with the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Monday, two immigrant women provided declarations in federal court, saying eight women were also on the planes sent to El Salvador. The women were not admitted to the prison and were sent back to the US, because the Salvadoran facility only detains men.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationVenezuelaDonald TrumpEl SalvadorUS politicsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

But ESPN laterreportedthat asphyxia was ruled out because Miller Gardner’s air passages were not obstructed, though traces of vomit were present.A precise cause of death reportedly remained pending Tuesday, with officials awaiting an autopsy and an analysis of toxicology testing results.Miller Gardner had reportedly gone to eat at a restaurant before becoming ill along with other family members. His body was found in a hotel room in the popular Costa Rican resort area of Manuel Antonio, on the country’s Pacific coast.The Gardners’ statement said their family had “so many questions and so few answers at this point”.“Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,” Jessica and Brett Gardner said in the release.“He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”The Yankees said their organization was “filled with grief”.“Words feel insignificant and insufficient in trying to describe such an unimaginable loss,” a statement from the team said. “It wasn’t just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years – so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller.”Brett Gardner, 41, was drafted by the Yankees in 2005 and spent his entire Major LeagueBaseballcareer – from 2008 to 2021 – with the organization.

When Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning as Canada’s prime minister in January, he did so amid surging support for the Conservative opposition and a sense that its Trump-adjacent leader, Pierre Poilievre, might be the right candidate for a new political era. The Liberals’ near-decade in power appeared to be close to an end.Now, Trudeau’s successor, the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney,has called a snap general electionagainst a dramatically different political backdrop. With Donald Trump’s tariff war and musings about Canada’s future as a 51st state the inescapable mood music, many voters who had given up on the Liberals appear ready to give them another hearing – and Poilievre is trying to distance himself from the president whose methods he was once so happy to adopt.For today’s newsletter, I spoke toLeyland Cecco, who is covering the election for the Guardian, about the Liberals’ resurgent hopes – and why the other parties are struggling to respond. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesTrump administration| A catastrophic security leak triggered outrage in US politics after senior Trump administration officials accidentallybroadcast highly sensitive military plans through a Signal group chatwith a journalist reading along. The stunning breach implicates key figures in the Trump administration including the vice-president, JD Vance.Domestic violence|Domestic abusers are driving their victims to suicide, police have warned, as they admitted to past mistakes and pledged to investigate more “hidden” cases of violence against women. The concession came as deaths by suicide among victims of domestic abuse surpassed the number of people killed by an intimate partner for a second year in a row.UK economy| Rachel Reeveswill put £2bn into affordable housingin a bid to “sweeten the pill” of the spending cuts being announced at this week’s spring statement. The chancellor will set out one of the tightest budget buffers on record, with the Office for Budget Responsibility expected to put the government about £5bn in the red.Turkey| Turkish authorities havearrested more than 1,100 people including journalists, while bombarding the social media platform X with requests to block hundreds of accounts after tens of thousands took to the streets in the largest anti-government demonstrations in years.Archaeology| One of thebiggest and most important iron age hoards ever found in the UKhas been revealed, potentially altering our understanding of life in Britain 2,000 years ago. More than 800 objects were unearthed in a field near the village of Melsonby, North Yorkshire dating back to the first century.In depth: ‘The shift towards the Liberals is remarkable – but it’s not a coronation’View image in fullscreenCaptain Canuck? Mike Myers with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney in a Liberal party ad.Photograph: YoutubeFor a sense of the prevailing mood in Canadian politics,watch this Liberal party ad, featuring Mark Carney and former the Dr Evil, Mike Myers (pictured above). The two appear in Canada hockey shirts at an ice rink, where Carney interrogates Myers about his Canadian credentials with a series of pop culture questions, before Myers responds: “Let me ask you, Mr Prime Minister: will there always be a Canada?” Carney replies: “There will always be a Canada.” “All right!” says Myers. “Elbows up!”That’s a reference to the hockey shorthand for “protect yourself” that has become a rallying cry for Canadian efforts to fight back againstDonald Trump– and probably as close to as universally popular a political slogan as you are likely to find in 2025.“It got 10m views in less than 24 hours, which is unheard of in Canadian politics,” Leyland Cecco said. “Politics is secondary – but everyone is talking about the US tariffs, and Trump’s 51st state threat. The hockey stuff would be written off as too cute in any other election, but this time, it works.”Why has Carney called an election now?In theory, Carney could have waited until October, the deadline for the next election. But in calling a snap vote for 28 April, he has bet on seeking a mandate as Donald Trump’s tariffs start to bite. “He has opted for the shortest possible campaign,” Leyland said. “Party insiders and analysts think he has the momentum. The country doesn’t really know who he is – and that could go either way in a longer campaign, so let’s harness the goodwill now.”Another factor may be the peculiar circumstances of his prime ministership: he is only the second person to hold the job without being a member of parliament, a position that leaves him vulnerable to attack as absent from the real business of government.After parliament was prorogued – suspended – when Trudeau announced his resignation, it was due to return yesterday, “and Carney would have been dealing with a hostile parliament ready to bring the government down, and the bad optics of not being able to attend himself”, Leyland said. “The Liberals have looked at the writing on the wall, and decided to seize the moment.”What has Carney done as prime minister so far?“More than half of Carney’s speech announcing the election was dedicated to the idea that Canada is under attack,” Leyland said. “He said: ‘Donald Trump wants to break us so America can own us.’ That would have been unfathomable not long ago.”He also sought to present his brief tenure so far as evidence of his ability to act decisively, setting out work on security arrangements with Australia, France and the UK, discussions on a new trading arrangement with the EU, an end to the unpopular carbon tax and plans for legislation to remove federal barriers to internal trade. The motif that he returned to as he described these measures: “We are stronger together.”“He’s moved really fast,” Leyland said. “He made symbolic trips to France and the UK, in a nod to that part of Canada’s history, and he’s pivoted the party towards the centre. The carbon tax was a very unpopular policy, and now gas prices are going to drop pretty significantly a couple of weeks into the campaign. That was a key Conservative attack. For someone who is not a career politician, he’s done some very political things.”In the Globe and Mail, columnist Robyn Urback described his pilfering of Poilievre’s policies as “the other guy’s ideas, without the other guy”.How have the odds shifted in recent weeks?From 2023 until 15 February,CBC News’ polling analysisgave the Liberals a chance of less than 1% of winning a majority. Now, the same projection gives them a 78% chance of victory. And opinion poll averages that had the Liberals 23 points behind the Conservatives two months ago now put them a sliver ahead.“It’s hard to communicate the head-spinningly unprecedented nature of this swing,” Leyland said. That shift is down to two things: the resignation of Justin Trudeau, the unpopular Liberal prime minister of more than nine years – who then enjoyed a sudden renaissance just as he passed the baton; and Donald Trump’s tariffs and rhetoric, however ludicrous, about absorbing Canada as a 51st US state.“It looked for a long time like Trudeau had stayed too long,” Leyland said. (Seethis January analysis piecefor more on the logic for that view.) “Now, with the way it’s played out, it looks like it may have been the best possible timing to leave.”How have the Conservatives responded?With difficulty. Pierre Poilievre’s appeal to his party’s base was to a large extent predicated on the degree to which his style resembled Trump’s, whether ininsulting nicknames for opponentsorrelentless attacks on the media. That brand of politicswon him the endorsement of Elon Musk. Now it looks more like an albatross.Poilievre has sought to reposition himself as Trump’s hostility to Canada has increased, and said he would strongly oppose American tariffs; he has also tried to argue that “the lost Liberal decade has made our economy weaker and more divided, just like Trump wanted”.But a measure of the Conservatives’ tricky political position can be found in a shift in their slogan – and how problematic it still is: from “Canada is broken”, which now sounds alarmingly sympathetic to Trump’s analysis, to “Canada first” –which still inevitably reminds votersof the parallels between the two leaders.Still, Leyland added: “I don’t want to write Poilievre off. He is a very effective retail politician, good with crowds, and his message resonated for a long time. This is an election where the campaign could really matter.”Poilievre has not been helped by an interview given to the rightwing US outlet Breitbart by the Conservative premier of Alberta, Danielle Smith,in which she saidthat the tariff war had hurt Poilievre and added: “I would hope that we could put things on pause, is what I’ve told administration officials. Let’s just put things on pause so we can get through an election.”“She really hurt his campaign,” Leyland said. “Poll after poll asking who is best equipped not to sell Canada out to the US finds Carney way ahead. That issue is the biggest challenge Conservatives face.”What about the other parties?The Liberal resurgence has been bad news for the smaller parties, too, with both Bloc Québécois, the pro-independence regional party, and the progressive leftwing New Democratic party (NDP) both seeing a sharp decline in support.For Bloc Québécois, the problem is rooted in Quebec’s heavy reliance on trade with the US – and in a sense that defending Quebecers’ identity, or even seeking independence one day, rely first on a robust freedom from US influence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now the fear is that without a strong federal government, everyone’s in trouble.”The NDP, meanwhile, is haemorrhaging support to the Liberals. One hypothesis is that many of its previous supporters prefer the NDP, but now see that preference as outweighed by the threat from Trump. “People are abandoning the NDP,” Leyland said. “But they will still hope that criticisms of Carney for tacking toward the centre will land, and some voters decide that parliament needs a stronger left voice.”Even if the momentum appears to be firmly with Carney, there is still time for that to change. “He has never really been seriously tested as a politician, so the debates [on April 16 and 17] will be very closely watched,” Leyland said. “And it’s possible that he won’t show the endurance needed for a relentless campaign. You can imagine him coming off as too technocratic.

China denies it plays a role in the crisis, which is the leading cause of US drug overdose deaths, but the issue has become a major point of friction between the Trump administration and Chinese officials.“There is nothing to prevent China … from cracking down on fentanyl precursors,” Ratcliffe said.The spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, said Washington has long “hyped up” the China threat as an excuse to maintain US military hegemony.“China is determined to be a force for peace, stability and progress in the world, and also determined to defend our national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,” Liu said, adding that “fentanyl abuse is a problem that the United States itself must confront and resolve.”The committee hearing was overshadowed by Democratic senators grilling Ratcliffe and Gabbard over revelations that they and other top Trump officialsdiscussed highly sensitive military plans in a Signal messaging app groupthat accidentally included a journalist.China has debuted its new landing barges – what does this mean for Taiwan?Read moreBut US concerns about China dominated about a third of the 32-page report, which said Beijing was set to increase military and economic coercion toward Taiwan, the democratically governed island China claims as its territory.“The PLA probably is making steady but uneven progress on capabilities it would use in an attempt to seize Taiwan and deter – and if necessary, defeat – US military intervention,” it said.Still, it said, China faces “daunting” domestic challenges, including corruption, demographic imbalances, and fiscal and economic headwinds that could impair the ruling Communist party’s legitimacy at home.China’s economic growth probably will continue to slow because of low consumer and investor confidence, and Chinese officials appear to be bracing for more economic friction with the US, the report said.Explore more on these topicsUS national securityChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

An equal number of women were interviewed from each country.One in four women reported having experienced sexual violence, with more than half of the harassment against female MPs taking place on parliamentary premises and committed by male parliamentarians. Two respondents said they had been sexually assaulted.Such acts were often used to delegitimise women’s presence in politics and force them into silence or invisibility, the report concluded.The MPs questioned – all of whom were guaranteed anonymity – described an environment permeated by misogyny and routine harassment. One MP recalled a male colleague telling her: “If you show me your underwear, I’ll vote for you.”Another woman said her superior “tried to force me into his hotel room, whispering in my ear, ‘I can touch you, can’t I?’” A third woman was asked by a male colleague: “Why don’t you stay at home and in the kitchen with the children?”A parliamentary staff member also reported that women in her office kept an unofficial list of “weird male parliamentarians” to warn one another about repeat offenders.“Violence and sexism against women in politics is a direct assault on democracy,” said Martin Chungong, secretary general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the Geneva-based global organisation of legislatures that published the report, adding that “parliaments must be sanctuaries for healthy debate and law-making”.Brigitte Filion, the report’s author, said she was troubled by the serious risk faced by women in parliament. “Thelevel of threats, onlineand offline psychological trauma, sexual harassment and other offences has many consequences for their safety […] and their ability to fulfil their roles.“The dangers for the future generations are obvious: this can discourage young women from getting involved in politics.”Fighting for change: why the road to parliament is still rocky for women across AfricaRead moreYounger women and those from minority backgrounds reported disproportionately higher rates of abuse.Filion said that while some parliaments in the Asia-Pacific region had introduced confidential reporting systems and support services to address gender-based violence, none of the countries surveyed had adopted legislation specifically addressing violence against women in politics. Only16 out of 37 countries in the region have laws in place to tackle wotkplace harassment, according to the World Bank.“Policies or codes of conduct on harassment – including sexual harassment – are becoming more common; however, progress is slow and measures mainly concern parliamentary staff,” Filion said. “Parliaments need to ensure that both members of parliament and parliamentary staff are fully included and protected.”A previous IPU study revealed that more than 80% of MPs worldwide have experienced psychological violence, including humiliating sexist remarks, while 20% of global participants reported they had been subjected to sexual violence.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentWomen in politicsAsia PacificSexual harassmentGenderWomenSexual violencenewsShareReuse this content"

The mushroom experiment will be conducted on the last day by the Australian adventurer Eric Philips.Scientists hail ‘avalanche of discoveries’ from Euclid space telescopeRead morePhillips will be only the fourth Australian-born person to go to space, after Dr Paul Scully-Power and Dr Andy Thomas, who flew for Nasa as US citizens, and Dr Chris Boshuizen in 2021, whose suborbital journey aboard a Blue Origin vehicle lasted about 10 minutes.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailFOODiQ Global’s chief executive, Dr Flávia Fayet-Moore, described mushrooms as a “perfect space crop”, citing their fast growth, ability to be eaten raw and nutritional value.“Because we don’t have technology to process food in space yet … Nasa is currently prioritising research into ‘grow, pick and eat’ crops – things like lettuce, tomatoes and mushrooms,” she said.Mushrooms are one of the few foods that naturally contain vitamin D, which increases when they are exposed to ultraviolet light.“They double in size every day,” Fayet-Moore said. “They don’t need a lot of inputs: they don’t need any special fertilisers, they don’t need a lot of water.”“They also have potassium that’s found in vegetables, but then they also have selenium and copper, which are typically found in nuts and seeds,” she said. “It’s a very versatile example of a nutrient-dense food.”Food and nutrition for lunar and Mars missions numbers among the top 30 priorities in Nasa’s list ofcivil space challenges.Swollen eyeballs, baby-like skin, and the overview effect: how astronauts feel when they return to EarthRead moreIt is not the first time fungi have been sent to space.

And it is pressure that we will resist.”The Danish leader also dismissed the idea of the trip being a private visit, saying: “You cannot make a private visit with official representatives from another country.”Trump’s threats to acquire Greenland, she said, should be taken seriously. “President Trump is serious … He wants Greenland. Therefore, it cannot be seen independently of anything else,” she told Danmarks Radio (DR).Trump’s expansionism threatens the rules-based order in place since second world warRead moreShe said: “It is clearly not a visit that is about what Greenland needs or what Greenland wants from a visit. Therefore, no matter how we twist it, it is a completely unacceptable pressure on Greenland, the Greenlandic politicians and the Greenlandic population, but it is also on Denmark and thus the kingdom.”Copenhagen, Greenland’s former colonial ruler, retains control of security and foreign policy in the autonomous territory, which is still part of the kingdom of Denmark. Trump has repeatedly stated his desire for the US to gain control over the island, which he has said is crucial for American security.Greenland’s prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, has accused Washington of“foreign interference”in relation to the planned visit, amid political uncertainty in the territory as coalition talks continue less than a fortnight after a general election.The US president responded by saying the delegation had been invited by “officials” on the Greenlandic side. “People from Greenland are asking us to go there,” he told reporters on Monday.The Nuuk government, however, disputed that. “For the record, the Greenlandic government has not issued any invitations for visits, either official or private,” it said in a statement. “The current government is acting as an interim government pending the formation of a new coalition, and we have kindly requested all countries to respect this process.”Also due to participate in the visit from Thursday to Saturday are the White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, now embroiled in an embarrassingsecurity leak, and the energy secretary, Chris Wright.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its readout, the Kremlin said that it would only implement theBlack Sea ceasefireonce the US delivers sanctions relief on Russian agricultural products and fertilisers, as well as delisting a major state-owned bank called Rosselkhozbank that services the Russian agricultural industry.That would be the first significant rollback of sanctions on Russia since the war began, and indicates that Moscow will seek a dual price to halt its war against Ukraine: political and military concessions fromUkraineas well as an escape from the international isolation that began after its full-scale invasion in 2022.Russia and Ukraine agree to ‘eliminate the use of force’ in Black SeaRead moreAnd, so far, it looks like that is a deal that theTrump administrationis willing to make.“The ‘Russian art of the deal’ is selling Russian demands as Russian concessions to the Americans, and then demand sanctions relief on top,”wroteDr Janis Kluge, a researcher who focuses on the Russian economy at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a thinktank. “The demand here is that Ukraine is not allowed to attack Russian warships any more and Russia gets to inspect Ukrainian ships.”Any sanctions relief onRussiawill be limited by the readiness of Europe to take similar steps – but Tuesday’s deal still reflects a serious reorientation of the diplomacy around Ukraine and leaves Europe more isolated in restraining Russia.Ukraine had opposed any rollback on sanctions against the Kremlin. PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid that he considered it to be a “weakening of our position and the easing of sanctions” against Russia, a position that was not compatible with an “unconditional ceasefire” against energy infrastructure and at sea.It also appears that either the White House hid the plans to ease sanctions – or US negotiators were themselves surprised by the Russian demand that limits on trade and finance be eased in order to achieve the main deliverable that the White House wants: the ability to declare even a partial ceasefire in Ukraine.“This wasn’t in the agenda before the meeting,” Zelenskyy said on Tuesday. “The Russians, as far as we know, have raised the issue of the American assistance to transport their agricultural products … We didn’t agree to that so that it would be in our common [statement].”Zelenskyy sought to sound upbeat during his remarks, and said that at least now Kyiv could appeal to the White House if Russia chose to violate the ceasefire against Ukraine in the coming month. Ukraine could also demand new sanctions against Russia if that happens, he said.But there are considerable doubts that Trump would be ready to slap further sanctions on Russia. And Steve Witkoff, his envoy, has spent “really a lot of time in dialogue with Putin”, said Zelenskyy, explaining why the White House messaging on the war sounds so much like the Kremlin narrative.In negotiations, a deal that does not work for both sides will collapse sooner or later. Tuesday’s agreement – and the separate statements that have emerged – will raise further questions of whether the US can mediate a conflict in which it appears to clearly sympathise with the Kremlin.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

He has denied any wrongdoing.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesGérard DepardieuGérard Depardieu tells court he grabbed sexual assault accuser by hips to avoid slippingActor denies assault and says he was following advice of his then lawyer when he previously told police there had been no physical contactAngelique Chrisafisin ParisTue 25 Mar 2025 13.22 EDTFirst published on Tue 25 Mar 2025 08.07 EDTShareThe French actorGérard Depardieuhas admitted in court that he grabbed the hips of a woman who has accused him of sexual assault, but said it was to avoid slipping and was not a sexual attack.“I grabbed her hips,” the actor, 76, told his trial for sexual assault at the Paris criminal court on Tuesday. The head judge noted that this was a change from his testimony during police interrogation when he had denied that any physical contact had taken place with the 54-year-old set decorator.Depardieu is on trial for the alleged sexual assault of the set dresser as well as alleged sexual assaults of a 34-year-old assistant director during the shooting of the feature film Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in 2021.He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted. He denies any wrongdoing, telling the court on Tuesday: “I deny all of it.”Depardieu – the biggest French cinema star to face trial for sexual assault since the#MeToo movement– said: “I grabbed her hips so as not to slip because I was so upset by her, by the heat. It was a Friday – it was the end of a film shoot with a man who was very tired.”In cross-examination by the state prosecutor, Depardieu later said: “I placed my hands on the woman’s hips to speak to her.”Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, lawyer for the complainant, asked the actor if he had lied during the police investigation when he told officers he had never touched the woman. Depardieu said: “I didn’t lie. I was following the advice of my [then] lawyer. Now I’m telling the truth.”The court heard that the set decorator, Amélie, had been working on styling film sets in a building in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on 10 September 2021.She told the court that Depardieu, who had been seated on a stool in the corridor between takes, began talking to her about the set and complained of the heat in the building. She said he told her: “It’s so hot, I can’t get an erection.” He also allegedly said: “I know how to make a woman come without touching her.”After he went to another room to film a scene, he returned to sit in the same corridor, she told the court. He asked Amélie why she was on the phone to her “bloke”, she said. She told him she was in fact busy on the phone trying to track down parasols for the film. He allegedly said: “Come and touch my big parasol. I’ll stick it in your pussy.”Amélie alleged that he then grabbed her hips, pulled her towards him and trapped her between his thighs with great force, and grabbed her body, including her pubis, waist and chest. “He grabbed me by the hips, pulled me forwards [towards him], trapped me with his legs,” she said.“That’s where I understood the strength he had, he held me very, very hard. I remember his eyes, I saw this big face, red eyes, very angry, very agitated. And he was saying: ‘Come touch my big parasol’, with a crazy look. I’ve never seen anything like that. That phrase is so idiotic; how would I have invented that – it makes no sense to talk of genitals like a parasol.”She said: “That fear that I felt – what stands out for me is not his sexual desire, but his savagery. It was the fact that he knew I was afraid – I saw his eyes light up with a kind of pleasure in making someone afraid. I remember that savagery. He really terrified me, and that amused him.”Depardieu denied assault. He said he had been unhappy with Amélie’s work as a set decorator, because a bedroom scene wasn’t ready and was done poorly. He had made comments that Amélie couldn’t even run a bric-a-brac shop let alone decorate a set, he said.Depardieu said he weighed 150kg at the time and was so overweight he couldn’t possibly have gripped anyone between his thighs. He told the panel of three judges: “I would never put anyone between my legs. You can do a test if you like – with the paunch I have, I can’t do it.”He said he did tend to make vulgar comments on set, telling the court he could often shout things like “Pussy! Pussy!”When the head judge questioned that he would actually speak like that on a film set, he said he could: “If it’s hot, if I’m in a bad mood, things always go on too long.”Depardieu said: “I don’t see why I would go around groping a woman, her buttocks, her breasts. I’m not somebody who rubs himself against others on the Métro.I’ve been told that exists, I don’t know about those types of things, there are so many vices I don’t know.” He said there was no way he would put his hands on a woman’s backside.He said, however, that he did use crude language on set but just to be “provocative” and to “relax” people. Asked by the head judge if he had said: “It’s so hot I can’t get an erection”, Depardieu replied: “Maybe I said that, yes, why not?”Depardieu said the media had used the allegations against him to damage his reputation. He attacked the #MeToo movement as well as the women who had held protest placards outside a concert tour he was giving at the time of the allegations. “This movement is going to become a terror,” he said.Amélie told the court that no conversation had taken place with Depardieu where he had criticised her work.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuFrance#MeToo movementEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

An Istanbul court initially ruled the journalists should be released before reversing the decision and issuing an official arrest order, according to their lawyers and representatives.Among the detained are Yasin Akgül of Agence France-Presse and the former AFP photojournalist Bülent Kılıç, who wasnamed Guardian agency photographer of the year in 2014for his coverage of Ukraine, events on the Turkish border with Syria and the deadly crash of flight MH17.They were held after photographing mass anti-government demonstrations that have sweptTurkeyfor the first time in years, prompted by the arrest of Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu last week. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in connection with the protests.The journalists were all charged with “taking part in illegal rallies and marches and failing to disperse despite warnings”, court documents showed.Akgül’s arrest drew a sharp rebuke by AFP chairman Fabrice Fries, who said his detention was “unacceptable”.“This is why I am asking you to intervene as quickly as possible to obtain the rapid release of our journalist,” Fries said in a letter addressed to the Turkish presidency.“Yasin Akgül was not part of the protest,” he wrote. “It is the job of a photographer to be where the events are occurring, including getting between protesters and the forces of order.”People in Turkey: share your views and experiences of recent protestsRead moreThe court decision was also slammed as “scandalous” by Reporters Without Borders, with the Turkish Photojournalists Union denouncing it as “unlawful, unconscionable and unacceptable”.İmamoğlu is a longstanding rival of the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the lone candidate seen as capable of challenging him at the ballot box in an upcoming election. On the same day that İmamoğlu was sent to a high-security facility on the edge of Istanbul, he was also nominated as a presidential candidate by his opposition Republican People’s party.Demonstrations that began outside Istanbul city hall have quickly grown, with tens of thousands gathering each night to vent their frustration at decades of rule by Erdoğan and his Justice and Development party (AKP).The protests have drawn an increasingly fierce response by the Turkish authorities. Turkish interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said 1,418 people have been arrested in connection with demonstrations in the past week.“While there are currently 979 suspects in custody, 478 people will be brought to court today,” he said. “No concessions will be made to those who attempt to terrorise the streets, to attack our national and moral values, and our police officers.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The agency’s analysts estimate that millions of messages in the UK and other western countries have been shared relating to sexual and physical abuse.The NCA director general, Graeme Biggar, said: “These groups are not lurking on the dark web, they exist in the same online world and platforms young people use on a daily basis.“Operating online clearly makes these offenders feel protected and out of reach but that is absolutely not the case. There have already been convictions; we and partners have made arrests in the UK and overseas, and further investigations are ongoing.”The warning follows growing concerns about boys and young men in the online “manosphere”, after the Netflix hit Adolescence became themost talked about TV show of the yearfor its depiction of the relationship between online “incel” culture and real-world harm.Keir Starmer responded to the show, saying there was “a problem with boys and young men that we need to address”, while the former England football manager Gareth Southgatewarnedof “toxic influencers”.The NCA highlighted this emerging phenomenon in its national strategic assessment, an annual report that outlines the serious and organised crime threats facing the UK.In the report, Biggar said criminals were exploiting “the societal shift to living more of our lives online”, and that this threat was diversifying, including “a growing overlap with online radicalisation to serious violence and extremism”, while artificial intelligence was making it easier to scale up offending.The NCA and UK police have identified a number of cases in which girls, some as young as 11, have been coerced into seriously harming or sexually abusing themselves, siblings or pets. In some instances, victims have been groomed into offending, while some young girls have been encouraged to take their own lives.Membership of these communities is loose and, although adults are involved, offenders are predominantly teenage boys who often share sadistic, misogynistic and nihilistic material on social media platforms, and who target those their own age or younger, the NCA found.Evidence suggests these offenders are motivated by gaining notoriety and status from the harm they inflict and the depravity of the content they share. These networks share content relating to a diverse range of extreme belief systems that they use to justify violence.Some offenders are also motivated by sexual gratification, while others seek to profit from criminality. The use of coercion and extortion tactics are common; for example, manipulating victims by grooming them, or convincing them they are in a relationship. This results in victims being fearful to come forward, contributing to under-reporting of offences.Alastair Simpson, an assistant chief constable and national policing lead for child sexual exploitation and abuse, said undercover online officers played a “vital” role in tackling these networks.“My message to anyone who is exploiting children online: remember that there is no space where criminals operate that we cannot go, and investigations into these networks have already begun,” he said.The NCA said it was working with police, as well as tech companies, safeguarding agencies, psychologists and academic experts to better understand how young people become offenders. The agency also encouraged parents to speak to children about what they do online.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The attack was totally successful.”The Atlantic reported that Waltz, who was a congressman representing Florida before being appointed national security adviser by Trump, sent a connection request on the chat app Signal to the magazine’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, on 11 March. Goldberg was then included in a chat group in which detailed information about plans for an attack on the Houthi armed group in Yemen was shared.Trumptold NBC Newsthat Goldberg’s presence in the chat had “no impact at all” on the military operation, and defended Waltz, claiming that the leak was “the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one”, as the White House sought to downplay the incident.Asked how Goldberg was added to the chat, Trump said: “It was one of Michael’s people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there.”Goldberg said he assumed he was being spoofed until the attacks inYemenoccurred exactly as the participants described in the chat.In his first public comments since the Atlantic story broke, Waltz on Tuesday said: “We are looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room.”Key figures in theTrump administration, including Waltz; the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard; were present in the Signal chat.On Tuesday morning Gabbard attempted to dodge questions about the leak during a Senate intelligence committee meeting.Stunning Signal leak reveals depths of Trump administration’s loathing of EuropeRead more“Senator, I don’t want to get into this,” Gabbard said when asked by Mark Warner, the senator from Virginia, if she had participated in the chat.Appearing alongside the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, Gabbard claimed “there was no classified material” in the Signal chat.Ratcliffe said that when he was confirmed as CIA director he was briefed by agency officials about “the use of Signal as a permissible work use” and “a practice that preceded the current administration to the Biden administration”.A White House statement released on Tuesday afternoon said: “Democrats and their media allies have seemingly forgotten that President Donald J Trump and his national security team successfully killed terrorists who have targeted US troops and disrupted the most consequential shipping routes in the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Don Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska,told CNNthe debacle was a “gross error” for which there was “no excuse”.“They intentionally put highly classified information on an unclassified device. I would have lost my security clearance in the air force for this and for a lot less,” Bacon said. “I will guarantee you, 99.99% with confidence, Russia and China are monitoring those two phones.

It was not clear why.In a statement the IDF said there was a violent confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis after “terrorists” threw rocks at Israeli citizens.“IDF and Israeli Police forces arrived to disperse the confrontation, at this point, several terrorists began hurling rocks at the security forces,” the statement said.“The forces apprehended three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at them, as well as an Israeli civilian involved in the violent confrontation. The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel Police.”Basel Adra, another of No Other Land’s four directors, who are all from Israel and Palestine, told the Guardian he thought the escalating settler violence might be a response to the international recognition won by the documentary.“Palestinians in the village have been under physical attack by settlers almost daily. The settlers’ violence is increasing here. Maybe it’s a revenge for the movie and the Oscar,” he said.Adra, who witnessed the attack in Susya described the violence as “horrific”. “There were dozens of settlers together with the Israeli soldiers and they were threatening us with weapons,” he said. “The police were there from the beginning and did not intervene. While the soldiers were pointing their weapons at us, the settlers started attacking the houses of the Palestinians.“Hamdan tried to protect his family and the settlers attacked him. Soldiers started shooting in the air to prevent anyone to help Hamdan. He was shouting for help. They let the settlers attack him and then the army abducted him.”Nasser’s Israeli co-director Yuval Abraham posted on X: “A group of settlers just lynched Hamdan Ballal, co director of our film no other land. They beat him and he has injuries in his head and stomach, bleeding. Soldiers invaded the ambulance he called, and took him. No sign of him since.”This is not the first time that directors and member of crew ofNo Other Landhave been attacked by settlers.Last February,Adrawas also surrounded and attacked by masked Israeli settlers.Earlier on Monday,Adrawrote on X that “armed and masked settlers” were “leading a terror attack onMasafer Yatta” as he was writing.“Dozens of settlers arrived at my friend Naser’s house in Susya, throwing stones at his home, smashing his vehicle, and slashing [the vehicle’s tyres with knives],” he added.“We risked our life to film,” he said, noting that “soldiers are ordering us to stay inside our homes in the village, while those who attack and could’ve slaughtered the residents in their homes roam freely, masked, around the village”.Israel’s culture minister has called the Oscar win for the joint Palestinian-Israeli documentary “a sad moment for the world of cinema”.Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelNo Other LandDocumentary filmsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She is also expected to squeeze future Whitehall spending plans to ensure she is on target to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules, despite weaker OBR projections – with full details to be set out in June’s spending review.Since the OBR last gave its assessment in October, government borrowing costs have risen and economic growth has been weaker than hoped. Reeves will underscore her determination to go “further and faster,” to kickstart the economy.Some in Labour had urged Reeves to flex her fiscal rules instead of outlining future spending cuts – but the Treasury fears that any sign of indiscipline would risk spooking bond markets and driving borrowing costs up further.One Labour source said ministers have become frustrated with the way the OBR process works, with last-minute forecast changes significantly affecting policy. “They think the process needs to change, but they can’t go around, for market reasons, shaking it up too much,” they said.With Donald Trump’s administration withdrawing from transatlantic defence cooperation and threatening to impose sweeping tariffs next month, Reeves will repeatedly stress how much the global context has changed.“Our task is to secure Britain’s future in a world that is changing before our eyes. The job of a responsible government is not simply to watch this change,” she will say.But analysts warn that these historic shifts mean that even after promising spending cuts, Reeves may still have to increase taxes to meet rapidly growing pressure for higher defence spending.Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: “Even a small change to the spending plans is going to make this an even more difficult spending review in June, and I think the bigger risk is that we get speculation starting on Thursday about which taxes are going to rise in the autumn – and I think that is really quite politically risky, and economically damaging.”Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: “We just don’t know how they intend to increase spending above 2.5% – that’s the really big one. That’s what’s changed.” He added: “The thing that’s really going to have to shift is her pledges on tax.”Prof Jonathan Portes, of King’s College London, said: “I don’t think they should be making big policy changes now, but I do think over time they will have to reform and increase taxes.”Reeves will tell MPs the move to increase defence spending, which saw the development minister Anneliese Dodds resign in protest at the aid cuts, was “the right decision in a more insecure world”.“This government was elected to change our country. To provide security for working people. And deliver a decade of national renewal. That work of change began in July – and I am proud of what we have delivered in just nine months,” she will say.The chancellor and her Treasury team have been trying to limit the likely fallout from Wednesday’s announcement, aware that both the cuts to Whitehall departments and the welfare impact assessments are likely to cause anger on the Labour benches.One Labour MP said: “Wednesday will be just as important for those impact assessments as for the spring statement itself – that’s when people will start to make their mind up about whether they will vote for these cuts or not.”Officials say they are planning to hold a vote on the changes to personal independence payments in May, with about 30 Labour MPs currently thinking of rebelling.Darren Jones, the Treasury chief secretary, held a meeting with about 100 frontbenchers on Tuesday to lay the ground for the spending cuts to come. People who attended that meeting told the Guardian he had spent much of it insisting that the spending reductions did not amount to austerity, given they are around half the scale of those made by George Osborne as chancellor from 2010 to 2015.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, told the Guardian on Tuesday: “We can’t do everything for everyone, everywhere, all at once. There are lots of things we would like to do now, but we’re having to bide our time so that we can fix the economy, because having those firm economic foundations is the essential prerequisite for everything else we need.”Reeves will announce details of a government transformation fund that Whitehall departments will be able to bid into, to pay for productivity-boosting projects such as overhauling out-of-date IT. Treasury ministers claim this will allow them to do more with less in future years, easing the impact of tighter budgets on public services.She will confirm on Wednesday she will start moving money from the aid budget to defence immediately, dashing the hopes of some Labour MPs who hoped the cuts to the development budget would be delayed until 2027.Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of the international development committee, said: “The government’s statement on cutting aid has had a chilling effect on development projects and staff morale, but it has also had very real consequences. Contract renewals are paused and new projects on hold. Whichever way to pack it, cuts are happening now.”The £2.2bn increase in defence spending from April will bring the country’s military spending up from 2.3% in 2024-25 to 2.36% in 2025-26. Ministers have promised to hit the 2.5% target in two years’ time.The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said Reeves, not global events, was to blame for the slowdown in the economy. “Our national security demands a strong economy. Yet since Rachel Reeves’s first budget, growth is down, borrowing is up and business confidence has been destroyed,” he said.A government spokesperson said: “We have set out a sweeping package of reforms to health and disability benefits that genuinely support people back into work, while putting the welfare system on a more sustainable footing so that the safety net is always there to protect those who need it most.”Additional reportingAletha AduExplore more on these topicsUK newsRachel ReevesSpring statement 2025Office for Budget ResponsibilityBudget deficitEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

It is completely intolerable. It doesn’t serve in Israel’s self interest. It cannot be justified as self-defence, and it has got to stop.”He added: “It’s very frustrating, let me tell you, being a member of the cabinet the United Kingdom and still feeling powerless in the face of this appalling conflict which does nothing for Israelis or Palestinians.”The health secretary’s remarks came in a wide-ranging interview during which he reflected on the flurry of angry emails and messages he received for saying there was an “overdiagnosis” of mental illness.View image in fullscreenWes Streeting at Conway Hall.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverWhile he said he understood why people emailed him with a strength of feeling, he stopped short of apologising, but acknowledged: “We’ve got to handle this in a sensitive way, and I reflect on your feedback … to handle this in a sensitive way”.ThreeNHSpatients who were angry at his comments on young people with mental illness interrupted Streeting as he spoke at the start of the event. They shouted “your cuts will kill” and held a banner which read: “Disability cuts will kill”, as they criticised his support for the planned cuts to personal independence payments to disabled people.Labour is gaslighting disabled people – and that should terrify us all | Zoe WilliamsRead moreReflecting on the government’s unpopular decision to cut disability benefits and foreign aid, Streeting urged Labour’s critical friends to “cut us some slack”.“The government’s been in for five minutes,” he said. “I know it’s hard and some choices we’ve made are unpopular but look at the scale of the challenge.”Defending the growing use of the private sector to tackle NHS waiting lists, Streeting added it is not just the “pragmatic thing to do” but the “principled thing to do” if there is spare capacity in the private sector for the NHS to use, so people can be seen faster.Explore more on these topicsWes StreetingIsrael-Gaza warLabourNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It means the initial timeline of two years for implementing the law will now stretch to four.The earliest an assisted dying service is now expected to beoperational is 2029, the year by which the next general election must take place, raising fears among backers of the bill that ministers would be reluctant to push through such a controversial change before voters go to the polls.A spokesperson for Leadbeater said she “hopes and believes the service can be delivered more quickly” but that the changes made to the bill since the autumn meant it would “inevitably take longer to implement”.The delay marks the latest major change to the assisted dying proposals, which have proven deeply contentious in the Commons and beyond.The new four-year timeline will only become official once it is approved by the Commons committee scrutinising the bill, which was due to discuss the proposed change on Tuesday night.Tom Gordon, a Liberal Democrat MP who sits on the committee, said that “delaying implementation risks pushing it beyond the next election, where it could be abandoned altogether”. “We have thoroughly scrutinised and strengthened this bill, ensuring it is safe and robust. Every extra year means more unnecessary suffering for those who cannot afford to wait,” Gordon said.Another MP who supports assisted dying said: “I fear it risks politicising it massively – if it has been through parliament and got support of the public then potentially making it an election issue is not desirable at all. It might have been easier just to not have a deadline at all.” A third supportive MP said they “can’t see Whitehall seeing this as anything other than a chance to delay it indefinitely”.If approved, the bill would allow terminally ill adults in England andWaleswho are expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life. MPs voted in support of the proposal in November.The bill’s supporters had originally intended for it to become law this year and its implementation to begin within two years, in 2027, meaning an assisted dying service would be established well before the next election.Leadbeater’s spokesperson said: “Kim has always been clear that it’s more important to get the assisted dying legislation right than to do it quickly.“The bill now contains even stronger safeguards than when it was first tabled, with a new judge-led voluntary assisted dying commission and multi-disciplinary panels to examine every application. These will inevitably take longer to implement.“But the four-year limit is not a target, it’s a backstop. Kim hopes and believes the service can be delivered more quickly if it becomes law later this year.”Wes Streeting paid tribute to Leadbetter’s “leadership through this process” praising her for constructively engaging with ministers, and her “willingness to compromise through the process”.“I can’t fault the way in which she has tried to engage with people, including critics, on this issue, and that’s been reflected in the decision of the bill committee today,” the health secretary said in an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday night.Jeevun Sandher, a Labour MP supportive of the bill, said: “All of these changes strengthen the bill. Extending the timeline to make absolutely sure we have enough time seems sensible to me. I hope and believe this choice will be available well before the four-year mark.”Pro-assisted dying campaigners expressed disappointment in the change. Andrew Copson, chief executive of Humanists UK, said: “Many other countries already have safe assisted dying laws and none of them has taken more than 19 months to implement them, apart from one that was subject to a court challenge. So it really shouldn’t have to take four years.”Opponents said the delayed timeline was symptomatic of wider problems with the bill. Jess Asato, a Labour MP, said: “Putting an arbitrary timeline on such a complex issue was never a sensible way to make life or death legislation. This last-minute switch demonstrates again just how chaotic this whole process has been with substantial last-minute changes to core sections of the bill.”In a significant change to the original proposals,last month Leadbeater removedthe need for every assisted dying case to be scrutinised by a high court judge after concerns this could overwhelm the court system. Instead, cases will be reviewed by panels including a senior lawyer, a psychiatrist and a social worker.Elsewhere on Tuesday, the Isle of Man’s parliament approved a bill to legalise assisted dying, making it the first place in the British Isles to introduce the change.The legislation, which will now be put forward for royal assent, will give terminally ill people “autonomy and choice” at the end of their lives, said Dr Alex Allinson, a GP and politician who introduced the private member’s bill in 2022.The bill only covers adults resident on the island for five years and who have a terminal illness with a life expectancy of no more than 12 months. They must also have a settled intention to end their life. Doctors will be free to choose whether they want to opt in to providing the service.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingHouse of CommonsEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the Met said in a statement: “Following enquiries to date, officers have found no evidence to suggest that the incident was suspicious in nature. As such, we are no longer treating this as a potentially criminal matter, although we continue to support other partners, including colleagues from National Grid, London fire brigade and SSEN, with whom we remain in close contact.“Should any relevant new information or evidence come to light it will be looked at and considered as appropriate.”The fire resulted in no planes being allowed to take off or land, causing diversions which affected about 1,300 flights. Some flights resumed on Friday evening but airlines faced difficulties and passengers were disrupted due to airline crew being in different parts of the world.The decision to close the airport was questioned by the head of the National Grid who said that there was enough power forthe airport to remain openduring the entire period it was shut down.John Pettigrew said two other substations that served Heathrow were working and could have supplied the airport with all the power it needed to remain open. “There was no lack of capacity from the substations,” he said. “Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow.”The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has ordered the National Energy System Operator to investigate what happened and provide its initial findings within six weeks. An internal review of the airport’s crisis management plans and its response will be undertaken by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, who is an independent member of Heathrow’s board.Heathrow’s chief executive Thomas Woldbye will be grilled by MPs on 2 April at a one-off session investigating the closure of the airport. A spokesperson for the airport told the Guardian on Monday: “This was an unprecedented issue which began with a fire at an off-airport substation, in less than 24 hours the entire airport was rebooted from a standing start and we delivered a full schedule from Saturday onwards.“There are two reviews into the systems and response both at Heathrow and with the wider grid infrastructure. We will support these and lessons will be learned where needed.”Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

The man she was visiting has been charged with her murder.Dowells, a hairdresser, was visiting her husband, David Brinson, 54, who was convicted in the 1990s of murdering four men during a robbery and sentenced to four consecutive life terms without parole.On 13 November, Brinson called prison officials, reporting that his wife had passed out. Officers began life-saving measures and called 911, but Dowells was pronounced dead shortly after. The Amador county sheriff’s office later confirmed she had been strangled and ruled her death a homicide.Prison officials and the district attorney’s office are investigating, with charges pending autopsy and prison reports, Riebe said.Dowells’ son, Armand Torres, 28, and his wife, Nataly Jimenez, toldNBC Newsthat Brinson’s account of events kept changing in the days following her death, including the time and location where he found her unconscious.“He would say, you know, she passed out on the floor, or she was passed out on the bed,” Jimenez said in an interview.Dowells lived in Inglewood, California, with Torres, Jimenez, and their three-year-old son, who called Brinson “Grandpa”. The couple had allowed their son to accompany Dowells on two prison visits in recent years.“If I could trust him with my kid, I’m thinking, it’s a green light,” Torres said of Brinson. “You know, like, everything’s fine.”Torres admitted he sometimes worried about his mother being involved with an incarcerated person but wanted to support her happiness. He was unaware Brinson, who is not Torres’s father, had been convicted of four murders.“We really love our mom, and we just wanted her to be happy, you know, and she usually came back happy,” he said. “They talked on the phone every day, everything seemed good. I’m all for second chances.”He recalled overhearing his mother and Brinson argue on the phone but didn’t think much of it.“Stephanie always tried to see the good in people,” Jimenez added.Thomas, the other victim, was found unconscious on 1 July 2024, in a family visiting unit while visiting her partner, Anthony Curry.Curry, 48, is serving a life sentence for attempted second-degree murder and a separate 13-year sentence for carjacking with a firearm. He has been charged with Thomas’s murder but has not yet been arraigned.The California department of corrections and rehabilitation allows certain prisoners to have family visits in private, apartment-like facilities on prison grounds, lasting 30 to 40 hours. The program aims to support positive family connections and rehabilitation. Death row inmates, sex offenders and those with disciplinary restrictions are excluded.The practice of family visits began in the early 1900s at Mississippi’s Parchman prison, initially for Black prisoners under racist assumptions about labor motivation. By the 1990s, 17 states offered family visits, which advocates say help maintain relationships and reduce prison violence.Currently, only California, Connecticut, New York and Washington allow such visits, with strict eligibility requirements. No federal prisons offer them. Each state has different program names and rules, such as Connecticut requiring a minor child and another adult family member to be present.Research shows that conjugal and family visits benefit prisoners overall, with incidents of violence being rare.One study showeda 25% drop in misconduct by people while incarcerated, andanother study founda 26% decrease in recidivism.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaUS prisonsWest CoastUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

It demands documentary proof for citizenship such as a passport to be eligible to vote in federal elections, empowers federal agencies to cut funding to states deemed non-compliant and instructs the Department of Justice to prosecute what the White House paints as “election crimes”.All the executive orders Trump has signed so farRead moreThe measure also seeks to block states from accepting mail-in ballots after election day, regardless of when they are mailed in.Many of the provisions in the order are likely to be quickly challenged and are legally suspect. The US constitution explicitly gives states and Congress the authority to set the rules for election and does not authorize the president to do so.“The short answer is that this executive order, like all too many that we’ve seen before, is lawless and asserts all sorts of executive authority that he most assuredly does not have,” said Danielle Lang, a voting rights lawyer at the non-profit Campaign Legal Center.Republicans have long sought to add a citizenship to the federal form and been stymied by the courts. Ina 7-2 decisionin 2013, for example, the US supreme court said that Arizona could not require proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. The power to set the requirements on the federal form is left to the bipartisan Election Assistance Commission.Courts have also blockedefforts to short-circuit efforts to add the question.The order tracks with a controversial bill in CongressSafeguard American Voter Eligibility(Save) Act, which would require Americans to prove citizenship in person – a requirement that could immediately eliminate mail-in and online voter registrationalready across 42 states, as well as DC and Guam.Trump signs executive order to dismantle US Department of EducationRead moreAll metrics point to these actions making it harder, not easier, for Americans to vote. According to thestate department in 2023, fewer than half of all Americans had a valid passport, and nearly 69 million women who have changed their names would struggle to produce matching documentation, according to aCenter for American Progress analysis.Kansas had a law requiring proof of citizenship in effect between 2013 and 2016. It wound up putting the registrations of 30,000 people in jeopardy – the vast majority of whom were eligible to vote.The Center for Democracy and Civic Engagementreported in 2024that roughly 21 million voting-age Americans, about 9% of the population, do not have a current, valid ID.Despite Trump’s claims of widespread election fraud, federal lawalready prohibits non-citizensfrom voting, with penalties including up to five years in prison. Current election systems alreadyuse multiple federal databasesto verify voter eligibility, including citizenship data from the Department of Homeland Security.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rhetoric and subsequent follow through represents a potentially transformative – and deeply controversial – approach to voter eligibility that could redefine access to the ballot box.“Perhaps some people think I shouldn’t be complaining because we won in a landslide, but we got to straighten out our election,” Trump said as he signed Tuesday’s order.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS voting rightsUS immigrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Musk, the world’s richest man, has been tasked byDonald Trumpwith drastically slashing the federal government workforce and costs.The situation raisesconflict of interest questionsfor one of Trump’s closest allies who backed him with millions of dollars of funding in the 2024 election. Musk boasts that his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) “slashes spending”, but critics say he’s using his position to steer government funding toward his companies.Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service installed in White HouseRead moreNoaa could offer the biggest prizes yet for Musk, presenting the opportunity forSpaceXto have a commanding financial advantage in a commercial US space market expected to grow to a value of nearly $2tn in value over the next decade. Already Doge likely has access to competitors’ confidential business information at Noaa, former employees at the agency say.More importantly for the public, it would put control of the nation’s communications infrastructure in the hands of a rightwing billionaire. Noaa’s activity quietly touches the basic functions of daily life, and everything from dependable cellphone service to how Americans connect to the internet to weather forecasting is at stake, five former Noaa employees who spoke with the Guardian said.“There’s a lot of smoke but we’re not sure where the fire is yet,” a former employee said. “We’re waiting to see when the next shoe drops.”In the wake of a firing spree that gutted some Noaa space operations, Donald Trump Jr’s investment firm stoked speculation bypurchasing$50m worth of SpaceX shares. Noaa operates as part of the US commerce department and is responsible for a range of economic activity relied upon by the public. Musk’s Doge team has laid off about 1,300 Noaa staff so far.SpaceX primarily launches rockets and satellites for Musk and national governments. Starlink, meanwhile, has nearly 6,000 satellites in low-earth orbit and provides satellite broadband internet service and military communications to at least 2.7 million people in 100 countries.SpaceX is the biggest player in the private space industry and several former Noaa employees praised the company as an often good partner prior to Musk’s attack on the agency. The space technology company had strong momentum prior to the newTrump administration, making it difficult to parse what is legitimate business and what could be construed as corruption, former employees said.A new emergency Freedom of Information Actrequestfor communications among Noaa offices and Doge in part seeks to shine some light on those questions. The Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) request noted that privatization of the agency has long been a goal of the right and was called for in the Project 2025 rightwing playbook. The move “is driven by greed and corruption”, Peer’s executive director, Tim Whitehouse, said.“The danger is that Musk’s enterprises could morph into government-sponsored monopolies that would operate with no fear of antitrust prosecution,” Whitehouse added.New contracts for StarlinkLeadership for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered staff in February to find tens of millions of dollars in funding for new Starlink contracts,Rolling Stonereported. The FAA is in the process of updating ageing air traffic control networks and last year awarded a $2.4bn contract to Verizon, but Starlink has already edged into the process.At the US Government Services Administration, Doge ordered federal staff to use Starlink for internet services, an employeetold NBC News. Another agency plans to contract with Starlink, according to a federal employee familiar with the situation who spoke with NBC News. Meanwhile, Customs and Border Protectionrecently authorizedan evaluation of Starlink to help monitor the border.Gutting space traffic controlThe nascent space traffic coordination program manages thousands of satellites, debris and spacecraft, and helps prevent up to 50,000 near-collisions, called conjunctions, daily. Starlink accounts for a large number of those.Called theTraffic Coordination System for Space(Traccs), the program would also eventually provide launch and re-entry services for commercial satellites and spacecraft, former employees said. Musk’s company already works closely with Traccs, but the program has avoided “vendor lock” and contracts with multiple companies, in no small part because Musk’s agenda may not always align with the nation’s, one former official said.“SpaceX is a great service provider, but as long as he’s in control of the company it’s not anything that can be counted on,” a former Noaa employee said.Those who spoke with the Guardian said it didn’t appear that SpaceX had any interest in privatizing or taking over Traccs prior to Trump’s re-election, but Musk’s Doge fired all but one Traccs member – in effect crippling a sorely needed operation. That could open the door for privatization, and SpaceX is best positioned.“They discover something is broken and conveniently say: ‘Oh, we can fix this,’” a former Noaa employee said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But private industry’s data and forecasts are of extremely poor quality compared to those from the Noaa, a former employee said.Noaa weather satellites have redundancies and fail-safes intentionally built in, and huge effort is put into calibrating them with weather on earth: Noaa flies planes into storms to confirm that the data its satellites are providing is accurate, for example.The data is “highly reliable, 24/7, no breakdowns, no ifs, ands or buts”, a former agency employee said. If Noaa satellites fail, explode or crash, they added, then people who rely on that data may die, or serious economic damage may be inflicted.“The risk of having outages is so significant because that data is used all the time for everything, and for far more than people realize,” a former employee said.Musk, by contrast, has a mission of eliminating redundancies and finding efficiencies, and former agency employees noted his rockets and satellites have a history of crashing and exploding.Meanwhile, Noaa monitors space weather, including solar flares, coronas and radiation, and geomagnetic storms that can damage the electric grid and telecommunications on earth and beyond. That could have implications for Musk’s well-known plans to colonize Mars.“If you’re serious about sending people to Mars, then you have to be able to monitor and respond to space weather,” an employee said.Radio frequencySpaceX, telecom giants and other industries are lobbying the federal government to auction off valuable bands on the radio frequency spectrum – the electromagnetic waves thatenable wireless communication, including among the military, the CIA, Noaa and their satellites.Nasa cuts raise fears of handing more influence to SpaceX owner MuskRead moreThe obscure function is essential to a wide range of commercial activities, such as cellphone use, and industry “wants to get their hands on all that they can” because it’s a finite resource, a former agency employee said.A large part of Noaa’s forecasts stem from its satellites monitoring water vapor movement in the atmosphere, and the agency owns the radio frequencies at which vapor vibrates. If theMusk-alignedFCC sells bands too close to that frequency, potential interference could impede satellite function and disrupt reliable weather forecasting and cellphone use.“Starlink wants more and more spectrum, and you hope [the FCC] would not be stupid enough to auction off the bands next to where water vibrates, but … I wouldn’t put it past anybody,” an employee said.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskSpaceXTrump administrationSatellitesSpaceDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Accountability for killing hundreds, protecting millions of lives, and ensuring aviation safety should be policies any executive branch should get behind regardless of any larger agenda.”Boeing’s previous plea deal, struck last year under the Biden administration, included spending $455m to improve safety and compliance practices over three years of court-supervised probation, as well as supervision by an independent monitor for three years.Relatives of the victims of the two crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019, have argued the agreement failed to adequately hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of their loved ones.“We urge the Department of Justice to stand on the right side of history, reject any further plea negotiations, and move forward with a full prosecution,” Erin Applebaum, a lawyer representing 34 families of those killed in the 2019 Max Ethiopian Airlines crash, said. “The families deserve their day in court, and this opportunity for justice must not be squandered.”Last May, the justice department found Boeing had violated a 2021 agreement that had shielded it from prosecution over the crashes. Prosecutors then decided to criminally charge Boeing and negotiate the current plea deal.Officials in the Trump administration have publicly argued that regulators must be firm with Boeing after a series of missteps, includinglast January’s cabin panel blowout. “We need to be tougher on Boeing,” said Steve Bradbury, who was confirmed as deputy transportation secretary this month.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsBoeingLaw (US)Plane crashesAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

In a report, it said the country’s fiscal health deteriorated further since Moody’slowered its outlook on the US triple-A ratingin November 2023.Donald Trump’son-and-off-again tariffshave been panned by economists for sowing confusion and uncertainty that they said was making it challenging for businesses to plan ahead, to the detriment of the economy.The US president on Monday indicated that not all of his threatened duties would be imposed on 2 April and some countries may get breaks, but at the same time said tariffs on imported automobiles were coming soon.“Consumers are rattled,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High FrequencyEconomics. “At great personal risk, we will opine that the chaos in Washington has something to do with this. The decline in consumer sentiment since the November election can no longer be written off as a coincidence.”The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index tumbled 7.2 points to 92.9 this month, the lowest level since January 2021. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index sliding to 94.0. The fourth straight monthly decline in confidence mirrored a similar deterioration in the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment measure, which has also erased all the gains notched in the aftermath ofTrump’s election victory in November.Shell-shocked! Why eggs – and their rising price – are an American obsessionRead moreThe drop in confidence was driven by consumers over 55 years old. Morale in the 35-55 year age cohort also worsened. But confidence rose slightly among consumers under 35 years. Confidence slumped across income groups, with the exception of households earning more than $125,000 a year. Consumers had over the past few months been generally upbeat about future income.“Consumers’ optimism about future income ... largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers’ assessments of their personal situations,” said Stephanie Guichard, senior economist, global indicators, at the Conference Board.The survey’s expectations index, based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, dropped 9.6 points to 65.2 – the lowest level since March 2013 and well below the threshold of 80 that usually signals a recession ahead. The share of consumers anticipating a recession over the next 12 months held steady at a nine-month high.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The last column coveredhow to stop tech companies spying on your phone as Trump promises mass deportations.The DNA testing company 23andMe hasfiled for bankruptcyafter months of concern over its financial health and its ability to keep users’ genetic information secure. In light of the uncertainty looming over the company’s future, you should do one thing to protect your privacy today: delete your 23andMe account.If you have used the service to discover your ancestry via your DNA, the extremely sensitive information you shared with 23andMe may transfer to the company’s eventual buyer. While 23andMe has a host of privacy controls that now allows users opt out of sharing their data with scientific researchers or requires the company delete their samples, that could change under a new owner.DNA testing firm 23andMe files for bankruptcy as CEO steps downRead moreGenerally, privacy and civil liberties experts do not recommend using ancestry and DNA testing services. There are few federal privacy regulations that limit how companies can use your information in the US – even your genetic data. How a private company maintains, stores and shares your data is left up to the whims of the people running it.Privacypolicies change often and so do executive suites. Not only is your data vulnerable to hacks, it can also be used for various commercial products and shared with law enforcement.23andMe has insisted that any new owner would have to comply with existing laws around the sale and use of consumer genetic data, but the reality in the US is that only a handful of states legally protect this type of personal information. In California, where this kind of privacy protection does exist, the attorney general, Rob Bonta, has issued an urgent “consumer alert” encouraging Californians to delete their 23andMe data.“California has robust privacy laws that allow consumers to take control and request that a company delete their genetic data,” said Bonta. “Given 23andMe’s reported financial distress, I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company.”There’s good reason for concern. 23andMe suffered a massive hack affecting some 7 million users in 2023. The hackers first revealed they gained access to the information when they attempted to sell what they claimed was the data of 1 million users ofAshkenazi Jewish descent and 100,000 users of Chinese descenton a popular hacking forum. In addition to a class-action lawsuit alleging the company failed to notify users of the data breach in a timely manner, the company said it was facing more than50 other lawsuitsin the wake of the hack. Its problems are international, too: the UK information commissioner’s office issued a notice of intent to fine the company £4.59m earlier this month.If you are one of 15 mllion people who have already handed over your DNA to 23andMe, what can you do to protect your data?Why I regret using 23andMe: I gave up my DNA just to find out I’m BritishRead moreHow to delete your 23andMe accountThe main thing you should do to protect your genetic privacy: delete your account.There’s a big caveat: the company says it will have to retain some information in its archives even if you delete your account. “23andMe and/or our contracted genotyping laboratory will retain your Genetic Information, date of birth, and sex as required for compliance with applicable legal obligations … even if you chose to delete your account,” the company’s privacy policy reads.If you’re reading this and you are trying to decide if you want to do a DNA test with one of these private companies, take the above caveat as a big reason not to. It’s possible, depending on what state you’re in, your data will never be completely erased.That said, it is still worth making the effort to delete your account and all the data in it.

He predicted stronger economic ties would develop between regional groups and trade blocs.Since starting his second term as US president in late January, Donald Trump has imposed various tariffs on leading trading partners such as Canada, Mexico and China, as well as global steel and aluminium tariffs. The EU has announced retaliatory measures from April, while the UK has chosen to adopt a “pragmatic approach” while it tries to negotiate a wider trade deal with the US.Starmer is warned against ‘appeasing’ Trump with tax cut for US tech firmsRead moreTrump is expected to impose more tariffs on 2 April, when his administration will announce “reciprocal tariffs” on countries around the world.Last week, officials at theUS Federal Reserve cut their US economic growth forecasts and raised projections for price growthas the central bank kept interest rates on hold. Some of the increase in the Fed’s inflation expectations was “clearly” due to tariffs, according to its chair Jerome Powell.“As we consider present developments … we believe that globalisation as we knew it may have now run its course,” Tucker said in his speech.“Economic considerations guiding optimally efficient supply chains led to one of the world’s greatest periods of wealth creation we have ever seen. The balance of economic power changed as a result, and what used to be sustainable no longer is.”This does not mean, however, that the world will “regress or geo-fragment and de-globalise”. New opportunities will arise of stronger economic ties between different “political groupings and trade blocs”, including the “Brics-plus group of countries,” which will increasingly trade with each other, Tucker predicted.The Brics group, originally made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has expanded to include Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ethiopia and Indonesia.Tucker said the world was undergoing a “period of deep and profound change” in trade, economic policy and international security arrangements.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bank is splitting its operations into eastern and western markets, to help it cut costs and navigate rising geopolitical tensions.Tucker said economic links between Asia and the Middle East, an important focus for the bank, would “soar” in the coming years.“The rising trade and financial linkages of these economies with the rest of the emerging world suggests there could be notable growth spillovers,” Tucker said.

The pungent odour wafts into passing vehicles, persisting long after they have left theCaribbeanisland’s coves, where the ocean has deposited masses of the seaweed, which turns red then black as it rots.Many residents of Soubise, one of the areas worst affected, say they have learned to live with the problem, which has plagued the island, and others like it, for years. Last week scientists in Florida said they thought they hadidentified a weather phenomenon in 2009 as the “tipping point”of the problem, which they said is caused by shifting winds churning up the ocean and bringing deepwater nutrient concentrations to the surface.Every day, Lindon Marast, 30, feels the ill effects of the sargassum invasion when he goes out to fish. “It gets caught in the boat’s propeller,” he says. “Then we can’t pass through the water because it stops the propeller from accelerating.”View image in fullscreenLindon Marast says the seaweed clogs the engine of his boatBut now Grenada’s government says it has found a way to turn the curse of sargassum into a blessing. It isworking with the European Unionand is looking for companies that could partner them in creating a multibillion-dollar market for the Caribbean.The aim is to rebrand the seaweed as a revolutionary solution to the climate crisis that could power homes and businesses with clean energy and boost agricultural yields.“We have had to deal with this problem for quite some years now,” says Emmalin Pierre, a local MP and leader of the opposition New National party. “It has been a major problem for not just the fishermen in the area but also residents.“The fishermen will tell you it’s challenging to even access their boats when it’s really bad. You also have the issue of the scent, which sometimes becomes unbearable even for passersby.”Soubise’s residents, who are facing severe coastal erosion as well as the invasion of the sargassum, have also expressed concerns about the effects of methane and other gases emitted by the weed, which they say cause skin rashes, tarnish jewellery and damage household appliances and boats.View image in fullscreenThe fishing village of Soubise, where some say the rotting seaweed causes skin rashesThe sargassum issue has blighted the island for more than a decade, but now UK-based aquaculture business Seafields has created a water-based farm to catch the sargassum before it reaches land, preventing it from rotting and releasing methane.Seafields claim its solution could save Caribbean governments and hotels hundreds of thousands of dollars in sargassum removal and support a lucrative market in bioplastic and similar materials.As well as its use in creating bioplastics, sargassum can be used as a fuel and as crop fertiliser. It is much cheaper to farm than most other seaweed, says John Auckland, founder and chief executive of Seafields. Unlike other macroalgae, it does not have a complicated reproductive cycle that requires hatcheries and lots of space, money and infrastructure to farm. This makes sargassum a valuable resource for the Caribbean.Used as a fertiliser, he says: “It stimulates crop growth by about 10% to 14% and can significantly increase yields for farmers.Some people say you get accustomed to the smell, but you can never get accustomed to itMark Nedd“It has slightly different applications than traditional bio-stimulants. So it’s a potential $200bn [£150bn] export market – and the Caribbean has the best product for it.”Some hotels inGrenadaare already using sargassum as a clean energy source. Benjamin Nestorovic and Renatta Fielden, from the Grenada-based bioenergy company SarGas, have proved the technology works and have installed a biodigester, which uses micro-organisms to break down the seaweedinto biogas and fertiliser, to fuel the ovens at the True Blue Bay Resort’s House of Chocolate bakery in St George’s.“You can eat chocolate with a good conscience,” Nestorovic says. “Our process produces clean energy and digestate – a valuable organic fertiliser – giving us two products in one.”View image in fullscreenBenjamin Mestorovic and Renatta Fielden. Their company, SarGas, launched a pilot project at Grenada’s True Blue Bay resort three years ago to assess the feasibility of turning sargassum seaweed into biogas and fertiliserView image in fullscreenThe biogas digester.

A small digester can supply six hours of fuel a day to farms, hotels and cafesThe company has recently secured government approval to construct a large-scale biogas facility to help provide electricity to the island.“They use diesel to generate electricity [now], which is very expensive for the local population. We are providing a reliable, cost-effective and sustainable alternative,” Nestorovic says, adding that the company plans to expand across the Caribbean.View image in fullscreenAs well as fertiliser and biofuel, sargassum seaweed can also be turned into bioplasticGrenada’s prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, held a conference last year to explore innovations around sargassum weed. Speaking at the event, he said: “We believe that we have a unique opportunity in Grenada and in the Caribbean basin to turn the tide on what is viewed as a problem into a solution – and into a solution that can have ripple effects to all of the stakeholders that it has thus far negatively impacted.”Mitchell set up a taskforce to work with the EU, and has promised to collect10,000 tons of sargassum by 2026. Last month, he told the Guardian that he had launched an expression of interest process for companies to propose projects to make his goal a reality.Meanwhile, farmers and fishers on the island have already discovered positive uses for the weed. “Sometimes it comes in with a lot of fish like mahi-mahi,” says Mark Nedd, 30, who started fishing at 14 and has grown up battling the sargassum invasion. Farmers, he says, collect it to use as fertiliser.Hotels and the rest of the tourism industry are equally keen to find a way to deal with this persistent threat. Kirl Grant-Hoschtialek, chief operations officer of the Grenada Tourism Authority, describes the painstaking process of removing the weed from beaches.Paradise lost? How cruise companies are ‘eating up’ the BahamasRead moreTeams of people, she says, work from one end of a beach to the other to remove the weed by hand because heavy machinery is likely to deplete the sand and organisms within it, worsening coastal damage.“Our beaches are our pride and joy,” she says. “Some have received accolades year after year. So we are very proactive when it comes to protecting them.”For those who live in Soubise, such as Nedd, any effort to tackle the weed cannot come soon enough. “If you pass here in a vehicle, the vehicle will automatically take that scent and carry it for a good way,” he says.“Some people say you get accustomed to the smell, but you can never get accustomed to it.”Explore more on these topicsSeascape: the state of our oceansGrenadaCaribbeanOceansMarine lifePlantsAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That Madrid are Liverpool’s nemesis in terms of European Cup/Champions League wins and, in recent years, two finals of that same competition, will hardly sweeten the pill, either.If Steven Gerrard resisted such temptations, feted forebears and contemporaries were tempted and succumbed. The aristocratic hubris of Madrid has regularly robbedLiverpoolof its prime talents. Not just those loved and lost. Jude Bellingham might be two years into his Anfield career by now, such a plan mooted in Liverpool’s front office, only for him to opt for the Bernabéu.Real Madrid close to deal to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold on a free transferRead moreAlexander-Arnold’s move is most regularly compared with Steve McManaman’s departure on a Bosman free transfer in 1999. Within Liverpool’s depressed late-90s period, “Macca” had remained a shining light only to turn down a fresh contract. McManaman was accused of treachery during his closing months in Liverpool red. That a lack of a transfer fee left Liverpool financially short was the common complaint, one shared with Alexander-Arnold, though the parameters are now rather different.The right-back will very likely be departing England’s champions, having won a previous Premier League title and the Champions League in 2019; whereas McManaman could look only to 1992’s FA Cup, won as a youngster, and the 1995 League Cup, where he had been the match-winner. Liverpool in the summer of 1999, after a half-season under Gérard Houllier, were rebuilding but miles behind Manchester United and Arsenal. Madrid, meanwhile, were adding McManaman on £65,000 a week, big money then even for a team of European champions during a period when their rivalry with Barcelona had become a matter of global rather than national significance.The common view isEl Maccawas an unqualified success, not least because of the goal against Valencia in Paris that helped clinch the2000 Champions League final. Liverpool’s soloist had been converted into Madrid’s ball carrier, leaving the pyrotechnics to more skilful types. It was not quite that simple. The summer of 2000, when Madrid snaffled Barcelona’s Luís Figo, paying a world-record fee, proved a difficult crossroads. Doing that deal helped along Florentino Pérez’s accession to the club presidency.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold has won it all at Liverpool.Photograph: Franco Arland/Getty ImagesParis’s hero was sidelined, an early victim of Pérez’s continuing ruthlessness, the hope being a sale back to England. Lazio were also linked, only for McManaman’s reinvention as a luxury water carrier for Figo – and soon after Zinedine Zidane – to extend his stay until 2003, collecting another Champions League title, when not coincidentally David Beckham arrived to end up playing a similar role.“Liverpool was great, but it’s not as though I left when I was really young,” McManamantold the Observerin 2001. “I came here when I was 27, after more than 10 years at the club. Liverpool is a tiny city compared to Madrid.” Alexander-Arnold will be 27 in October.McManaman, who eventually developed a decent grasp of Spanish, made the most of Madrid. Michael Owen followed that same route in 2004, just as vilified for running his contract down by Liverpool fans, as Pérez snared him for £8m. The 25-year-old, less worldly than McManaman, struggled to assimilate himself and his young family while living in a hotel. Owen has admitted driving every day to the airport to buy English newspapers at a time before new media could take the strain of his thirst for news from the racetracks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Rafa Benítez demurred, an ill-fated move to Newcastle was set in train. Owen later revealed an annual hotline to Jamie Carragher: “‘Does Rafa want me?’ I’d say. ‘Does Kenny want me? Does Brendan want me?’ It was circumstances that stopped it happening … by the end I wasn’t the player I had been before and they simply didn’t fancy me. I wasn’t good enough.”If losing two locals was painful, Xabi Alonso’s departure in 2009 was another to make Reds fans wince. “We’ve got the best midfield in the world,” rang the Anfield chant, celebrating the triumvirate the Basque signing from Real Sociedad formed with Gerrard and Javier Mascherano. Alonso’s departure, for a fee of £30m, was not a case of Liverpool being sold short, though it was another Pérez pincer move made in the knowledge that the club needed to sell, the American ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett’s finances beginning to creak.Álvaro Arbeloa also headed to Madrid in 2009, for £5m, where the one-time full-back now works as an acclaimed youth coach, but Alonso’s loss was an exposure of damaging fissures at Liverpool. Benítez’s pursuit of Gareth Barry the previous year had led to Alonso becoming unsettled. “Another season would have been too much for me,” he said in 2011.Playing his best campaign in 2008-09 for Liverpool as they went close to a Premier League title left fans wanting more. Alonso becoming a key foundation of Madrid’s next, dominant era was little consolation. Like McManaman, like Owen, like Alexander-Arnold now, the pull of Madrid was too great for the player – and Liverpool – to resist.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolReal MadridTrent Alexander-ArnoldfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a sport as prohibitively expensive as elite tennis, her family wealth – her billionaire parents own several sports franchises, including the NFL’s Buffalo Bills – afforded her unfettered access to equipment and knowledge. Her career, however, has come to signify something else altogether.At the age of 22, Pegula was still fluttering in and out of the top 150, stuck on the lower rungs of the ITF circuit and simply trying to figure things out. Pegula did not break into the top 100 until a couple of weeks before her 25th birthday in February 2019 and even then it seemed as if she was light years away from ever becoming a top player. She failed countless times before she began to soar.Tim Henman: ‘I told Andy Murray to take his time … the next week he was coaching Djokovic’Read moreToday, Pegula has established herself as a veteran top 10 player and one of the most reliable members of the sport’s elite. Her success was not the result of a dramatic overnight shift – she built her confidence and convictions through her daily work and resilience over a significant period of time.On Wednesday in Miami, Pegula will faceEmma Raducanuin what is now undoubtedly the best tournament of Raducanu’s career outside her fateful US Open title run in 2021. After defeating one top-10 American player in Emma Navarro, Raducanu now has the opportunity to measure herself against one of the best in the world in her first WTA 1000 quarter-final.Although she remains a clear underdog, the Briton should not be afraid. Their two previous matches have both been tight. Pegula won their first and only hard-court meetingin two tough setsat the Cincinnati Open in 2022, but last summer Raducanudefeated Pegula in three gruelling setson home soil in Eastbourne to finally clinch her first top‑10 win.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu chats with her support team in Miami, trainer Yutaka Nakamura (left) and temporary coaches Mark Petchey and Jane O’Donoghue.Photograph: SMG/ShutterstockThe pair share some similarities. Both possess smooth, compact strokes off each wing, effortless two-handed backhands and excellent timing, which they use to take the ball early and take time away from their opponent. Both relish smothering rivals with vicious early service returns. Only one of them, however, has come close to directing those assets into consistent winning tennis over a long period.Pegula particularly thrives in fast conditions and few players are as adept at deflecting the power generated by her foes. One of the biggest ­challenges for Raducanu will be to find the right balance between imposing herself by ­playing ­offensive tennis and also keeping Pegula uncomfortable by mixing up the speed and trajectory of her ball.The 22-year-old has done a great job this week of frustrating opponents with her backhand slice and defence, but Pegula is a level above them all.Alongside improvements to her serve, forehand and movement, Raducanu’s three months of work with her new fitness coach, Yutaka Nakamura, the one person who has accompanied her throughout the year, appear to be paying off. She looks like a considerably stronger and more durable athlete.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For so long, Raducanu was always the player breaking down on the court. She now looks physically prepared for all possibilities and she recovered well from a gruelling,attritional second-round win over Navarro. Against those struggling opponents, she made her own luck by refusing to allow them back into the matches.As she faces off against Pegula, there are also lessons that Raducanu, at 22 years old, can learn from her. Successful tennis careers are a marathon and each is completely different. Some players fulfil their potential at a young age but others must reckon with a far longer journey.While the past three and a half years have at times been brutal for Raducanu, mere match wins often hard to come by, players who work hard each day will always have opportunities to turn their fortunes around. With that in mind, it is notable that Raducanu has competed more frequently this year than ever before. Even as she struggled through numerous bitter losses in recent months, to her credit she kept on ­rolling with the punches and showing up. This week at least, she is finally landing some of her own.On TuesdayNovak Djokovic– a six-time tournament winner in Miami – stormed into the men’s quarter-finals after thrashing Italy’s 15th seed Lorenzo Musetti 6-2, 6-2 on a rain-affected day of play.

The supposedly too old Warriors are setting up a title challengeMany believed Steph Curry’s Golden State were past it in 2022 before they won the championship. This time around, Jimmy Butler has given them new lifeAlex KirshnerTue 25 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 11.34 EDTShareIt felt like the end, again.TheGolden State Warriorsmissed the playoffs in 2020 and 2021, but they stormed back from the abyss in 2022 to beat the Boston Celtics in the NBA finals. Steph Curry was 33 for most of that season. Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were 31. The Warriors’ return to the pinnacle of basketball had the whiff of a last hurrah, and indeed, their championship core faded for a second time after that: a second-round exit in 2023, a play-in tournament flatlining in 2024. Curry and his four-time championship-winning teammates continued to get older in the way athletes do.Last year’s missed postseasonwas a crossroads. Thompson left in free agency for the Dallas Mavericks. Curry and Green returned for what would be their age-36 and age-34 seasons, buttheseWarriors, the ones that collected all those titles under Steve Kerr, were finally cooked. They had to be.Or did they? Golden State are now the hottest team in basketball as the playoffs approach. They have 14 wins and three losses since 13 February. That stretch began one week after they made a blockbuster wing swap with the Miami Heat,trading Andrew Wiggins for Jimmy Butler. The move saw Golden State send away a key player of their second championship core, Wiggins, for a player who looks poised to be part of a third iteration under Curry and the still-trucking Steve Kerr. The Warriors were tied for 10th in the Western Conference on the day of the Butler trade, looking ticketed for the play-in again. Now they’re up to sixth and looking, at least for the moment, like an honest title contender.Nikola Jokić is putting up record numbers. So why is he unlikely to be NBA MVP?Read moreThe Butler trade is a convenient start point for the turnaround. Butler has not even found his jump shot yet; he has made 22.7% of his three-pointers as a Warrior and has struggled to make baskets from all over the floor. However, Butler has five all-defensive team honors to his name and is still a hellacious defender at 35. The Warriorshave allowed107.6 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor, a defensive rating that would make them roughly the best defensive team in the NBA if the team maintained those numbers all the time. (WithoutButler, Golden State have allowed 113.1 points per 100 trips.)Those numbers stand in stark contrast to those of Wiggins, who had arguably been a drag on the team by the end of his time in the Bay. This season, Golden State have posted anet rating 7.2 points betterwhen he was off the floor than when he was on it. Butler has reversed that, with the Warriors doing 9.4 points better per 100 possessions when he’s on the floor than not.Despite not finding his shooting form yet, Butler has not gummed up Golden State’s offense, which scores roughly the same amount when he’s off or on the court. Imagine his usefulness once the shots start falling more frequently.But while Butler has been a swell addition, the thing that really makes Golden State tick has not changed. Curry remains a marvel and has arguably been carrying more of a load than ever this year. His 32 minutes per game are a bit below his career average, sensible for a player who turned 37 this month. But these are intense minutes, with Curry using up 30% of the Warriors’ offensive possessions, a higher rate than he did 10 years ago. Kerr gave him a night off last week and said his star point guard was “exhausted.”Managing Curry going forward will make or break Golden State’s chances of making another deep playoff run. Curry took a hard fall on Thursday against Toronto and exited the game with what the teamcalled a pelvic contusion. While it doesn’t sound like Curry will miss much time, there are no minor injuries for 37-year-olds who are trying to lead NBA teams to championships. The 11-time All-Star has been playing inspired ball in this second-to-last year of his contract (and maybe of his career, though that depends on whether Curry wants to quit before a major decline).Though the Warriors have been on a great run, they won’treallycontend for another finals appearance unless they get serious offensive contributions from someone other than Curry. Some regression to the mean with Butler’s shot-making will help, but the Warriors’ offensive cupboard is not well stocked. The only other rotation regular averaging more than 11.3 points per game is bench forward Jonathan Kuminga, who is having theleastefficient shooting season of his four-year career. Other than Curry and Butler, there is a good argument that Golden State do not have even one above-average offensive player. There is a lot of promise, though, in free-throw magnets Butler and Kumingaspending eternity at the foul line.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionTo what extent can Golden State keep rolling like they have the past month and a half? The Warriors havesomethinghere. The fun of the past few weeks has been learning that the magic of the Curry-Kerr Warriors is not yet depleted, even with Thompson now playing in north Texas. Green isn’t the player he used to be, but he is still useful, and the Warriors are better when he’s playing than when he isn’t. When Green is the primary defender within two feet of a shooter, those shooters make 38.1% of their shots – less than they made against Green10 years ago, when he was in his heyday.Kerr has been adept at finding good role players to round out a roster whose salary cap is eaten up rapidly by Curry and his aging buddies. This year has been no different, with the Warriors getting lots of useful bench minutes out of players that a lot of basketball fans have barely heard of. The team has stayed above water when giving minutes to bench power forward Gui Santos, the 55th overall pick in 2022, who spent two years averaging 14 points per game in the G-League. Guards Moses Moody and Brandin Podziemski, first-round picks in 2021 and 2023, have become significant reserve contributors the past two years. That backcourt youth movement has been more helpful this year than Buddy Hield, the veteran shooting guard whose salary dwarfs theirs but whose production has not.The Warriors who won the title in 2022 did so by managing to bridge the gap between Curry and their future. Golden State are trying to repeat that trick now, and they may havejustenough in the tank to make it happen again. Curry will be the straw that stirs the franchise’s drink until the moment he retires, but the past few years, Golden State lacked enough ingredients to create anything interesting. But now that Butler has walked through the door, the Warriors – for the first time in three years – are impossible to ignore as we go deeper into the spring. As usual, there’s an unshakeable feeling that we’re watching this happen for the last time. But with Curry, Butler, and Green all under team control next year, too, perhaps it’s time to stop assuming that the laws of gravity apply to Golden State.Explore more on these topicsGolden State WarriorsUS sportsStephen CurryNBABasketballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When his sons, Jakob, Filip and Henrik, stormed to Olympic, world and European titles, the reality television cameras were there to capture many of the steps, squabbles and medals along the way. Little wonder that Team Ingebrigtsen became the most popular TV show in Norwegian history.But on Tuesday a courtroom in Sandnes, in the south-west of the country, heard that the reality inside the family home was far bleaker, with harrowing stories of violence, threats and manipulative behaviour from Gjert towards Jakob, the double Olympic champion, and his younger sister, Ingrid.Over four hours of testimony, Jakob detailed how he had been punched and kicked by his father when he was at primary school and been threatened with being beaten to death, and outlined multiple other incidents which he said had left him emotionally damaged.Jakob told the court that he and his brothers had finally decided that enough was enough in 2022, when Ingrid was hit in the face with a wet towel, leaving a red mark, because she did not want to go for a run. It was at that point they split from their father and coach and told their story to the Norwegian newspaper VG.Gjert, who faces up to six years in prison if convicted, has denied any allegation of violence.Such was the interest in the trial that the live blog of Ingebrigtsen’s testimony was followed by nearly 200,000 people on VG. The Norwegian superstar, who holds four world records and the Tokyo 2020 1500m and Paris 2024 5,000m gold medals, was calm as he outlined the allegations against his father – whom he referred to throughout as “the defendant”. They included being punched when he was as young as seven or eight after Jakob’s school phoned the family home asking to speak to his mother, who was at work. Jakob told the court that his father had asked him why they had called, and when he told him he didn’t know he was punched in the head “many times”.“I’m just standing in the kitchen and looking down at the ground,” he added. “The defendant is standing over me and screaming at me that I’m a liar and I’m lying for what feels like a very long time, before he starts hitting me in the head … I try to protect myself from violence, before he takes my hands and puts them down on my side, before he starts to continue hitting me in the head.“I don’t know exactly how many times I was hit, but when I stand there it feels like a very long time. Somewhere between 10 and 20 times, where I try to just protect myself.”In another incident, which allegedly occurred when Jakob was eight or nine, he said that he had been playing in the street on a scooter when his father jumped on him and kicked him in the stomach. “I remember trying to get up, and lying on all fours, before I get a kick in the stomach which I remember was a strange experience,” he said.In middle school, Jakob said his father had threatened to “shame him and beat him to death, or something similar” when he was sitting with several of his family members in a car together.Jakob told the court he and his brothers had finally decided to go public with their father’s behaviour and to sack him as their coach after he saw a photograph of his sister with the mark. Jakob said the photo, which was shown to the court on Monday, was just one of “many episodes she has been in”.“She is a young, small girl who is in a physical confrontation with a grown, large man,” he said. “I have been in that myself, but I am not her and can only imagine how traumatic that and those experiences have been for her. It was about her wanting to stop running and training. She wasn’t allowed to do that.”Jakob said his father had tried to stop the relationship with his now-wife, Elisabeth, after they had met when they were 16 and had reacted angrily when they wanted to move in together when they were 18. “In that context, we were called terrorists by the defendant”.The court also shown a 24-minute video of Gjert aggressively arguing with Jakob when he had asked to use the PlayStation after training when he was 19.His father’s alleged behaviour had affected Jakob’s ability to show and feel emotions, he told the court. “If I was happy or did something nice, it could be used against me if I was a little tired at training the next day,” he said. “I was very conscious about showing emotions. I ended up not doing it. I have a hard time letting people in and I have a hard time trusting people.”Asked why he had stopped calling his father “Dad” when he was about 11, Jakob said: “I no longer saw this person as a father. I thought that the things he says, the things he does and has done, are not worthy of a father.“You have become a father yourself, what would you expect from the father you no longer call Dad? What is missing?” asked Larsen.“Empathy, caring,” Jakob responded.The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsNorwayEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Iran join Japan and New Zealand as the first countries to have punched their ticket via the usual qualification process, while co-hosts United States, Mexico and Canada qualified automatically.Internazionale striker Mehdi Taremi was largely to thank for Team Melli’s accomplishment on Tuesday, scoring both goals in an otherwise sloppy performance fromIran. The Iranian defense let in two soft goals from Uzbekistan, who will secure their first-ever World Cup finals place with a victory in either of their two remaining qualifiers.Tuesday’s result means Iran areguaranteed to finish in the top two of Group Ain the third qualifying of AFC qualifying, earning them passage to the team’s fourth World Cup finals in a row, and seventh in their history. It stands as a major accomplishment for Iran, even as qualifying from Asia has been made easier thanks to the World Cup’s newly expanded, 48-team format.An increasingly multicultural Japan have qualified for the 2026 World CupRead moreHowever, the country’s current relations with the United States, which will be host the bulk of the tournament’s games, could make it hard, if not impossible for Iran’s fans and potentially even players and staff, to travel to the country for the games.In a recent memo, the issuing of which was reported by Reuters,Iran was listed among 41 countriesthat would face partial or complete bans on citizens entering the United States by the Donald Trump administration. Iran specifically is listed among a group of 10 countries, including Afghanistan, Syria, Cuba and North Korea, that would be set for a full visa suspension.That memo was issued after a 20 January executive order that required increased vetting of foreign nationals from countries deemed to be a national security threat. That list is almost certain to include Iran, as did Trump’s 2017 ban on predominantly Muslim countries.Despite the co-hosting arrangement with Mexico and Canada, it is extremely likely that Iran would be scheduled to play within the United States when the 2026 World Cup comes around. At present, only one spot at the tournament (The third-seeded team in Group A) would allow for the possibility of a non-host team to play all of their group games outside the United States. That spot would play all three group games in Mexico, with the second game coming against the home country. Iran could only avoid playing in the United States by winning Group A, and would continue to play games in Mexico until moving to Miami for the quarter-finals.Iran, however, have never made it out of the group stage at the World Cup. They came the closest to doing so at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, where a 1-1 draw with Portugal on the last day of group play was enough to keep them out of the round of 16. That was followed up at the 2022 World Cup when a 1-0 loss to the United States eliminated Iran when a draw would have seen them through to the knockout stages.Uzbekistan could also have rubber-stamped their place at the finals on Tuesday, had North Korea defeated the United Arab Emirates in their later game in Riyadh. Instead, the UAE won 2-1 to keep their hopes of direct qualification alive, with Sultan Adil striking in stoppage time. Qatar, the hosts in 2022, slipped to fourth in the group after a 3-1 loss to Kyrgyzstan in Bishkek.Explore more on these topicsIranWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The top-seeded Trojans kept going without their star player, pummeling Mississippi State 96-59 to reach the Sweet 16 for the second straight year, but the injury cast a shadow over the entire evening asone of college basketball’s biggest starswas left in serious distress.Watkins was streaking to the basket chased by two defenders when her knee bent awkwardly as she planted her right leg, the non-contact injury causing her to crumple to the floor. The crowd went silent as she writhed in pain and clutched her knee while her teammates looked on helplessly and USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb rushed to her side.ESPN reportedthat the 19-year-old has torn her ACL and will undergo surgery. Watkins was averaging 24.6 points this season for USC.Southern Cal’s JuJu Watkins: basketball’s next big thing has arrivedRead more“I’d be lying if I told you that I wasn’t rattled seeing JuJu on the floor crying,” Gottlieb said. “This is a human game and so I obviously tried my best to be what I need to be for the team, but internally it’s a lot.”Watkins’s teammates were terrific in her absence. They kept their poise while building leads of 28-8 after one quarter, 50-27 at halftime and 75-42 after three. The Trojans hit buzzer-beaters to end each of the first three quarters and they celebrated by jumping around on the court.Kiki Iriafen scored a season-high 36 points on 16-of-22 shooting for USC and grabbed nine rebounds. She left with 6:29 remaining and the crowd chanting, “Kiki! Kiki!” Freshman Avery Howell added 18 points, hitting four three-pointers.“What a performance by this group,” Gottlieb said. “You never want anyone to go down, especially someone like JuJu that we all lean on in so many ways, but this team rallied. They rallied for her, they rallied for each other, our fans had our back. I’m just really proud and I think we showed what kind of team we are.”The Bulldogs were led by Jerkaila Jordan with 17 points. “My prayers and thoughts are with JuJu,” MSU coach Sam Purcell said. “I’m hoping the best for her because she’s special.”The Trojans were up 34 points in the third. Their fans loved it, getting on their feet and roaring, especially when Iriafen waved both arms in the air, urging them on.“It’s hard when you have such a key player not with you,” Iriafen said. “For us, it was just making sure we got the job done. We want our season to be extended.”The Bulldogs had more than just the Trojans to contend with. The home crowd, angered by the loss of one of the game’s biggest stars, booed every time MSU touched the ball and their cheerleaders heard it, too, getting jeered during a halftime routine.“You can’t tell me that the energy of the crowd and how angry they were with the other team and how much they were for our team is so much about what JuJu has given to this arena, to this program, to this city.”The victory keeps the Trojans on a potential collision course with Paige Bueckers and UConn in the regional final in Spokane, Washington. They were knocked out by the Huskies in last year’s Elite Eight.Explore more on these topicsNCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He has looked to hit the ground running, just as he did when he won the Champions League four months after joining Chelsea, but building rhythm in international football is not easy. The players are not around for long and some games drift into irrelevance. Tuchel has started with two straightforward wins butneither set the pulse racing. The awkward reality is that qualification lacks jeopardy these days.Thomas Tuchel admits he took off Jude Bellingham as he was a red card ‘risk’Read moreEngland were under no threat of losingagainst AlbaniaandLatvia, so all eyes were on the quality of their performances. Tuchel, having delivered a searing critique of the team’s displays under Gareth Southgate at Euro 2024, was after identity, intensity and excitement. He has talked about imposing an aggressive Premier League style. The issue is that doing so is challenging against opponents who arrive at Wembley focused on damage limitation. It was pass, pass, pass from England but both games were pretty turgid. Tuchel will see room for improvement. He must consider, too, whether gung-ho football is possible against good opponents, particularly in the heat of an American summer. He could do with the Football Association organising some tough friendlies before the World Cup.Bellinghamcould define England’s World CupThe sense that it was too easy against Latvia, who are 140th in the Fifa rankings, was heightened by Jude Bellingham producing an unfocused display. He played with desire but wanted too much time on the ball.Tuchel wants him to be more tactically and mentally disciplined. He will not have liked Bellingham earning a booking for a foul moments after sloppily losing possession. Bellingham still needs to direct all that energy into more positive areas. He was hugely fortunate not to receive a second booking for a rash tackle in the second half. Would he enjoy such leniency in a tournament game? Unlikely. England need Bellingham to be more mature. He has to be more efficient and less impetuous. England need the Bellingham who carved Albania open with a superb assist for Myles Lewis-Skelly. That player can drive a team to glory. The petulant version could drag them down.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi, one of England’s best players at the Euros, was dropped against Albania.Photograph: Dave Shopland/ShutterstockUps and downs in defenceTuchel has food for thought at full‑back. There was a debut goal from Lewis-Skelly and plenty of evidence that the 18-year-old is an asset at left-back. There was also Reece James making his first start forEnglandsince September 2022, scoring his first international goal. He is back from injury and Tuchel, unlike Enzo Maresca, regards the Chelsea captain as a right-back rather than a midfielder. The question is whether James possesses the physicality of old. A lovely free-kick against Latvia underlined the brilliance of his right foot but there were some rusty moments in defence.Ultimately the back four is far from set. Dan Burn, the Newcastle centre-back, did not convince against Albania and Tuchel does not seem sure on Marc Guéhi. He dropped Guéhi against Albania and the Crystal Palace defender, one of England’s best players at the Euros, was involved in an early mix-up with Jordan Pickford against Latvia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were up against deep defences, limiting their space to go round the back. Even so Tuchel wanted more. He felt that Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford did not make a big enough impact against Albania and there was a quiet display from Jarrod Bowen against Latvia. Morgan Rogers did well but Bukayo Saka was missed on the right. Eberechi Eze had a good cameo against Latvia, scoring his first goal, but the sense is that some of the biggest winners were those who were not selected or not available. Noni Madueke will have a chance of a recall once he returns from a hamstring injury and Tuchel has given Jack Grealish hope of a recall. Arsenal’s Ethan Nwaneri, who has been with the under‑21s, will also have a chance if he maintains his rise.England 3-0 Latvia: player ratings for the hosts from the World Cup qualifierRead moreGet Wharton in next timeIt must be pointed out that the wingers need help from their teammates. Tuchel was frustrated that the ball often did not reach Foden and Rashford quickly enough. England have to raise the tempo. It comes back to the state of their midfield. They still lack a player who can link defence and attack; a player capable of fizzing risky early passes into the forwards. Adam Wharton is worth a look next time. The Crystal Palace midfielder does not have a high pass completion rate but that suggests he is trying to make things happen. England should have a proper look at him. The fact that Tuchel is getting his full-backs to invert suggests that England are again having to adjust to their lack of control in midfield. They need a specialist. Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson is also pushing.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelJude BellinghamWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld Cup 2026World CupanalysisShareReuse this content"

Probably shock. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions. It was a game we were more in control of than I thought we’d be. I really liked us. We were really good. We didn’t deserve to lose.”North Macedonia v Wales: World Cup 2026 qualifier – liveRead moreGiven thatNorth Macedoniahad won their six previous games without conceding a goal and Wales were unbeaten in seven matches under Bellamy, something had to give. When Bojan Miovski scored a fine 91st-minute goal the visitors looked set to lose a qualifier they really should have won and the relief at the final whistle prompted untrammelled Welsh celebrations.The night had begun on a much more sombre note. For the first time since taking charge, Bellamy wore a suit. It was a mark of respect to the 59 people whodied in a nightclub firein the North Macedonian town of Kocani, a tragedy remembered by an impeccably observed minute’s silence before kick-off.Blagoja Milevski’s decision to switch his formation to a back five seemed sensible as Wales enjoyed prolonged periods of fast-paced possession on a slick surface as they dominated an initial 90 minutes low on clearcut chances.There were moments when Bellamy could have done with turning back time and joining his attack. But, obdurate as the home defence proved, that rearguard almost cracked when Sorba Thomas could not quite make the most of a fine cross from the Leeds winger Dan James.View image in fullscreenSorba Thomas cannot quite direct his shot on target for Wales.Photograph: Georgi Licovski/EPAIn an intriguing subplot featuring Elland Road regulars past and ­present, James sporadically ­tormented Ezgjan Alioski, North Macedonia’s former Leeds left wing-back. Alioski plays in Saudi Arabia for Al-Ahli these days but he could conceivably have beaten Karl Darlow – currently the second-choice goalkeeper at Elland Road – had his audaciously ambitious first-half volley been a ­little better weighted.With North Macedonia increasingly double marking James, Bellamy’s creative players struggled to turn territorial domination into material advantage.The moment when Brennan Johnson’s quick feet and faster brain conjured a fine chance Nathan Broadhead could only send swerving over the crossbar appeared emblematic of his manager’s technical area frustration.Yet if the more pessimistic among the 2,000 Wales fans who had travelled to one of Europe’s most interesting, least generic capitals feared their team could come undone against skilled counterattacking opponents, such anxieties were assuaged by a commanding central defensive performance on the part of Joe Rodon and his sidekick, Chris Mepham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It almost brought swift reward when Alioski shot narrowly wide.Then Joe Allen lost concentration and permitted Miovski to intercept a tired pass backwards intended for Rodon.Little did Miovski know that Kieffer Moore’s headed flick and Brooks’ instinctive connection would shortly combine to remind everyone that Bellamy’s Wales do not know the meaning of surrender.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersNorth MacedoniaWalesmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Afghanistan women’s side last played an official game in 2018.Chelsea Women executive to leave club and join global seven-a-side seriesRead moreCurrent and former players welcomed Fifa’s steps but expressed frustration at the pace of change.Fifa’s move comes too latefor potential participation at the 2027 Women’s World Cup because the team will not be in the draw on Thursday for the 2026 AFC Women’s Asian Cup qualifiers. That tournament determines qualification for the World Cup and Olympic Games.“Players want to play for their country, they want to represent the women of Afghanistan and they want to be a voice for those who are on a voiceless journey,” the national team player Mursal Sadat said. “The Taliban took that platform from us. Not only us: it’s worth mentioning that it’s the fourth educational year that women are not allowed to go to school. How can we expect the Taliban to negotiate about sports if they’re not even allowing education for women? They would never negotiate. They are traumatised by women, they don’t like women, they are afraid of women’s rights and women’s voices and what they can do.“Unfortunately, Fifa’s inaction took our platform away from us for four years. We sacrificed four years, youthful years, four years that we could have represented, four years that we could have advocated, four years in which we could have pushed the world towards bigger change for women of Afghanistan. We watched the 2023 Women’s World Cup from the sidelines. Yet, in two days we have another draw for the Asian Cup qualifiers and we’re still not allowed to play.”Khalida Popal, a founder of the Afghanistan women’s national teamand the first woman to work for the Afghanistan Football Federation, said: “Fifa’s letter is a positive step towards collaborative action and recognising the sacrifice of Afghan women and Afghan women football players. Today more than ever, we want the leadership from governing bodies of sport. Afghanistan should be a case study and used to show how the governing bodies of sport have to create systems so women don’t lose opportunities.”View image in fullscreenMelbourne Victory Afghan women’s team captain, Fatima Yousufi (left), Malala Yousafzai and Khalida Popal, director of the Afghan women’s team.Photograph: Kelly Defina/Getty ImagesThe SRA and others, such as Popal, Malala Yousafzai and Human Rights Watch, have consistently called for Fifa to recognise the exiled team.

Under Fifa rules the organisation of an Afghanistan women’s team has been the responsibility of the Taliban-controlled AFF.Fifa said in its letter that it was “committed to developing practical and sustainable measures that promote access to football for all Afghan women and girls to the greatest extent possible” and that it had developed a strategy and implementation plan to ensure opportunities exist for Afghan women inside and outside the country.It also said it wanted to focus on activities to promote the wellbeing of women and girls in Afghanistan and to take part in diplomatic dialogue with organisations and governments inside and outside the country to “explore ways to reduce the exclusion from sport of women and girls in Afghanistan over time”. Fifa pointed out that it had played a role in helping women’s footballers, associated staff and their families to get out of Afghanistan.Andrea Florence, the SRA’s executive director, said: “Afghan women footballers’ ability to play internationally depends entirely on intervention from Fifa. Fifa’s letter in response to our report laid out their strategy to support Afghan women. It is great to hear that Fifa is working to promote playing opportunities for the players, but we remain hopeful that they will decide to officially recognise the team and allocate financial support as it does to other member associations.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s in the house, I’m outside.” Asked if anything similar had happened before, she said: “No, it’s the first time,” adding that she had been hit “in the face”.After police arrived at about 11.30pm, an officer offered to use an ice pack for the bump on her head. Georgia Barton told them: “I’ve been pushed down and kicked about and stuff. He said he was going to fight with my brother and my dad.”Prosecutor Helena Duong said during the trial: “There had been a verbal disagreement about a family matter.”Barton “grabbed her and pushed her to the ground and kicked her in the head”, Duong said, adding that as a friend tried to intervene, Barton “threw” him off and said: “Don’t disrespect me.”He was arrested at about midnight in his bedroom, where he had been asleep, and was still drunk, the trial was told. He did not comment when questioned by police.Giving evidence, Barton said he had argued with his wife after their friends got into a disagreement.“That led to us having a disagreement. I stupidly took my mate’s side, I said his wife was out of order,” he told the court. “We just got into petty name calling. We ended up getting a bit more agitated and were close to each other.”A friend had come between him and his wife to separate them, said Barton, but he denied that anything “physical” had happened.Duong asked Barton: “Are you someone that on occasion might lose your temper?”“Yep,” the former footballer replied.Asked if he had kicked his wife, he said no, before adding: “If I kicked someone in the head there would be a lot more damage than what’s alleged in this case.”The court heard that the couple are still married and living together. An original trial scheduled for 2022 was adjourned after Georgia Barton wrote to prosecutors and said her injuries had been caused by accident when a friend moved in to separate the pair.“I’m not a victim … I want to move on with my life,” she said.Prosecutors said they did not plan to ask her to give evidence in court, and a judge paused proceedings citing concerns that a trial would be unfair to Barton.The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Stephen Parkinson, appealed against the decision at the high court in London. In a judgment in June, two senior judges ruled in the DPP’s favour and said Barton should face a trial over the allegations in front of a different judge.Explore more on these topicsJoey BartonnewsShareReuse this content"

Michael O’Neill’s side had their chances under the closed roof of the Strawberry Arena, but they were wasteful until Isaac Price scored a late consolation.North Macedonia v Wales: World Cup 2026 qualifier – liveRead moreNorthern Ireland came into the match on the back of an encouraging 1-1 friendly draw with Switzerland, but they had lost Trai Hume and Ethan Galbraith from that game to injury. Portsmouth full-back Terry Devlin and Leyton Orient’s on-loan Tottenham forward, Jamie Donley, were handed full debuts as O’Neill started eight players aged 21 or under.Sweden, by contrast, were smarting from Saturday’s embarrassing 1-0 defeat in Luxembourg. That result marked a nightmare debut for new head coach Jon Dahl Tomasson, but he saw his side bounce back by going ahead after only seven minutes on Tuesday evening.Isak, who has scored 23 goals for his club so far this season, was the creator this time, expertly bringing down a high ball in the area before rolling the ball to Emil Holm, who was free at the far post to slot beyond Pierce Charles from six yards out.O’Neill’s side had actually made a bright start, with Justin Devenney forcing a save from the Sweden keeper Viktor Johansson inside the first minute, and Ruairi McConville heading a free-kick into the side netting. But with Isak on the prowl the hosts were always menacing going forward, and moments later he swept past Paddy McNair before hitting a rising shot which flew just over the crossbar.Back came Northern Ireland and Price, their goalscorer against Switzerland, saw his shot saved before Brodie Spencer curled narrowly over the top. Sweden scored their second after 33 minutes when Charles could only push a low cross from Gabriel Gudmundsson straight to Benjamin Nygren, who was left to tap into an empty net.View image in fullscreenAnthony Elanga makes it 5-0 late in the game.Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty ImagesThe visitors kept pushing, and Johansson had to come up with an acrobatic save to tip a George Savile curler over the crossbar. But just before the hour mark, Sweden had a third when Nygren turned Sebastian Nanasi’s free-kick on to a post and the former Watford winger Ken Sema lashed in the rebound.Five minutes later Isak had his goal, capitalising on some sloppy Northern Ireland passing on the right flank, cutting inside and curling a superb drive in from the edge of the area. Nottingham Forest’s Anthony Elanga, on as a substitute, tapped in the fifth with 13 minutes left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

O’Neill’s side will have to learn from a lesson in finishing when they go into June friendlies against Iceland and Denmark before the start of World Cup qualifying in September. Germany, Luxembourg and Slovakia await Northern Ireland in Group A, while Sweden are in an open-looking Group B with Kosovo, Slovenia and Switzerland.“We obviously didn’t come here to have a scoreline like we had tonight, but we knew it would be a tough game,” said O’Neill afterwards. “In all honesty the attitude of the team was great. They never stopped trying to play. It was a tough night but that’s why we took a game like this.”“I think 5-1 is maybe a bit harsh on us but at the end of the day we did give them opportunities and at this level they will punish you,” the manager added. “There’s another level above this – we have to go and play Germany – but we can only get better as a team if we expose ourselves to this level of opposition.”Explore more on these topicsFriendliesSwedenNorthern Irelandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Alongside him have worked the head of women’s football, Paul Green, and, until last summer, Emma Hayes, who spent 12 years as Chelsea’s head coach before taking charge of the USA women’s team.Jacob has said farewell to Chelsea in a LinkedIn post, writing: “The last 11 years have provided some of the most incredible experiences and memories of my life. What started off as a random business meeting with Emma Hayes became one hell of a journey.“I would like to thank all of my colleagues at Chelsea who have been there with me and all contributed huge amounts to what is an incredible team effort.

The former Wycombe owner told the Guardian that he still wants to buy Reading and would “get on a plane today” if it would help to resolve the situation.The alternative is for Dai, Platek or a combination of both to make a multimillion-pound offer to pay off Couhig and reunite the club with its property assets. Until the ownership situation is resolved, further borrowing to ease the club’s cash-flow problems is impossible as they have no assets to offer as security. Only Couhig’s loan and a £5m sell-on fee from Michael Olise’s transfer from Crystal Palace to Bayern Munich has kept them afloat until this point.View image in fullscreenDai Yongge with one of his former Reading managers, Jaap Stam. The Chinese businessman has been disqualified from owning an EFL club.Photograph: Jasonpix/ShutterstockThe long-running ownership battle has been made more difficult by the EFL’s decision to disqualify Dai due to the discovery of multiple unresolved court cases in China, one of which it is claimed has left him facing a potential bill of £200m. Dai was disqualified forfailing the EFL’s owners and directors teston 11 February, but it was not made public until a letter from the EFL was referenced by his lawyer in the court case last Friday.The EFL has declined to comment but sources have indicated it chose not to make the disqualification public for fear of it jeopardising the sale process. The Guardian has been told that even Platek and Couhig were not made aware of the matter until Thursday evening. The EFL made a previous attempt to disqualify Yongge due to Reading being repeatedly late in paying wages in November 2023, but was blocked by an independent commission appointed to hear the case.The commercial court case last week sprang from Dai seeking an emergency injunction a fortnight ago to remove Couhig’s property charges, pending the American’s claim for £12m in damages resulting from the collapse of his own takeover bid, which will be heard by the high court in July. The injunction attempt was dismissed by the judge.Couhig is understood to have reached out to Dai before the court case last week giving him two alternatives – sell the club to him, or pay him off – without receiving a response. There has also been no dialogue with Platek, who had have to deal with Couhig’s claim on the stadium and training ground if he went ahead with his proposed purchase.“People act like it’s me that’s stopping the deal, but that’s just not true,” Couhig told the Guardian. “I’m willing to get on a plane today if it means bringing a resolution for the betterment of the club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I would listen to any offer from either party.”Platek, who also owns the Portuguese club Casa Pia, has had considerable involvement in investing in English football previously through his position as co-head of global credit at BDT & MSD Partners, the investment vehicle of the technology billionaire Michael Dell. Previously known as MSD, the company has lent tens of millions of pounds to the EFL clubs including Burnley, West Bromwich Albion, Derby and Sunderland, as well as Premier League side Southampton.A source who has dealt with Platek in the past told the Guardian that his love of deal-making is legendary, and predicted the Reading negotiations would go down to the wire. West Brom in particular were close to going under three years ago before securing a £20m loan from MSD.The EFL is understood to be concerned about Reading becoming the first club to enter administrationsince Derby four years ago, with the potential for liquidation to follow, but is hoping the current regime could limp on until the end of the season if necessary.An EFL board meeting on 3 April will decide Reading’s immediate fate if the club have not been sold at that point. The board could suspend the club or extend their deadline if it deems there to be a reasonable prospect of the sale going through.Explore more on these topicsReadingLeague OneFootball LeagueFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However the federal criminal appeals court accepted the two men’s explanation that the payment had been for consultancy work.Blatter, now aged 89, gave little reaction listening to the verdict of three cantonal judges acting as a federal criminal appeals court. Sitting in the row in front of Platini, Blatter alternately tapped his fingers and held his left hand over his mouth. Platini sat with his arms folded or rubbing his hands as he listened to a translator sitting beside him relating the court’s verdict in German into his native French.The complex case centred around a payment made fromFifato Platini with Blatter’s approval in 2011 for supplementary and non-contracted salary working as a presidential adviser from 1998-2002. Swiss prosecutors had described the payment as “without a legal basis” and said it had “unlawfully enriched Platini” because there was no written contract at the time.However, both men maintained they had struck a verbal gentleman’s agreement for the Frenchman to be paid backdated additional salary for advising Blatter between 1998 and 2002, which Platini had not received at the time because of Fifa’s perilous finances.“You have seen my daughter was coming with tears because she believed in [her] father and I believed in myself,” said Blatter after the hearing, going on to speak of a sword of Damocles being removed from over his head. “To wait such a long time affects the person and my family was very much affected.”View image in fullscreenFormer Fifa president Sepp Blatter arrives to hear the verdict in Switzerland.Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters“Michel Platini must finally be left in peace in criminal matters,” said the Frenchman’s lawyer Dominic Nellen in a statement. “After two acquittals, even the office of the attorney general of Switzerland must realise that these criminal proceedings have definitively failed.”“The criminal proceedings have had not only legal but also massive personal and professional consequences for Michel Platini, although no incriminating evidence was ever presented,” Nellen added, before suggesting further legal action “against those responsible for the criminal proceedings”.The latest win for Blatter and the 69-year-old Platini came exactly nine-and-a-half years after a Swiss federal investigation in September 2015 kicked off events that ended the careers of football’s most powerful men. On that day in Zurich, police came to interrogate Blatter and Platini at Fifa after an executive committee meeting when Platini was a strong favourite to succeed his one-time mentor in an upcoming election.The emergence of the payment also led to Blatter ending his reign as Fifa president in disgrace, while Platini lost his job as president of Uefa, the European governing body, after his ban.Judges on Fifa’s ethics committee subsequently banned both men from football. Platini has always maintained that the case was a deliberate attempt to thwart his attempt to become Fifa president in 2015.Though federal court trials have twice cleared their names, Blatter’s reputation will always be tied to leading Fifa during corruption crises that took down a swath of senior officials worldwide.A further appeal to the Swiss supreme court can be filed by prosecutors.Explore more on these topicsFifaUefaSepp BlatterMichel PlatiniFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It had been assumed the Manchester United defender was not involved for the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia because of injury.Maguire has not played since 2 March because of a calf problem and Tuchel said the fitness of the player had been a factor. But the head coach made plain that he considered Maguire to be behind Ezri Konsa and Marc Guéhi in the pecking order for right-footed centre-halves.Tuchel calls on Fifa to reschedule ‘awkward’ June international windowRead moreTuchel called up the left-footers Dan Burn and Levi Colwill, plus a fifth centre-back in Jarell Quansah, who favours his right. Guéhi is also comfortable on the left of a central pair. Tuchel said Maguire had not been helped by United’s struggles this season or Ruben Amorim’s preference for a back three. Tuchel played a four againstAlbaniaandLatvia.“I spoke to all of the players who were not on the list to give my direct feedback on my decision,” Tuchel said, when asked about Maguire. “It was a close decision. We chose Marc Guéhi and Ezri Konsa. At the moment, I think they are a little bit in a better rhythm and deserve to be with us. Two right-footers in central defence and the rest were left-footers in the centre of defence.“The second reason was that Harry was not fit when we did the nomination. It was presumed that he can play but I didn’t want to take the risk to nominate the player which we then have to take care [with] … constantly need to assess whether he can do a full training session or half training session. We did the same with Reece James and only because of the feedback that he could do every session in full was the reason we brought him into camp.“Harry knows that. It’s not so easy for him at the club at the moment. He plays in a back three on top of it but he’s a top professional and he’s very important forEngland. He took it unbelievably well. He wrote me messages to wish us good luck and you see what a person he is. He is a top guy and he will always be in contention.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also looked ahead to his next get-together with the players, which will be for the away qualifier against Andorra on 7 June and the friendly with Senegal at Nottingham Forest’s City Ground three days after.Harry Maguire’s England absence due to form rather than injury, admits TuchelRead moreThe summer calendar has been complicated by theClub World Cupin the US, which runs from 14 June to 13 July. Tuchel stands to have a host of his players involved, including the captain Harry Kane with Bayern Munich, Jude Bellingham with Real Madrid and the Chelsea and Manchester City contingents.What most troubles Tuchel – and it is a concern he says is shared by club and national team managers – is the awkwardness of the June window and how it prevents players from having an uninterrupted rest at the end of the season. The situation is surely compounded by the Club World Cup.The Premier League and La Liga conclude on 25 May and the Bundesliga finishes on 17 May. The DFB-Pokal final is on 24 May; Bayern are out of the competition. Then there is the Champions League final on 31 May, which could feature both Madrid and Bayern. Chelsea hope to contest the Conference League final on 28 May.“Being a club coach or international coach – theFifaJune window is I think debatable … if it makes sense,” Tuchel said. “Not everyone plays a Champions League final or a club final so there is this awkward period for a player. They have 10 or 14 days’ break, then they go to international [in early June].View image in fullscreenReal Madrid’s Jude Bellingham is one of a number of England players expected to feature in this summer’s Club World Cup.Photograph: George Wass/PPAUK/Shutterstock“They get a little bit of holiday but they think: ‘Other players are on holiday, I need to come back. I can’t enjoy my two weeks because I need to do individual [work] and then I go suddenly to international camp.’ So the June window is not ideal for anyone, especially the players. But it’s there. It’s Fifa who can maybe align the calendar and find a gap where we put this window somewhere else to open the window for the better of the players.”Competing teams at the Club World Cup must arrive in the US no later than three days before their opening tie. Bayern kick off on 15 June, Chelsea on the 16th and Madrid and City on the 18th. The international window runs from 2 to 10 June and the national teams have priority during it.That England’s game against Senegal is a friendly does not matter. It is considered by Fifa to be a match to prepare for a tournament, in other words the 2026 World Cup. Tuchel would not lose any players to clubs that might want them to prepare for the Club World Cup.It is possible that Tuchel could come to an arrangement with a club in that scenario – to work out what would be best for the player in terms of his workload. That said, Tuchel has made it clear the time is short for him leading up to the World Cup and every training session will count.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am more concerned that they never have a real break of three to four weeks. Maybe they have three weeks’ holiday but maybe after five days they play another competition. That’s the problem. They should have a minimum three or three and a half weeks of preparation and then it would be better for everyone.”Kane said: “It’s a hard situation. There are arguments from the club’s point of view to generate more money. And there’s also a player welfare point where there’s only so much you can do without more injuries. I don’t think the players are listened to that much, if I’m totally honest.“Everyone wants their piece, their tournament, their prize and the players are the people who have to get on with it. It is what it is. I love playing football so I’m never going to complain about playing football. If you manage it well, with your coaches and your clubs, there’s ways of getting more rest in certain moments.”Kane was asked whether, given the choice, he would go to the Club World Cup. “Yes, absolutely,” he replied.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelFifaClub World CupFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Or that less than five years ago, there were questions about if he would ever play again.Yet there Jiménez was, with two goals inMexico’s semi-final against Canadaand another two in thefinal against Panama, joking about enjoying a few tequilas in celebration of El Tri’s first-ever Nations League triumph. A sleek headband is the only visible reminder of his November 2020 collision with Arsenal’s David Luiz – an incident that fractured his skull and caused a brain bleed, andwhich could have cost him his lifewithout the proper and timely medical interventions he received.There is no obvious physical record of the months of hard work it took Jiménez and his family to get back to a normal life, let alone to a playing career that was just blossoming in the Premier League (then with Wolves) and forMexico. Jiménez doesn’t need one.Raúl Jiménez: ‘The doctors told me it was a miracle to still be there’ | Paul DoyleRead more“It’s fantastic to come back after what I’ve been through,” he told CBS after his two-goal performance on Sunday, securing Mexico’s first win in the competition in four attempts. “This is a great example that you [should] never lose faith and continue. You know what you’re capable of doing and know your level.”Jiménez has rediscovered his form as he climbs Mexico’s all-time goalscoring chart, on which he currently sits third, seven behind Jared Borgetti and 13 behind Javier “Chicharito” Hernández. He is a leader on the team now; an elder statesman at 33 years old who hopes to lead Mexico back to the top of Concacaf.Yet even after his return to the field from the accident, even as he recaptured his goalscoring form withFulhamahead of this March international window, the attention in Mexico has been focused on a different striker expected to lead the line at the 2026 World Cup: 23-year-old Santi Giménez. The striker has seemed to score for fun at club level, earning a January move to Milan from Feyenoord this winter, but he is in the midst of an international goal drought, having failed to score for El Tri since the 2023 Gold Cup final.Fans rarely focus on consistency. A shiny, new rising star is much more exciting. But consistency is exactly what Jiménez has provided in the Premier League over the last two seasons, and increasingly in recent weeks. After scoring seven goals last season but cooling in the back half of the year, Jiménez has 10 goals in 29 Premier League appearances for Fulham this season – adding a goal each in the FA Cup and the League Cup as well.Mexico’s homophobic chant started as an unfunny joke. Now it’s a stubborn problemRead moreSome of them have been brilliant. Others have been unremarkable or, as you’d expect from a penalty specialist, from the spot like his double against Ipswich Town in January. Even this month, before heading off on international duty, Jiménez was on the mark for Fulham, using a savvy first touch off his chest to set himself up for the opening goal against Brighton before the home side rallied to win.What matters, especially for Mexico, is that he’s scoring at all. The goals and even consistent minutes gives El Tri something they need much more of: An in-form player, performing well in one of the best leagues in the world.It also gives Mexico a confident, veteran leader who manager Javier Aguirre may not have been expecting to have when he took over the team shortly after their collapse at the 2024 Copa América. So when the debate in Mexico became about whether Jiménez or Giménez should start, Aguirre’s answer was: Both. They partnered with to great effect in both Nations League, Jiménez admitting afterward that he liked working with another forward because it meant less attention from the stout, five-man back lines both of Mexico’s opponents lined up with.The mentorship he provides isn’t just for Giménez, though; Jiménez’s experience can even be an example for a World Cup veteran like Edson Álvarez, the 27-year-old West Ham midfielder who wore the armband this month for Mexico but is still establishing his leadership style.Aguirre now has plenty of reason to have Jiménez as one of the first names on the final squad he draws up for the 2026 World Cup, even though he will be celebrating his 35th birthday before the tournament begins on Mexican soil.For now, Jiménez insists his focus is on helping Mexico in the short-term and keeping the good vibes rolling as he returns to London.“It’s a great achievement – put the goals aside, the work of the team when we had to defend or had to attack we did it in the same way,” he said after the final victory. “We have to be smart, know how to manage matches and we got what we had been denied.”Now, Mexico go into the summer’s Gold Cup in search of something less tangible. They want to be the bully of the region again, the unquestioned top team. The regional superiority has faltered in the last few years, but Raúl’s resurgence gives Mexico hope.Explore more on these topicsMexicoFulhamUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Musk, the world’s richest man, has been tasked byDonald Trumpwith drastically slashing the federal government workforce and costs.The situation raisesconflict of interest questionsfor one of Trump’s closest allies who backed him with millions of dollars of funding in the 2024 election. Musk boasts that his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) “slashes spending”, but critics say he’s using his position to steer government funding toward his companies.Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service installed in White HouseRead moreNoaa could offer the biggest prizes yet for Musk, presenting the opportunity forSpaceXto have a commanding financial advantage in a commercial US space market expected to grow to a value of nearly $2tn in value over the next decade. Already Doge likely has access to competitors’ confidential business information at Noaa, former employees at the agency say.More importantly for the public, it would put control of the nation’s communications infrastructure in the hands of a rightwing billionaire. Noaa’s activity quietly touches the basic functions of daily life, and everything from dependable cellphone service to how Americans connect to the internet to weather forecasting is at stake, five former Noaa employees who spoke with the Guardian said.“There’s a lot of smoke but we’re not sure where the fire is yet,” a former employee said. “We’re waiting to see when the next shoe drops.”In the wake of a firing spree that gutted some Noaa space operations, Donald Trump Jr’s investment firm stoked speculation bypurchasing$50m worth of SpaceX shares. Noaa operates as part of the US commerce department and is responsible for a range of economic activity relied upon by the public. Musk’s Doge team has laid off about 1,300 Noaa staff so far.SpaceX primarily launches rockets and satellites for Musk and national governments. Starlink, meanwhile, has nearly 6,000 satellites in low-earth orbit and provides satellite broadband internet service and military communications to at least 2.7 million people in 100 countries.SpaceX is the biggest player in the private space industry and several former Noaa employees praised the company as an often good partner prior to Musk’s attack on the agency. The space technology company had strong momentum prior to the newTrump administration, making it difficult to parse what is legitimate business and what could be construed as corruption, former employees said.A new emergency Freedom of Information Actrequestfor communications among Noaa offices and Doge in part seeks to shine some light on those questions. The Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) request noted that privatization of the agency has long been a goal of the right and was called for in the Project 2025 rightwing playbook. The move “is driven by greed and corruption”, Peer’s executive director, Tim Whitehouse, said.“The danger is that Musk’s enterprises could morph into government-sponsored monopolies that would operate with no fear of antitrust prosecution,” Whitehouse added.New contracts for StarlinkLeadership for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered staff in February to find tens of millions of dollars in funding for new Starlink contracts,Rolling Stonereported. The FAA is in the process of updating ageing air traffic control networks and last year awarded a $2.4bn contract to Verizon, but Starlink has already edged into the process.At the US Government Services Administration, Doge ordered federal staff to use Starlink for internet services, an employeetold NBC News. Another agency plans to contract with Starlink, according to a federal employee familiar with the situation who spoke with NBC News. Meanwhile, Customs and Border Protectionrecently authorizedan evaluation of Starlink to help monitor the border.Gutting space traffic controlThe nascent space traffic coordination program manages thousands of satellites, debris and spacecraft, and helps prevent up to 50,000 near-collisions, called conjunctions, daily. Starlink accounts for a large number of those.Called theTraffic Coordination System for Space(Traccs), the program would also eventually provide launch and re-entry services for commercial satellites and spacecraft, former employees said. Musk’s company already works closely with Traccs, but the program has avoided “vendor lock” and contracts with multiple companies, in no small part because Musk’s agenda may not always align with the nation’s, one former official said.“SpaceX is a great service provider, but as long as he’s in control of the company it’s not anything that can be counted on,” a former Noaa employee said.Those who spoke with the Guardian said it didn’t appear that SpaceX had any interest in privatizing or taking over Traccs prior to Trump’s re-election, but Musk’s Doge fired all but one Traccs member – in effect crippling a sorely needed operation. That could open the door for privatization, and SpaceX is best positioned.“They discover something is broken and conveniently say: ‘Oh, we can fix this,’” a former Noaa employee said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But private industry’s data and forecasts are of extremely poor quality compared to those from the Noaa, a former employee said.Noaa weather satellites have redundancies and fail-safes intentionally built in, and huge effort is put into calibrating them with weather on earth: Noaa flies planes into storms to confirm that the data its satellites are providing is accurate, for example.The data is “highly reliable, 24/7, no breakdowns, no ifs, ands or buts”, a former agency employee said. If Noaa satellites fail, explode or crash, they added, then people who rely on that data may die, or serious economic damage may be inflicted.“The risk of having outages is so significant because that data is used all the time for everything, and for far more than people realize,” a former employee said.Musk, by contrast, has a mission of eliminating redundancies and finding efficiencies, and former agency employees noted his rockets and satellites have a history of crashing and exploding.Meanwhile, Noaa monitors space weather, including solar flares, coronas and radiation, and geomagnetic storms that can damage the electric grid and telecommunications on earth and beyond. That could have implications for Musk’s well-known plans to colonize Mars.“If you’re serious about sending people to Mars, then you have to be able to monitor and respond to space weather,” an employee said.Radio frequencySpaceX, telecom giants and other industries are lobbying the federal government to auction off valuable bands on the radio frequency spectrum – the electromagnetic waves thatenable wireless communication, including among the military, the CIA, Noaa and their satellites.Nasa cuts raise fears of handing more influence to SpaceX owner MuskRead moreThe obscure function is essential to a wide range of commercial activities, such as cellphone use, and industry “wants to get their hands on all that they can” because it’s a finite resource, a former agency employee said.A large part of Noaa’s forecasts stem from its satellites monitoring water vapor movement in the atmosphere, and the agency owns the radio frequencies at which vapor vibrates. If theMusk-alignedFCC sells bands too close to that frequency, potential interference could impede satellite function and disrupt reliable weather forecasting and cellphone use.“Starlink wants more and more spectrum, and you hope [the FCC] would not be stupid enough to auction off the bands next to where water vibrates, but … I wouldn’t put it past anybody,” an employee said.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskSpaceXTrump administrationSatellitesSpaceDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The company has reportedlylobbied the Trump administrationto declare, via executive order, that training AI on copyrighted data is fair use.Earlier this month, Melbourne publisher Black Inc Books caused concern among writers, literary agents and the industry’s peak body when it asked its authors toconsent to their work being used to train artificial intelligence.Some AI companies have begun entering into agreements with publishers for the use of their work, including OpenAI,which signed a deal with the Guardian in Februaryfor use of Guardian content in ChatGPT.Explore more on these topicsMetaArtificial intelligence (AI)FacebookInstagramnewsShareReuse this content"

Voice-based chatbots initially appeared to help mitigate loneliness compared with text-based chatbots, but this advantage started to slip the more someone used them.After using the chatbot for four weeks, female study participants were slightly less likely to socialise with people than their male counterparts. Participants who interacted with ChatGPT’s voice mode in a gender that was not their own for their interactions reported significantly higher levels of loneliness and more emotional dependency on the chatbot at the end of the experiment.In thefirst study, the researchers analysed real-world data from close to 40m interactions with ChatGPT, and then asked the 4,076 users who had those interactions how they felt.For thesecond study, the Media Lab recruited almost 1,000 people to take part in a four-week trial examining how participants interacted with ChatGPT for a minimum of five minutes each day. Participants then completed a questionnaire to measure their feelings of loneliness, levels of social engagement, and emotional dependence on the bot.The findings echo earlier research, for example in 2023MIT Media Lab researchersfound that chatbots tended to mirror the emotional sentiment of a user’s messages – happier messages led to happier responses.Dr Andrew Rogoyski, a director at the Surrey Institute for People-Centred Artificial Intelligence, said that because peoplewere hard-wired to to think of a machine behaving in human-like ways as a human, AI chatbots could be “dangerous”, and far more research was needed to understand their social and emotional impacts.“In my opinion, we are doing open-brain surgery on humans, poking around with our basic emotional wiring with no idea of the long-term consequences. We’ve seen some of the downsides of social media – this is potentially much more far-reaching,” he said.Dr Theodore Cosco, a researcher at the University of Oxford, said the research raised “valid concerns about heavy chatbot usage”, though he noted it “opens the door to exciting and encouraging possibilities”.“The idea that AI systems can offer meaningful support — particularly for those who may otherwise feel isolated — is worth exploring. However, we must be thoughtful and intentional in how we integrate these tools into everyday life.”Dr Doris Dippold, who researches intercultural communication at the University of Surrey, said it would be important to establish what caused emotional dependence on chatbots. “Are they caused by the fact that chatting to a bot ties users to a laptop or a phone and therefore removes them from authentic social interaction? Or is it the social interaction, courtesy of ChatGPT or another digital companion, which makes people crave more?”Explore more on these topicsChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)LonelinessComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

The last column coveredhow to stop tech companies spying on your phone as Trump promises mass deportations.The DNA testing company 23andMe hasfiled for bankruptcyafter months of concern over its financial health and its ability to keep users’ genetic information secure. In light of the uncertainty looming over the company’s future, you should do one thing to protect your privacy today: delete your 23andMe account.If you have used the service to discover your ancestry via your DNA, the extremely sensitive information you shared with 23andMe may transfer to the company’s eventual buyer. While 23andMe has a host of privacy controls that now allows users opt out of sharing their data with scientific researchers or requires the company delete their samples, that could change under a new owner.DNA testing firm 23andMe files for bankruptcy as CEO steps downRead moreGenerally, privacy and civil liberties experts do not recommend using ancestry and DNA testing services. There are few federal privacy regulations that limit how companies can use your information in the US – even your genetic data. How a private company maintains, stores and shares your data is left up to the whims of the people running it.Privacypolicies change often and so do executive suites. Not only is your data vulnerable to hacks, it can also be used for various commercial products and shared with law enforcement.23andMe has insisted that any new owner would have to comply with existing laws around the sale and use of consumer genetic data, but the reality in the US is that only a handful of states legally protect this type of personal information. In California, where this kind of privacy protection does exist, the attorney general, Rob Bonta, has issued an urgent “consumer alert” encouraging Californians to delete their 23andMe data.“California has robust privacy laws that allow consumers to take control and request that a company delete their genetic data,” said Bonta. “Given 23andMe’s reported financial distress, I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company.”There’s good reason for concern. 23andMe suffered a massive hack affecting some 7 million users in 2023. The hackers first revealed they gained access to the information when they attempted to sell what they claimed was the data of 1 million users ofAshkenazi Jewish descent and 100,000 users of Chinese descenton a popular hacking forum. In addition to a class-action lawsuit alleging the company failed to notify users of the data breach in a timely manner, the company said it was facing more than50 other lawsuitsin the wake of the hack. Its problems are international, too: the UK information commissioner’s office issued a notice of intent to fine the company £4.59m earlier this month.If you are one of 15 mllion people who have already handed over your DNA to 23andMe, what can you do to protect your data?Why I regret using 23andMe: I gave up my DNA just to find out I’m BritishRead moreHow to delete your 23andMe accountThe main thing you should do to protect your genetic privacy: delete your account.There’s a big caveat: the company says it will have to retain some information in its archives even if you delete your account. “23andMe and/or our contracted genotyping laboratory will retain your Genetic Information, date of birth, and sex as required for compliance with applicable legal obligations … even if you chose to delete your account,” the company’s privacy policy reads.If you’re reading this and you are trying to decide if you want to do a DNA test with one of these private companies, take the above caveat as a big reason not to. It’s possible, depending on what state you’re in, your data will never be completely erased.That said, it is still worth making the effort to delete your account and all the data in it. Here’s how you do it: Log in, go to settings, and scroll to “23andMe Data”. Click “view” and then scroll to “delete data”. Click “permanently delete data”. You will receive an email from the company to confirm your request. (Check your spam folder.) If you don’t confirm it via the link provided to you in the email, it will not complete your request.The company says that, once your account is deleted, you “will automatically opt you out of Research and discard your sample”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it has demanded the university shut down or restructure departments it deems to be politically problematic, and that it alter its criteria for who to admit to incoming student cohorts.We come from diverse political backgrounds and worldviews; some of us were deeply alienated by last year’s campus protests around the war in Gaza, others of us were sympathetic to the students. Regardless of our political views, however, we firmly believe that the federal government should have no role in policing Columbia’s academic structures, in shaping course requirements and personnel choices made by the university, in dictating admissions strategies, and in terrorizing students for expressing political views that the first amendment clearly protects.Yet, astoundingly, all of these changes are now being accepted by Columbia University in the vain hope of deterring a predatory government from cutting off federal funds and decimating the university’s science research facilities. The university higher-ups have sold out students and faculty alike in their efforts to access federal dollars.We recognize that the fault here lies primarily with theTrump administration, which is stampeding away from democratic norms and, by the day, reinventing the US as an autocracy in the image of Orbán’s Hungary and Putin’s Russia. We recognize, too, that universities such as Columbia are caught between a rock and hard place, damned if they cooperate with the Maga agenda and damned if they don’t.In such a dismal situation, courageously standing up for moral principles and academic codes would have been the honorable – and ultimately more effective – path to take. As Churchill famously said after England and France’s capitulation to Nazi demands at the Munich conference in which Czechoslovakia was dismembered: “You had a choice between dishonor and war; you chose dishonor and you shall have war.”Trump’s administration preys on weakness, and it is employing an extraordinarily effective divide and conquer strategy. We are seeing this in its assault onindividual law firms, such as Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, which this week cried uncle and arranged a meeting with Trump, in which itagreed to do $40mof pro bono work for clients and issues of his choice in exchange for not having their security clearances revoked.That will, of course, only empower Trump and the justice department to ask more of the capitulating attorneys and also to go after additional law firms, seeking the same result – indeed, on Friday night, Trump released a memo directing the Department of Justice to do just that. We are seeing it with major media outlets – take, for example, ABC’s extraordinary decision to donate millions of dollars to the Trump presidential library to make an inconvenient Trump lawsuit disappear; or CBS’s decision to give the Trump team access to the transcripts of its pre-election interview with Kamala Harris. Again, that will only empower Trump to demand further concessions from those companies in how they report on his Administration as well as to seek to kneecap the independence of other media outlets.And, of course, we are seeing it in the escalating war against academia. Columbia’s capitulation won’t end the nightmare that American research universities are facing, rather it will make it worse. For if an institution of the stature, and with the vast endowment resources, of an Ivy League school such as Columbia can be publicly humiliated and made to grovel for Federal crumbs, then every other academic institution in the country is rendered weaker and more open to political attack.Given this reality, we urge Columbia’s administrators to rethink their strategy in dealing with Trump’s authoritarian administration. We urge university administrators around the country to respond collectively rather than allowing themselves to be picked off one by one. And we urge Columbia alumni, of all political persuasions, to join with us in recognizing the enormous stakes in play here, and in demanding that this wonderful academic institution stand up for the values and the beliefs that have held steady since its founding more than 270 years ago. We urge alumni to call their political representatives to protest the assault on academic freedom, to contact Columbia University’s leadership to express their displeasure, and, if necessary, to withhold their donations to Columbia until such time as the university stiffens its spine in its dealings with the Trump administration.This is, we believe, one of the greatest crises facing academia in US history, and also one of the greatest assaults on free speech. How universities such as Columbia respond will determine whether universities remain independent or whether, ultimately, they end up simply serving as extensions of an increasingly authoritarian state.Sasha AbramskyJason ZiedenbergMarissa VenturaMarion DavisMartha IrvineAnna AllenGil GriffinMegan WilliamsTony Fong, Science editorVictoria Pesce ElliottHolly BassStuart DavisChuck TanowitzJennifer Cohen OkoCarolyn JurisVictoria ColliverJohn NicholsChris LombardiAlice Sparberg AlexiouElizabeth KadetskyDina HamptonAaron NaparstekKevin HeldmanJerome WeeksBetsy RosenLizzy StarkJay RossProfessor Sam FreedmanTimothy CahillExplore more on these topicsUS universitiesOpinionTrump administrationNew YorkUS politicsDonald TrumpUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

So was the indifference to the potential civilian cost of the strikeson Houthi targets in Yemen, designed to curb attacks on Red Sea shipping. The Houthi-run health ministry said that 53 people including five children and two women were killed. The response by the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, to the attacks was to post emojis: a fist, an American flag and fire. The lack of contrition for this security breach is also telling. Individually and together, these are far more than a “glitch”, in Donald Trump’s words. They are features of his administration.Mr Waltz appears to have organised the Signal chat andinadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg,editor in chief of the Atlantic. The magazine says that the secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, posted details of the timing and sequencing of attacks, specific targets and weapons systems used, though the administration denies that classified information was shared. Other members included Mr Vance; the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard; the CIA director, John Ratcliffe; Steve Witkoff, special envoy to the Middle East; and “MAR”, the initials of the secretary of state, Marco Rubio.These conversations would normally take place under conditions of high security. While Signal is encrypted, devices could be compromised. Foreign intelligence agencieswill be delighted. Legal experts say using Signal may have breached the Espionage Act.The hypocrisy is glaring. Mr Trump’s first presidential campaign – and several members of this Signal group – lambasted Hillary Clinton for using a private email server to receive official messages that included some classified information of a far less sensitive nature, and for the autodeletion of messages. These Signal messages too were set to disappear, though federal records laws mandate the preservation of such data.In many regards, this leak hammers home what US allies already knew, including this administration’scontempt for Europe, which the chat suggests will be expected to pay for the US attacks. The vice-president characterised an operation carried out to safeguard maritime trade and contain Iran as “bailing Europe out again”. Mr Hegseth responded that he “fully share[d] your loathing of European free-loading”. Concerns about information security are familiar territory too. In his first term, the president reportedlyshared highly classified informationfrom an ally with Russia’s foreign minister, and after leaving office hefaced dozens of chargesover the alleged mishandling of classified material, before a judge he had appointedthrew out the case against him.The UK and others cannot simply walk away when they are so heavily dependent on and intermeshed with US intelligence capabilities. Their task now is to manage risk and prepare for worse to come. It may be that this breach is not chiefly distinguished by its severity, but by the fact that we have learned about it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Feel safe? Me neitherTue 25 Mar 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 14.19 EDTShareOnce again, we find ourselves having an anguished debate about mobile phones and online safety, in this case asking: should we ban the devices for US national security advisers under the age of 60? Do you know what your national security adviser isdoing on his device? Is he using it to stay in touch with other guys in the big-man-osphere to talk about bombing Hooters? Or did he maybe add the editor-in-chief of a leading general interest magazine to a Signal group in the crucial period running up to a highly sensitive US military operation in Yemen, seemingly committing so many alleged crimes that he should have a full-body orange jumpsuit tattooed on him for ever?By now, you will have caught up with the tale of one of the most idiotic breaches of security imaginable – seemingly executed, regrettably, by the actualUS national securityadviser. Mike Waltz seems to have been aided and abetted in his full-spectrum fatuity by other ultra-senior figures, including the vice-president, JD Vance, and the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, who shared detailed operational and strategic information in a chat to which Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg had been accidentally invited. Is Hegseth OK? Has he returned to being – how to put this delicately? – someone you probably don’t want to give important tasks to “after lunch”?On another tangent, meanwhile, was there some extremely senior military or government official with either the first name Jeffrey, or the second name Goldberg, whom Waltz actually meant to add? And did that intended Jeffrey or Goldberg wake up the next day, see theYemennews, and feel a deeply wounded sense of Fomo? “Wait, you guys bombed Yemen without me? I hate you ALL. I demand you put me in the group chat NOW, just so I can immediately flounce off and leave the group chat.”The breach exposes so many things that it is difficult to know where to start. It certainly highlights the almost immeasurably rich lexicon of emojis. You realise that a certain type of guy deploys the same three emojis for taking out a Houthi target as they would if Bryson DeChambeau nailed a slightly tricky putt on the 14th at the West Palm Beach Pro-Am. Punching fist, USA flag, flames emoji. Let’s GO, Bryson!That said, the emojis are obviously the best of it. Less easy to scroll past is the bit where Vance, or his proxy, says: “I just hate bailing out Europe again.” Then Hegseth replies: “I fully share your loathing of European freeloading. It’s PATHETIC.” Mm. Three weeks ago, we hadVance offering a blanket disparagementof European forces as “some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years”. Now we have this Signal chat – yet another sweet memorial to all the European service personnel who gave their lives in the US Republican party’s endlessly stupid 9/11 wars. We never asked to be reimbursed for that military assistance – very BAD! very Wrong! – and are now repeatedly hearing that it meant nothing to Marine-adjacent shutterbug Vance, who remains the most unbearably loud and rude American at the luxury hotel breakfast. They really should make a darkly satirical TV show about these absurd, degenerate, unpleasant people. Call it The White Potus.Needless to say, the first instinct of the Trump administration has been to insult the journalist, when in less responsible hands than Goldberg’s this could have been catastrophically endangering information for involved US service personnel and intelligence operatives. At time of writing, Hegseth’s sole comment on the bed he and the guys just shat was to attack the man to whom they personally served this scoop, calling Goldberg “a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist”. Is he though? Come on, Pete! Given the same information in real time, your boy Joe Rogan would have livestreamed it and you know it. At least Donald Trump would have been up to speed with it that way. “I don’t know anything about it,” was the president’s sleepy verdict yesterday, a day he spent wetting his pants about some oilpainting of himhanging somewhere in the Colorado state legislature.As for consequences, do please remember that we are dealing with the biggest hypocrites on the planet. Consider their own thunderous statements on infosec. Here is the chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, just last week: “If you have a private that loses a sensitive item, that loses night vision goggles, that loses a weapon, you can bet that that private is going to be held accountable. The same and equal standards must apply to senior military leaders.” Also last week, here is Trump’s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard: “Any unauthorised release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such.” Was Tulsi on the Signal chat? Course she was! If you still want more, here’s Hegseth mining the seemingly endless potential of Hillary Clinton’s careless use of a private server for classified information back when he was a Fox News host: “If it was anyone other than Hillary Clinton, they would be in jail right now.” “When I’m president of the United States, neither she nor any of these other people are going to be above the law,” was the previous verdict of one Marco Rubio, last seen on the Houthi chat appearing in the role of secretary of state of the United States.We’ll have to wait and see if these clowns will hold themselves to their own very high standards. In the meantime, please enjoy European diplomats declaring that as far as the relationship between the continent and the US goes, this is “the writing on the wall”. If only it HAD been written on a wall – that would actually have been more secure and secretive. Come to that, it would genuinely have been more secure and secretive to hire a skywriting plane.

Absolutely no judgment if so, but anyone who isn’t into that sort of thing may want to avoid a holiday to the US at the moment. Although I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that. Unless you’ve been hiding under a news-blocking rock (in which case: what’s the address? And can I join you?), you’ll have noticed that Donald Trump’s America hasn’t exactly been rolling out the red carpet for visitors. There have been a number of recent incidents where white westerners – people who aren’t normally targeted by overzealous US immigration authorities – have been detained, deported ordenied entryfor obscure reasons.Take the 28-year-old Welsh artistRebecca Burke, for example. She was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) for 19 days in what her father described as “horrendous conditions”. Now, to be fair, Burke had the wrong paperwork: she hadn’t realised that she needed a working visa instead of a tourist visa in order to exchange domestic chores for accommodation with a host family. But getting imprisoned for almost three weeks over a mix-up and then being led on to a deportation flight –in chains!– back to a country that is supposedly a close ally, is obviously extreme. A Canadian woman alsomade headlinesafter being detained by Ice for two weeks when immigration enforcement officers flagged her visa application paperwork. And two German tourists were similarly held for almosttwo weeks in a detention centre.In response, some countries havebeefed up their adviceabout travel to the US. Last week, Germany updated its UStravel advisoryto emphasise that a visa or entry waiver does not guarantee entry. Meanwhile,the UK’s Foreign Officehas revised its guidance to emphasise that you should comply with all requirements as “the authorities in the US set and enforce entry rules strictly [and] you may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules”.The Trump administration is descending into authoritarianismRead moreForget being careful about following the rules – just don’t come here. Why spend your money in the US, which is threatening to annex its neighbours and rapidly descending into authoritarianism? I don’t say any of that lightly, to be clear. The US government is not synonymous with the American people. The majority of those didn’t actually vote for Trump: onlyabout 32% of eligible voters cast a ballot for him. There will be plenty of people in the tourism industry who are horrified about what’s happening and who may be hurt from a drop-off in international travel.Nevertheless, choosing how we spend our cash is the greatest power most of us have. And choosing to deploy it in Trump’s America helps normalise an abnormal situation. If I (a British-Palestinian with a US green card) wasn’t based in Philadelphia already, I absolutely wouldn’t be thinking about travelling stateside right now.I’ll tell you what I am thinking about a lot at the moment, however: whether it’s wise for me to do any sort of travel that involves interaction with US border authorities. When I got my green card 10 years ago, after spending more than $11,000 on legal fees and huge amounts of time on paperwork, I thought I’d finally be able to stop worrying about my US immigration status. Now, of course, as the high-profile detention ofMahmoud Khalilover his pro-Palestine activism shows, not even permanent residents are secure. Particularly if (like me) you have publicly expressed “controversial” ideas such as: Palestinians are human beings; Israel shouldn’t be allowedto kill childrenwith impunity; and Americans should be outraged that their taxpayer dollars are being used to fund a genocide.But not even keeping quiet about Palestine will protect you.Fabian Schmidt, a German green card holder, was recently detained and “violently interrogated” by US border officials – who reportedly forced him to strip and take a cold shower – for reasons that aren’t clear. Heck, you’re not even safe if you’re an American citizen. Trump recently threatened to send anti-Tesla protesters to anotorious prison in El Salvador. I used to joke about getting deported, but it’s not really something to laugh about any more – it’s something to have an emergency plan for.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTravelOpinionIsrael-Gaza warUS immigrationTrump administrationUnited States holidayscommentShareReuse this content"

It will have little meaning if multibillion-dollar corporations can sue peaceful protesters out of existence for their speech. Yet, that’s exactly what was decided in a small courtroom in Morton county, North Dakota.Energy Transfer – a Dallas-based fossil fuel company that is responsible for the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) – sued two Greenpeace entities in the US (Greenpeace Inc and Greenpeace Fund), and Greenpeace International. Energy Transfer was awarded more than $660m in a highly watched, month-long case. Greenpeace will appeal the verdict.The company sued Greenpeace entities simply for peacefully supporting the Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access pipeline back in 2016-2017. At issue in the North Dakota case are nine statements made by Greenpeace that are alleged to be defamatory.All of the statements at issue are legitimate expressions under the first amendment, and none of the statements in question were original to Greenpeace.Energy Transfer also claims that Greenpeace made alleged false statements to financial institutions involved with financing the Dakota Access pipeline – and that based on those statements, the financial institutions took action that cost Energy Transfer hundreds of millions of dollars. The financial institutions, however, had their own commitments and conducted their own due diligence regarding the Dakota Access pipeline.An initial lawsuit was filed in 2017 in federal court but it was dismissed in 2019. Energy Transfer immediately refiled a virtually identical suit in state court in North Dakota, a conservative state with strong ties to the energy sector. It is a jurisdiction where public sentiment ran against the DAPL protests – which were organized by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Indigenous water protectors.The ruling in the Energy Transfer case could have wide ranging consequences on first amendment rights in the US. By attempting to hold Greenpeace liable for everything that happened at Standing Rock, the case attempts to establish the idea that, for any participation in a protest, you can be held liable for the actions of other people, even if you’re not associated with them or if they’re never identified. It’s easy to see how this win for Energy Transfer could chill speech and silence future protests before they even begin.Greenpeace USA was one of many organizations that supported the Indigenous-led resistance. Answering a request for trainings in de-escalation and non-violence, Greenpeace USA supported a delegation from the Indigenous Peoples Power Project (IP3) to travel to Standing Rock and run non-violence trainings. In no way did Greenpeace direct the Standing Rock protest movement, or engage in (or encourage others to engage in) property destruction or violence.The legal tactic being used against the Greenpeace movement is a classic example of what’s known as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (Slapp). Slapps are frequently used by wealthy people and corporations – in this case, the oil and gas industry – to silence constitutionally protected free speech.Rather than a good faith attempt to seek remedies for harm, the goal of these lawsuits is often to bury the defendant in legal fees and waste their time on frivolous litigation. When used to silence criticism – including from whistleblowers, journalists and environmental advocacy organizations like Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International – they essentially function as a tax on free speech by making it too expensive to speak truth to power. These abusive legal tactics can be used to sue critics into bankruptcy, and they serve as a threat to anyone who may want to speak up in the future.Although 34 states and the District of Columbia have passed anti-Slapp laws, North Dakota is not one of them. And, while support for federal anti-Slapp legislation is growing in the US, there is currently no federal law on the books. That means that corporations can continue threatening abusive lawsuits in federal court or in states without protections. Without any provisions protecting public protest, corporate operations that harm the social good can proceed without restraint.Perhaps equally worrisome, this case is an attack on the type of ordinary advocacy that organizations like Greenpeace and the ACLU – alongside many others – rely on to do their work. Everyday actions like attending a protest, signing a letter of support, or supporting communities at risk should never be considered “unlawful”. Otherwise, the future of everyone’s first amendment rights could be at risk.If corporations can weaponize the court system to attack protesters and advocates for their speech, then any political speech or cause could become a target. And in an environment where theTrump administrationis regularly leading dangerous attacks against our basic rights and liberties, including against the press and activists, this threat is all the more serious.The right to protest and speak out must be embraced as a core pillar in a functioning democracy – even when that speech threatens the rich and powerful, and even when it’s speech we don’t agree with.Sushma Raman is the interim executive director of Greenpeace USAAnthony Romero is executive director of the American Civil Liberties UnionExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionProtestTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Now it’s acting like Vichy on the HudsonTue 25 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 09.15 EDTShareIt was never about eliminating antisemitism. It was always about silencing Palestine. That is what the gagging of protesting students, and now the gagging of faculty, was always meant to lead to. While partisans of the Israeli-American mass slaughter in Gaza may have been offended by their protests, large numbers of the students whose rights of free speech have been infringed upon via draconian punishments were themselves Jewish.Many of those faculty members who are about to be deprived of academic freedom and faculty governance, and perhaps fired, are themselves Jewish, indeed some are Israelis. If it were ever really about discrimination, the university would have taken action against the ceaseless harassment of Palestinian, Arab and Muslim students and faculty, and their allies and supporters, instead of endorsing and enabling it.This was always about protecting the monstrous, transparent lies that a genocidal 17-month Israeli-American war on the entire Palestinian people was just a war on Hamas, or that anything done on 7 October 2023 justifies the serial massacres of at least 50,000 people in Gaza, most of them women, children and old people, and the ethnic cleansing of the people of Palestine from their homeland. These lies, generated by Israel and its enablers, which permeate our political system and our moneyed elites, were repeated ceaselessly by the Biden and Trump administrations, by the New York Times and Fox News, and have now been officially sanctioned by a once great university.These lies are rooted in blatant racism. Frantz Fanon wrote that the Manichaenism of the colonist sometimes “goes to its logical conclusion and dehumanizes the native, or to speak plainly, it turns him into an animal”. Indeed, Israeli minister of defense, Yoav Gallant, in October 2023 called Palestinians “human animals”.Benjamin Netanyahusaid of them: “I don’t call them human animals because that would be insulting to animals.” In this colonial war, through this lens, Palestinian lives, like other brown and Black lives, are rendered a worthless, faceless, dehumanized mass, while other lives are uplifted and individually cherished and mourned.We should hold on to these thoughts as long as we can, because in the dystopian world we have entered, simple mention of race and racism are, or will soon be, violations of the perverse current reading of federal law. Once the quislings who run Columbia University have implemented the diktats of their masters in Washington and on the board of trustees, once these diktats have spread to other universities under threat, teaching and even quoting Fanon will be perilous indeed, as will be mere mention of race and racism, not to speak of gender, disability and much else. We are approaching the status of Chilean universities under Pinochet, where on the orders of an authoritarian government, ideas and books were banned, students were expelled and arrested, departments were taken over, and faculty and staff fired.The US government has sent Columbia University a ransom note | Sheldon PollockRead moreWe should not mourn what Columbia has become, for as great as it may have been, none of this is entirely new. Before the current expulsions and suspension, Columbia once in its history expelled a student for non-violent protest: in 1936 for protesting against offering a platform to Nazis. In 1953 its president signed a letter pronouncing communists unfit to teach. Columbia trustees fired two faculty members for opposing the first world war on pacifist grounds, while student conscientious objectors were arrested and jailed.Columbia has long been run more like the vast, wealthy business and real estate empire that it is, than as an educational institution. It is a place where trustees, donors and powerful professional schools dictate its policy, not the rest of its faculty. In the spring of 2024, two-thirds of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted no confidence in a president who bowed to outside pressure, threw her faculty under the bus, and called in the NYPD for the first time since 1968. Her successor has outdone her, further garlanding Columbia’s already rich repressive traditions with groveling obeisance to government dictates that were promoted and eagerly seconded by shameless collaborators within the university.After Friday’s capitulation, Columbia barely merits the name of a university, since its teaching and scholarship on the Middle East, and soon much else, will soon be vetted by a “senior vice provost for inclusive pedagogy”, in reality a senior vice provost for Israeli propaganda. Partisans of Israel, infuriated that scholarship on Palestine had found a place at Columbia, once named it “Bir Zeit on the Hudson”. But if it any longer merits the name of a university, it should be called Vichy on the Hudson.Rashid Khalidi is the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies at Columbia University and author of The Hundred Years’ War on PalestineExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionUS universitiesIsraelDonald TrumpIsrael-Gaza warUS educationMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Whether it will prove strong enough to protect Europe’s liberal democracies and deter Russia without US military support may be tested all too soon.Nato was created under US leadership to keep the Soviet Union at bay while suppressing centuries-old rivalries among European powers. The alliance stayed united through the cold war and attracted new central European members after communist rule collapsed. But the spectre ofUS disengagementnow threatens to leave Europe without its nuclear-armed protector.As Trump races to seek an accommodation with Putin at the expense of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, European leaders have discovered to their dismay that neither Nato nor the EU is in a position to provide security guarantees for Kyiv. Trump has nixed any Nato role in Ukraine and Hungary’s Viktor Orbánhas blockedany EU consensus.A “coalition of the willing” has brought nations together in varying configurations to try to bolster Volodymyr Zelenskyy and pull together a possible security force for Ukraine in case of a ceasefire. At its core is a group of five European powers – the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Italy – dubbed the E5, which has the makings of a durable if informal security council.Between them, these five nations have most of Europe’s economic output, military forces and political clout. Britain and France are Europe’s only nuclear powers and permanent members of the UN security council. Germany has Europe’s biggest economy and has just loosened its constitutional debt brake to unleash a massive surge in defence spending. Poland is Nato’sbiggest defence spenderproportionate to gross domestic product and will soon have Europe’s biggest army.The E5 is not an ideal format. The eight Nordic and Baltic states that are leaders in European defence and resilience deserve a voice. On the other hand, Italy’s seat at the top table owes more to its legacy status as a southern founder member of the EU, and to the prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s political ties to Trump, than to Rome’s willingness to take any military risks forUkraine.The French president, Emmanuel Macron,first raisedthe need for a European security initiative in 2017 to mitigate the geopolitical damage from Britain’s vote to leave the EU. Nothing came of it then because the wounds of Brexit were too raw. Macron tried again after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, leading to the creation of a 44-nationEuropean political communitythat brought together leaders of “free Europe” for strategic discussions. Without executive powers or a secretariat, the forum has so far been more a photo opportunity than an effective continent-wide security body, but at least it gathers the European family.In a Guardian column last September, I noted thatEurope appearedto have settled into a holding pattern of helping Ukraine just enough to keep its head above water but not enough for it to prevail. A Nato official told me it may take a “second shock” of the magnitude of Russia’s full-scale invasion to jolt Europeans out of their complacency and spur them to take more radical collective steps to boost their own defences.Trump’s return to the White House has delivered that shock. Within a few short weeks, he adopted Moscow’s narrative on the origins of the war,branded Zelenskyy a dictator, subjected him to ahumiliating ambushin the Oval Office, and cut off arms and intelligence for Kyiv. He riled allies with demands that the US take over Greenland, part of EU member Denmark, retakecontrol of the Panama canaland absorb Canada as the 51st state of the US.Europe is crying out for leadership. After years of drift, Germany is finally ready to answer | John KampfnerRead moreTrump undermined Nato by saying he would not defend countries that did not meet their defence spending targets. His vice-president, JD Vance, excoriated European democratic values in ahostile speechat the Munich Security Conference, and his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, told European allies the US wasshifting its military focusto Asia and they would need to take care of their own security in future. The shock sits deep and some European governments are still in denial, at least publicly.London and Paris have taken the lead in trying to moderate Trump and prevent him selling out Ukraine while organising a European mobilisation to support Kyiv. The European Commission has put forward a collaborativerearmament plancentred on €150bn in EU loans. There are now reports that the UK, France, Germany and Nordic countries are working on a plan for aphased European takeoverof US Nato responsibilities over five to 10 years, to be put to Trump before a Nato summit in June.All this suggests that a de-facto European security council is already at work trying to limit the damage from Trump’s geopolitical wrecking ball and prevent a security vacuum in Europe. However, reports that his administration is alsoconsidering vacatingthe top Nato military post of Supreme Allied Commander Europe, which has embodied the transatlantic security guarantee since 1951 (with Eisenhower in the role), suggest the transition may be sudden, unilateral and chaotic rather than gradual, consensual and negotiated.That would be a true stress test of whether Europeans can handle their own security in an increasingly lawless world of predatory great powers.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When we feel thwarted by nature all we can do is cling to hopeTue 25 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 18.32 EDTShare“You can’t get this wrong, they grow by themselves!” she laughs.I love a lush garden and dream of being surrounded by the cacophony of flowers, bees and butterflies that were a staple of my Indian childhood. But I am reconciled that the decidedly meditative act of sowing, tending and reaping must wait until retirement.My patient has other ideas. At the end of a consultation, when I ask how she is coping, she furnishes images of her indoor garden. Shrubs, palm fronds and dainty blooms. But one plant captures my whole attention. It stands tall, nearly touching the ceiling as if pulled there by an invisible string.Its leaves are big and bright, sturdy in the way of broad shoulders. They grow all the way along the stem. No broken or curled leaves, no hesitant shoots, just a solid staircase of soothing green all the way up. So, when she says that this is the thing she looks to for tranquillity, I understand. This plant has a presence. And a certain dignity. I can imagine holding a quiet dialogue with it.Noting my interest, she does what thoughtful people do. The next time, she presents me with a baby version of the plant.I am touched, but find myself confessing that even supposedly “low maintenance” plants perish under my watch. You’ll be fine, she laughs. The subtext is, “even you can do this.”I place the white pot inside our front entrance where I can see it and remember her. The plant has two nascent leaves. It looks content in the corner it shares with the fake orchid.Clinical cancer trials are vital for scientific progress – but there are many unanswered questions for patients | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreOwing to a family history, my patient has an aggressive cancer. Her measured temperament does no justice to her bad luck. But a pragmatic acceptance of her situation mixed with resolute determination to do her best is inspiring. In her case, the best turns out to be a complete response to treatment.Every oncologist has an indelible memory of a patient’s disease unexpectedly melting away. Later, there will be nuanced questions about the how and why, but in that moment of discovery, there is only happiness – and a tsunami of hope.When her disease eventually returns, her failing body serves only to gird her spirit. As I rue my inability to make a tangible difference to her survival, she repeatedly tells me that she is not afraid to die. Searching her face, I see that she is serious and am moved by her equanimity. Her funeral overflows with well-wishers, testament to a short life lived with great love and unceasing generosity.Months later, during an intense Australian summer, I notice one leaf of the plant go brown and another curl inward. The other four leaves look healthy. I take extra care to water the plant, hoping this will do the trick. Next, I sprinkle some plant food, willing its revival. I move it from sun to shade and shade to sun. But nothing I do is good enough. I am not usually sentimental about plants, but this exercise tests me.For weeks, I wonder why I am taking extraordinary measures until I realise that the plant’s journey is a metaphor for my patient’s life.At the start, she was youthful and energetic, and my early care kept her that way.Then, as her health took a downturn, my efforts stopped helping.More chemotherapy was not better; more surgery was not the answer; until finally, even more worrying was pointless. In hospice, under the fog of sedation, she smiled at me with her eyes, said thank you and went back to sleep. The once consoled was now doing the consoling.“Indoor plant dying: why?” I ask Google.Underwatered, overwatered, overfertilised, underfertilised, too much sun, not enough sun. And if it’s none of those, Google unhelpfully declares, then the diagnosis is: failure to thrive.In this age of modern medical miracles, all I could offer my patient was that I would walk with her until the endIs it a coincidence that this was the opaque diagnosis I had offered my patient when she asked why, despite everything I was doing, she never felt quite right? I feel glum, and to an extent, thwarted by nature. Again.I wonder if my patient’s more deliberate care and attention might have resuscitated the plant. Did hers grow into an indoor tree because it was serving a greater purpose while mine just stood guard at the front door?“Do you want me to replace it, love?” my gardener offers innocently. With my track record, we have had this conversation before, and I have usually, gratefully, agreed.“No need”, I swallow, feigning a nonchalance I don’t feel. What good would it do to burden him with why?Abandonment is just a word, but in the doctor-patient relationship, it has enormous implications. Many cancer patients report that once they stop responding to treatment,their oncologists grow uninterested. From my vantage point, this is neither fully true nor so simple – but that doesn’t really matter.In this age of modern medical miracles, all I could offer my patient was that I would walk with her until the end. I was there the night before she died, still processing my disbelief and devastation.As we enter the cooler months, I am hoping anew. Maybe the plant will shake off its ailment and reach for the ceiling. Or maybe that’s an unlikely story I am telling myself.Like their patients, doctors cling to hope, too.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

They make vast profits and hold great influence over our governments and institutions. However, the inconvenient truth is that they have only managed to become so powerful and profitable because they help themselves to our personal data. These are mostly US companies – but they extract and exploit vast amounts of data, and with that data economic value, from British citizens.At a time when many are struggling with the cost of living, it is paradoxical that vast amounts of money are being made by the richest companies in history from the data being provided by the same people. This data often contains extremely intimate personal information, which is then used to influence people’s behaviour.Despite protections under British law, the social media companies have been allowed to get away with these activities largely unchallenged. They need to be reminded that they are not too big to have to abide by our laws. That is why the news thatTanya O’Carroll,a human rights campaigner from London, has reached a settlement in her landmark case against Facebook’s parent company, Meta, is a most important development.Four years ago, O’Carroll wrote toMetastating that she wished to exercise her right under Europe’s general data protection regulation or GDPR to object to the processing of her personal data. The law is clear that the right to object is absolute when it comes to targeted advertising, and people are entitled to exercise the right free of charge.View image in fullscreenMark Zuckerberg at an event in California in September 2024.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesO’Carroll was worried about the extremely detailed and private information thatFacebookwas using to target advertisements at her – including matters such as her family relationships, financial interests and political views. This wasn’t information that Tanya had provided to Facebook, but characteristics it had inferred about her based on her activity online.Now, just days before going to trial, Meta has agreed, for the first time, to stop targeting advertising to a user, based on their personal data.O’Carroll’s case is certainly a watershed: it suddenly opens up the possibility for millions of people across the UK to follow in her footsteps, and object to the processing of their personal data by Meta. The nonprofit organisation Ekō isrunning a campaignto help people do just that.By using their right to object, people could trigger a change in their relationship with tech giants. Instead of continuing to passively be the product that these companies sell to advertisers for vast profit, social media users may now be able to force these companies to rethink the value they offer them. Locking in users and huge, seemingly guaranteed, profits have long created hubris among the social media platforms – and, in recent years, a sharpdecline in the quality of the productthat they offer.This could therefore be a significant moment in the short history of social media in our country. It is crucial that our courts and regulators now robustly enforce the law. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) intervened in support of O’Carroll in the run-up to this outcome. Now, if Meta starts to push back, the ICO must enforce the right for others to object.But the government could still get in the way. The tech giants have considerable influence over politics around the world, and the UK is no different. The governmenthas suggestedthat it will create a favourable policy environment for these US companies to do what they like with British consumers. The decision to replace the head of the Competition and Markets Authoritywith a former Amazon bosslooks like a step in this direction and this must not happen with the ICO and other regulators. It is also crucial that potential legislative changes under thedata (use and access) billdo not undermine the ICO’s independence.If the law is now properly enforced, O’Carroll winning her right to privacy against one of the wealthiest companies in history represents a significant tip in the balance of power between social media platforms and ordinary people in our country. It is also a reminder of the importance of public interest cases, and how crucial it is that they are adequately funded and thus able to be brought.For too long Meta has used its size and influence to lobby its way out of accountability. The law exists to protect citizens and uphold their rights. It is high time technology giants were obliged to respect these rights.Dominic Grieve was Conservative MP for Beaconsfield from 1997 to 2019, and attorney general from 2010 to 2014Explore more on these topicsMetaOpinionFacebookPrivacySocial mediaTechnology sectorDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

On paper, Amelia’s one of theluckier ones:she has a stable job and lives in a city where rents are 35% lower than the national average. Yet for three months, Amelia has failed to find a single alternative home she could afford.Though she is theoretically eligible for social housing, joining the1.3m householdsalready trapped on waiting lists won’t fix her immediate crisis. Neither, it seems, will Labour’s flagship pledge tobuild 1.5m new homes.Last month, the government promised a£350m increasein affordable housing funds. But what does “affordable” mean in practice? It’s defined as a rent of no more than80% of market rate. In a market where house priceshave risen to nine timesaverage wages in England and Wales, 80% of any such amount has clearly becomecompletely unaffordablefor most people.Of the 2,800 new affordable homes to be built with the extra funding, the government has said half will be social rent (homes that are either owned by housing associations or local authorities, available at 50% of market rate and meant for people on low incomes); the money will alsofund an additional 250 council homes. These promises come on the back of ministers consistently acknowledging theunabating lack of social homes. This raises the question: why are Labour’s interventions not commensurate with the scale of the problem we are facing, and the opportunity it has to fix it?Successive governments have exacerbated rather than solved the crisis, with policies solidifying housing as a commodity rather than a right. The housing crisis experienced by people such as Amelia is a direct result of the selloff of social housing. This has been caused, in part, by thefailure to endordevolvethe right-to-buy scheme, which has seen more than100,000 social homes lostsince 2015, four in 10 of which are now rented out for profit in the private market.This loss of social homes is also directly contributing to astronomical increases in temporary accommodation costs – a staggering89% over the past decade. In 2023-2024 alone, councils in Englandspent £2.3bn on temporary accommodation. In some regions, such as Yorkshire and Humber, councils are payingabout three timesthe rate of private rent on temporary accommodation.Hard-hit councils are trying entrepreneurial fixes to housing shortages, looking for homes far outside their areas. Last week, the London borough of Enfield beganlooking for homes around Liverpool. Simultaneously, from 2021 to 2026, councils willhave paid £70bnin subsidy to landlords through local housing allowance.Call it Thatcher’s timebomb: the great council housing selloff, a crisis hidden in plain sight | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreThe real solution is providing council housing that protects individuals’ right to shelter and brings in revenue to fund public services. While Labour’s stated aim is to prioritise growth, its inaction means that public and private money is being haemorrhaged on housing costs. If households were not being forced to spend almost half of their incomes on housing, they would have disposable income to spend locally. Shelter has recently shown that investment in 90,000 social homes could bring£51bn into the economyover 30 years.But so far, the government’s interventions seem to primarily serve the interests of developer-landlords. These perpetual winners continue to reap the financial rewards of building new homes, while wriggling out ofsection 106affordable housing commitments, too often on the grounds of depleted profit margins. Asresearchfrom the University of Sheffield shows, in Manchester between 2012 and 2020 only 151 affordable homes were built – quite a slump from themandatory20% affordable housing target of 4,583 homes. This is theextractive development modelin practice.The new planning and infrastructure bill is set to bolster this system, through a focus on “cutting the red tape” to build faster and bigger. Bulldozing the planning system is being celebrated by the developers and the building sector, a tell-tale sign of whois set to winfrom these changes. It is no coincidence that the build-to-let firms have, in 2025, become the UK’slargest single type of business, increasing more than fourfold from 2016. The developer-led model will never prioritise social and genuinely affordable housing.With Labour’s current plans, renters will not see their lives improve. Instead, they need the government to shift its focus and take seriously the opportunity that social housing offers – for people’s lives and the economy – complemented by mechanisms to deal with unfettered rent increases. Unless this government takes action on social housing, anyone who rents privately in this country might soon be facing the same crisis as Amelia.*This name has been changedAbi O’Connor is an urban sociologist who researches the political economy of housing, land and regional inequality at the New Economics Foundation and the University of LiverpoolExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionPlanning policyRenting propertyHousingPropertyLabourAngela RaynercommentShareReuse this content"

The government usually doesn’t want to give away its entire election strategy.In the past such budgets have not gone well. The2019 “back to black” budgetwas filled with absurd assumptions about how wonderful the economy would be. The2022 March budgetwas one of the worst-delivered to date – both pointless and dumb – sugar hits designed to buy an election win and then … well, nothing.Budget 2025: Chalmers spruiks a ‘modest but meaningful’ $5 a week in a budget that puts Dutton in a pickle | Josh ButlerRead moreAndhow does this budget look, given that Katy Gallagher on Monday said: “As finance minister, I probably get 100 good ideas for one that we can do.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailWell, forget 100, let’s see if there are any good ideas.Tax cuts!Forget not wanting to give away the election strategy!Angus Taylorfor the past few weeks has been absolutely banging on about people paying an extra $3,500 on average in tax compared with June 2022 due to bracket creep. It was – and I’m being kind here – a truly stupid argument. People were paying more tax for two main reasons – they were earning more money because wage rises have improved over the past three years and because in 2022, in his last budget, Josh Frydenberg got rid of the $1,500 low-middle income tax offset.The treasurer quietly let Taylor bang on and on about the inability to afford a tax cut, and then he slapped down two pretty decent tax cuts.I haven’t seen a plan come together this well since Road Runner painted a tunnel on a cliff face.These are pure Labor tax cuts – in the real sense of what theLabor partyshould be all about. Dropping only the bottom tax rate from 16% to 15% in 2026-27 and then 14% in 2027-28 delivers the biggest percentage cut to those on $45,000 – and everyone earning more than that gets $268, which is nice but not absurd.If the graph does not display, click hereIt delivers over the two years a 1.2% tax cut to those on $45,000, and means that including the stage-three tax changes and the loss of the low-middle income tax offset, the very vast majority of people are paying less tax.Checkmate, Angus.Budget deficitsThe big shocker for me was not just the tax cuts but that the budget deficit is not all that changed. In December the Treasury estimated a budget deficit in 2025-26 of 1.6% of GDP; now it is 1.5% of GDP. The budget also forecasts a lower deficit in 2026-27 than in the December mid-year economic and fiscal outlook.To be honest I really don’t care – as I have said repeatedly – about deficits, and these changes are minute. Will this one come true? We shall see:If the graph does not display, click hereThere will of course be much talk about “deficits as far as the eye can see”. But we really should start to realise that a budget surplus is neither something that represents success nor something that is usual.The budget has been in deficit 33 of the past 50 years – or two-thirds of the time since Gough Whitlam lost office. And yet in that time our standard of living has greatly improved and we still exist as a sovereign nation.The economy is not exactly humming.No, not a recession, but nothing you would want to brag about.There were warning signs thatdowngrades were cominglast week when the OECD, reacting to Donald Trump’s diarrhoea sandwich of autocracy and idiocy, downgraded growth figures around the world,including Australia’s.Largely these downgrades are not in place in this budget.If the graph does not display, click hereAre these heroic assumptions? No, but they are not pessimistic. You can’t forecast for what Trump might do but these do smack a bit of “Please Donald, don’t screw things up”.As it is, if these estimates come true it will still mean three years in a row of the economy growing slower than 2.5%. That is decidedly not an overheating economy.Still lots of tax5:37Federal budget 2025: Chalmers delivers speech spruiking tax cuts and energy relief – videoI was pretty sure there would be a big downgrade in tax revenue – that seemed to be the line. But nope: as with the previous two years there is more revenue than was previously expected.Employment growth is projected to be a bit better, wage growth is expected to be a bit better and unemployment is expected to be a bit better.

A bit of lower-than-expected NDIS payments, shifting around some infrastructure spending and some using of the contingency reserve. Is it a bit funny? Well, it’s not the most opaque thing I’ve seen and overall there are not a lot of “savings” to be found that are actual cuts.The opposition will likely gnash teeth in faux outrage at the lack of a surplus and tell everyone it would have been able to deliver one. In reality, given the amount of tax revenue, no government this century has delivered a surplus – and definitely not John Howard and Peter Costello:If the graph does not display, click hereOne thing that we are not seeing is much tax from gas companies. Revenue from the petroleum resources rent tax is set to keep falling.Two years ago the treasury estimated that over the four years of 2023-24 through to 2026-27 we would raise $10bn from the PRRT. Now we are down to $6.3bn. So, during a major gas boom, the government raised half the revenue from the PRRT than it did from excise on spirits – well done, gin and whisky drinkers, we salute you.If the graph does not display, click hereGood thing the government askedthe gas industry how to change the PRRTso it would raise more revenue. That worked a treat.Big spending?Perhaps the easiest line to take if you are looking to criticise an ALP budget and you reside in the opposition leader’s office, or the news.corp editorial office (apologies for the repetition) is to have a look at the spending and say: the budget is out of control, spending gone mad, absence of tough decisions.Never mind that in March 2022, when Josh Frydenberg tried to buy his way to an election win,The Australian ranwith “the cost of winning” and suggested that the “Treasurer gives Coalition a shot at poll ‘miracle’.”We don’t need to be so biased, and this budget is not really sloshing money around.The growth of public demand gives the best indicator of the impact the government spending will have both on the economy and inflation. In 2025-26 public demand growth is just 3% and then 2% the following year – pretty mild – especially given that the private sector is expected to grow pretty weakly:If the graph does not display, click hereAs for the overall spending, weirdly we have a range of commentators trying to compare the amount the government is now spending with how much it spent before the NDIS was introduced. Once we take that disability support, not only is this budget not a big-spending one, it is actually downright measly:If the graph does not display, click hereGood ideas?Downright measly is certainly how those on jobseeker will feel – still existing 38% below the poverty line. Yes, there is some good new spending on bulk billing andthe PBS. The extension of theenergy rebateswas unsurprising (although it’s a bit odd it didn’t slowly wind it back) and it’s always good to find savings bycutting back on consultants. And yes, the tax cut is mostly for low-income earners.But the budget still contains $10.8bn for fuel tax credits, most of which will go to mining companies. The budget does nothing to wind back the tax abuses of the superannuation system or the 50% capital gains tax discount that has distorted the housing market.Still not much tax from gasClearly the government has many good ideas – maybe even 99 of them. But the government has decided that none of them was better than letting gas companies get away with paying bugger-all tax or the richest 10% gettingabout $40bn a year in tax breaks.Yes, this is a good budget for low- and middle-income earners, but hopefully one day we will see a budget that also does the work undoing all the distortions and hurt that still remains in our economy.Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian budget 2025GrogonomicsAustralian economyAustralian politicsTaxWelfareBusinessAngus TaylorcommentShareReuse this content"

Depriving 2 million pensioners of the winter fuel allowance. Refusing to scrap the two-child benefit cap to lift nearly half a million children out of poverty. Raising tuition fees for students by more than the rate of inflation. Cuttingoverseas aidto the poorest people across the globe by half. Cutting£5bn from benefitsfor disabled people. Introducing a new round of cuts to government department spending andlaying off 50,000public sector workers.I very much doubt even 12 months ago you would have thought that this would be theLabourparty in government.It is expected that in the spring statement, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will seek to justify this effective return to austerity by the necessity to maintain “iron” economic discipline through a rigid adherence to her fiscal rules. The chancellor’s argument will be that the world has changed, which is true, but this prompts the question: why, then, doesn’t the government’s strategy change to meet the situation it now finds itself in? Even Germany’s iron laws welded into its constitutionare being adaptedto the new economic realities.Media briefings suggest that in her spring statement speech on Wednesday Reeves wants to be upbeat about Labour’s achievements so far. She is likely to cite the welcome rise in the minimum wage, but may fail to acknowledge that even working full-time on the minimum wage means a person is nearly £10,000 below the annual income, after tax,calculated by the Joseph Rowntree Foundationas necessary to secure an acceptable standard of living.In recent interviews Reeves has already claimed this year’s above-inflation rise in wages as a government success, but has failed to mention that even with this long awaited rise, wages remain so low that37% of peoplehaving to claim universal credit are actually in work.At least she will have some big numbers to cite on investment in the NHS and infrastructure. The problem is that much of the new NHS money could be drained away by the strains placed on it as disabled people find they are unable to cope without the support that has been taken away from them. This will include elderly people without adequate physical care and younger people without mental health support.The problem with the increase in infrastructure investment is also that the memory of the cut in Ed Miliband’sgreen investment budgetlingers in the mind and, as Reeves has repeatedly been warned, infrastructure investment takes a long time to feed into growth on any scale in the economy, and any benefit is likely to land after the next election.The danger now is that the government’s standing could be irretrievably damaged as the Labour party is branded just another austerity party. This will provide the key that opens the door to the populist Reform UK. Nigel Farage’s party doesn’t need to present a rational, implementable alternative economic policy programme. It will simply go full Trump to distinguish itself from both Conservatives and Labour by portraying itself as anti-establishment, the defender and voice of the working class – while targeting immigrants, wokeism and even some corporations.The polls and council byelection results are showing that there is a crisis of confidence in the government, reflecting the reactions and worries about recent policies among our supporters and even party members. But it is not too late to turn things around. In the very short term, a relaxing of the fiscal rules would enable the chancellor to raisesufficient taxesfrom those with the broadest shoulders to prevent a return to ongoing austerity.It is not rocket science to implement a programme of marginal tax rises that would end cuts and fund the progressive policies any Labour government would aim to pursue. The list is obvious: equalising capital gains tax with income tax rates; a realistic rise in corporation tax; afinancial transaction tax; the introduction of a small wealth tax on multimillionaires, called for by thePatriotic Millionaires group.There are also many non tax measures to help people who are still struggling with the cost of living, such as fair rent controls, service charge caps, stricter controls on energy and water price rises, and reviews of food price rises to prevent price gouging. However, the spring statement and the subsequent public spending review in June should define what the long-term strategy of the government is rather than responding to the short-term political and economic mess it has created for itself. For this I urge the chancellor to look beyond just stabilising our economy and managing the existing system slightly more efficiently than the Conservative chancellors before her.Labour’s economic strategy is outdated. I can fix that | Jagjit ChadhaRead morePeople want long-term change that provides everyone with a decent quality of life and addresses the grotesque levels of inequality in our society and the environmental crisis. Over the past 25 years, I have followed the work of Richard Wilkinson and subsequently his colleague Kate Pickett at theEquality Trust. Their detailed research has forensically revealed the impact of inequality on our society and economy. To quote thetrust’s reporttimed to coincide with the election of the new government last year: “Biased public policies and flawed economic systems are serving a few wealthy people at the expense of the wellbeing of people and planet.”The report went on to outline how the duty that was enacted in the Equality Act 2010 to reduce inequalities resulting from socioeconomic disadvantage could be implemented by redistribution power and wealth in our society. This includes new policy-making mechanisms that empower communities to identify and design the services to address their needs, wealth taxes to fund these, universal social security programmes and community wealth-building.I thought and hoped, maybe naively, that this was the sort of programme that the incoming Labour government would implement. The track record of the government so far is, sadly, remarkably distant from this progressive approach. The spring statement could be the opportunity to change that narrative, not just by bridging the short funding gap with redistribution but more importantly to narrate and launch the longer term progressive path we need to achieve true Labour goals.My remaining hope is that the chancellor will seize that opportunity, for I fear that if she doesn’t it will be impossible to recover the ground we have lost.John McDonnell is the independent MP for Hayes and Harlington.

Most now accept the need for closer tiesTue 25 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 07.49 EDTShareAs the chancellorekes out every last billionthis week, it’s worth stepping back and remembering one key reason why Britain fares worse than its neighbours: Brexit. On Monday,MPs debatedwhether to rejoin the EU following the success of a public petition that gained 134,000 signatures. Don’t hold your breath. The government replied by quoting its not-until-hell-freezes-over manifesto pledge: “there will be no return to EU membership”. But the global Trumpquake has shaken all certainties, upended all that seemed solid. The European defence emergency has made talk of Brexit and its future less taboo on both sides of the Channel. Close observers note the ice breaking. “Things are moving in the right direction,” says Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform (CER).Nonetheless, Labour is so paralysed by Brexit that despite its hunt for growth, it has said nothing about the monumental sums that leaving the EU have cost the economy. Estimates vary, but the CER sets ourlosses at 5% of GDP. That’s a vast sum: 1% of Britain’s GDP is worth£25.6bn. Goldman Sachs’scalculations are similar. Researchers at the London School of Economics found that theUK lost £27bn in exportsto the EU in the first two years; the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) reckons Britain has seen a15% reductionin trade.Last week Policy Exchange, a pro-Brexit thinktank, tried to salvage some shred of Brexit’s reputation, but to no avail. Sifting through the statistics, even it couldn’t find any Brexit advantages. Try as it might to produce a positive narrative, its reportLess Than Meets the Eyecould only attempt to limit the damage. It concluded that the OBR’s 15% trade reduction was “greatly exaggerated – and that the real impact is only a small fraction of what has been assumed”.Out tumbles more bad Brexit news. This month the Food and Drink Federation reported that its exports to the EU, much its biggest market, weredown by 34%. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research found that businesses now invested12.4% lessthan they would have done if Brexit hadn’t happened. The City lost 40,000 finance jobs soon after Brexit: those high earners who have departed Britain lost the Treasury£1bn a year in tax.You want more? Brexit is a key factor in the worst UK medicine shortages in four years, the Nuffield Trustreported this month. I have folders full of similar figures, but let’s leave it with this from the thinktankUK in a Changing Europe: “Five years on and Brexit still defines the UK economy … and will continue to.” In the long term, forget budgets picking over a little taxing and cutting here and there as Britain falls further behind. Rachel Reeves is right to call growth our only hope. But Brexit is a great drag on that ambition. Even if the UK schmoozes itself into avoiding Donald Trump’s very worst tariffs, the EU is still our biggest market.“The world has changed,” the chancellor told the BBC. The doubt is whether the government is changing fast enough to repair the pain caused by Brexit. Now is the moment to speak honestly about Brexit’s colossal harm. Most know it already, according to the polls. Even 54% of Britons who voted leave, including 59% of voters in “red wall” seats, say they would accept free movement for UK and EU citizens in exchange forsingle market access.Most politicians shudder at any rerun of the poisonous referendum, but it’s good to keep preparing the ground, as with this latest Westminster debate, even while the government fails to follow changing public attitudes. Keir Starmer has called for an “ambitious UK-EUdefence and security partnership”, butFrance has blocked British defence companiesfrom accessing a €150bn (£125bn) European defence fund. How the Brexiters celebrated.“So much for the Brexit reset!”sneered the Mail. Grant of the CER is optimistic that the French will fall in with the rest of the EU, and that Britain will get access the fund. Behind the scenes, UK ministers and their EU counterparts have beenshuttling across the Channelfor meetings.The three asks in Labour’s manifesto are important: a veterinary deal to let food cross the border, a mutual recognition agreement for professional qualifications and performing artists free to travel, not yet agreed by the EU. Youth mobility looks likely to be agreed for the 19 May EU-UK summit. But these measures won’t yield much economic benefit. The CER’sJohn Springford calculatedthey will only add 0.3-0.7% to UK GDP.Labour is jumpy at even mentioning youth mobility, but it’s time to resist the Home Office and take all students and young temporary residents out of migration numbers.Starmer’s adept handling of Ukraine has won goodwill for Britain, but the EU will stay dubious about a country that assaulted it – and all it stands for. It would help restore trust in UK good faith if they saw him facing down the Brexiters and their noisy media, now barely more than a minority cult, so mad they even explode with fury at the UK aligning with the EU’s universalphone chargers.There is a destination Britain should aim for: Switzerland. It hasjust renegotiatedits complex patchwork of EU agreements, partly in the single market, for goods only. It has food and product safety agreements dynamically aligned, keeping up with changes and covering electricity trade, which Britain wants too. It’s inside the Horizon and Erasmus funding programmes (for research and education and training respectively). It allows freedom of movement, with the same “emergency brake” that Cameron originally agreed. However inflexible the EU seems, Switzerland shows painstaking deals of mutual advantage can crisscross the apparently rigid single market rules.Making the Blair/Brown mistake of never explaining to voters the value of the EU, Starmer doesn’t dare make bold speeches to Britain about his EU reset. It’s time he did. He might find he attracts great respect for telling the truth about whatBrexithas done to us, by daring to confront the Brexiters head on.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionEconomic policyBrexitEuropean UnionEconomic growth (GDP)Foreign policyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

We can reveal the culprit was a tiny – but harmful – type of planktonic algae calledKarenia mikimotoi.The South Australian government sent us water samples from Waitpinga beach, Petrel Cove beach, Encounter Bay boat ramp and Parsons Headland on Tuesday. We studied the water under the microscope and extracted DNA for genetic analysis.Mysterious sea foam on South Australian beaches reportedly leaves more than 100 surfers illRead moreOur results revealed high numbers of the tiny harmful algal species – each just 20 microns in diameter (where one micron is one thousandth of a millimetre). While relatively common in Australian coastal waters, blooms ofK. mikimotoioccur only sporadically. But similar harmful algal blooms and fish kills due toK. mikimotoihave happened in the past, such as the2014 bloomin Coffin Bay, South Australia. And this latest one won’t be the last.Harmful algal bloomsSingle-celled, microbial algae occur naturally in seawater all over the world.They are also called phytoplankton because they float in the water column and photosynthesise like plants. “Phyto” comes from the Greek word for plant and “plankton” comes from the Greek word for wanderer, which relates to their floating movement with ocean currents and tides.Like plants on land, the microalgae or phytoplankton in the ocean capture sunlight and produce up to half the oxygen in our atmosphere. There are more than 100,000 different species of microalgae. Every litre of seawater will normally contain a mixed group of these different microalgae species.But under certain conditions, just a single species of microalgae can accumulate in one area and dominate over the others. If we are unlucky, the dominant species may be one that produces a toxin or has a harmful effect.This so-called “harmful algal bloom” can cause problems for people and for marine life such as fish, invertebrates such as crabs, and even marine mammals such as whales and seals.View image in fullscreenK. mikimotoicauses harmful deadly algal blooms in Asia, Europe, South Africa and South America, as well as Australia andNew Zealand.Photograph: Anthony RowlandThere are hundreds of different species of harmful algae. Each produces its own type of toxin with a particular toxic effect.Most of these toxic chemical compounds produced by harmful algae are quite well known, including neurotoxins that affect the brain. But others are more complicated, and the mechanisms of toxicity are poorly understood. This can make it more difficult to understand the factors leading to the deaths of fish and other marine life. Unfortunately, the toxins fromK. mikimotoifall into this latter category.IntroducingKarenia mikimotoiThe species responsible for recent events in South Australia,K. mikimotoi, causes harmful algal blooms in Asia, Europe, South Africa and South America, as well as Australia and New Zealand. These blooms all caused fish deaths, and some also caused breathing difficulties for some beachgoers.The most drastic of theseK. mikimotoiblooms have occurred in China over the past two decades. In 2012, more than 300 sq km of abalone farms were affected, causing about A$525m inlost production.Explaining the toxic effectsMicroalgae can damage the gills of fish and shellfish, preventing them from breathing. This is the main cause of death. But some studies have also found damage to the gastrointestinal tracts and liversof fish.Tests using fish gill cells clearly show the dramatic toxic effect ofK. mikimotoi. When the fish gill cells were exposed to intactK. mikimotoicells, after 3.5 hours more than 80% of the fish cells had died.View image in fullscreenLeafy seadragons were among the dead sea creatures that washed up on South Australian beaches.Photograph: Anthony RowlandFortunately, the toxin does not persist in the environment after theK. mikimotoicells are dead. So once the bloom is over, the marine environment can recover relatively quickly.Its toxicity is partly due to the algae’s production of “reactive oxygen species”, reactive forms of oxygen molecules which can cause the deaths of cells in high doses.K. mikimotoicells may also produce lipid (fat) molecules that cause some toxic effects.Finally, a very dense bloom of microalgae can sometimes reduce the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water column, which means there is less oxygen for other marine life.The human health effects are not very well known but probably relate to the reactive oxygen species being an irritant.K. mikimotoicells can also produce “mucilage”, a type of thick, gluey substance made of complex sugars, which can accumulate bacteria inside it. This can cause “sea foam”, which was evident on beaches last week.Unanswered questions remainA question for many people is whether increasing water temperatures make blooms ofK. mikimotoimore likely.Another concern is whether nutrient runoff from farms, cities and aquaculture could cause more harmful algal blooms.Unfortunately, for Australia at least, the answer to these questions is we don’t know yet. While we know some harmful algal blooms do increase when nutrient runoff is higher, others actually prefer fewer nutrients or colder temperatures.We do know warmer water species seem to bemoving farther south along the Australian coastline, changing phytoplankton species abundance and distribution.While some microalgal blooms can causebioluminescence that is beautiful to watch, others such asK. mikimotoican cause skin and respiratory irritations.If you notice discoloured water, fish deaths or excessive sea foam along the coast or in an estuary, avoid fishing or swimming in the area and notify local primary industry or environmental authorities in your state.Shauna Murray is a science professor at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and Greta Gaiani is a Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Research Fellow at UTS.

The climate crisis and environment are expected to get passing mentions.But there is a strong case that they should be at the forefront of debate over the next six weeks, understandable cost-of-living concerns notwithstanding.There are glaring questions about major environmental decisions due in the months and years ahead that remain unanswered. Here are some of the big ones that Australians should expect answers to before they decide the next parliament.Green hydrogen has stalled in nearly every corner of Australia. So why is the government still revving it up?Read moreHow will more gas lead to lower prices?Gas appears to have replaced a far-off proposal to build taxpayer-funded nuclear plants as the main focus of the Coalition’s public messaging on energy.On Monday, the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, argueda Peter Dutton-led government would “flood gas into the grid to give Australians some hope about bringing down their energy bill and to bring down their food bill”.Small problem: nobody from theCoalitionhas coherently explained how burning more gas would lower power bills. Or why – given there is claimed bipartisan support for reaching net zero emissions and scientists say deep cuts are needed now – the country should not be taking steps to limit its use.Littleproud fell back on high school economics: that more supply means more competition means lower prices. It’s a simple truism, but doesn’t always hold when there are complicating factors – and with gas, there are several.About 80% of the gas extracted in Australia is exported or used by the export industry, and the local price is largely driven by the international prices. There was a big hike in costs after the Gladstone liquefied natural gas export (LNG) hub opened more than a decade ago, and another when Russia invaded Ukraine. The result is gas is the most expensive major energy source in most of the country. Opening a new basin or two years from now does not change this equation.TheABC has reportedthe Coalition plans to introduce a domestic gas reservation policy – requiring companies to carve out a proportion of gas for local use – for new offshore developments as a quid pro quo for reducing climate and environment regulations. This sort of policy has had an impact in Western Australia but the situation in the east today is quite different. Experts say the cheapest gas sources have already been tapped.Currently, the Coalition’s lines about the need for gas largely echo industry talking points. But how about some public-focused evidence?How will Australia’s broken environment laws be fixed?Anthony Albanese has made a remarkable U-turn on protecting nature. A year ago he was backing his environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, to revamp the 25-year-old national law and create a national Environment Protection Agency (EPA) to make key decisions andimpose beefed-up penalties.But the rewrite of the widely criticised Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act was indefinitely delayed, and Albaneseintervened to stop a deal between Plibersek and the crossbench on the EPA legislationfollowing industry pressure. Now the prime minister plans to amend the EPBC Act to protect the salmon industry in Tasmania’s Macquarie Harbour, a step that“apoplectic” conservationists say will weaken the laws.Albanese’s response is that the government backs jobs and estimates suggest the population of the endangered Maugean skate – which scientists sayhas been affected by the salmon industry– may be back at 2014 levels. Which sounds OK, but leaves out that in 2014 the skate was already an endangered species, considered at risk of extinction.The government says it wants better laws and supports introducing an EPA –though not the model it proposed this term. A specific policy is still MIA, let alone answers about what it would mean for new fossil fuel developments in environmentally sensitive areas or native forest logging.For Peter Dutton’s part, he has claimed thatnobody can argueAustralia’s existing environment protection system is inadequate.4:36Here's why Peter Dutton's nuclear power plan is a fantasy - videoIt may shock the opposition leader to learn that many people do argue that. The obvious places to start arethe Samuel review of the EPBC Act– released while Dutton was a cabinet minister – andthe 2021 state of the environment report, which was so damning the Coalition refused to release it before the 2022 federal election.Has either leader read these reports? Do they consider it inevitable that the current course is likely to lead to many loved Australian species going extinct? If not, why not?What evidence is there that gas exports are cleaner than coal?Back on gas: MPs from both major parties have argued expanded Australian gas exports are justified, in the words of Labor’s strategy, “to 2050 and beyond”. They argue this in part based on a claim that LNG is lowering global emissions by displacing coal overseas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If not, shouldn’t we know if we’re heading down this path?As Trump attacks US science agencies, ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred ushers in a fresh wave of climate denial in Australia | Adam MortonRead moreHow rapidly will Australia cut emissions at home?Remarkably, both major parties plan to go to the election without answering this question.We know the Coalition plans to scale back the legislated national 2030 climate commitment – a stepat odds with the global Paris agreement, the goal of reaching net zero emissions in just 25 years and,according to polls, the wishes of most Australians.Labor will be more ambitious, but it missed a February deadline to set a 2035 goal. It has an explanation – it is waiting on advice from the Climate Change Authority, and that advice has been delayed until after the election, in part due to the changing global landscape following the US election. Fair enough, to a point. But the government could move faster if it chose.There is a view among some climate-focused professionals that the delay may be a good thing. It reduces the risk of a damaging climate scare campaign infecting another election. And a future in which a minority Labor government has to negotiate across the parliament could lead to a more ambitious goal. Which may be true. But it is not guaranteed – or the point. It’s a pretty basic principle that people should know what they are voting for in advance.Does anything about the Coalition’s policy add up?At the time of writing, the Coalition has no policies to cut emissions before the mid 2040s, and it is talking about winding back several Labor policies to allow more pollution.Meanwhile, Dutton’s nuclear policy is one of the biggest issues hanging over the upcoming campaign. He hasn’t yetexplained how it would work in any detail. Some have argued that the proposal to build taxpayer-funded nuclear plantsisn’t genuineand should be ignored.Dutton could be prime minister by May. There is credible evidence that his proposal to slow the rollout of renewable energy, use significantly more fossil fuels and eventually build nuclear plants could lead tohigher power bills, aless reliable electricity gridandfar more emissions.If true, it suggests a pretty reckless approach to ensuring Australia’s energy security and climate, not to mention cost-of-living concerns, over the decades ahead.But in the spirit of short-term electoral politics, let’s focus on the next three years. What does the Coalition propose to move the country towards an economically and politically sustainable low-emissions future between now and the 2028 election?

Part of the Frick’s appeal is that it is a great museum that hardly feels like a museum at all. Even more than, say, the Wallace Collection in London – one of the inspirations behind the 5th Avenue landmark – the Frick has the feeling of being someone’s home, its contents selected by a singular eye.That’s because it was and they were. Both home and eye belonged to one man, the Pennsylvania-born coke and steel magnate Henry Clay Frick, who was rich beyond imagining. It is not, though, a place frozen in time. The collection has doubled in size since his death in 1919. The building, which remained the family home until 1931, was altered and enlarged to convert it into a museum that opened in 1935. Nevertheless, “It has such an intimate feel,” says Rüger. “And there’s also an element of fantasy. People think, ‘What would it be like if I lived here?’”It's goodbye to the charming old ladies’ powder room – and hello to the all-gender lavsThis place on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a Gilded Age mansion of remarkable opulence, is on the verge of reopening after a four-year, $300m renovation – its biggest tune-up and renewal for 90 years. For three of those years of closure, the collection was on view at a temporary premises, the former Whitney Museum HQ on Madison Avenue, a bracingly brutalist building by Marcel Breuer that offered a completely different backdrop for the Frick’s Vermeers and Holbeins, its Boulle and Meissen. But now it is back home: the Old Masters are again on the silk- and velvet-clad walls, the chandeliers cleaned and rehung, the fountain in the central sculpture court trickling afresh.View image in fullscreenBig changes … the Fifth Avenue facade of the museum.Photograph: Nicholas VeneziaThe result of the renovation, overseen by German-born, New York-based architect Annabelle Selldorf and her team, is a Frick Collection that is both comfortingly the same (who would want it to feel radically different?) and substantially altered, as paradoxical as that may seem. Much of what’s new is behind the scenes: a state-of-the-art conservation studio, brightly lit from three sides; new offices; necessary but invisible work to the electrics. The connected FrickArtResearch Library, set up by Frick’s daughter Helen Clay Frick, has a renovated reading room, its 1930s Windsor chairs freshly buffed up. There’s also a new education room and facilities for school groups.Much more obviously to the regular visitor, Selldorf has carved out a more spacious entrance hall, moved the coat check and toilets downstairs (goodbye charming old ladies’ powder room, hello more numerous and practical all-gender lavs), and created an intimate, curvaceous 218-seat chamber-scale recital hall for the museum’s music series and lectures in the basement. She wanted her interventions, she said, to be “a good friend to everything that is already there”. She has also created a simple but luxurious marble-lined staircase that ascends to the upper levels from the new entrance hall. Up on the first floor, one can find a 60-seat restaurant. Opening in June, it will end the Frick’s long reign as the only major New York museum where you couldn’t get a cup of coffee.View image in fullscreenPool of light … the central sculpture court.Photograph: Joseph Coscia JrThe upstairs is the biggest obvious change to the Frick. In the past, visitors would pass through the south hall of the museum on the ground floor, with its Vermeers and Bronzino, beside a tantalisingly roped-off grand staircase that ascended to unseen areas beyond an elaborately gilded organ screen on the half-landing. “There was always this very Frick thing,” says deputy director Xavier Salomon, “that only the director and senior curatorial staff were allowed to use those stairs – so naturally we used to love doing it as much as possible, especially during opening hours.” As he descended the staircase on one occasion, Salomon heard a French family whispering among themselves: “That must be a young member of the Frick family.”There’s no more velvet rope. Now those upstairs rooms – where the Fricks had their bedrooms, boudoirs, guest rooms and breakfast room – are open to the public, accessible either from the mansion’s grand old staircase or from Selldorf’s new marble steps. In the 1930s these rooms were converted into offices, which have now departed to light and modern new quarters adjacent. With the exception of Frick’s former sitting room, which remains the director’s office, they now form a sequence of small, intimate spaces for art.For example: one of the joys of the Frick is itsBoucher room, lined with a series of allegorical panels by the French 18th-century painter, bought by the magnate for the amazing price of $500,000. Originally the panels were upstairs in Frick’s wife Adelaide’s boudoir. But in 1935, when the upstairs rooms were designated offices, they were moved down to what had been a butler’s pantry. Piece by piece they have now been reinstalled in their original upper room, with its airy views over Central Park.View image in fullscreen‘Holy of holies’ … the living hall with its twin Holbeins.Photograph: Joseph Coscia JrFrick’s bedroom is now home to an early portrait ofEmma Hamilton by George Romney, back to its old place where he hung it above his fireplace – “the last picture he saw at night and the first he saw in the morning, and since he died here, probably the last he ever saw in his life,” says Salomon.After her father’s death, Helen Clay Frick collected early Italian gold-ground pictures by artists such as Cimabue and Duccio. Previous visitors to the Frick will remember these occupying a space at the very end of the large west picture gallery downstairs. Now they have their own room, appropriately Helen Clay Frick’s former bedroom. And the breakfast room has its original paintings back: French landscapes, including by Corot and Millais, among which the family began their days. No table and chairs though: this is definitely a museum, not a stately home. “We didn’t want to do Downton Abbey,” says Salomon.The result of the expansion is that more of the Frick’s collection is on view in the museum. In place of the gold-ground Italian paintings, the little room at the edge of the West Gallery is now devoted to enamels. There is a special exhibitions gallery in what visitors knew as the Boucher room. The first show is of drawings in the collection, including the only Pisanello drawing in the US –a study of a hanged man– and a delicious Goya of men fishing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Take the living hall, what Salomon calls “the holy of holies”, with its remarkable twin Holbeins – of Sir Thomas More, sporting the best painted velvet sleeve in the history of art, and Sir Thomas Cromwell. In these downstairs rooms, though, the less obvious work included matters such as reweaving velvet or silk wall coverings, often in the French ateliers where the originals were made 90 years ago – a labour of research and love.In the same room as the Holbeins is the Bellini ofSt Francis, “arguably the greatest painting in the collection”, according to Salomon. It is, he points out, unusual for Frick’s taste: he did not purchase many religious paintings. There are no grim pictures of martyrdom – flayings and beheadings are not in evidence – and violent mythological moments are rare. Frick’s taste was for the gentle, the conversational, the elegant. Beautiful women, handsome and efficient-looking men, rendered by the greatest artists. Helen Clay Frick said he liked “pictures pleasant to live with”.View image in fullscreenHe adored money … Henry and Adelaide Frick.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveLooking at these works, which Frick wanted to be seen by the public after his death, it is tempting to make a comparison between the robber barons of his generation – names now indivisible from American culture, such as Mellon and Carnegie – and the super-rich tech billionaires of today.It would be hard to argue that Frick led a life of untarnished virtue. His brutal tactics in breaking strikes in Pittsburgh make for grim reading: privately employed Pinkerton agents opened fire on striking workers at the Carnegie steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania, duringa notorious encounter in 1892. His appetite for buying the best of European fine and decorative art was sensational. He moved through galleries “like a streak of lightning”, recalled Helen Clay Frick. He vacuumed up a great deal of cultural heritage from countries that might have thought to hang on to it before it was too late: his purchase of an El Greco of St Jerome that previously hung in Valladolid Cathedral inspired Spain to enact laws on the export of art. He adored money. In the library, there is a large 10-volume work titled The Book of Wealth. For all this, he left something good to the public: a museum intimate in its atmosphere, gracious in its furnishings – and teeming with knockout artistic masterpieces.The Frick Collectionreopens on 17 AprilExplore more on these topicsMuseumsArtNew YorkArchitectureDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pickett’s award-winning new play takes a sideways look at her downfall – by imagining its impact on everyday womenTue 25 Mar 2025 12.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 13.04 EDTShareLike many British schoolchildren, Ava Pickett chanted the “Divorced, beheaded, died” rhyme about Henry VIII’s six wives – and it has stayed in her head ever since. So much so that her play 1536 pivots around the last days of the second wife, Anne Boleyn. Pickett’s history lessons covered Boleyn’s magnificent rise – which sparked a passion so great the king bent constitutional law to marry her – as well as the torrid details of her downfall and beheading. Pickett believed the “facts” (that Boleyn committed treason, that she slept with her brother) until she didn’t. “The older I got,” says the 31-year-old, “the more I thought, ‘I don’t buy that.’”Named after the year of Boleyn’s death, 1536 comes at the queen’s story sideways. She is not seen on stage but is talked about by three young women who meet in an Essex field, in between work, to quibble and gossip about men, haircuts and the king’s bride. Their predicaments gain chilling resonances as the local men become more puritanical, mirroring the patriarchal violence of Henry’s court.Men can change the air in a room – but it’s hard to name, hard to call outThis is not Pickett’s first foray into historical drama – she has also written for Hulu seriesThe Great,based on the life of Catherine the Great. She says 1536 grew from her interest in “the whispered conversations between women” about Boleyn. “‘Do you think she did it, though?’ ‘Do you really think he’s going to kill her?’” Another oblique question was what the king’s marriage has to do with them. “That’s something I really care about,” says Pickett. “The way it permeates day-to-day lives.”By “it” she means misogyny and the trickle-down effects of patriarchy, which, she makes clear, is not just the stuff of historical drama. “For me it’s absolutely about now,” she says. “Of course it is. We still lower our voices and say, ‘He did this thing – do you think that’s weird?’ We still question ourselves … There are men in positions of power who have done absolutely terrible things to women. What does it mean to watch them get elected or re-elected?”View image in fullscreenElle Fanning as Catherine in The Great, to which Pickett contributed.Photograph: Gareth Gatrell/HuluWhile writing the play, the misogyny around her became so glaring that she couldn’t unsee the way it filtered through society. “I’m interested in the subtlety [of it] and the way that men can change the air in a room,” she says. “It’s hard to name, hard to call out.”1536 wonthe Susan Smith Blackburn prize for female, transgender and non-binary playwrights in 2024. At the ceremony, Pickett called it “a love letter to friendship”. She has a circle of female friends, some of whom she has known since school. This isn’t as cosy as it sounds. These friendships, as glorious as they are, come with prickly edges: “I feel so known by them and it can feel dangerous when you’re fighting with someone who has known you since you were 14.”This is the side of “sisterhood” that is not always acknowledged, she continues, because as women “you’re meant to be on the same side”. In 1536, Pickett felt “a need to explore the ugliness of friendship. I think this idea that ‘We’re best friends and we’ll always be best friends’ in sisterhood is so untouchable. But it just isn’t true. You have to really work at your friendships. That’s beautiful, but it does also means that there are moments of real savagery.”View image in fullscreen‘I have been incredibly lucky’ … Pickett.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianPickett started out wanting to act. Born in Essex, she was one of the first in her family to go to university (at Middlesex), and followed up her theatre degree with a master’s from the Central School of Speech and Drama. “That was great but when I came out it went so badly. I was one of the only people not to get an agent, I didn’t know anyone in the industry, I was working in a cinema and had no money, so eventually I had to move back to Clacton. I wassoembarrassed. I had made such a big deal about going to uni and wanting to be an actor.”And yet, at her lowest ebb, she started to write a sitcom, Essex Girls, about an eldest daughter who goes to London to realise her dreams and comes back having failed. “I’d auditioned for a producer a couple of years earlier and still had his email so I wrote saying, ‘Could you read it?’ He read it and said, ‘You have to come back to London.’”She did, and Pickett has straddled the worlds of theatre and TV ever since. She currently has a satire in development with Derry Girls’ Lisa McGee. “I have been incredibly lucky in that I have benefited from people holding the door open,” she says. “It’s so easy to back people when they’ve had some success. If you believe in someone’s talent, you should get behind them. A producer got behind me with Essex Girls and it changed my life. My agent got behind me and it changed my life. Think about how many people would have kept going if someone had got behind them early.”1536 is at theAlmeida theatre, London, 6 May-7 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreAwards and prizesAlmeida theatreMonarchyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Should Netflix have hidden its stars away in a safe house?Mark LawsonTue 25 Mar 2025 11.29 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 11.32 EDTShareStrangers turning up at your house, a vehicle vandalised, violent commentary online, eyes tracking you as you shop –the last episode of Adolescencechillingly shows the modern consequences of sudden public attention.But the creators of the Netflix show – already seeming certain to sweep the prizes in next year’s TV awards – have, in an upsetting case of life imitating drama, experienced something of this attention (although without, we hope, the criminal elements).Along with star Stephen Graham, Jack Thorne co-wrote this extraordinary four-parter about the impact on the Miller family of 13-year-old Jamie stabbing to death a classmate, apparently under the influence of misogynist “incel” rhetoric imbibed online.Thorne reports a digital backlash, telling GQ: “I went on Channel 4 News, and I talked about what I’d seen, and where I’d been, and why we were telling this story, and the comment stream afterwards was all about how I looked. It was all about my oestrogen levels, and my testosterone levels, and who I was as a man.”‘The younger me would have sat up and nodded’: Adolescence writer Jack Thorne on the insidious appeal of incel cultureRead moreOthers involved inAdolescencehave spoken privately about their alarm at the level of comment and attention as they go about their lives in public. In Los Angeles and New York – creative cultures more experienced in the toxic possibilities of publicity – actors in hit shows or films have bodyguards and gated mansions. But the cast of Adolescence may plausibly be seen on a bus or in a shop; the younger performers have to go to school.Such excessive receptions to drama are becoming more common. This intensity of attention has happened three times in the last 15 months: with Mr Bates vs the Post Office (shown on ITV in January 2024),Baby Reindeer(on Netflix last April) and now Adolescence (released by Netflix on 13 March this year).In the case of the drama about the false prosecutions of post office operators for fraud, some cast members were relieved to be filming other shows abroad after it aired, as colleagues texted accounts of being mobbed by the public while shopping or travelling. While this attention was friendly and supportive of the drama’s whistleblowing on corporate cruelty, that distinction may not always be reassuring to those on the receiving end.View image in fullscreenMedia storm … Richard Gadd as Donny and Jessica Gunning and Martha in Baby Reindeer.Photograph: Ed Miller/APRichard Gadd’s TV adaptation of his solo stage show, Baby Reindeer, started a loud conversation because of media and social media attempts to identify the real-life models of a stalker and a rapist in the fictionalised story. This led to a man complaining to the police of false identification and a woman telling Piers Morgan on TV that the stalking storyline was based on her. Last year, a US judge threw out the woman’s claims against Netflixfor punitive damages due to negligencebut allowed a case for defamation to continue.That Adolescence seems to represent a further rise in public scrutiny is unsurprising, given its subject matter of the violently sexist, digital radicalisation of young men. Whereas we cared about post office operators and were gripped by comedian Gadd’s distressing personal life, every parent, teacher and student is more intensely invested in the story of a pubescent child-killer.When the Baby Reindeer controversy happened, the dramatist Russell T Davies suggested inan interview with the Timesthat such a crisis would not have occurred at the BBC, which would have been “much stricter” with editorial checks. While there is no proof that Netflix’s processes failed in regard to Gadd’s drama, Davies’s comment reflected a feeling in British TV that streamer shows can take advantage of being outside the regulatory system led by Ofcom.However, perhaps the greater problem for the corporation is that the three recent drama hits – Adolescence, Baby Reindeer and Mr Bates – were all produced by other broadcasters. That may be one reason why its chief content officer, Charlotte Moore, recently announced that she isleaving the BBC to become an independent drama producer.‘Unnervingly on-the-nose’: why Adolescence is such powerful TV that it could save livesRead moreIn the case of Adolescence, Netflix and the production company (Brad Pitt’s Plan B) had two separate duties of care. The first was during shooting, and applied especially to the 15-year-old Owen Cooper, who plays Jamie, to protect him while repeatedly rehearsing and performing traumatic material. By all available accounts, such support was impeccably dispensed on set.The second obligation of producers, though, is post-transmission. And here there might be questions. Everyone in the media wants a piece of a hit, but I have been surprised by the level of publicity commitments carried out by Cooper – given his age and this being his first role – and Thorne, whose charmingly unguarded personality can make him vulnerable to gotcha interviewing. That, though, is not only a matter for Netflix and Plan B; the media should also think about who they interview and how, and the framing of the coverage.View image in fullscreenShould he have had so many publicity commitments? … the 15-year-old actor Owen Cooper in Adolescence.Photograph: NetflixThe biggest lesson, though, is that we tend to think of the arts as soft and safe, a haven from the heavy issues of news and tribalisms of sport. But because fiction often interrogates events and beliefs, culture is on the frontline of ideological tensions. Fiction is dangerous.SoSalman Rushdie is half-blindedand otherwise mutilated for his defence of free writing and speech. Audiences at last year’s open-air staging of Fiddler on the Roof in Regent’s Park walked though heightened security apparently deemed necessary for a Jewish show with Jewish actors. A theatre producer recently told me about having quietly dropped a planned production of a play about neo-Nazis because of security advice – that the theatre would not be safe for audiences and performers. And actors in a TV show must plead to be left alone.From now on, producers will have to think hard about how to protect creative teams from the device and real-life attention that Adolescence, among other things, so brilliantly dramatised.Especially with Netflix shows – which have a coordinated global drop that can make the vulnerability of those involved universal – recognisable creatives in standout series should probably go to a metaphorical or actual safe house when transmission begins. (Again, this is complicated with streamers by the period of weeks or months in which a show may be first seen.) If the subject matter is controversial, the producers should probably strongly recommend that those involved neither post on nor read social media, especially if young or vulnerable.Great drama reflects society, but Adolescence has found a terrifying reflection staring back at it.Explore more on these topicsAdolescenceTelevisionBaby ReindeerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Severance’s playfulness with non-chronology, labyrinthine hallways and duplicate selves are also found in scrappy, low-budget gems, including Christopher Smith’s underrated 2009 film Triangle.On its face, Triangle is set up like a formulaic horror flick. A bunch of loosely connected, attractive thirtysomethings gather on a sailboat for a sunny day out at sea. We follow Jess (Melissa George), a harried single mother who we first see soothing her young autistic son, before she mysteriously turns up alone.Things get weird fast. A mysterious storm descends; a frantic distress signal crackles on the radio; when the sailboat capsizes, the group are forced to board a hulking ocean liner which seemingly appears out of thin air, deserted save for a silhouette spied against the railing. By the time the friends are being hunted by a masked killer along the liner’s hallways, Jess is experiencing dizzying bouts of deja vu – not the typical disposition of a final girl.Needless to say, the less you know about Triangle, the better. Its genre-busting unfolds with a surprising elegance as, before you know it, its straightforward survival plot warps into a Mobius strip. The initially limited cast becomes haunted by doubles upon doubles, and every scant detail from the first moments of the film becomes imbued with retroactive meaning.Part time-loop movie, part slasher, part fable, the dizzying narrative scope is even more impressive when contrasted with its charmingly schlocky confines. An Australian-UK co-production, Queensland is very obviously subbing in for Florida and the cast is populated by Aussie and Kiwi actors attempting questionable American accents (including a pre-fame Liam Hemsworth).The initial dodgy special effects and hammy line deliveries quickly give way to expressive, atmospheric direction as we sink into the mind of our tortured lead. George delivers a captivating performance as a woman who proves herself to be more than a stock character.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like Severance, Triangle is an identity thriller at its heart.Though Jess initially appears to pick up clues that explain the contours of the surreal trap she has found herself in – and, on a meta-level, therearemany Reddit threads and flow charts explaining the story’s logic – the conclusion renders this near-void, offering something much more mythic and thematically rich.The creepy ghost ship location (the Kubrickian influences are given a shout-out through a significant room labelled “237”) is named after the Greek god Aeolus, the ruler of winds and father of the eternal rock-pusher Sisyphus. If this seems to be a fairly obvious metaphor for being stuck in a loop, Smith takes it to the next level, with heady questions about how desperate a person can be to change their circumstances while refusing to change critical aspects of their character.Triangle is a thrilling watch because of its inherently multilayered, unclassifiable nature: it’s both small-scale and epic, a puzzle and a myth, brainy and silly. Unpacking the events of the film, I’ve often been overwhelmed with frustration, wondering if I was thinking about it too hard, if I was simply trying to explain away plot holes.The conclusion I’ve reached is that it reallyisthat good. It’s everything a mystery should be: complex and bold, with jaw-dropping moments and discomforting characters. It’s a film that sticks in the mind – if it doesn’t make your brains ooze out your ears.Triangle is available to stream on Stan (Australia), Pluto TV (UK) and Peacock and Prime Video (US).

With a running time of around nine hours, it was also one of the longest. And I’ve seen it three times. That’s a lot of hours to give but none of them were wasted.The first two occasions were in 1998 when the Maly played the Barbican in London. There were two options: watch it in three sections across three evenings, or do it all in one go – three hours per act, with an hour’s break between each. Being young, filled with Dostoevskian fervour, and still in possession of a stoic bladder, I did both.The 90s were an incredible time for anyone interested in international theatre. With the fall of the iron curtain, long hidden theatre makers were suddenly able to share their work with new audiences in the west and those audiences were, in turn, captivated by the startling innovation of what they saw. At the forefront was the Maly Drama Theatre’sLev Dodin.He and his student company’s combination of wildly imaginative, intellectually rigorous productions had most recently dazzled UK audiences with their devised works Gaudeamus and Claustrophobia, but The Devils was in another league. Developed with the Maly’s older company, it was a Russian epic on a par with the accomplishments of Dostoevsky himself.View image in fullscreenTheatre of high-wire intensity … The Devils directed by Lev Dodin.Photograph: Yuri BelinskiyForged in long years of scene studies, improvisation, writing, rehearsing, performing then re-rehearsing, it was theatre on a scale I’d never experienced in British or Irish theatre. Text was important but Russia itself was there. Its people. Its history. The weight of its politics and its legacy of nihilism, revolution, death and redemption. The entire production revolved around the charismatic Pyotr Semak as the dead-in-the-soul aristocrat, Stavrogin, who filled the theatre with darkness. It was a terrifying performance, unbearable and unforgettable. But he was surrounded by stunning performances. From Irina Tychinina as the unwilling witness, Dasha, and Sergey Bekhterev as the manipulative revolutionary, Verkhovensky – who spent one astonishing scene eating an entire roast chicken to illustrate his character’s relentlessness – to Sergey Kuryshev’s heart-rending Kirillov, the engineer cajoled into using his suicide for the good of the cause and Igor Ivanov’s hilarious turn as the useless drunk Lebyatkin. Performed in Russian with English surtitles, amid a spare but haunting set, it was theatre of high-wire intensity, from which neither performers nor audience would go home unscathed. And it was demanding, exhausting even. Some couldn’t take it and left but most stayed.The Devils made everything that came after it seem pallid in comparison.Novelist Eimear McBride: studying method acting taught me how to writeRead moreThe last time I saw it was two years later in the Maly’s own theatre in St Petersburg. It was a much smaller stage, in far less grand surroundings but in their home town – and Dostoevsky’s – and the resonance was so great it felt like the company could make the very walls shake. Profound, merciless and all-consuming, it was a lesson in the power of uncompromising vision that I still think of now, with awe. At the time it sent me back to the novel which, in turn, led to the character-altering, confessional section of my novelThe Lesser Bohemians. So those long hours spent in the theatre were pretty transformative in the end.The City Changes Its Faceby Eimear McBride is published by Faber (£20).

Why is it such an effective shock tactic?Michael HoganTue 25 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 10.45 EDTShareWarning: the below article contains spoilers for episode six, season three ofThe White Lotus.Talk about a hangover from hell. In the latest episode of The White Lotus, Saxon Ratliff woke up dazed and dishevelled from the previous night’s Full Moon party. It had been a long, messy day-and-night of booze, edibles, “lasers and shitty music”. Oh, and being pleasured by his own brother.The blender-obsessed nepo baby, played by Patrick Schwarzenegger, regained consciousness on a superyacht, next to his naked younger brother Lochlan (Sam Nivola). Despite both Ratliffs insisting they’d blacked out, flashbacks kept floating to the surface.First the siblings snogged for a drunken dare during a Spin the Bottle-style game. Ex-model Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) breezily admitted she’d “hooked up with both brothers”. Toxic jock Saxon had a hazy memory of Chloe and Lochlan having intercourse while he masturbated next to them. Hang on. Was that definitely his hand beneath the bedsheet?Eventually, a queasy image came into focus. The women matter-of-factly reminded Saxon that Lochlan “jerked you off”. Saxon was disbelieving at first, before blaming the drugs. “I don’t think there’s a drug in the world that’d make me get with my brother,” deadpanned Chelsea. At which point Saxon stumbled off to throw up again. The power balance between the brothers seems to have tipped. Is little Lockie now the alpha bro?‘Stolen off a donkey’: why is The White Lotus so obsessed with graphic penis footage?Read moreHBO’s super-rich spa satire had been dangling this taboo-busting prospect for the previous five episodes. There was a distinct whiff of dysfunction between the Ratliff siblings since they touched down in Thailand. When first escorted to their villa, the family of five were informed there were only three bedrooms. “You can sleep with me,” sister Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) told Lochlan. “I don’t mind.” Saxon promptly made it even weirder: “Brothers and sisters don’t sleep together after they have full-grown, you know, genitals.”The priapic protein shake enthusiast has a habit of making suspiciously over-sexualised remarks. “Dude, long plane rides make me so fucking horny,” he said poolside, ostentatiously adjusting his trunks. Piper, a gap year Buddhist, was understandably upset by her brothers grilling her about whether she’s still a virgin. In their adjacent beds that night, Saxon called his sister “pretty hot”, insisting that Lochlan must have noticed too.He proceeded to browse porn on his iPad, before heading butt-naked to the bathroom. Lochlan ogled him before Saxon caught his eye and closed the door. Social media blew up with speculation about an incoming incest plotline. And now writer Mike White has finally gone there. Schwarzenegger has acknowledged the “very odd and weird” dynamic between the brothers, adding that certain scenes were “uncomfortable to watch with my family”.White has deployed sexual shock tactics in all three seasons so far, with eye-popping male nudity and graphic gay romps. In the Sicily-set second series, Leo Woodall’s Jack was caught mid-coitus with his “uncle” Quentin (Tom Hollander). This familial cliffhanger was resolved with the revelation that they weren’t actually related. This time, though, The White Lotus did it for real.View image in fullscreenClive Owen and Saskia Reeves in Close My Eyes.Photograph: Beambright/Four Four Int/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockSibling incest has long been a TV taboo. Nearly 50 years ago, the BBC’s Roman epic I, Claudius – sort of Succession in togas – showed John Hurt’s Emperor Caligula fathering a child with his sister Drusilla. Playwright Stephen Poliakoff’s 1991 film Close My Eyes portrayed the obsessive love between Clive Owen’s town planner and his elder sister, played by Saskia Reeves. A few years later, scouse soap Brookside caused a stir by depicting a sexual relationship between siblings Nat and Georgia Simpson. “We’re adults and we love one another,” Nat told their parents after they were found in bed together. There was tabloid uproar. MPs waded in. Producer Phil Redmond admitted it had gone too far and the Simpson family were written out.But HBO dramas have continued the troubling trend. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros are a veritable hotbed of icky inbreeding. Game of Thrones began with 10-year-old Bran Stark sneaking a peek at Queen Cersei having sex with her twin brother, Jaime Lannister. “We shared a womb, we came into this world together, we belong together,” said the defiant Cersei when confronted. In prequel House of the Dragon, most of the Targaryens end up inter-marrying to keep their bloodline pure and their peroxide mullets intact.During the first and best series of True Detective, viewers glimpsed multiple murderer Errol Childress, AKA The Yellow King, in flagrante with his half-sister. Last year’s Prime Video reboot of Cruel Intentions ramped up the incestuous vibe between step-siblings Lucien and Caroline. And the 2021 Gossip Girl remake saw twins Grace and Jake hook up in a New York hotel room. “Even I didn’t see ‘twincest’ coming,” quipped their trans frenemy Luna.Screenwriter Andrew Davies insisted that the incestuous affair between siblings Hélène and Anatole Kuragina (Tuppence Middleton and Callum Turner) was “crucial” to his 2016 BBC adaptation of Tolstoy’s War & Peace. And in Tom Hardy’s aptly titled 2017 BBC show Taboo, the mud-spattered protagonist’s feelings for his half-sister Zilpha (Oona Chaplin) progressed from love letters to groping in church pews and ultimately the bedchamber. Chaplin told Vanity Fair: “There’s a sexual libertarianism right now. Girls are walking around with their asses hanging out. Guys are just as much. Sex has become a very public-display type of thing, so very few things have remained taboo. Where does the taboo lie now? I think it’s in incest.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Parker Posey’s viral White Lotus accent is a gift to us allRead moreLast year, there was a backlash against an incestuous scene between the Menendez brothers in Netflix’s true-crime dramatisation Monsters: The Lyle & Erik Menendez Story. Critics claimed the “sick” showrunner Ryan Murphy had “made up” the storyline. Murphy pushed back, arguing that it was important to “present points of view from many people involved in the case”. He pointed out that journalist Dominick Dunne, played by Nathan Lane, “wrote several articles about that theory”.With their roots in classical literature and the Bible, incest stories are certainly nothing new. In the prestige TV era, however, they’re definitely becoming more frequent. For audiences hardened online, it’s a way of upping the ante in terms of sexual transgression, a shortcut to shocking a seemingly unshockable generation. Drugs and violence are so last century.When it comes to TV incest, it’s usually villainous characters who are the culprits. Saxon certainly falls into that category in The White Lotus. By invoking the ultimate taboo, White isn’t just breaking boundaries and baiting controversy, then. He is pointing out the deep-rooted corruption of the moneyed elite.The show’s executive producer, David Bernad, told the New York Post last week that the scenes weren’t just for shock value and will pay off in the climactic two episodes: “There’s a specific reason in terms of the narrative storytelling and the larger thematic idea. As the season wraps up, you’ll see their purpose. The brother story culminates in a very satisfying way.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

But her reputation has been tarnished by accusations of racismCatherine TaylorTue 25 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 25 Mar 2025 11.59 EDTShareAmonth before she died aged 39, on 3 August 1964, of complications from the autoimmune disease lupus, the American writer Flannery O’Connor wrote from her home in Milledgeville, Georgia to a regular correspondent, the academic and nun Sister Mariella Gable: “The wolf, I’m afraid, is inside tearing up the place.”The “wolf” that O’Connor refers to is her illness, the name of which derives from the Latin. The disease can be mild, but in its worst form it is systemic, causing not only inflammation, chronic fatigue, muscle weakness and skin rashes, but also permanent tissue damage. In her last years, O’Connor could only move around by means of crutches, tending to her beloved pet peacocks. “I can write for one hour a day, and my, my, do I like my one hour. I eat it up like it was filet mignon.”Before diagnosis at the age of 25, O’Connor had been a talented graduate student with an MFA from the prestigious University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop and had completed a coveted Yaddo artists’ colony residency in upstate New York. A draft of her first novel, published as Wise Blood in 1952, and filmed by John Huston in 1979, won a prize; she had become involved in the New York City literary scene, acquired an agent, and was close friends with the poet Robert Lowell and others of his circle. She also lived for a while in Connecticut with the classicist Robert Fitzgerald and his wife, Sally, who would go on to edit of The Habit of Being (1979), a vast volume of O’Connor’s correspondence. Venerable publisher Robert Giroux had her in his sights early on: he remained her editor throughout her life.View image in fullscreen‘The wolf is inside’ … O’Connor in 1952, with her novel Wise Blood.Photograph: Apic/Getty ImagesHer illness meant that in 1951 O’Connor moved back to what she termed the “Christ-haunted” south, to live with and be cared for by her widowed mother, Regina Cline O’Connor. They eventually settled at Andalusia, the O’Connor family summer home, a working farm just outside Milledgeville, Georgia, presided over by a large white classic Southern house straight out of a Tennessee Wiliams play, complete with veranda for rocking chairs. It that is now a museum preserving O’Connor’s work and legacy. The land was formerly a cotton plantation; O’Connor satirised her upbringing in the Jim Crow-era segregated south in sardonic stories of hypocritical, racist and godless southerners, while at times revealing unpalatable personal views in her letters – “the habit of bigotry”, as critic Paul Elie wrote, in a2020 New Yorker essaytitled “How Racist Was Flannery O’Connor?”.Mary Flannery O’Connor was born on 25 March 1925 in Savannah, the oldest city in Georgia, the only child of real estate agent Edward Francis O’Connor and Regina Cline, who was from an old southern family. Of Irish descent, the O’Connors’ Catholicism made them a minority in the heavily Protestant south. Her first taste of fame was atfive years old, on a Pathé newsreel, featuring a chicken that “Mary O’Connor” had taught to walk backwards. “I was just there to assist the chicken, but it was the high point in my life. Everything since has been anticlimax,” she joked. The determined chicken, walking backwards to go forward, is a tempting metaphor for O’Connor’s own endurance. It instilled in her a “love affair” with birds that seemed to transcend most human interactions. Ever self-deprecating, she described herself as a “pigeon-toed child with a receding chin and a you-leave-me-alone-or-I’ll-bite-you complex”, an attitude apparent in her acerbic, droll letters, her wry fiction and the cartoons she drew for her student newspaper at Georgia State College for Women (now Georgia College & State University), where she obtained a BA in sociology and literature in 1945. By this time O’Connor’s father had died, in early 1941, of the lupus that his daughter would inherit. Mother and daughter were left to their ambiguous, interdependent relationship. Notably, none of O’Connor’s letters to Regina has ever been published.O’Connor’s novelistic ambitions would not entirely fold with the progression of her illness, but ironically it was her limited energy that made her into one of the most original short story writers of the 20th century, her acute and disturbing moral vision of humanity driven by a devout, if unconventionally expressed, Catholic faith. “When you can assume that your audience holds the same beliefs you do, you can relax a little … when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock – to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the almost-blind you draw large and startling figures,” she wrote.O’Connor’s frequently brutal fiction, with its distorted, unnatural characters, is usually categorised as “southern gothic”, a term initially coined dismissively by the novelist Ellen Glasgow in 1935 to describe the “backwoods” and “eccentric” fiction of writers such as William Faulkner. Faulkner was undoubtedly a great influence on O’Connor (and he admired Wise Blood), as was master of the grotesque Edgar Allan Poe, the Catholic French novelist François Mauriac, and her near-contemporary Katherine Anne Porter. O’Connor’s own influence can be traced in later writers such as Shirley Jackson, CE Morgan and Joyce Carol Oates.View image in fullscreenMaya Hawke as the author in 2023 biopic Wildcat.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyHer characters hover somewhere between victim and villain: their fates are ordained; they do not appear to have free will. In what is probably her best known and most anthologised story, A Good Man Is Hard to Find (1953), a prattling, controlling grandmother meets her appalling match in the Misfit, the homicidal leader of an escaped convict gang. The elderly woman and her son’s young family – each objectionable in their own way – are shot dead in turn by the gang when they crash their car on a road trip through Georgia – all because the grandmother insisted on having one last look at a house she remembers from her past. “The horrible thought she had had before the accident was that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in Georgia but in Tennessee … Behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth.”“It should elicit from you a degree of pity and terror, even though its way of being serious is a comic one,” O’Connor said of that story, urging readers to ignore the “dead bodies” and focus on the transformative “action of grace” when the grandmother reaches out, fatally as it turns out, to the Misfit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Her reputation has been clouded since that 2020 New Yorker essay, although it has been argued that Elie’s disclosures were not new; the letters have been in the public domain since the late 70s.Hilton Als wroteof her Black characters in 2001: “She didn’t use them as vessels of sympathy or scorn; she simply – and complexly – drew from life.” Yet a major biography by Brad Gooch (Flannery O’Connor: A Life, 2009) admits her to be, in private, as Joy Williams put it in aNew York Times review, “a connoisseur of racial jokes”.O’Connor could be perversely contradictory, arguing both for and against integration, while lampooning racist white characters in stories like Revelation and Everything That Rises Must Converge. It was this deeply problematic aspect that caused director Ethan Hawke to hesitate over filming recent biopic Wildcat, which stars his actor daughter Maya as Flannery, alongside Laura Linney as Regina. Hawke and Linney also play most of the roles in the dramatisation of a selection of the stories. The performances are compelling, and Hawke ably transforms into O’Connor – bushy hair and eyebrows, steely spectacles, tell-tale lupus “butterfly” rash blazing across her cheeks. Disappointingly Wildcat sidesteps the question of the author’s racism, while delving into the mystery and conflict of her religious belief. In a 1959 letter she wrote: “What people don’t realise is how much religion costs. They think faith is a big electric blanket, when of course it is the cross.” O’Connor defiantly carried that cross to the end.This article was amended on 25 March 2025. An earlier version said that Flannery O’Connor graduated in 1945 from “Georgia Women’s College (now Georgia State University)”; in fact, the institution’s name in 1945 was Georgia State College for Women, and it is now known as Georgia College & State University.Explore more on these topicsBooksFlannery O'ConnorShort storiesFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He laughs incredulously. “You know that statistic about men thinking about sex once every seven seconds? That’s how often I think about death.”In an interview promoting his fourth solo studio album, Te Whare Tīwekaweka, this existential conversation is unexpected. But increasingly, the Aotearoa/New Zealand artist is noticing the way his career pulls him further and further from his roots, and his wellbeing.Often, his thoughts are concerned with admin – withdeath cleaningand the worry of not having his affairs in order. But there’s also the niggle of a life not fully lived – something he puts down partly to the touring lifestyle.“There’s a feeling of impermanence. You make a lot of noise in a lot of places, but you’re not boring that one hole,” he says.View image in fullscreenMarlon Williams says committing to an album entirely in his ancestral tongue filled him with ‘whakamā (self-doubt)’.Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianLast timeWilliams spoke to Guardian Australia, in 2022, he was releasing My Boy: a “Māori disco bop” album featuring Māori instrumentation and strumming techniques, and a smattering of te reo (Māori language). Now he’s gone deeper, creating an album entirely in his ancestral language. Te Whare Tīwekaweka reverberates with a longing for connection before the opportunity is lost – something he seems to feel in his life, and in his relationship with te reo. There’s a Māori saying: it takes one generation to forget language and three to get it back.Williams is of Ngāi Tahu and Ngāi Tai descent, with his mother’s tribe from the South Island and his father’s from the North Island. He went to a total immersion preschool where children speak only te reo, but the language was lost when he entered primary school.“There’s shame in not knowing the language already, and pain in my own family of not knowing it,” he says. Over the past few years he started taking the odd class, but also teaching himself.Committing to an album entirely in his ancestral tongue filled him with “whakamā (self-doubt)”, he admits: “I’ve been psyching up for a long time, just finding the gall.” The album’s title translates as “The Messy House” – his acknowledgment that the grammar and phrasing may not be perfect.Te Whare Tīwekaweka is released at a tumultuous time for te reo and race relations in Aotearoa. Since being sworn in, in November 2023, the rightwing coalition government has moved towind back the use of te reo Māoriwithin its departments. In November 2024 it introduced legislation to reinterpret theTreaty of Waitangi, which upholds Māori rights.“There might be a referendum, which, as we know from Australia, can lead topretty terrible things,” Williams says.I meet Williams in Melbourne, where he used to live, the morning after a long day of commitments. Hunched over a 10am bowl of pho, he admits to usually rising at 3pm, being a night owl. Kicking his brain into gear is made harder by the care with which he feels he must broach the subject of language – particularly at this moment in Aotearoa/New Zealand politics.“I considered not venturing into it at all, because it’s so politically loaded,” he says, adding that the timing of the album itself is coincidental: “It has been in the works for a long time and is a very personal project.”Williams seems caught between a rock and a hard place. He’s second-guessing his credentials as an unwitting poster boy for te reo, but also the public appetite for an album in language. When he tells people about the album, he notices his tone shift depending on who he’s talking to. Sometimes he sounds apologetic – “but it’s all in Māori”.View image in fullscreenThe documentary Marlon Williams: Ngā Ao E Rua – Two Worlds opens in New Zealand in May before reaching Australian cinemas.Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThis angst is striking given the amount of praise and acclaim he’s enjoyed in his career so far. He’s won numerous Apra and Aotearoa music awards, and previous albums have reached No 1 in Aotearoa/New Zealand and the top 10 in Australia. In May, he will play Sydney Opera House as part of Vivid Live, followed by shows in New York, Los Angeles and London, before returning to Australia for Melbourne’s Rising festival. A documentary covering the making of his latest album,Marlon Williams: Ngā Ao E Rua – Two Worlds, opens in New Zealand in May before hitting Australian cinemas.In recent years, Williams has been working on setting up a more balanced life, but it’s still a work in progress. Step one: moving home. He had relocated to Melbourne in 2013 for a more immersive musical life, living for a while at the Yarra Hotel in Abbotsford, during which time he and his friends formed the Yarra Benders – the band that still tours and records with him.During the pandemic he moved back to Lyttelton, a small port town on the South Island of Aotearoa/New Zealand, in an attempt to replant his roots. “It’s stunning. I’ve been going out kayaking and gathering mussels, cooking them up,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When they started running into each other at parties, they hit it off.View image in fullscreenMarlon Williams performs at the Sound Doctor in Anglesea, Victoria.Photograph: Patrick CallowAmong the album’s other collaborations is aduet with Lorde, on the track Kāhore He Manu E. The singer had been doing her own studies of te reo.“Her pronunciation is beautiful,” Williams says. “She’s such a sound-oriented person that she can hear a vowel sound that’s imperceptible to most people.”Another track, Korero Māori, features a kapa haka choir (which will also feature in his bigger live shows) and takes a woman’s perspective.“It translates as ‘Speak Māori’, but it also means ‘plain’, so it’s like, ‘don’t bullshit me’,” Williams says. “It’s talking to a man who’s world-weary. There are lines like, ‘I’ve seen a map of the world, don’t try and use big words on me. I’ve seen a map of the world, and I see you here before me. You left a Māori and you came back a Māori.’”There it is again: that theme of being away too long. It’s also visible in the video forAua Atu Rā, in which Williams lies on a Māori therapist’s couch. He’s dressed in a suit and tie – the same outfit a figure wears on the album cover art. It’s an old drawing his mother did, depicting a lean, tall man trudging wearily through the night towards a house.“I knew that drawing as a child, but I’d forgotten,” he says. “I saw it again a few years ago. I said to Mum, ‘Oh, that’s me.’ She said, ‘No, I painted that when I was pregnant with you.’”And now Williams must pull on his proverbial suit once more and leave, initially for a tour of the US. He will be shadowed by his fear of missing out on “the things that you’re supposed to experience” back home in his community.Most would expect a young musician to be revelling in this moment. “I know,” he says. “It’s like I’m having an inverted midlife crisis.”Te Whare Tīwekaweka is out on 4 April.

If you use it without permission you’re breaking the law. It’s so simple.”In January, it emerged that Mark Zuckerbergapproved his company’s useof The Library Genesis dataset, a “shadow library” that originated in Russia and contains more than 7.5m books. In 2024 a New York federal court ordered LibGen’s anonymous operators topay a group of publishers $30m(£24m) in damages for copyright infringement. Last week, the Atlantic republished asearchable databaseof the titles contained in LibGen. In response, authors and writers’ organisations have rallied against Meta’s use of copyrighted works.“It’ll be incredibly difficult for us, and for other affected industries, to take on Meta, but we’ll have a good go!” said Osman.Fellow authors expressed support for his statement. “THANK YOU! You are right,”wrote the novelistAlice Jolly. “We need to fight – now. Our work has been stolen. There are laws to protect us against this and they need to be enforced. Six of my books have been stolen. That’s my life’s work.”Many writers posted screenshots of their books appearing in the LibGen database. “91 results,”wrote novelistEmma Donoghue. “That’s every book I’ve published since 1993, in multiple languages, scraped without permission to train AI. They’re robbing us in hopes of replacing us.”“As a matter of urgency, Meta needs to compensate the rights holders of all the works it has been exploiting,” the Society of Authorssaid in a statement. “This is yet more evidence of the catastrophic impact generative AI is having on our creative industries worldwide.”‘OpenAI’s metafictional short story about grief is beautiful and moving’ | Jeanette WintersonRead more“From development through to output, creators’ rights are being ignored, and governments need to intervene to protects authors’ rights,” the trade union added. “In the UK, and globally, we need to see strong legislation from governments to uphold and strengthen copyright law, ensure transparency and fair payment, and to penalise big tech companies who ride roughshod over the law.”In January, acourt filingby a group of authors suing Meta for copyright infringement – which includes Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jacqueline Woodson, Andrew Sean Greer, Junot Diaz and the comedian Sarah Silverman – says that company executives, including Zuckerberg, were aware that LibGen is a pirated database.Quoting from Meta internal communications, the filing claims that company engineers discussed accessing LibGen data but hesitated to start because “torrenting from a [Meta-owned] corporate laptop doesn’t feel right [grinning face emoji]”.A Meta spokesperson told the Guardian that the company “has developed transformational GenAI open source LLMs that are powering incredible innovation, productivity, and creativity for individuals and companies.

All AI-translated manuscripts “will be copy-edited and then reviewed by Taylor & Francis editors and the books’ authors before publication”, said the publisher.“How will authors check translations into other languages?” wrote the author and illustrator Oisín McGann in response to the newson BlueSky. “Do they get paid for the work?

He has denied any wrongdoing.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesGérard DepardieuGérard Depardieu tells court he grabbed sexual assault accuser by hips to avoid slippingActor denies assault and says he was following advice of his then lawyer when he previously told police there had been no physical contactAngelique Chrisafisin ParisTue 25 Mar 2025 13.22 EDTFirst published on Tue 25 Mar 2025 08.07 EDTShareThe French actorGérard Depardieuhas admitted in court that he grabbed the hips of a woman who has accused him of sexual assault, but said it was to avoid slipping and was not a sexual attack.“I grabbed her hips,” the actor, 76, told his trial for sexual assault at the Paris criminal court on Tuesday. The head judge noted that this was a change from his testimony during police interrogation when he had denied that any physical contact had taken place with the 54-year-old set decorator.Depardieu is on trial for the alleged sexual assault of the set dresser as well as alleged sexual assaults of a 34-year-old assistant director during the shooting of the feature film Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in 2021.He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted. He denies any wrongdoing, telling the court on Tuesday: “I deny all of it.”Depardieu – the biggest French cinema star to face trial for sexual assault since the#MeToo movement– said: “I grabbed her hips so as not to slip because I was so upset by her, by the heat. It was a Friday – it was the end of a film shoot with a man who was very tired.”In cross-examination by the state prosecutor, Depardieu later said: “I placed my hands on the woman’s hips to speak to her.”Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, lawyer for the complainant, asked the actor if he had lied during the police investigation when he told officers he had never touched the woman. Depardieu said: “I didn’t lie. I was following the advice of my [then] lawyer. Now I’m telling the truth.”The court heard that the set decorator, Amélie, had been working on styling film sets in a building in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on 10 September 2021.She told the court that Depardieu, who had been seated on a stool in the corridor between takes, began talking to her about the set and complained of the heat in the building. She said he told her: “It’s so hot, I can’t get an erection.” He also allegedly said: “I know how to make a woman come without touching her.”After he went to another room to film a scene, he returned to sit in the same corridor, she told the court. He asked Amélie why she was on the phone to her “bloke”, she said. She told him she was in fact busy on the phone trying to track down parasols for the film. He allegedly said: “Come and touch my big parasol. I’ll stick it in your pussy.”Amélie alleged that he then grabbed her hips, pulled her towards him and trapped her between his thighs with great force, and grabbed her body, including her pubis, waist and chest. “He grabbed me by the hips, pulled me forwards [towards him], trapped me with his legs,” she said.“That’s where I understood the strength he had, he held me very, very hard. I remember his eyes, I saw this big face, red eyes, very angry, very agitated. And he was saying: ‘Come touch my big parasol’, with a crazy look. I’ve never seen anything like that. That phrase is so idiotic; how would I have invented that – it makes no sense to talk of genitals like a parasol.”She said: “That fear that I felt – what stands out for me is not his sexual desire, but his savagery. It was the fact that he knew I was afraid – I saw his eyes light up with a kind of pleasure in making someone afraid. I remember that savagery. He really terrified me, and that amused him.”Depardieu denied assault. He said he had been unhappy with Amélie’s work as a set decorator, because a bedroom scene wasn’t ready and was done poorly. He had made comments that Amélie couldn’t even run a bric-a-brac shop let alone decorate a set, he said.Depardieu said he weighed 150kg at the time and was so overweight he couldn’t possibly have gripped anyone between his thighs. He told the panel of three judges: “I would never put anyone between my legs. You can do a test if you like – with the paunch I have, I can’t do it.”He said he did tend to make vulgar comments on set, telling the court he could often shout things like “Pussy! Pussy!”When the head judge questioned that he would actually speak like that on a film set, he said he could: “If it’s hot, if I’m in a bad mood, things always go on too long.”Depardieu said: “I don’t see why I would go around groping a woman, her buttocks, her breasts. I’m not somebody who rubs himself against others on the Métro.I’ve been told that exists, I don’t know about those types of things, there are so many vices I don’t know.” He said there was no way he would put his hands on a woman’s backside.He said, however, that he did use crude language on set but just to be “provocative” and to “relax” people. Asked by the head judge if he had said: “It’s so hot I can’t get an erection”, Depardieu replied: “Maybe I said that, yes, why not?”Depardieu said the media had used the allegations against him to damage his reputation. He attacked the #MeToo movement as well as the women who had held protest placards outside a concert tour he was giving at the time of the allegations. “This movement is going to become a terror,” he said.Amélie told the court that no conversation had taken place with Depardieu where he had criticised her work.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuFrance#MeToo movementEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Among them were a group of Israeli soldiers who escorted the settlers inside the village.Minutes later, the settlers walked straight over to the house of Hamdan Ballal, one of the four directors of the Oscar-winning documentaryNo Other Landthat documented the destruction of villages in theWest Bank– a film condemned in Israel and described by the country’s culture minister as “a sad moment for the world of cinema”.The settlers started throwing stones against his house, witnesses said, and chased Ballal to his house, beating him and eventually handing him over to the military. Handcuffed and blindfolded by the soldiers, Ballal, bleeding from his head, was moved to a military vehicle.On Tuesday afternoon, Ballal and two other Palestinianswere released from a police stationin Kiryat Arba, in the occupied West Bank, where they had spent the night on the floor while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack.0:56Moment Israeli settlers attack activists in West Bank – videoThe Guardian has reviewed videos and photographs captured by activists from the Center for Jewish Nonviolence (CJNV) who were on the scene, spoken to witnesses – includingBasel Adra, another of No Other Land’s directors – and contacted the Israel Defense Forces in order to shed light on an incident that sparked anger across the world.Five Jewish American activists from CJNV who tried to help Ballal as he was being beaten by the settlers said that, before the masked attackers entered the village, another group of settlers, mostly teenagers, had interrupted the celebrations for the break of the daily fast for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, by shouting, pushing and swinging punches at Palestinians.“They were eventually followed by the masked settlers who started throwing stones,” a statement from CJNV said.MapVideo provided by CJNV showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night. The activists rush back to their car as rocks can be heard thudding against the vehicle.“They destroyed our car with stones and slashed one of the tires; all of the windows and windshields were broken,” one of the activists at the scene, Josh Kimelman, told the Guardian.Meanwhile, another group of settlers went to Ballal’s home, throwing stones at his car and house.Ballal’s wife heard her husband being beaten outside and screaming: “I’m dying.”Witnesses said an Israeli police car arrived on the scene, but officers “refused to get out of the vehicle and intervene”. Instead, they began interrogating the Jewish American activists.View image in fullscreenBallal being detained by the Israeli military near his home.Photograph: Raviv Rose/AP“The police were there from the beginning and did not intervene,” said Adra. “While the soldiers were pointing their weapons at us, the settlers started attacking the houses of the Palestinians.“Hamdan tried to protect his family and the settlers attacked him,” he added. “Soldiers started shooting in the air to prevent anyone to help Hamdan. He was shouting for help. They let the settlers attack him and then the army abducted him.”Members of the activist group then entered Ballal’s house and saw blood on the floor, which a family member said was spilled when he was hit on the head.Injured, handcuffed and blindfolded, Ballal was moved by the soldiers to a military vehicle.In a statement to the Guardian, the IDF said there had been a violent confrontation between Palestinians and Israelis after “terrorists” threw rocks at Israeli citizens.“Last night [Monday], several terrorists hurled rocks at Israeli citizens, damaging their vehicles near Susya. Following this, a violent confrontation broke out, involving mutual rock-hurling between Palestinians and Israelis at the scene,” the statement said.“IDF and Israeli police forces arrived to disperse the confrontation, at this point, several terrorists began hurling rocks at the security forces.“The forces apprehended three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at them, as well as an Israeli civilian involved in the violent confrontation. The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel police.”View image in fullscreenBallal’s car after the attack.Photograph: HandoutOn Tuesday, Ballal’s lawyer, Lea Tsemel, said he was released with the two other Palestinians detained during the incident, Nasser Shreiteh and Khaled Muhammad Shnaran.Associated Press journalists saw the director leaving the police station where he was being held. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes.This is not the first time that directors and crew members ofNo Other Land, and Palestinian residents of Susiya, have been attacked by settlers. CJNV shared details of at least 43 attacks in the village since the beginning of the year, perpetrated by violent settlers.‘‘We came back from the Oscars and every day since there is an attack on us,” said Adra. “This might be their revenge on us for making the movie. It feels like a punishment.”No Other Land, which won the Oscar for best documentary feature film, chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. Ballal and Adra, both from Masafar Yatta, made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with the Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.View image in fullscreenA still from No Other Land.Photograph: Antipode FilmsThe film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin international film festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad, with Miami Beachproposing ending the leaseof a cinema that screened the documentary. It has struggled to find a backer in the US and has instead been self-distributed.Last February,Adrawas also surrounded and attacked by masked Israeli settlers.“We risked our life to film,” he said, adding that “soldiers are ordering us to stay inside our homes in the village, while those who attack and could’ve slaughtered the residents in their homes roam freely, masked, around the village”.Israel captured the West Bank in 1967, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to more than 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centres.The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. About 1,000 people have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards, and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians, as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It just said: ‘Better than any award that I could ever receive in my life’. He’s an icon. He’s a hero.”Bossing it: first photo of Jeremy Allen White as Bruce SpringsteenRead moreGraham continued: “He’s a working-class hero. He’s an icon to thousands, to millions. And his text just said, ‘Thank you so much. You know, my father passed away a while ago and I felt like I saw him today and thank you for giving me that memory.’“I was crying reading the text, do you know what I mean? Oh mate, it was beautiful. You couldn’t ask for anything more, you know, to share that with someone was gorgeous. He’s a lovely man.”Graham also revealed that the singer was a fan of the 2006 Shane Meadows film This Is England, something of a breakthrough for the actor, and that he had had discussed his relationship with his father at length, with Springsteen’s memoir Born to Run a springboard. In that book, Springsteen writes: “He loved me but he couldn’t stand me. He felt we competed for my mother’s affections.”Following the praise but near Oscar miss for Timothée Chalamet’s portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, all eyes are now on White to capitalise on the vogue for biopics of veteran US music icons in their youth.Speaking to GQ last year, White said: “I’m really lucky that there’s sort of a team of folks now in place to help young actors portray rock stars. I’ve got a really talented group of people helping me train vocally, musically, to get ready for this thing.”He too had access to Springsteen, who he said was “really supportive of the project”. Meanwhile Jeremy Strong, who plays Springsteen’s manager Jon Landau, called the shoot“one of the greatest working experiences I’ve ever had”.Springsteen has been quoted as saying White “sings very well” and that the film is cast “beautifully”.Explore more on these topicsFilmStephen GrahamBruce SpringsteenJeremy Allen WhiteBiopicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the end, Wayne Knight (who played Newman in Seinfeld) was cast in the film. “But I don’t know. I’ll never know what people say. Homophobia is alive and well still.”Lane added that his early career success in theatre may have reinforced homophobic attitudes towards him. “There’s always … that ‘He’s from thetheatre’ thing. It’s either homophobia or it’s just, ‘He gives big performances because he comes from thetheatre.’ If they give me a chance, I seem to do well – but you have to get the part. You need a part to prove that. I gave up long ago trying to pursue it.”Lane also said he was “grateful” to Ryan Murphy, whose advent allowed him to play major character roles in TV shows, including journalist Dominick Dunne in Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story and defence attorney F Lee Bailey in The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story. He added: “Before I die, it would be lovely to get to play a juicy, serious supporting role in some film.”Explore more on these topicsFilmNathan LaneLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Earn money to finance your first films. But don’t earn it with clerical works in an office. Go out and work as a bouncer in a sex club. Work as a warden in a lunatic asylum. Go out to a cattle ranch and learn how to milk a cow. Earn your money that way, in real life.’”He added: “You do not become a poet by being in a college. […] You have to go outside of what the norm is. You have to have a certain amount of, I say, good criminal energy [to make a film.]”Herzog, 82, is known forhis on-the-hoof approach to film-making, as well as his prodigious work-rate. The director of more than 70 features said he would “would give away everything” when trying to finance projects, and called the resulting films the real “loot”, rather than any salary.“It’s not normally what a director has to do,” Herzog said. “It’s good to have some good boots, and you can barter it for a load of fish. Or my wrist watch I would give away. I would give away everything. And of course I make money sometimes and I invest it in the next film.”Herzog also told CBS that he instructs his students in how to pick a lock, use bolt cutters and forge a shooting permit. The career, he cautioned, is “not for the faint-hearted”.Speaking to IndieWirein 2022, Herzog said that despite it now being more tricky to finance a film, he was still regularly shooting two projects a year. His next project to be released is a documentary called Ghost Elephants, about a mysterious herd in Angola; at least six further films are in pre-production.Explore more on these topicsWerner HerzogDocumentary filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

It made such an impact because the consequences of the rebellion were so cruel. The rebels were utterly motivated by principle and religion and were met with a tidal wave of violence.”View image in fullscreenThe Morning of Sedgemoor (1905) by Edgar Bundy depicts rebels sheltering in a barn after the Battle of Sedgemoor.Photograph: Tate Images/Tate/Tate ImagesThe setting for the exhibition is poignant as the museum is housedin Taunton Castle, one of the sites of the Bloody Assizes, where rebels were told they were to be hanged, drawn and quartered.Jeffreys, the judge at the trials, is certainly not forgotten here. When two years ago an information board of Taunton’s history was placed in the town,someone scratched out Jeffreys’ eyes and inscribed the word “bastard” next to the image.“It showed that this defining event in West Country history has not been forgotten,” said Mayberry. “In the light of modern events, one is forcibly reminded that some of the triggers to rebellion and to conflict 340 years ago are the very same ones which we are now rediscovering today – how charming and persuasive leaders can lead us to disaster, how societies divide according to religion and ideology, and how it’s really the luck of the draw whether they find a way through to reconciliation.”View image in fullscreenMonmouth’s buckle and button. The duke reputedly gave the buckle to a child when he stopped to change horses during his escape from Sedgemoor; the button is said to have been cut from his coat.Photograph: South West Heritage TrustThe rebellion came 34 years after the end of the English civil war and three years before the “Glorious Revolution”. It was a failed attempt by dissident Protestants led by James Scott, the first duke of Monmouth, to depose the Catholic king James II.At the centre of the exhibition, called After Sedgemoor: Remembering the Monmouth Rebellion, are two paintings loaned by the Tate and Manchester Art Gallery.Edgar Bundy’s The Morning of Sedgemoor (1905) shows rebels sheltering in a barn after the Battle of Sedgemoor, while John Pettie’s The Duke of Monmouth’s Interview with James II (c1882) captures the rebel leader vainly pleading for his life.Also on display isan ostrich plume reputedly worn by Monmouth at the battleand 200 musket balls recently found at the site.Documents being exhibited include an order by a royalist commander that a mound should be built over the dead who lay shallowly buried on the battlefield.Sam Astill, the chief executive ofSouth West Heritage Trust, which operates the Museum of Somerset, said: “The rebellion has a fundamental place in the story of Somerset, and the events that followed it have never been forgotten. There couldn’t be a better setting for the exhibition than Taunton Castle, which still echoes with the events of 340 years ago.”The exhibition runs from29 March to 6 July 2025Explore more on these topicsSomersetHeritageReligionEnglandMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

Examples include How the Grinch Stole Christmas (not convincing) to The Phantom Thread (mostly bang on, featuring real dressmakers at work). Each one is picked apart with waspish scrutiny by Banner, who can spot the difference between a vintage treadle-operated chain stitch machine and a lockstitch machine from different periods in the 19th-century. Hopefully Banner will get a chance to scrutinise this loosely sewing-themed thriller and nitpick its faux pas, such as the bit where the seamstress protagonist Barbara (Eve Connolly) seems to sew a button on a client’s wedding dress in less than a minute. (No thread shank? Shocking!)In fact, it is clear co-writer-director Freddy Macdonald is more interested in sewing equipment, especially thread reels and needles, rather than sewing per se. The conceit is that Barbara, a shy American woman running a sewing supply shop and mobile seamstress business in Switzerland after the death of her mother, comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong. In Run Lola Run-style, the film shows us three different outcomes, each based on whether Barbara chooses to commit the perfect crime, call the police, or run away. In nearly all she uses reels of Mettler thread to rig up pulleys and other simple machines to create booby traps or retrieve useful objects, little Heath Robinson-like contraptions that aren’t quite traced out in enough detail to be persuasive. Drug deal-participants Joshua (Calum Worthy) and Beck (Thomas Douglas) are sometimes her allies and other times her antagonists, but in each timeline she must contend with psychopathic kingpin Hudson (John Lynch, the best thing in the film), doing extreme bad parenting as he bullies his son Joshua.Like the thread contraptions and what little sewing we see, the comedy is a bit, well, threadbare, while the full garment of the film lacks the finishing on the seams that would make it satisfying and professional-looking. There are just too many loose ends, in every sense, when this kind of black comic farce needs to run with the precision of a Bernina sewing machine – which is prominently featured here in a plausible bit of product placement. If there’s a sequel, Macdonald should consider hiring Banner as a consultant.Sew Torn is on digital platforms from 31 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsSewingCraftreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s told through the eyes of seven-year-old Rita (Sofía Allepuz), whose mum, Mari (played by Vega) is trapped in a violent marriage. We see the world how Rita sees it: filled with of moments of joy and discovery; her sense of wonder adds tenderness and hope to the story. It’s never voyeuristic (the violence happens almost entirely off screen), but Rita is effective at evoking how each member of the family is brutalised by abuse, living in a constant state of hypervigilance.Rita works hard. Her little seven-year-old hands scrub, carry heavy plates and wash dishes to make her mother’s life a little easier. Rita’s five-year-old brother Lolo (Alejandro Escamilla), is anxious and timid, much to the irritation of their taxi driver dad José Manuel (Roberto Álamo). He is a man clenched with anger and frustration. “You’re an idiot,” he snaps at his wife with a contempt and fury that made me wince. Vega is terrific as Mari, a woman who is tender and loving with her children, but seems to have switched off some part of herself in order to live with José Manuel; she is on auto-pilot, drained and exhausted.“All men are assholes!” a neighbour jokes to Rita. Her mum tells her to study hard, earn plenty of money – and never rely on a man. But everywhere around them is a message of male dominance. Divorce has just been legalised in Spain – but it feels doubtful it could be an option for a working-class woman like Mari. On the radio, an agony aunt tells a new mum that it is natural for her husband to cheat on her: “It means he’s healthy.” No one comes to help when José Manuel attacks Mari; the conclusion can only be that it’s not just bad men who are to blame for violence against women, but the entire culture. The message would be grim but Rita is a film warmed by optimism and compassion; at the heart of it is a lovely, unselfconscious performance by Allepuz.Rita is on digital platforms from 24 March.In the UK, call the nationaldomestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

For more than two years during the second world war, a teenager named Irene Gut kept 12 Polish Jews safe from the Nazis, hidden in a basement right under the nose of her boss, a high-ranking Nazi officer. Following the war, Gut emigrated to America and never spoke a word about her wartime experiences until the mid 1970s. Now the story of her remarkable courage and heroism is told very politely in an English-language drama that feels a little too tactful in places to really say anything about the horrors ofNazism.Sophie Nélisse plays Irena, a Polish trainee nurse forced into slave labour by the Germans following the occupation in 1939, put to work first in a factory then a hotel. Then Nazi officer Rügemer (Dougray Scott) picks her to be his housekeeper – and when she moves in to his sprawling villa, Irena also sneaks in a group of Jewish prisoners whom she has been supervising at the hotel. When Rügemer is out during the day, the hideaways come out of the cellar to help cook and clean – anything to stop him making good on his promise to bring in more staff. The film doesn’t linger too deeply on the experiences of 12 mostly young Jewish people: the terror and the boredom and the tensions they must have felt, crammed in together month after month.In its weakest moments Irena’s Vow feels shallow; there are scenes of near-misses that should be heart-stopping but fall a little flat. That said, there is a horrible scene in the town, when Irena is forced by German soldiers to view the public hanging of an entire family for harbouring a Jewish man – the youngest child to be executed is only six or seven.The film gives us a rather saintly portrait of Irena, which is a faintly unsatisfying character treatment. It’s a shame that the most fleshed-out character is the Nazi officer Rügemer, a repulsive man in his 60s whose vanity is puffed up by his uniform and power, and who drinks himself into oblivion to block out the sound of the mass shooting of the town’s Jewish population.Irena’s Vow is in UK cinemas and on digital platforms from 28 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSecond world warHolocaustPolandGermanyNazismreviewsShareReuse this content"

Stéphane Larue’sThe Dishwasherfollows a restaurant worker whose life threatens to unravel amid his gambling addiction; in Merritt Tierce’sLove Me Back, the world of waitressing is a front for Texas’s grimy underbelly. Beneath the surface frenzy of French writer Claire Baglin’s debut novel,On the Clock(translated by Jordan Stump), there is a similar stream of existential angst, its protagonist “mired in the heart of pointlessness”.Baglin’s focus is intergenerational exploitation in the (French) workplace. She gives an impressionistic portrait of a young woman employed at a burger joint in brisk but unsparing prose, alternating between her unnamed narrator’s customer-facing drudgery – unfriendly co-workers, pestering managers, habitual injuries – and her childhood memories, particularly of her hot-tempered father, Jérôme, who toiled in a factory for 20 years.Structured around the eatery’s different stations, the novel starts “Out Front”, stops by “Deep Fat” and winds up at the “Drive-Thru”, inducting the reader into the inner workings of each. But around that simple scaffolding, Baglin’s novel is deliberately disorienting. Passages detailing how to “mash the trash” segue into the narrator’s recollections of her hoarder father filling his front room with stuff and “immersed in the pile of junk” at a dumpster.The political backdrop is glimpsed when the neighbour’s parrot squawks ‘Sarkozy sucks’It can all get a bit confusing. Although mostly narrated in the first person, Baglin also makes discombobulating leaps into the mind of Jérôme. Events and timelines are hazy, as if told from a fragmented child’s viewpoint (“It might be afternoon, another year”). Simmering tensions stay inexplicit, her parents’ fraught conversations a “secret murmur”. We are left to merely guess at her father’s fraying mental health and financial woes, while the political backdrop to his troubles is glimpsed only in a childhood game referring to the recession and the neighbour’s downstairs parrot squawking “Sarkozy sucks” on demand.The cutthroat culinary environment of the narrator’s present day is described in Kafkaesque terms (a machine buzzes “like a giant insect”) and as a full-blown war zone with “shrapnel” flying. Uniformed anonymity gives cover, the narrator becoming willing to trample on others, “to take their place” in the pecking order. Baglin expertly captures the giddiness of the working day, her writing percussive: “Snap, snap, you get that?” “Thanks, medium fries! … shake shake shake.”On the Clockhas a rhythm that takes getting used to and I did find Baglin’s digressions strayed too much from the propulsive kitchen-set story. But the novel is underscored by a lacerating humour, even in its bleakest passages, and offers a refreshingly uncompromising study of working-class life, with its calluses, oil burns and hypocrisies laid bare. The result is a terse, bracing whirlwind of a book.On the Clockby Claire Baglin (translated by Jordan Stump) is published by Daunt (£9.99).

It’s hard to imagine a more patriotic project (“a paroxysm of island backslapping”, Hatherley says) except that, “at every level except for the texts”, this was “an entirely central European endeavour”.Its mostly female staff of designers, editors, typographers and publishers was made up of recent refugees from countries that had succumbed to fascism, many of whom had to be released from internment on the Isle of Man in order to work on the books. Adprint, the company that produced and packagedBritain in Pictures, was the creation of the Viennese-born publishers Wolfgang Foges and Walter Neurath. The latter, with his wife Eva, would go on to found Thames & Hudson.This is one of many examples described inThe Alienation Effectwhere Britain’s cultural furniture was rearranged and redesigned by women and men, often under-credited and under-recognised, who had fled here in the 1930s and 40s. Some, like migrants today, landed on the coast of Kent in flimsy craft. Between them they shaped film, art, architecture, planning, publishing, broadcasting, children’s literature and photography. We owe to this diaspora (in whole or in part) the Royal Festival Hall, Penguin Books andThe Tiger Who Came to Tea. Hatherley also highlights less famous and metropolitan glories such as the murals in Newport civic centre – the “Sistine Chapel of municipal socialism” – created by the Frankfurt-born Hans Feibusch and his artistic partner Phyllis Bray.View image in fullscreenHungarian journalist Stefan Lorant, right, editing Picture Post in 1938.Photograph: Kurt Hutton/Getty ImagesMost (not all) were from the political left and the artistic avant garde, and Hatherley’s aim is both to explore their trajectories and to honour and mourn the postwar attempts at building a more fair and enlightened society in which they played a significant part. There is also a simple point, relevant to the present, about the contribution that feared and despised migrants can make to their host country.New arrivals – fleeing persecution because they were Jewish, or on account of their politics, or both – reacted in various ways. Many, while grateful for their refuge, were dismayed by the bad weather, overcooked food, cultural conservatism and lifeless streets of 1930s Britain, the “identical little houses built quickly out of dirt”, as one put it. Nor was their welcome warm. Graham Greene attacked, in theSpectator, the numbers of migrants in the film industry. TheDaily Mailrailed against the “outrage” of how “stateless Jews from Germany are pouring in from every port of this country”. A brigadier from Eastbourne suggested they be forced to wear identifying armbands. Calls to lock up “dangerous aliens” led to their internment in sometimes atrocious conditions.Some, like the architects Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, responded by moving on quite quickly to the greater opportunities of the United States. Others embraced British culture and became its eloquent champions: the Dresden academic Nikolaus Pevsner, for example, would lovinglycatalogue architectural treasuresin his county-by-countyBuildings of Englandseries and write a book celebratingThe Englishness of English Art. The cinematographer Walter Lassally, who came on theKindertransport, would eventually move from gritty portrayals of working-class life such asA Taste of Honeyto filming the imperial-age nostalgia ofMerchant Ivory filmsin the 1980s.Powerful photographs by the likes of the Hamburg-born Bill Brandt documented contrasts of privilege and povertySome tried to keep alive their social and artistic radicalism and re-grow it on sometimes unpromising British soil. It is these types that Hatherley likes best. The artist Naum Gabo is, he says, “the sort of modernist I find easiest to like – futuristic, unsentimental, abstract, pure, uncompromised, a real link from the October revolution and Weimar Berlin to London (and St Ives)”. He also admires the photographer Edith Tudor-Hart, born Suschitzky, who combined her documentation of Welsh coalmines and London slums with work for the communist-aligned National Unemployed Workers’ Movement and (it is believed) the KGB’s forerunner the NKVD. He makes space to write about Bertolt Brecht, even though the Marxist playwright never settled in Britain, and borrows from him the book’s title.Perhaps the most emblematic of these European-made British icons wasPicture Post, a magazine that the Hungarian leftwing journalist Stefan Lorant, previously imprisoned by the Gestapo, helped to found. Here, powerful photographs by the likes of the Hamburg-born Bill Brandt documented contrasts of privilege and poverty, or else portrayed ordinary people living their lives. They shot Eton, Oxford, northern back streets, village fetes, seaside frolics and funfairs, and helped create a climate of opinion that contributed to Labour’s landslide election victory in 1945. Now they are familiar images of the good old days with which Nigel Farage might feel comfortable.Possibly you already had some knowledge of the works of these migrants, butThe Alienation Effectreveals their sheer breadth and depth. Hatherley, whose background is in writing about architecture, moves with confidence through the fields of film, typography and art. The book is thick with information, sometimes resembling the gazetteers or guides he has previously written. It’s an occasionally chewy read, but it’s more often acute, informative, passionate and witty, a sometimes moving tribute to achievement in the face of diversity, and an essential antidote to crude theories of national identity.The Alienation Effectby Owen Hatherley is published by Allen Lane (£20).

Not a single hiker, dog walker or shepherd. Instead, golden eagles have circled lazily overhead, stags have boldly held our gaze, and rare blue butterflies have flitted around our booted feet. The silence here is deep and dense, broken only by birdsong.This is the Madonie national park, also known as the Sicilian Alps, home to many of the island’s highest mountains and rarest plants. It’s a landscape of 200 million-year-old rocks, rich in fossils. Of raptors and the tiniest of songbirds. Of wild boar, fallow deer and porcupines. Of cyclamen and crocuses. Of the largest holly trees on the planet, and of 65 varieties of orchid. A landscape that is void of tourists, ramblers and Sicilians. For anyone in search of wilderness, solitude and sunshine, I can’t think of a better place.Summer here would be too hot to wander. Spring – when the lush green landscape is dotted with sweet peas and poppies, and villages come alive with religious festivals – and autumn, when we visit, with its pink prickly pears hanging from cacti and rutting stags, are the best times to explore.View image in fullscreenAnnabel Abbs in the Madonie natural park.Photograph: Annabel AbbsThe 40,000 hectare park was created in 1989, when its biodiversity and geological rarity were recognised by Unesco as possibly the richest in the Mediterranean. My partner and I are here to walk from its hinterland to its rim on the northern coast of Sicily, not far from the capital, Palermo. Our route follows a section of the newly restored 166km Via dei Frati (The Way of the Friars), a trail once used by itinerant friars, pilgrims, beggars, mystics and missionaries. We shall be walking about 90km of sharp ascents and descents over seven days, starting from the village of Gangi (with views of Etna on a clear day). And yes, a century back, some of the Madonie’s medieval hilltop-perching villages were infamous mafia strongholds – all of which makes for a landscape as rich in history as it is in flora and fauna. Today, these villages – depopulated, dusty, replete with romantically ruined castles-on-crags and ridiculously ornate churches – are where we sleep.We dip and dive past monumental oak trees rumoured to be a thousand years oldWe booked our guesthouses – in Petralia Sottana, Gangi, Geraci Siculo, Castelbuono and Cefalù – in advance, but could have saved ourselves the effort as we were the only guests. Each day, we head out on quiet country lanes that gradually turn into cattle tracks and then into hidden, winding paths. Here, we must keep a careful eye on the yellow arrows and red-and-white stripes, daubed on rocks and trees, that indicate the Via dei Frati. As we climb, we leave behind the horned cattle, shaggy goats and timid ponies that roam the Madonie’s verdant pastures. Now, skittish deer and their fawns clatter over the scree that often replaces grassland. Raptors soar. We dip and dive, through steep beech forests, past monumental oak trees rumoured to be a thousand years old, around woodlands of wild pear, ash and juniper.In these most remote locations, we often stumble across tiny deserted chapels – and wonder how they were built, and by whom. These were vital places of refuge for the friars who once followed these routes, seeking alms in exchange for work.View image in fullscreenThe village of CastelbuonoPhotograph: Interfoto/AlamyThe Via dei Frati was rediscovered by a Sicilian psychotherapist called Santo Mazzarisi. After walking several well-known pilgrim routes and wondering why Sicily had no trail of its own, Mazzarisi began researching, and then restoring, this ancient path. In 2017, it opened to the public, starting at Caltanissetta in central Sicily and ending at Cefalù on the coast. In the past, pilgrims then crossed the sea from Messina before heading to Jerusalem, but today’s route has been designed as eight stages, each ending in a village where food, accommodation and, of course, a beautiful church can be found. For atrue pilgrim experience, Mazzarisi suggests visiting during holy week – 13-20 April this year – when Caltanissetta hosts processions of life-size statues re-enacting the Resurrection.It’s as though we’re inside a Renaissance painting, with grazing goats, wooded valleys and divinely slanting lightWe join the trail at Gangi because this is where it hits the Madonie mountains. The park contains none of the usual trappings of civilisation so, of necessity, we carry a daily picnic, prepared by our guesthouse, and eat our focaccia sandwiches on sun-warmed rocks. Having explored Gangi’s museum, which is chock-full of geological and archaeological treasures unearthed from the park, we walk 14km to Geraci Siculo. We are not walking at our normal pace – there’s too much to distract us. Instead, we pause regularly to note the birds (buzzards, firecrests, buntings, tits and yellow-feathered serins), to examine the curiously striated rocks that are everywhere, and to exclaim over the remarkably “biblical” scenery. We feel as though we’re inside a Renaissance painting: grazing goats, wooded valleys, divinely slanting light.In Geraci Siculo, we are beckoned into a library by its wizened curator, who proceeds to unlock glass cabinets stacked with 15th-century religious manuscripts. We cannot understand what he is telling us, but the odour of dusty pews drifting from the pages adds to the peculiar sense of time travel.We continue to hike, upwards, through clouds, to Petralia Sottana, where we spend an additional day climbing Monte San Salvatore, following the scuffed tracks of rootling boar, clambering over granite boulders, and getting pleasantly lost.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re heading to the region’s world famous giant holly trees, 20 metres high and thick with scarlet berries, when we hear voices, dogs barking, cars reversing. The sound is such an affront to our ears we pick up our pace, almost running to return to the unpeopled wilderness we’ve fallen in love with. Minutes later, we are happily alone again until we reach Castelbuono. A taxi is planned to take us to Gibilmanna for the final 9km descent into Cefalù on the Tyrrhenian Sea. Although the route becomes increasingly urban, we are mollified by repeated glimpses of sparkling ocean and the knowledge that Cefalù has not only beaches but a Unesco-listed Norman cathedral among its many treasures.In the past, we have hiked all over Europe, but – thanks to the strenuous ascents and silent nights – never have we slept so well. And never have we felt so deliciously solitary. If crowds are your thing, this park and the pilgrim route just won’t do. But if you like a landscape all to yourself, or a terrain so rich in geological history and so abundant with rare plants, insects and birds that you’re forced to walk at an unfamiliarly slow pace, the Via dei Frati will surpass all expectations.Annabel travelled independently.

Then you simply wrap it up into a parcel and pop it in the oven for 10-15 minutes.Punchy flavours are another good idea with frozen seafood, which is why Toogood often goes for curries or tomato-based stews. Frozen prawns, however, tend to be destined for noodle soups: “Fry some veg, such as tenderstem broccoli, then add noodles and stock. Chuck in a handful of prawns at the end, then spruce it up with chilli, coriander and spring onion.”Defrosted mussels, by contrast, are worth steaming and chopping to stir throughgribiche, McIlroy says, but Scott warns they can “lose their flavour” by being frozen. That’s why, if fresh mussels aren’t an option, she tends to seek out tinned ones instead: “They’re lovely on toast with avocado.”A bag of frozen fish pie mix is also a boon. Toogood puts his to work in fishcakes: “Roast the defrosted fish with herbs and some seasoning until cooked through, then flake it into mashed potato with a load of fresh parsley, or massaman curry paste or lime pickle.” Shape that into patties, then flour, egg and breadcrumb them, and shallow-fry until golden. “Fish pie mix is also great in shakshuka or in a tomato- or white sauce-based stew,” Scott says. Or try it in her simple take on fish pie, which involves mixing the defrosted pie mix with creme fraiche, mustard and herbs, putting that in an ovenproof dish, topping with sliced new potatoes and baking.And let’s not forget the great unifier, fish fingers. Happily, Toogood says, they really don’t need much messing with: “Just a good spoon of crispy chilli oil, plus some chips and peas, and you can’t go far wrong.” You’ll find no arguments here.Got a culinary dilemma?

However, frying ready-made gnocchi so they are golden and nutty on the outside, elevates them to something lighter, tastier and much more interesting. I love to finish them under the grill, to accentuate that crispness, together with the oozy sweetness from nuggets of gorgonzola. A fancy-feeling dish that is incredibly easy to throw together.Charred gnocchi, purple sprouting broccoli and gorgonzolaPrep10 minCook25 minServes4300g purple sprouting broccoli, woody ends removed3 tbsp olive oilSea salt andblack pepper2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced40g butter500g gnocchi200g mascarpone½bunchflat-leaf parsley, finely chopped100g gorgonzolaCut the broccoli stalks into 1cm pieces and roughly chop the heads.

We shouldn’t forget this, because the crispness of raw rhubarb is perfect in salads, sambols and pickles, while in cooked form it sits beautifully alongside rich, fatty proteins such as mackerel, pork and burrata, all of which welcome its tart cut-through.Charred mackerel with rhubarb sauce and remoulade (pictured top)This makes for an eyecatching, light dinner or lunch. The celeriac is super-quick to prep if you have a food processor with a julienne attachment but, if you don’t, know that the process of cutting it into thin batons by hand can be gratifyingly meditative.Prep15 minCook20 minServes4For the sauceJuice of ½ lemon2-3 tbsp caster sugar, to taste400g rhubarb, dicedA generous pinch of salt½ tsp wholegrain mustard, or to tasteA small knob of butterFor the celeriac remoulade500g celeriac(about ½ a large one), peeled and root removedJuice of 1 lemon1 tsp flaky sea salt1 small shallot, peeled and very finely chopped1½ tbsp moscatel vinegar, or apple cider vinegar60ml creme fraiche2 tbsp Kewpie mayonnaiseA pinch of caster sugar,or to tasteWhite pepper, or black pepper10g dill, or other soft green herb of your choice, finely chopped1-2 tsp capers(optional)To serve2 large mackerel, filleted to yield 4 filletsFlaky sea saltStir the lemon juice and two tablespoons of sugar in a small saucepan until the latter starts to dissolve. Mix in the rhubarb and salt, then set over a medium-low heat, cover and leave the rhubarb to soften for about 10 minutes.Lift off the lid and turn up the heat to boil off some of the excess liquid for 10 minutes or so. Take off the heat, stir in the mustard and butter, then taste and add more sugar, if need be. Transfer to a clean jar and set aside until ready to use (or store in the fridge for two to three days).Run the celeriac through the julienne attachment on a food processor. Alternatively, cut it into 1-2mm-thick slices, stack them on top of each other, then cut into batons of a similar thickness. Put the celeriac batons in a medium-large bowl and toss with the lemon juice. Sprinkle over the salt, then scrunch this into the celeriac with your hands to soften.Turn on the grill to its highest setting and line a grill pan with aluminium foil. Stir the shallot and vinegar in a jug, then mix in the creme fraiche, mayonnaise and sugar. Season to taste with pepper, then pour over the celeriac mix and toss until evenly coated. Stir through the chopped herbs and capers, if using, and set aside.Season the mackerel fillets with salt, then arrange them skin side up in the grill pan and cook for five minutes, until the skin is heavily blistered and the flesh cooked through. Serve with the remoulade and a spoonful of the rhubarb sauce.Seared king prawns with rhubarb and ginger sambolView image in fullscreenAlexina Anatole’s seared king prawns with rhubarb and ginger sambol.I like to leave the shells on the prawns for flavour (and because I like a tactile eating experience), but you could just as easily peel them. Serve with jasmine rice.Prep15 minCook20 minServes4For the rhubarb-ginger sambol25g desiccated coconut100g raw rhubarb,cut into 5cm lengths4cm piece fresh ginger, peeled½ banana shallot,peeled andthinly sliced2 bird’s eye chillies, thinly sliced (remove the seeds if you prefer less heat)Juice of ½ lime1 tsp fish sauceA pinch of salt, or to tasteFreshly ground black pepper, to tasteFor the stir-fry3 tbsp neutral oil2 spring onions, peeled and finely sliced2 large garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced2 small pak choi, thickly sliced500g sustainably-sourced shell-onking prawns, deveined1 tsp maple syrup, or to taste (optional)15g coriander,leaves picked and roughly chopped30g salted peanuts, roughly choppedPut the coconut in a bowl of cold water and leave to soak for five to 10 minutes. Thinly slice the rhubarb lengthways, then stack up the slices and cut into matchsticks. Repeat with the ginger, then put both in a small bowl. Add the shallot, chillies, lime juice and fish sauce, and toss. Set aside until ready to use (you can do this a day or two in advance and store, covered, in the fridge).Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.To cook, put a large wok or frying pan on a medium-high heat and add the oil. Once it’s shimmering, add the spring onion, garlic and pak choi, and stir-fry for just a minute or two, until the pak choi turns a bright, fresh green.Add the prawns and stir-fry, flipping them as necessary, until they’ve mostly turned pink. Add the sambol, turn up the heat and stir-fry for a further minute or so, just until the sambol starts to soften slightly. Taste and add a little maple syrup, if you feel it needs a touch of sweetness, or more fish sauce for punch. Serve immediately, garnished with the coriander and chopped peanuts.Alexina Anatole is the author of theSmall Wins Substackand Sweet: the Secret to the Best Desserts, published by Square Peg at £27.
