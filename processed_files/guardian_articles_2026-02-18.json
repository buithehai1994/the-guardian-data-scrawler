As the price of gold goes up, we get busy on both sides.”In late January the pricereached more than $5,000 (£3,681) an ouncefor the first time, mainly thanks to President Trump, although it has recently come back from that level.View image in fullscreenJewellers on Leicester’s Golden Mile.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAmid the US president’s clashes with the US Federal Reserve and his threats to invade Greenland, investors sought a safe haven from volatile markets and currencies. So private buyers and central banks across the worldscrambled to acquire goldandrepatriate stockpilesheld in the US.The soaring prices have driven Sunny’s customers to snap up 22-carat gold bars and coins or dig through jewellery boxes to sell off unworn jewellery.The continuing closure of bank branches is also a factor in consumers seeking other investments despite bank deposits being protected up to £120,000. Over the past two years, Barclays and NatWest shut down their local branches on the Golden Mile. “It’s making it harder and harder to get access to your money. But if I’ve got gold, I’ve got money,” Kanda says.View image in fullscreenSundeep Kanda, the owner of Sunny Jewellers, says he is seeing a lot of people buying and selling gold.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAs a result, the soaring value of bullion has produced tidy profits for south Asian jewellers that specialise in high-caratage gold. The cultural importance of gold across south Asian cultures, as good luck and insurance against hard times, has maintained demand despite high prices.Almost half of the gold mined globally has been used for jewellery, according to the World Gold Council. At Hindu weddings, brides are given a gold necklace with black beads, known as a mangalsutra, and grooms often receive a gold bracelet.Gold graphicIn India, the tradition of giving gold at weddings stems from the dowry system. Even after the abolition of dowries, giving gold remains a method of providing protection for women in case things go wrong, or of setting up a newlywed couple for financial stability.View image in fullscreenA 22-carat gold heritage bridal jewellery set by Minar Jewellers.Photograph: Minar Jewellers“People do like the idea of buying gold as a means of maintaining cultural traditions,” says Pravin Pattni, the owner of Minar Jewellers in Tooting, southLondon. “And they know as well, in the back of their mind, that it is a sound investment.”For many jewellers, the high price of gold is “a blessing in disguise”, Pattni says. “The higher price hasn’t actually subdued the demand. When there’s a wedding, it doesn’t matter if the price of gold is high. Whatever they need, they need.”Ten to 15 years ago the average customer bought £25,000 of jewellery for a wedding, according to Pattni. “Today, it would not be a surprise if they came in and bought £75,000 to £100,000 worth of jewellery, simply because the price of gold is so high.”Business has been booming on the Golden Mile, says Parul Visram, who alongside her husband manages Ram Jewellers, which has been on Belgrave Road for more than 50 years. “People do have trust in gold, that they are going to get the value back.”View image in fullscreenParul Visram of Ram Jewellers says business has been booming on Leicester’s Golden Mile.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianInside Sunny Jewellers, customers Hitesh and Meera Jethwa are buying several 15g chains in 22ct gold to give to family members in remembrance of a nephew who died recently.“With gold, you cannot go wrong,” Hitesh says. “Today, maybe it’s a high price or low price, whatever. But after three or four years, you will say: ‘Oh, it’s a good job I bought it.’ Because it’s always going up.”View image in fullscreenHitesh and Meera Jethwa buy gold chains at Sunny Jewellers for family members.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianJayant Raniga, the owner of PureJewels in east London, says customers react with “shock horror” when they first see the price of gold. “But then they accept it very quickly. It’s quite reassuring in a way. Customers are committed to buying gold.”Younger members of the south Asian diaspora are investing in lightweight pieces that can be worn every day, or placing their savings in gold bars. Their elders, meanwhile, are selling off their heavier, traditional jewellery to financially support their children and grandchildren.View image in fullscreenJayant Raniga, the owner of PureJewels in London, says: ‘Customers are committed to buying gold.’Photograph: Priya Bharadia/The Guardian“The heirlooms, as such, people try not to sell,” Kanda says. “But life is hard at the moment. The cost of living is so high, and people think: ‘If we cash out on this, we can pay some bills off.’”Pattni says customers are often “pleasantly surprised” to discover the value of their jewellery, often tucked away in a steel safe or jewellery box for decades.One customer, a grandfather in his 80s, brought in his collection of gold jewellery to sell. During his young adulthood, in the early 1970s, gold was worth approximately 40p a gram. He was in disbelief to find the total value of the collection was now £200,000, which he decided would be put towards the deposit for his grandson’s first house.“That’s the beauty of gold,” Pattni says. “Anybody who has put any money into gold, they’re just laughing because they’ve made so much more money without having to do anything.”Months of soaring prices came to a close at the end of January. Trump’s choice of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair led to a sharp fall in the price of gold and silver, as investors sold off their precious metals and began to return to the US dollar. It now stands at $4,877 compared with the peak of $5,594 in late January.This volatility of the gold price has caused uncertainty for jewellers on the right time to buy and sell stock. For jewellers creating bespoke designs, the volatility of gold places pressure on their manufacturing process.Pravin Pattni (right) and his son Jaysal run Minar Jewellers in Tooting.Photograph: Minar JewellersHowever, for Raniga, who manages an atelier above his east London store, sticking with 22 carat gold is non-negotiable. “The malleability, its sheen, its longevity: there is no substitute.”Many of these jewellers are run by families across several generations, who emigrated to the UK from the Indian subcontinent or east Africa from the 1960s.Amid the volatility, Pattni has noticed a growing interest in investment gold among younger and non-Asian customers. “There’s more awareness within the [white British] population about the cultural significance of wearing 22ct jewellery. They realise it’s worth more.”Within south Asian families, the advice to invest in high-carat gold continues to be passed on. Gemmologist Vishal Jogiya recalls a father who recently visited his shop on the Golden Mile with his 10-year-old son and explained gently to to the boy why their cash would be better stored in a 10g gold bar.View image in fullscreenGemmologist Vishal Jogiya at his store on Leicester’s Golden Mile.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“That 10-year-old kid will remember buying this piece of gold. He’s been taught the value in investments,” Jogiya says. “While I was watching this, it just made me realise: the value in what we’re doing is humungous.”Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesRetail industryLeicesterLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’ve hardly been idle since: two tours, two films, a 40-date residencyat the Las Vegas Sphere, nearly three hours of stripped-down re-recordings of old material on Songs of Surrender, plus Bono’s autobiography, which spawned a solo tour, a stint on Broadway andanotherfilm. An impressive workload by any standards.Still, you could take the gap between original albums – the longest in U2’s history – as evidence of a problem that’s bedevilled the band for nearly 20 years: where doU2fit into the current musical landscape?The obvious answer is to acquiesce to the “heritage rock” label, rest on the laurels of their back catalogue and rake it in touring the hits. Clearly that doesn’t appeal, as evidenced by Bono and The Edge explaining that a 2017 tour playing 1987’s The Joshua Tree in full was not about nostalgia. So what else? They’ve tried everything, from reaffirming their experimental credentials onNo Line on the Horizonto trying to play 21st-century pop at its own game – AutoTune on the vocals, hitmaker Ryan Tedder in the producer’s chair, a mooted but unrealised collaboration with David Guetta, a doomed attempt to engage with the era’s new means of distribution in theirdisastrous hook-up with Apple– without ever really recapturing the success or the spirit of their late 80s/early 90s imperial phase.Which brings us to Days of Ash, not a taster for their forthcoming album but, like Bruce Springsteen’s recent Streets of Minnesota, an attempt to reanimate the protest-song-as-quickfire-response spirit of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s 1970 single Ohio. It’s an idea that you might have expected would have occurred to more people of late. If CSNY could get Ohio in the US chart within weeks ofthe Kent State shootingsit commemorated – in 1970, when getting a single in the charts involved actually pressing records, distributing them to stores and servicing radio stations – then there seems no reason why artists can’t put the faster processes of the streaming era to use in that way: there’s something faintly depressing about the fact that it’s currently the province of old lags such as Springsteen and U2. Three of the EP’s five songs – there’s also a brief poetry-plus-ambient-instrumental interlude – commemorate recent deaths in conflicts and protests: those of nonviolent Palestinian activist Awad Hathaleen, 16-year-old Iranian protester Sarina Esmailzadeh, and, most recently, the shooting of Renee Nicole Good on 7 January.The latter informs the EP’s lead track, American Obituary, on which U2 sound more righteously angry than they have in years, both in the lyrics, which have a confrontational man-the-barricades tone seldom heard in U2’s work since the era of War – “America will rise against the people of the lie … the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power” – and musically: a stew of distorted guitar, growling bass and siren-invoking electronics.On subsequent tracks the music shifts into less aggressive mode – more acoustic guitars, less of The Edge in full flight, a noticeably hazier ambience – and the lyrics take on a more familiar note of consolation and optimism: biblical imagery, distinctly Bono-esque aphorisms (“the future, as everyone knows, is where we’re gonna be spending the rest of our life”). But a genuine urgency remains, no doubt linked to the EP’s relatively quick turnaround. It’s in stark contrast to the mass of second-guessing, re-recording and abandoned projects that have marked U2’s last couple of decades; denying themselves the opportunity to overthink things seems to have sharpened U2 up. There’s a crispness to The Tears of Things’ assault on fascism and religious fundamentalism t felt noticeably absent from patches of their recent oeuvre. “When people go around talking to God it always ends in tears,” Bono sings.It doesn’t all work. Their Ed Sheeran collaboration, Yours Eternally, is less jarring than some of the lunges for contemporaneity in U2’s 21st-century catalogue, but the problem is that the sound of Sheeran’s voice and guitar has become immediately recognisable thanks to its omnipresence over the last 15 years, which means that his guest appearance swamps the song by default.You’d also hesitate to herald the EP as evidence of a new approach, not least because Bono has announced the music on their forthcoming album is nothing like this, more a “carnival vibe”. But what you can safely say is that U2’s aforementioned imperial phase was fuelled by an almost religious zeal, a firm sense of purpose and a belief in the power of music to effect change – the stuff that their hipper post-punk contemporaries found risibly uncool – and that zeal, purpose and belief has been recaptured here.Explore more on these topicsU2Pop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then a deluge of soft toys lobbed from the stands. But across the face of the brilliant Russian skater Adeliia Petrosian there was only the faintest of smiles. For now.So far at theseWinter Olympics, a Russian is yet to win a medal. But there is a possibility that could change on Thursday when the 18‑year‑old Petrosian, who sits in fifth after the short programme, takes to the ice again shortly after 9pm.Russia plays prideful, but there’s no doubt the Olympics ban is hurting | Bruce BerglundRead moreIt won’t just be in Milan where people will be watching the result closely, but in the very highest places in Moscow too. Which tells you something about how the mood music has shifted in Russia – and how its return from the sporting cold is closer than you might think.Two years ago the Kremlin could not have been more frigid about the Paris Olympics. In fact, the few Russians who competed as “authorised neutral athletes”, after they were vetted to check they did not explicitly support the war in Ukraine, were criticised.Irina Viner, Russia’s rhythmic gymnastics president, even went as far as to call those who went “traitors”, and suggested that only “homeless” athletes competed without their flag and anthem. One rower told Match TV that the Kremlin had compensated Russian competitors who dropped out.Now, though, Russia is firmly behind its Olympians again. As Russia’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said before the Games: “I’ll definitely be watching wherever our guys perform. It’s a must-see.”That view was amplified vociferously on Wednesday by the TV presenter and Putin loyalist Dmitry Guberniev. After calling Petrosian “a great girl” and predicting she would beat everyone, he reflected the shift in Moscow’s support for the 13 Russians here in Milano Cortina, in bawdy terms.“It’s interesting how life changes,” he said. “I see posters everywhere on the roads about our beloved Olympians in Italy. Many called the Paris Olympians traitors. Life is changing for the better, all those arrogant little bastards and assholes are keeping their mouths shut now.”It might sound strange to western ears – especially given the war in Ukraine is still raging, and Russia was also previouslybanned for massive state-sponsored dopingat the Sochi Olympics they hosted in 2014 – but most seasoned Olympic insiders believe Russia will be allowed back this year.Look at the direction of travel. In December theInternational Olympic Committeecalled for Russian youth athletes to be allowed to compete internationally under their own flag, paving the way for them to compete at the Youth Games this summer.View image in fullscreenKirsty Coventry said ‘every athlete should be allowed to compete freely without being held back by the politics and divisions of their governments’.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAAnd this month Kirsty Coventry, the IOC president, insisted that “every athlete should be allowed to competefreely without being held back by the politics and divisions of their governments”. She did not explicitly mention Russia, but everyone in the room knew which country she was talking about.Certainly Mikhail Degtyarev, Russia’s sports minister and head of the Russian Olympic Committee, sounded bullish on Wednesday, as he predicted a return to international sport under the Russian flag and anthem could come as soon as April or May.And there was also a jagged edge to his remarks, as he warned the IOC what would happen if it did not hurry up. “If the IOC doesn’t bring our case up for discussion, we will, of course, go to court,” he told the Russian website Championat.“The cutoff date is May. And we won’t just go to court demanding the reinstatement of the Russian Olympic Committee, but we will file a commercial lawsuit in Swiss civil courts, because we are losing money that we spend on training athletes who were barred from competition due to the IOC’s decision. An unlawful decision, in our opinion.”Two outstanding issues remain. The first is over Russia’s breach of the Olympic charter by unilaterally including regions of Ukraine in the Russian Olympic Committee – which is the reason it is banned from Milano Cortina. And it also still has to pay outstanding fees to the World Anti-Doping Agency. But no one – including Degtyarev – believes these are significant barriers to re-entry.Meanwhile on the slopes in Italy there has been only the occasional gripe and grudge from the Russian team about how they have been treated. This week the Russian ski mountaineer Nikita Filippov claimed that the organisers did not give him a free mobile phone because he was a neutral athlete. “All athletes are given Samsung phones, but we were shortchanged, only given shampoo and toothpaste,” he said in an unboxing video on social media. “Oh well, we didn’t come here for phones.”There was also mild frustration back in Russia when Petr Gumennik was awarded sixth place in the men’s figure skating, with even Peskov, whose wife is the former Olympic champion Tatiana Navka, getting involved. “I am not a specialist, but my wife says that Petr could have easily been in the top three with a different attitude from the judges,” he said.While some back home remain queasy about their athletes competing as neutrals, rather than in the red of Russia, Degtyarev urged them to think of the bigger picture. “I can tell these people that our athletes, who are making their way abroad as neutrals, have not given up their passports, citizenship, flag and anthem. They love Russia, they fight for it, and the whole world knows they are Russian.”And if there are no medals, will that be a blow to prestige, he was then asked. “It would be a blow if we weren’t there at all,” came the reply. “And the fact that we’re there is already a good result.”So what price we see Donald Trump shaking hands with Vladimir Putin at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics opening ceremony – and the Russian flag waving as 250 of its athletes enter the coliseum? A year ago it would have sounded preposterous. Now only a fool would rule it out.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Russia Olympic teamInternational Olympic CommitteeSport politicsWinter OlympicsRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a wonder anyone ever gets any actual work done. “I’m tired,” says Amy Madigan, grinning crookedly on a video call. It’s noon in Los Angeles but the living room curtains behind her are shut tight. I worry she may have just pulled an all-nighter.The last time Madigan was nominated was in 1985. She played Gene Hackman’s brittle daughter in a blue-collar drama called Twice in a Lifetime (the title now feels apt). Awards season, she points out, was shorter and sweeter back then. “Now it’s a big unruly beast.‘We want to speak to Amy!’I’ve been doing this since November. Do you not think people are sick of talking about us and seeing our faces? Haven’t you people seen enough?”We were hoping to start rebuilding our house in February or March – but it’s going to take yearsMadigan is now 75, which makes her the plucky veteran in this year’s best supporting actress race; the sentimental outsider, although there’s nothing remotely cosy about her. She is shortlisted for her role in Zach Cregger’s Weapons, a gripping small-town horror movie that plays out in segments, like a set of witness statements. Madigan crops up – first teasingly, then electrifyingly – as the nightmarish Aunt Gladys, the scariest child-catcher this side of Robert Helpmann in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Feeding off the young and conjuring adults into zombies, Gladys has round specs, clownish makeup and a brutal orange wig – and Cregger’s film has her tottering around town talking 19 to the dozen. The woman is laughable and pitiable right up until the moment when she’s not.View image in fullscreen‘It’s crazy how people are responding to her’ … as Aunt Gladys in Weapons.Photograph: Warner BrosThose pulled drapes are unnerving. Madigan’s home looks so impersonal, like a bolthole or a safe house. That’s probably because it is, she explains. She’s in a rental she shares with the actorEd Harris, her husband and longtime creative collaborator. The couple’s real house burned down in the wildfires last year. So that’s her other full-time job, sorting permits with the city. “We were hoping to start rebuilding in February or March, but that’s not going to happen. It’s going to take years.”Cregger has credited Madigan with “saving” his movie. At the very least, she gives it a big injection of blood. And in the months since its release last August, Aunt Gladys has permeated the culture and become a TikTok sensation, beloved of costumed trick-or-treaters and professional drag acts alike. The actor steers clear of social media but is well aware of the fuss. “PeoplelikeGladys. They want to hang out with Gladys.” Stumped pause, crooked grin. “Which I find kind of interesting.”Gladys’s appeal, sad to say, is not quite universal. I watched Weapons with my 11-year-old son and it scared him to bits. He refused to go to bed afterwards, thought Aunt Gladys might be lurking. That’s my fault as a parent but it is also hers, just a little. “Wow. Well, I’m sorry for doing that to him,” she says. “But I’m also taking it as a compliment.”It’s a funny thing, horror. It somehow hits harder than more respectable genres. “Horror operates on an emotional level,” explains Madigan. “People want it and need it. They like to view it from afar. I grew up with all the genius black-and-white ones. Nosferatu, The Bride of Frankenstein, right up to Bette Davis in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? That scared the hell out of me, though it’s maybe more gothic than horror. But it’s all based on the old fairytales. Someone stealing the children – that’s been around since ad infinitum.”Gladys feeds on children, draining their energy to stay alive. Maybe Madigan, for her part, is now feeding on Gladys. For the past 10 years, her career has been on subsistence rations, with smaller parts in smaller films. So Weapons has been a godsend, if not quite a magic bullet. She is keen to keep things in perspective. “Friends are like, ‘Oh, the scripts must be flying into your mailbox.’ And I’m like, ‘No.’ But I’m more on the radar, more in the conversation, which is nice. It’s like Gladys showed up, made an impact and reminded the world I’m still here.”How bad did it get? Did she ever think about quitting? “Sure. How could you not? Those thoughts invade, especially when you have a fallow time, and I’ve certainly had those during these past few years. Then you have a down day and think, ‘Will I ever get a job again? Maybe I’ve retired and haven’t really told myself yet.’” She pulls a face. “The business is brutal. It just is. But the reality is that I still love doing it.”Evidence suggests she has always been a scrapper, a survivor, regarded as too tough and too caustic for mainstream Hollywood tastes. “Freckled, plain but winning,” wrote the critic Stanley Kauffmann of her first screen performance – she played a pregnant convict in 1982’s Love Child – with the implication that every subsequent triumph would come in the face of steep odds. So she made hay on the margins, playing John Candy’s girlfriend in Uncle Buck and Kevin Costner’s wife in Field of Dreams before picking up a Golden Globe for her starring role in Roe vs Wade, the 1989 abortion rights legal drama.View image in fullscreenBrittle daughter ... Madigan’s earlier Oscar-nominated turn in Twice in a Lifetime.Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Bud Yorkin Productions/AllstarFor a spell, she and Harris were an indie-film power couple, working off the same page, with their careers in parallel. Then his work-rate kept motoring – with roles in the likes of The Truman Show, Darren Aronofsky’s Mother! and Top Gun: Maverick – while hers began to trail off. Plus ça change. There’s an inbuilt sexism, she says, to the whole casting process. “But Ed knows the business as well as I do. So he’s good on all that. We met working together. We’ve done many films together. So we’re used to having each other’s backs.”I’ve been meaning to ask about their appearance at the 1999 Oscars, when the directorElia Kazanwas presented with an honorary award by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Madigan and Harris have collaborated on 11 films altogether, but that night was surely their most high-profile joint performance, as they watched the presentation silent, stony-faced and unclapping. Kazan was the great leftist film-maker of postwar US cinema, the man behind Viva Zapata!, On the Waterfront and A Face in the Crowd. But in 1952, he broke ranks and spilled names in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. It was a dark time; lives were ruined. And Kazan, Madigan feels, played a role in all that.“My dad was a journalist,” she says by way of explanation. “He was also the political liaison officer for the supreme court in Illinois. So I grew up politically minded. My dad covered the McCarthy hearings and it affected him greatly, to the point where he couldn’t really talk about it.

There are certain lines you don’t cross.”The trouble, of course, is that history repeats itself. Lines that are crossed tend to be crossed again. Just look at the political landscape today, she says. The near-daily assault on the first amendment; the footage of people shot dead in the street. She is furious about Trump and despairs at the state of the country. When their house burned down, she and Harris briefly discussed getting out altogether. “It feels awful – politically speaking – to be living in the US now. So of course the subject comes up in conversation. But I’m still proud to be an American. I believe in my fellow man. And you can feel something happening in southern California. People are terrified but they are also angry. They’re resisting, fighting back. So I’m guardedly hopeful.”It is a strange time to have another date at theOscars, she knows.

José Mourinho: in favour of restrained celebrations.José Mourinho, once of the poke‑in‑the‑eye, sprint‑down‑the‑touchline, accost‑the‑referee-in-the-car-park school of footballing expression: now apparently very big on showing respect to the game. Well, it seems like we’ve all been on a journey here.“I told him the biggest person in the history of this club was Black,” Mourinho recounted when asked about his conversation withVinícius Júnioron Tuesday night. “This club, the last thing that it is, is racist.”Mourinho accused of gaslighting for response to Vinícius’ allegation of racismRead moreAnd doubtless these words will have been a profound source of comfort to Vinícius in his lowest moment, having been insultedon the pitchby an opposition player in a Champions League playoff.After all who among us, having been racially abused in a public place, has not turned to the memory of Eusébio, and felt all that residual resentment and ambient anger subside in an instant? With Benfica on the verge of Champions League elimination, knocked out of both cups and seven points back in the Primeira Liga, perhaps Mourinho’s glittering future career as a trauma therapist is even closer than we think.“A stadium where Vinícius plays, something happens, always,” Mourinho said after Benfica’s 1-0 defeat byReal Madrid. And remember: this guy is a master communicator, right? A man who chooses his words with incredible precision and a brilliant strategic mind, right? That’s why he’s “box office”. That’s why, a decade after he was objectively good, so many want him back in the Premier League.But of course Mourinho is the symptom rather than the virus here. The substanceof this caserests on whether Gianluca Prestianni really did call Vinícius “a monkey”, or whether – as Prestianni claims – the whole thing is just an unfortunate misunderstanding, albeit one that could surely have been avoided had Prestianni not inconveniently covered his mouth with his shirt as he spoke.Naturally, there’s going to be a lot of equivocation here. You’re going to say: what if it wasn’t actually a racist incident at all? You’re going to say: what if Prestianni was simply covering his mouth to say something entirely innocuous? You’re going to say: show me the smoking gun, your irrefutable proof. You’re going to say: it’s a heated situation, things get uttered in the moment, think about the career and reputation of this angelic Argentinian kid being dragged through the mud.I believe Vinícius when he says he was racially abused because, unless he has grossly misinterpreted it across a distance of about four feet, to accept any other explanation is to accept a nonsensical, absurd sequence of events. That somehow a player who has spent his whole career in Europefending off racismhas somehow invented this episode for shits and giggles. That he has maliciously imagined what was said to him. That he would willingly walk off the pitch, and halt a Champions League tie being broadcast across the world, on the basis of a fiction.View image in fullscreenVinícius Júnior has spent his career in Europe fending off racism.Photograph: José Sena Goulão/EPAAnd yet at the time of writing, the only person to have received any tangible, meaningful punishment for the events that followed Vinícius’s winning goal is Vinícius himself, booked for the exuberance of his celebration. “The problem in this situation is that Vinícius Júnior has not helped himself,” the former referee Mark Clattenburg said on Amazon. “He has made this difficult for the referee.”At which point it is worth recalling the words ofthe Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffelast week. In an interview with Sky News, Ratcliffe stated that the UK had been “colonised by immigrants”, citing incorrect population data to back up his view. A lot of the subsequent commentary focused correctly on the diversity of the United squad and the city of Manchester itself. But of course in so doing we end up in a familiar trap: the immigrant continually forced to justify their very existence, to defend their presence against a dominant narrative that seeks to position them as troublesome disruptors.I’m less interested here in the false division between “racists” and “non-racists”, a division that in any case is primarily concerned less with proscribing racist behaviour than legitimising anything else that fails to meet an arbitrary threshold. But some of the immediate reaction to the abuse of Vinícius felt telling in bleakly familiar ways. Not racist, but. Not condoning what was said, but. And ultimately, what a shame we have to talk about this, rather than the stuff that actually matters.There is a particular strain of football discourse that tends to regard racism as a reputational risk rather than a lived reality. That the true injustice is not so much the insult as the allegation. That the real victims are not the players who endure it, but the institutions forced to deny it and the neutral observers forced to talk about it. As if the correct response to abuse is strategic restraint. As if simple human dignity is conditional on decorum.In the meantime people who have no problem linking smaller personal aggressions to larger cultural forces when it comes to – say – phone thefts or sexual grooming, remain weirdly resistant to the idea that the tolerance of individual incidents can scale to a broader societal trend. Let’s defer to the Uefa panel, who will invariably conclude that it was one player’s word against another. Let’s just ask Grok whether it was racism.View image in fullscreenJim Ratcliffe’s controversial comments about immigration last week have only increased divisiveness.Photograph: Lucy North/PAThis is what links the comments of Mourinho and Ratcliffe and Clattenburg, as well as the many criticisms of Black players such as Jude Bellingham and Marcus Rashford: the insistence on perfect victims. Shall we all be good little immigrants? Not antagonise crowds, not claim benefits, not write seditious columns in the newspaper, not have difficult dads, not make defensive errors or go on the piss, not make things difficult for the referee, return respectfully to our own half after celebrating a goal? Will that save us? Will that help us win your approval?Mourinho’s invocation of Eusébio was interesting, although probably not in the way he intended. After all, Mourinho spent his early years under the right-wing dictatorship of António de Oliveira Salazar, during which Eusébio, the indisputable star of Portuguese football in the 1960s and 1970s, played an outsized role. For the regime’s advocates, Eusébio’s sporting success and integration into polite Portuguese society was an indicator of the essential benevolence of empire: a colonial exploit run along the lines of the “civilised” and the “indigenous”. As long as you kept your head down, spoke the language, practised Christianity, erased all traces of your African identity, you too could be edified by your contact with European civilisation.At a time when football’s anti-racist impulses have rarely felt more under threat – from the systematic online abuse of players to a men’s World Cup being held under an explicitly white supremacist regime – these questions feel more urgent than ever. Is this a sport genuinely invested in eradicating racism, or one that regards it as no more than an inconvenience, a distraction, a smudge on the business model?Eusébio was tolerated only to the extent that he kept scoring goals and kept his mouth shut. As Vinícius faces his latest gauntlet of lies and bad faith, it’s tempting to wonder whether anything has meaningfully changed.Explore more on these topicsVinícius JúniorJosé MourinhoReal MadridFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Or Google it?Well, that’s the question. It’s just as much effort for you to find the info as it is for them.So they’re just being lazy?They might not think so, but the name jokes that they’re too precious to lift a finger to make a simple search.Where did it come from?Korea, originally – “finger princess” is a direct translation of “ping-peu”.It’s not only women, surely?No, you can also be a “finger prince”.Verymodern.

It must fall on perpetrators and on the companies that enable harm.”The prime minister said that institutional misogyny being “woven into the fabric of our institutions” meant the problem had not been taken seriously enough. “Too often, misogyny is excused, minimised or ignored. The arguments of women are dismissed as exaggerated or ‘one-offs’. That culture creates permission,” Starmer wrote.Government sources said they expected to give the new powers to Ofcom to enforce by the summer and companies will be legally required to remove this content no more than 48 hours after it is flagged to them.View image in fullscreenElon Musk’s Grok AI tool has sparked fury over the creation of sexual images that it facilitates.Photograph: Pablo Vera/AFP/Getty ImagesPlatforms including social media companies and pornography sites that fail to act could face fines of up to 10% of their qualifying worldwide revenue or having their services blocked in the UK.Victims would be able to flag the images either directly with tech firms or with Ofcom – which would trigger an alert across multiple platforms, according to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.Ofcom would be responsible for enforcing the ban on the images, with the aim to remove the onus on victims to need to report the same image potentially thousands of times as it is continually reposted.The media regulator will be told to explore ways for “revenge porn” images to have a digital watermark to allow them to be automatically flagged every time they are reposted.Internet providers will also be given new guidance on how to block hosting for rogue sites who specialise in hosting nonconsensual real or AI-generated explicit content.The Grok “nudification” tool that sparked an outcry in early January saw ministers threaten to banXif it did not act. About 6,000 bikini demands were being made to the chatbot every hour, according to analysis conducted for the Guardian, with many requests made to create images of women bent over or wearing just dental floss.But there has also been a rise in recent years of nonconsensual real or deepfake images being used to blackmail young women and men,which charities have linked to a number of suicides.Starmer said the horror stories of women and girls who saw intimate images spread across the internet was “the type of story that, as a parent, makes your heart drop to your stomach”.“Too often, those victims have been left to fight alone – chasing action site to site, reporting the same material again and again, only to see it reappear elsewhere hours later,” the prime minister said. “That is not justice. It is failure. And it is sending a message to the young people of this country that women and girls are a commodity to be used and shared.”Creating or sharing nonconsensual intimate images will also become a “priority offence” under the Online Safety Act, giving it the same level of seriousness as child abuse images or terrorism. The law does not require platforms to independently identify nonconsensual intimate imagery, but just to remove these images when they are flagged.Google, Meta, X and others already do this for child sexual abuse content through a process called hash matching – which assigns videos a unique digital signature that can be matched against databases of abusive content. And while the 48-hour timeline is brief, India has recentlymandatedthat social media companies remove some deepfake content in three hours.Abusers using AI and digital tech to attack and control women, charity warnsRead more“I think that 48 hours is certainly possible, to be honest with you,” said Anne Craanen, who researches online misogyny at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.“The problem is, it may not necessarily incentivise a quicker response rate from companies. But 48 hours is longer than the timeframe for the removal of other types of content, such as terrorist content in the EU.”Craanen added that there are already existinginitiativesto use hash matching to protect victims of intimate abuse; although it can be challenging getting different tech platforms to coordinate among themselves, so that an abusive video uploaded to Facebook, for example, is automatically detected on Reddit.Hash matching is not a perfect technology, Craanen emphasised, and can be circumvented. Terrorist groups, for example, often add emojis or small alterations to videos already hashed as terrorist content, thus making them unrecognisable to hash matching systems.The advent of AI tools and AI deepfakes will make this problem worse, allowing nonconsensual intimate images and other content to be quickly altered and spread around the internet, Craanen said, evading attempts to quickly detect it with tools such as hash matching. In a moment like the January Grok bikinification crisis, some abuse might be impossible to reign in.While the law appears to apply to all tech platforms, including “rogue websites” that fall outside the reach of the Online Safety Act, there are questions as to how it could apply on encrypted messaging services such asWhatsAppand Signal.In his article, Starmer said he was also determined to challenge misogyny in government and in politics, after several weeks where the prime minister has faced criticism for the appointment of Peter Mandelson as US ambassadordespite knowing about his friendship with the disgraced financierand child sex offender Jeffery Epstein. Mandelson was fired after new revelations about the closeness of their friendship.2:23Mandelson ‘lied repeatedly’ over Epstein links and betrayed Britain, Starmer says – videoThe prime minister is also facing a row over the appointment of a new cabinet secretary, Antonia Romeo,tipped to be the Home Office permanent secretary, who was cleared of bullying allegations nine years ago but remains a divisive figure in the civil service. Some of her defenders have said the criticism of Romeo is based on sexist double-standards.Starmer suggested he wanted to appoint more women to senior leadership roles in government and said he was “determined to transform the culture of government: to challenge the structures that still marginalise women’s voices”.“And it’s why I believe that simply counting how many women hold senior roles is not enough,” he said. “What matters is whether their views carry weight and lead to change.”Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsSocial mediaXInternetGrok AIElon MuskKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

These deaths comprised 56% of violent deaths in Gaza.“The combined evidence suggests that, as of 5 January 2025, 3-4% of the population of the Gaza Strip had been killed violently and there have been a substantial number of non-violent deaths caused indirectly by the conflict,” the authors of the study, a team including an economist, demographer, epidemiologist and survey specialists, wrote in the Lancet Global Health.The exact death toll in Gaza has been bitterly disputed, although last month a senior Israeli security officer told Israeli journalists thatfigures compiled by health authorities in Gaza were broadly accurate, marking a U-turn after years of official attacks on the data.The officer was quoted as saying that about 70,000 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli attacks on the territory since October 2023, excluding those missing.Graph showing estimated cumulative deaths in Gaza as a result of violenceGaza health authorities now say the direct toll from Israeli attacks has exceeded 71,660 people,including more than 570killed since a ceasefire came into effect in October 2025.Researchers who published a study in the Lancet last year estimated the death toll in Gaza during the first nine months of the war given by the Palestinian territory’s health ministry was about 40% lower than their estimate.The new research also suggests that official death toll was a substantial undercount, and by a roughly similar margin. It was based on a survey of 2,000 families in Gaza, carefully selected to be representative of the territory’s population, who were asked to give details of deaths among their members. The survey was run by experienced Palestinian pollsters known for their work inPalestineand elsewhere in the region.“This is a very sensitive survey, and potentially very upsetting [for respondents], so it was important to have Palestinians both asking and answering the questions,” said Michael Spagat, a professor of economics at Royal Holloway, University of London, one of the authors of the peer-reviewed study.Spagat, who has worked on the calculation of casualties of conflicts for more than 20 years, said the new research suggested 8,200 deaths in Gaza from October 2023 to January 2025 were attributable to indirect effects , such as malnutrition or untreated disease. He questioned another study published in the Lancet in 2024 that estimated there would befour “indirect” deaths for every “direct” death.“There is a huge variation depending on the specific circumstances of every conflict. In Kosovo [conflict of 1998-99] almost all the deaths were violent. In somewhere like Darfur, you see something very different. In Gaza, at least initially, there were resources in terms of well-trained doctors and a health system … Also, the territory is very small, so when aid does flow you can reach people,” Spagat said.“I would push back on the notion that this is a small number of deaths. I think we’re experiencing desensitisation effects …. But, yes, it’s much lower than what many people say and believe.”The Hamas raid of October 2023 killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, while 250 were taken hostage by the militant Islamist organisation. Israel launched its retaliatory assault within hours, devastating much of Gaza with airstrikes, tank shelling and artillery bombardment.The study covers the most intense and lethal period of Israel’s offensive, but not the most acuteperiod of the humanitarian crisisin the territory. Famine in Gaza wasdeclared by UN-backed expertsin August last year.The proportion of combatants to non-combatants among those killed in Gaza has also been bitterly disputed. Israeli officials have claimed their attacks killed an almost equal number of each. The new study contradicts this claim.In November, a research team from theMax Planck Institute for Demographic Researchestimated that 78,318 people had been killed in Gaza between 7 October 2023 and 31 December 2024 – almost exactly the same period as the new study. But that research also suggested a much higher number of indirect deaths, which contributed to a reduction of life expectancy in Gaza by 44% in 2023 and by 47% in 2024.Spagat said reaching a definitive figure of those killed in the conflict would take a long time and significant resources. Figures given even in the most recent study published this week have significant margins of error.“It is not a given that there will be a multimillion-pound research project to reconstruct what actually happened. It will be a long time before we get to a full accounting of all the people killed in Gaza, if we ever get there,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

A total of 30 local authorities will now hold elections in May when they had not expected to, with almost a quarter of those in Lancashire.At last year’s county council election, Reform took control of the authority, winning 53 out of 84 seats. Labour was left with just four councillors.The government had said ahead of that election that local polls could be postponed if an authority set to disappear under the reorganisation approached the government, but no such request was put forward by the county council.“I was surprised by the announcement, as previously a precedent was set when Lancashire county council offered to postpone their elections, so it would have been no different,” one senior councillor said. “It will now cost the taxpayer millions of pounds in elections which in most cases will be for a year.”Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Every promise has been broken.”In Pendle, Labour no longer has any councillors after several left the party over its stance on Gaza. David Whipp, the council’s Lib Dem leader, said he feared the latest government climbdown would deepen voters’ “disillusionment and disenfranchisement”.All seven of the Lancashire councils where elections are going ahead are due to be abolished in 2028. They are due to be replaced by bigger authorities – combining 14 councils into between two and five bodies. Ministers are expected to announce the makeup of the new larger authorities in July.Explore more on these topicsLabourLancashireLocal electionsLocal governmentLocal politicsNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the state department gave its official backing to the deal.However, in a post on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, the US president wrote: “Our relationship with the United Kingdom is a strong and powerful one, and it has been for many years, but prime minister Starmer is losing control of this important island by claims of entities never known of before. In our opinion, they are fictitious in nature.”Trump added that if Iran did not make a peace deal with the US, “it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia”, as well as RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, to “eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime – an attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly countries”.“Prime minister Starmer should not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia, by entering a tenuous, at best, 100-year lease,” the US president continued.“This land should not be taken away from the UK and, if it is allowed to be, it will be a blight on our great ally. We will always be ready, willing and able to fight for the UK, but they have to remain strong in the face of wokeism, and other problems put before them.”Last month, the US president had described ceding sovereignty as an “act of great stupidity”.His latest statement comes only a day after the US Department of State said it “supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago”.When asked about Trump’s latest social media post on Wednesday evening, his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: “The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration. It’s coming straight from the horse’s mouth.”The UK’s shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, said Trump had “once again publicly rebuked Keir Starmer and his government over their ill-judged, unnecessary and expensive Chagos surrender. This is an utter humiliation for Starmer.”The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said Trump’s “flip-flopping” on the issue showed why Starmer’s approach was “doomed to fail”.“Britain can’t rely on the US while Trump is in the White House,” he said. “It’s time to strengthen our ties with allies we can depend on, starting with our neighbours in Europe.”A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The deal to secure the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia military is crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe.“The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base.”On Wednesday, British authorities issued removal orders againstfour Chagossians who landed this weekon a remote atoll in the Chagos Archipelago in an attempt to complicate British plans to transfer the territory.The four landed on Monday on Île du Coin, part of the Peros Banhos atoll, with more expected to join them in what would be a permanent settlement.The removal orders seen by Reuters, addressed to them individually, were issued by a British Indian Ocean Territory immigration official and stated they are unlawfully present in the territory and will be removed.It warned that breaching the order by returning would be a criminal offence punishable with up to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of £3,000 ($4,060).The UK’s deal is opposed by some Chagossians, who accuse Mauritius of decades of neglect. Mauritius has denied the accusations.Up to 2,000 Chagossians were forcibly removed from the archipelago in the 1960s and 1970s and resettled mainly in Mauritius and Britain. Many want the right to return to their homeland.The UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination has urged Britain and Mauritius not to ratify the 2025 agreement, saying it risks perpetuating historical rights violations.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rights advocates have raised free speech concerns under Donald Trump’s administration, citing his crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza, and his threats against liberal non-profits and groups opposed to his agenda, including his immigration and climate policies.The Trump administration has accused groups, often without evidence, of funding and organizing political violence. Climate advocates have criticized Trump’s cuts to domestic climate regulations and the US withdrawal from global environmental accords.The environmental group’s global website says it is a “decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly” on the climate emergency.

The husband is a dual national but does not have a British passport and they are now thinking they may have to cut their honeymoon short and return before 25 February or face being stranded.Gabrielle was all set for a routine trip from Australia to the UK. Then the rules for dual citizens suddenly changedRead moreOne man in Canada said he had brought forward his flight to 23 February to make sure he could enter the UK because he wanted to visit his brother who had a brain tumour and was dying.James (whose name has been changed) said: “I didn’t want to miss his birthday on 12 March. It is completely absurd that dual nationals like myself should be ruled ineligible to enter the UK as tourists without an ETA [electronic travel authorisation]. I suppose that you have to have a curious Whitehall mentality to think a British citizen must enter the UK as a British citizen and nothing less.”Another told how his brother had cancelled a trip to his father’s memorial, while several said they would not be able to make it back to the UK to visit sick or dying parents.Forster said: “Whilst they sort out the chaos, the government should allow a grace period, as many dual nationals are in heartbreaking circumstances, unable to visit ill family members or attend weddings and funerals. They must also urgently provide a low-cost, affordable alternative to the current system.”Hundreds of British nationals who do not have a valid UK passport, who have travelled on their second passport without trouble up to now, have complained they could effectively be banned from their own country.One businessman said he had travelled 100 times on his foreign citizenship in and out of the country while all the time raising tax for the British exchequer.The immigration lawyer Sacha Wooldridge said she expected “pragmatism” at border control next week as theHome Officewould “not want to bring Heathrow to a halt”.She said: “Although this has consequences for people travelling in the next weeks and months, I assume the Home Office take the view that proportionally it is not a big problem and they will continue with their mandate to push forward on strengthening the border.”New UK border rules for dual nationals are discriminatory against women, campaigners sayRead moreZeena Luchowa, an immigration lawyer at Laura Devine, said one of the problems was “carrier liability” with airlines risking fines if they let anyone on board without a valid British passport or certificate of entitlement.Earlier on Wednesday,Ryanairsaid it may be able to accept passengers who present out-of-date passports but that the decision would have to be taken by the government first.In a statement, the airline said: “If a dual national claims to be British but cannot present a British passport, Ryanair will need to contact the UK government’s carrier support hub to verify their identity and confirm eligibility to travel – they will decide.”Abta, the trade organisation for tour operators and travel agents in the UK, has also said there should be a grace period. “While the government’s advice for UK citizens is to either get a passport or certificate of entitlement for travel beyond 25 February, it is clear there will need to be a period during which carriers must allow people to board with alternative proof,” said Luke Petherbridge, Abta’s director of public affairs.Petherbridge said there was “considerable confusion and uncertainty around the new rules”, especially for those on holidays in the coming weeks.The Home Office said: “From 25 February 2026, all dual British citizens will need to present either a valid British passport or certificate of entitlement when travelling to the UK. Without one, carriers cannot verify they are a British citizen, which may lead to delays or refused boarding.”The Home Office has been approached for further comment on the “alternative” documentation a British dual national may be able to present to a transport operator next week.Irish British dual nationals are not included in the new rules and can travel in and out of the UK with either passport.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumRyanairAirline industryAir transportHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

You won’t find it at one of the city’s eclectic jazz nights; nor in any of its clubs or live music venues. You’ll find it in the back aisle of a Co-op supermarket on Ecclesall Road.“Anyone noticed how nice the freezers sound in the eccy road co-op?”someone wrote on the Sheffield Reddit page in January. “It’s like all the fans have been carefully tuned to the calmest droning chord ever, it’s like being in an electrical gong bath.”Earlier this week, another Redditor shared a video of the freezers in all their aural glory, later earning a huge second audience when reposted to X. A debate ensued. Was it tuned to C# major? Could you hear the opening of Nothing Compares 2 U somewhere in the electronic hum? “I think it’s developed a slight discordant edge over the last couple of months,”one Reddit user wrote. “It’s ageing like fine wine.”View image in fullscreenTuned to C# major”? … the Ecclesall Road Co-op.Photograph: Alim KherajI was curious, and the Ecclesall Road shop is not too far from where I live. Armed with an iPhone, I went to see if I could capture the sound.Immediately, I was struck by how noisy the supermarket was. Alongside Co-op’s in-store radio, the fridges housing prepacked sandwiches and chilled fruit were giving off a low groan. I wondered if there could be an ambient classic hiding in every appliance, before I remembered the mechanical buzz that my own fridge makes throughout the day. That was not the calming drone I’d heard online.I headed to the back of the shop and to a cluster of three freezers. This was it. The sound they were making was an unbelievable symphonic hum. I stood entranced; it was like listening to an orchestra playing underwater. I whipped out my phone and recorded.Audio recording of the 'symphonic' fridges in a Sheffield supermarketGiven the discussion about the freezers online, I asked staff if they had noticed the noise. One lady behind the till seemed confused and said she hadn’t seen anyone else coming in to soak up the drone. Another staff member, manning the self-checkouts, was also miffed. “We’ve only noticed it today,” he said. “It’s like an orchestra.”There is a long history of musicians utilising found sounds and the noise of industry in their compositions. In the early 20th century, Italian futurist composer Luigi Russolo builtintonarumori– noise generators designed to mimic sounds including cities and transport. Russian composer Arseny Avraamov incorporated the sounds of a flotilla, cannon, locomotives, artillery regiments, sirens, foghorns and a choir in his 1922 composition Symphony of Sirens, the city of Baku becoming his orchestra.Later, in the mid-20th century, composers such as Pierre Schaeffer and Egypt’s Halim El-Dabh developed what became known as musique concrète, a form of composition that used field recordings as instruments. It’s a technique that would evolve into the sampling used in music today, but one many musicians still embrace: in 2018, Nottingham-based label KIKS/GFR releaseda compilation of field recordings of different fridges.View image in fullscreenField recordings as instruments … musique concrète composer Pierre Schaeffer.Photograph: INA/Getty ImagesThe noise of the freezers, however, was far more harmonic. I texted the recording to my boyfriend, an aficionado of ambient and experimental music. “It sounds more like a synthesised human voice,” he said in a voice note. “The obvious reference is Brian Eno’s Ambient 1: Music for Airports. On the second track, it’s all synthesised choral voices and they sound human but also unnervingly nonhuman.”He’s not wrong: there are similarities between Co-op’s freezers and Eno’s 2/1 in their particular haunting qualities. What it reminded me more of, though, was the noise emitted by electric cars; which, depending on the make and model, consist of everything from orchestral samples to recordings of the didgeridoo.But unlike Eno and the electric cars, the noise coming from the freezers, much like the music found in nature, exists without a compositional hand. It’s this, explains Dr Benjamin Tassie, an Ivor Novello-nominated composer based in Sheffield, that draws us to these sounds. “We go around the world blocking out sounds a lot of the time,” he says. “These sounds are unexpected. They jolt us out of ourselves and attune us to the world in a different way. The natural overtone series that exist in something like a drone or the squeak of a door have a harmoniousness to them.”​AI slop, begone! The viral musical virtuosos bringing brains and brilliance back to social mediaRead moreOn my way home, I decided to see if my local Co-op freezers were also musical. To my delight, I could hear a hum – one that, despite visiting the shop many times a week, I had never noticed. I thought of all the times I’d stalked the aisles, headphones jammed in my ears, and the sounds I might have missed.A Co-op spokesperson had this to say: “While we’re unable to confirm whether the freezers are rehearsing for their next orchestral recital, it’s good to hear our shoppers are enjoying the freezer section at Ecclesall Road Co-op.”Given the ongoing discussion online, and the number of posts by people saying they were going to take recording equipment down to the Co-op to capture the drone, the freezer song may well go on to become something bigger. (“Can someone with skills clean this up and make a 10-hour YouTube version?” read one Reddit request.)For me, though, the freezer’s symphony is a poignant reminder to acknowledge the surprising beauty in the world. As Tassie says: “Listening to the world around us as music can reframe and reimagine what it means to listen.” Surely, we could all do with more of that.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockExperimental musicElectronic musicSheffieldfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s utopia at the end of the AI rainbow! A better work-life balance!You may have come across similar articles inFortune magazineand the New York Times. The AI spin brigade is in full force.Business leaders are rhapsodizing about how AI will free their employees to take more time off. Zoom’s Eric Yuan told theTimesthat “A.I. can make all of our lives better, why do we need to work for five days a week? Every company will support three days, four days a week. I think this ultimately frees up everyone’s time.”Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase,saysadvancing technology could push the workweek down to just three and a half days. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates openly wonders whether atwo-dayworkweek could be the future.Elon Muskpushes the ideato the extreme (as he does everything else): “In less than 20 years – but maybe even as little as 10 or 15 years – the advancements in AI and robotics will bring us to the point where working is optional.” Even better: “There will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money,”saysMusk. “There will be universal high income.”All of this is pure rubbish. Even if AI produces big productivity gains – which is still an open question (anMIT studylast year found that “despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, 95% of organizations are getting zero return”) – it’s far from clear that workers will see much, if any, of the benefits.If productivity rises, as it’s supposed to do when the workplace becomes immersed in AI, each worker will generate more value, by definition. And supposedly with more value, we’re all better off.Worker productivity has been rising for years, yet the median wage has barely risen, when adjusted for inflation.Here’s the truth: the four-day workweek will most likely come with four days’ worth of pay. The three-day workweek, with three days’ worth. And so on.So, as AI takes over their current work, most workers will probably get poorer or have to take additional jobs to maintain their current pay.In his 1930 essayEconomic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,the great British economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that in a century, “the discovery of means of economizing the use of labour” would outpace our ability to “find new uses for labor”. In other words, less work.Keynes was sure that by 2030 the “standard of life” in Europe and the United States would be so improved by technology that no one would worry about making money. Productivity gains would create an age of abundance.In fact, by 2030, he predicted, our biggest problem would be how to use all our leisure time:“For the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem – how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.”We’re still five years away from Keynes’s magic year, but at the rate we’re going, his prediction seems wildly wrong.Rather than creating an age of abundance in which most people no longer have to worry about money, new technologies have contributed to a two-tiered society comprising a few with extraordinary wealth and a vast number of people barely making it.AI is likely to further widen inequality.Imagine a small box – call it an iEverything – capable of producing for you everything you could possibly desire. It’s a modern-day Aladdin’s lamp. You simply tell it what you want and – presto! –the item or service suddenly appears.Sounds wonderful until you realize that no one will be able to buy the iEverything because no one will have any means of earning money, since the iEverything will do everything.This is obviously fanciful, but the dilemma is very real. Productivity gains are great, but the too-little-discussed question is how they will be distributed.The distribution issue can’t be ignored. When more can be done by fewer people, who gets paid what? It comes down to who has the power.Unless workers have the power to demand a share in the productivity gains, profits will go to an ever-smaller circle of owners – leaving the rest of us with less money to buy what can be produced.If the five-day workweek with five days of pay shrinks to four days with four days of pay, and then to three, and to two, and perhaps one, AI will supplant most people’s work and drive down our take-home pay. We may see a dazzling array of products and services spawned by AI, but few of us will be able to buy them.But this isn’t necessarily our fate. If AI does deliver big productivity gains, how can average working people get a share of those gains? They can get a share if they have the bargaining power to get it.It seems doubtful that labor unions will provide that power. Forty years ago, over a third of the private-sector workforce was unionized. Now, it’s only 6% – not much power there.Which leaves politics. Will average working people gain the political muscle to demand a share of AI’s productivity gains?That depends on whether one of our two dominant political parties will demand and enact laws that distribute those gains more fairly (think wealth taxes financing childcare, elder care, and healthcare, for example).If not, maybe a third party emerges – a workers’ party – dedicated to this?In the meantime, don’t fall for the breathless rubbish about AI allowing employers to “free up” employees’ time.The real question is whether AI’s productivity gains, if it delivers, are shared with workers. And the truth is employers won’t share those gains unless they’re forced to.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Have you been “brutally frame-mogged” lately? If you’ve been finding this kind of online discourse even more impenetrable than usual, a 20-year-old content creator calling himself Clavicular is probably to blame.Born Braden Peters, Clavicular is a manosphere-adjacent influencer who has recently broken containment for a string of high-profile controversies, including livestreaming himself apparently running over a pedestrian with his Tesla Cybertruck and being filmed chanting the lyrics toKanye West’s Heil Hitlerin a nightclub with the self-styled “misogynist influencer”Andrew Tateand the white nationalist commentatorNick Fuentes.Before taking up with what some feel are among the worst men alive, Clavicular was known only as a “looksmaxxer”, a young man intent on optimising his physical attractiveness by frequently extreme measures (such as steroids, surgery and, er, taking a hammer to his jaw).Yet Clavicular’s gonzo live streams and absurd lingo have seen him escape his subcultural silo, landing him a modelling gig at New York fashion week and aprofile in the New York Times.So where has he come from? And what does his rise mean for humanity?1. He’s the internet’s most famous ‘looksmaxxer’Peters came to prominence last year on the streaming platform Kick (like Twitch, but more laissez-faire with content moderation), where he nowhas nearly 180,000 followers. That’s dwarfed by his audience on TikTok which, at time of writing, ismore than 760,000.Clavicular’s niche is looksmaxxing, a practice of physical self-optimisation increasingly popular among young men. (His screen name refers to the collarbone, which is prized within that online community.) Having achieved a disquieting transformation himself, Peters first gained a following for posting about the process behind his hard-won face and physique, and the rewards he has allegedly reaped with women.For a fee, Peters will also coach individuals on how to “ascend”, as he puts it, and become more handsome themselves, though lately his focus has shifted from looksmaxxing-specific content to streaming great stretches of his day-to-day life. Peters earned more than $100,000 (£74,000) from Kick last month alone; his most recent upload to the platform is more than nine hours long.2. There’s very little he won’t do to look good …Peters is notorious for the extreme lengths by which he claims to have achieved his chiselled appearance. By his own account,he is infertileas a result of years of steroid abuse, and uses methamphetamine to suppress his appetite. “It’s really not as bad as people think,” he told another Kick streamerlast October.According to the New York Times, Peters began looksmaxxing at 14, ordering testosterone and fat dissolvers on the internet and refining his vision by altering pictures of himself using Photoshop. His parents gave up trying to intervene, he said, when they realised “there was nothing that they could do to stop my ascension”.He was subsequently expelled from college for possessing testosterone. These days, Peters’ goals extend to double jaw surgery. For greater facial harmony on a budget, he has endorsed smashing facial bones with a hammer – or, if you are really in “hardmaxxing” mode, your fist. “Bone smashing is legit,” Peters said in December, in conversation with the popular conservative podcaster Michael Knowles. It should go without saying thatmedical experts strongly advise against this.3. … but it’s an ugly businessHaving begun with “incels”, self-described “involuntary celibates” who see conventional attractiveness as a claim on women, looksmaxxing is considered a subculture within the online manosphere, defined by its hostility to feminism and belief in male supremacy.In its pseudoscientific calculations and striving towards a physical ideal based in whiteness, looksmaxxing has also beencriticised forreviving “eugenic beauty standards”. Peters has dismissed these accusations of racism as “dumb”, and defended his repeated use of the N-word as “not a racist thing”.A Rolling Stone writerwho paid to access Clavicular’s online academy reported finding a “godly colouring” routine for non-white looksmaxxers who got the “short end of the phenotype stick”. In the advice on translating physical attractiveness into sexual success, meanwhile, women are referred to as “targets”, “slayables” or “foids” (“female humanoids”), while followers (the “Clan”) are advised to “inch closer until your erection is her problem” or “guide her hand”.Asked to comment on whether these techniques constituted sexual coercion, Peters responded: “Who the fuck is rolling stone magazine LOL”.4. He ‘hates politics’, but is buddies with Andrew TatePeters claims to be apolitical, stating that he will endorse whichever party gives him “the fattest bag”. That’s not to say he doesn’t have opinions.On the political commentator Michael Knowles’s podcast, Clavicular said he would vote for Democrat Gavin Newsom over US vice-president JD Vance because the latter was ugly, or “subhuman”, with a “recessed side profile”. (In the same interview, Peters described actor Sydney Sweeney as “malformed” with “eyes of doom.”)While some have described Peters’ worldview as standard incel nihilism, he doesn’t seem all that invested in the aims of the manosphere. Peters’ affiliation with Tate, the “misogynistic influencer” accused of sex trafficking (who denies wrongdoing), and Fuentes, an avowed white nationalist, seems motivated by a shared love of shock value and online infamy rather than a mutual or coherent ideology. On the viral video showing Peters with Fuentes, Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan Tate, chanting along to Heil Hitler in a Miami nightclub, Peters defended it as “just a song”.5. The vernacular is keyClavicular’s ridiculousness can make it hard to take him seriously – with his malign influence masked by his idiosyncratic argot.Working on your personality, for example, is derided by Peters and his followers as “jestermaxxing”. If you “mog” someone, you are better looking than they are. If you “frame-mog” someone, your shoulders are superior to theirs. If you are “slaymaxxing”, you are having sex.Like the ubiquitous 67 meme, the lingo is deliberately obscure to exclude “normies”, but it has increasingly beencatching on, even in spheres that you’d really rather were more discerning. Last month, the US government’s Department of Wartweeted: “Low cortisol. Locked in. Lethalitymaxxing.”6. He’s courting controversy with all the subtlety of a CybertruckClavicular’s profile has been boosted by a string of recent controversies, most originating from his own streams. In November,he broadcast himselfseemingly injecting his then 17-year-old girlfriend with fat-dissolving peptides, calling himself “Dr Clav”.The following month, he appeared to strike a pedestrian with his Tesla Cybertruck. “Is he dead? … Hopefully,” Peters said to his passenger. He later claimed that the man had been stalking him, and that he had been acting in self-defence. Peters has said he is a target for other content creators who want to piggyback off his profile by provoking him in public; others have suggested the incident was staged. It has proved difficult to verify independently.Certainly, all attention is good attention, per the Clavicular worldview, and it has proved difficult to substantiate his controversies or even pin them on him.It bears emphasising that Clavicular is not yet a celebrity, or even straightforwardly aspirational. He has evenexpressed doubts about his path, describing his life as a “fucking horror story” and expressing regrets about being expelled from college. “I wish I had that experience … I will never get to live the normal life, of a normal kid – so I’m going to try to mog.”Explore more on these topicsMenInternetSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The second time, he missed a right-of-way sign and was struck by a car at a junction. The third time, ice sent him skidding off the road and into two trees. Crashes four to eight, he said, were bumper-scratches in traffic too minor to mention.That Mîndruță escaped those collisions with his life – and without having taken anyone else’s – is not a given inRomania. Home to the deadliest roads in the EU, its poor infrastructure, weak law enforcement and aggressive driving culture led to 78 people per million dying in traffic in 2024. Almost half of the 1,500 annual fatalities are vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve learned the hard way,’ says Lucian Mîndruță, a Romanian journalist and radio host.Photograph: Ajit Niranjan/The Guardian“I was not careful enough, driving slowly enough, or really aware enough,” said Mîndruță, a journalist and radio host in Bucharest, whose last serious crash was 20 years ago. “I’ve learned the hard way.”Cars are the biggest killer of children and young adults worldwide but efforts to save lives have struggled to attract public or political attention. Even inEurope, where fatality rates are low by global standards, five times more people are killed in car crashes than murdered. The EU is on track to miss its target of halving road deaths by 2030.As public frustration with dangerous driving has mounted, the Romanian government has taken its first serious steps to make roads safer. Last year, it defined aggressive behaviour – such as tailgating and intimidating other drivers – in law and increased penalties for dangerous driving. A network of speed cameras is being introduced alongside a system to automatically detect traffic violations.“Things are moving,” said Alexandru Ciuncan, the president of the Coalition for Road Safety (RSC), a group campaigning for road safety in Romania. “Not with the speed that we want, but we’re glad that something is happening now.”There are signs of progress. The death rate on Romania’s roads fell slightly in 2024 to an average of four people a day, with a further nine people a day seriously injured. New police data shows the downward trend continued in 2025, with deaths falling by 13% and serious injuries by 4%.View image in fullscreenTraffic is responsible for 60% of air pollution in Romania’s capital, according to the Environmental Platform for Bucharest.Photograph: Ioana Epure/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesYet structural change remains elusive. In October, the European Commission sent Romania a letter of notice to properly implement its road safety directive. Campaigners complain of a pervasive “selfish” driving culture and fear changing mindsets will take more than a decade. In May, the country held its first road safety awareness week.In the jam-packed, rush-hour traffic that fills the smoggy streets of Bucharest – the second-most polluted capital in the EU, according to the European Environment Agency – an ageing car fleet often running on diesel fuel compounds the health risks from reckless driving.Traffic is responsible for 60% of the city’s air pollution, according to the Environmental Platform for Bucharest, and the prevalence of old imported cars, with dirty exhaust pipes and few safety features, increases the death toll from both smog and crashes.Raul Cazan, the president of 2Celsius, an environmental nonprofit, said imported “clunkers” often suffered from wear and tear, and lacked modern safety features such as electronic stability control and advanced airbags.“You’re not only importing pollution from the west,” he said. “You’re also importing danger.”View image in fullscreenCars pass the Victoria Palace government building in Bucharest. In the past year, the Romanian government has taken its first serious steps to make the country’s roads safer.Photograph: Ioana Epure/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesEurope’s roads have grown safer over decades but progress has stalled in recent years, and the SUV boom threatens to reverse progress. The average bonnet height in new car sales in 2024 rose from 77cm (30in) in 2010 to 84cm (33in), with associated dangers for vulnerable road users.In Romania, a major manufacturer of parts for the German automobile industry, SUVs make up about half of the new cars registered, and dominate online listings for used cars. The influx will lead to a more modern vehicle fleet but the vehicles’ extra mass and their drivers’ reduced vision is likely to undermine the benefits.“All other things being equal, ever-bigger cars reduce safety for all other road users,” said James Nix from Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based nonprofit. “Increasing width is likely to bring more sideswipe crashes. Higher bonnets impair vision and increase injury severity in the overwhelming majority of collisions.”Analysis of police data by the RSC found speeding was the biggest cause of deaths in 2024 and “pedestrian indiscipline” – such as jaywalking – the main factor listed in serious injuries. In the countryside in particular, a lack of safe crossings and pavements contributes to rural areas having double the fatality rate of urban areas. Almost half of deaths happen on high-speed national roads that cut through communities.Mîndruță, an amateur cyclist who has lost friends to car crashes, said driving in other countries made him realise how rewarding it was to drive with care for his own safety and that of others.Being an individualist on the road was really not good for your health or your soul, he said, looking back at the collisions in which he was involved. “Killing somebody else would have been a nightmare.”Explore more on these topicsRomaniaRoad safetyAir pollutionRoad transportPollutionEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We are still processing our thoughts in a group chat. We agreed that the visuals were often delightfully shocking. We talked about the contrasts between the lavish costumes and the moor landscape, which we thought Fennell got right. We talked about the Charlie XCX music and how well it evoked the landscape and the spirit of the book.We were entertained by the sex scenes and agreed Brontë would have written some if she had written in a different time … but Fennell failed to develop the emotional longing and connection. It was reduced to something silly instead. We lamented that Fennell turned Nellie (our beloved unreliable narrator) into a conniving villain, and the film seemed to miss the supernatural elements of the book – if Fennell wanted to shock us, she could have shown that scene in which Heathcliff digs up Cathy’s body!While we appreciated that Fennell conflated the characters of Heathcliff and Hareton [Earnshaw] to make him more sympathetic, we thought she forgot what she was doing when she swung into his awfulness – no consistency. However, it was brilliant to combine Earnshaw and Hindley’s characters. That made sense. We will certainly be discussing it for weeks to come.Sarah Campbell, 46, Denver, Colorado‘The book’s characters aren’t likable, and Fennell kept that essence’UK audiences swoon over Wuthering Heights as film takes £7.7m over Valentine’s weekendRead moreWhen I heard there was a film ofWuthering Heights– starring Margot Robbie, no less! – I knew I had to read the book. As English is not my mother language, I struggled with the interventions by Joseph, as Brontë transliterated his speech. I had to read it aloud to understand what he was saying (and I live in Yorkshire!). The movie was marketed as the “biggest love story”, but Emily’s story was more about obsession and vengeance.I was pleasantly surprised by the film. I don’t think that any of the book characters are likable, and Fennell kept that essence. Also, most of the book was narrated in Nelly’s view, and she is an unreliable narrator. This is not represented in the movie, probably as it wouldn’t make sense given the changes in the plot. I saw it on release night and the cinema room was full, something not seen many times these days – so I do believe that despite some valid critiques, the movie is a good watch.Júlia Fachinetti, 25, SheffieldView image in fullscreen‘The ridiculous costumes took away from the intensity of the characters’: Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff and Margot Robbie as Catherine:Photograph: Warner Bros Ent All Rights Reserved/PA‘A 21st-century spotlight all over it’I’m a fan of 19th-century gothic literature and Kate Bush. However, I have tried and failed to readWuthering Heightstwice. The dense language and long, dark paragraphs left me cold. I may try again though, after seeing the film. I found it to be almost completely absorbing. “Almost”, because the ridiculous costumes and set pieces completely took away from the intensity of the characters, story and locations – these people and places are steeped in passion and drama, there was no need to fluff them for a willing audience! I think it could have been perfectly dark, bleak and moving, if only Fennell hadn’t decided to shine a 21st-century spotlight all over it.Rachel Mountney, 48, Ireland‘Anyone who thinks it’s a love story is out of their mind’‘It’s not a documentary’: costume designers on ditching accuracy for spectacleRead moreI previously avoided Wuthering Heights because of its reputation for being complicated. When I heardEmerald Fennellwas adapting it, though, I decided to pick it up. I think everyone else had the same idea, because the secondhand bookshop was baffled at having suddenly sold all its copies. My book club decided to read it as well, and had its biggest turnout yet.I was delighted by how dark the book was. It felt so modern in its depiction of unfettered rage and the unabashed use of blood and violence. I had to pause every now and then to orientate myself, because the narrative-within-a-narrative can be jarring, but it was a lot of fun. Anyone who thinks it’s a love story is out of their mind. It’s about traumatised people who all hate each other and think obsession is romance. It’s brilliant.Before seeing the film, I was totally prepared to call all the naysayers snobs, but I thought it was pretty poor. There was no chemistry between Cathy and Heathcliff, and I became bored by all the shagging and the violins. Some bits were darkly funny – Isabella’s [Linton] intro, for example – and I enjoyed the surrealism, but it had no consistency. Heathcliff’s personality was toothless. And why was Wuthering Heights (the house) built in Mordor?Cassidy Ellis Salter, 34, London‘I think Fennell was a bit scared to go fully feral’Emerald Fennell is a visceral director. If you go to see the movie as a “gothic romance”, then you’ll be able to enjoy it. But as an English literature nerd and teacher, I hate that people will come out of it thinking they have seen Wuthering Heights! Maybe just a horny gothic story would have been enough, without calling it that.To be fair, the idea that the film is a teenager’s version of the book is done well – Cathy’s over the top dramatics, the sexy montage – that’s pure, juvenile fan fiction. It’s interesting, too, that Heathcliff is at times presented as an aside rather than a true main character. I don’t think Fennell went as hard as she could have in showing their obsession with each other. As for the smut factor, that was purely designed for the BookTok girlies – and, to be honest, I think the director could have gone further! I think she was a bit scared almost to go fully feral. The visuals that alluded to sex were clever, though.I enjoyed the film, but people who now go and read the book will be disappointed; Isabella’s character wasn’t given enough and Linton was too nice. The soundtrack was fabulous – probably the best thing about it really. The teacher in me thinks if it does encourage someone to read the book, then that’s a win. Just as long as people realise that this version is a reinterpretation, or reimagining.Melanie Downs, Toowoomba, Australia‘Too much emphasis on costumes and unsubtle symbolism’I first read Wuthering Heights as a teenager in the 80s. I always said it was my favourite book. I’m not sure I totally understood it, but the idea of doomed lovers out on the harsh moors was compelling to my adolescent, hormonal self. The characters all had a place and told their own stories. Kate Bush raised the interest further: all British girls wanted to be Cathy, yearning for their own version of Heathcliff, after Kate’s theatrical performance on Top of the Pops.I’m yet to get over the disappointment of the movie. Too much emphasis on costumes and unsubtle symbolism. The opening scene at the hanging was good, and Martin Clunes was excellent. But I was bored by the film and Margot Robbie’s distractingly lavish costume changes. She was too “Hollywood” for the role. I had to leave 10 minutes early to avoid a parking ticket and missing the end didn’t bother me.Richelle Buckingham, 58, NewcastleView image in fullscreenMargot Robbie as Cathy and Shazad Latif as Edgar in a scene from Wuthering Heights.Photograph: AP‘I don’t think there was a thriving BDSM scene in Haworth back then’It’s at least 20 years since I last read Wuthering Heights, but the film’s omissions have prompted me to reread it. The book is torrid, twisted and tangled. It’s fascinating how Catherine and Heathcliff’s relationship is tender initially, but begins to warp following Catherine’s stay at Thrushcross Grange, finally becoming passionately cruel after Heathcliff’s return.The film was a different beast. Conflating some characters and events was an interesting choice. The childhood actors almost overshadow the adult leads. You could say the S&M element of the film is suggested in the book: the central relationship is a pursuit of the pain, rather than the pleasure – although I don’t think there was a thriving BDSM scene in Haworth back then. But Isabella’s fireside scene was definitely artistic licentiousness.Jacob Elordi caught Heathcliff’s brooding quality perfectly. But a blond Catherine? Heresy! That said, Margot Robbie does a decent job. There were times I felt I was watching a series of music videos, rather than a coherent narrative, which perhaps reflects the messiness of the central relationship. I don’t doubt the film reflects the director’s vision, but it rang a little hollow to me.Gerard O’Doherty, 62, Clevedon, North SomersetExplore more on these topicsWuthering HeightsEmily BrontëEmerald FennellMargot RobbieJacob ElordifeaturesShareReuse this content"

But no sooner had it become the main rubric for discussing both the far left and far right than commentators began to question its validity: worrying that it wastoo vague, or toopejorative, orfuellingthe forces to which it referred.Now, with the fortunes of the two political poles heading in different directions – the right gaining ground across the west while much of the left struggles to rebound from serial defeats – the notion that this word could encompass such different players seems even less plausible. For a lucid account of these forces, we might have to shift our focus elsewhere: finding terms that can explain their unequal balance of power, so that we can in turn find the proper remedy.The difficulty of separating the real nature of populism from the fraught discourse that surrounds it is telling, because among the only confident claims we can make about the populist phenomenon is that it places an enormous stress on language. Indelible slogans, silver-tongued leaders, a direct address to “the people”: these were common elements in the otherwise disparate range of electoral projects that surged after the great recession of 2007-2009, rejecting bromides about “unity” and “consensus” for the hard semantic distinction between “us” and “them”.For all the problems with the populist label, it was at least able to capture this highly rhetorical mode of politics, which took root at a time when most political expression was confined to the realm of words rather than deeds: Twitter (now X) fulminations and dinner-table rows as opposed to strikes and street fights. If populism was to some extent an empty signifier, it reflected a political culture that had been emptied out – with the decline of mass parties, trade unions and other voluntary associations leaving few channels for activism. The erosion of these structures forced outsider politicians to find other means to advance. Rather than building such popular bases, they relied on soundbites to monopolise the attention economy and turn out disenchanted voters.But while “populism” was a useful summation of these electoral strategies, it was less able to delineate what such leaders hoped to do once they were in government. In the US, for example,Bernie Sanderswas clear that his aim as president would be to harness the state to reactivate the labour movement and disempower the corporate sector. The cabal around Donald Trump also has a considered plan to reorient state policy by centralising authority in the executive and weaponising it against racialised groups. Although populism may have been the means, the ends were more extensive. By thinking of Sanders and Trump solely in terms of their campaign methods, commentators sidestepped a more thorough analysis of their governing projects: radical social democracy or hardline neo-nationalism.Over the past decade, one of these projects has continued to accrue power – not only in the US, but also in Italy, Finland, Slovakia, Hungary, Britain, France and elsewhere – while the other has mostly been marginalised. It turned out that when the left and right battled on the terrain of discourse, with politics often reduced to a series of sales pitches, the odds were in favour of the right, not least because a partisan media was willing to diffuse its message. The upshot is that Sanders’s social democracy remains merely an idea, while Trumpian neo-nationalism is increasingly a reality.Given this development, the limits of the populist paradigm have become even more clear. The primary feature of our politics is no longer underdog candidates using this toolkit to capture the state; it is the left trying to reconstitute itself after the failure of that enterprise, while much of the right consolidates its success. Socialists have realised that populism, as a political practice, is not strong enough to resist an onslaught from the most powerful institutions in society: state ministries, centrist parties, legacy papers, the business lobby, the courts. Reactionaries, meanwhile, have learned that they can win elections on a populist platform, but they are still working out exactly what relationship to cultivate with these institutions. Post-populists on both sides are defined by how they approach such fortresses of the elite: not only in their rhetoric, but in their actions.Here the options are twofold. They can either compromise at risk of being assimilated, or mount a direct challenge at risk of being overwhelmed. In Spain, the current leader of the left, Yolanda Díaz, has taken the first path: trying to strike deals with the centre left and big business, yet repeatedly realising thelimits of her leverage. In France, by contrast, Jean-Luc Mélenchon has preserved his party’s political independence andrefusedto make any concessions that would threaten it, but this has so far left him tooisolatedto outpace his opponents.We can see a similar bifurcation out at the other end of the spectrum. Whereas leaders such as Italy’s Giorgia Meloni have pursued rapprochement with the traditional power bloc,backtrackingon their riskier policies, ones including Trump have adopted a more pugnacious strategy:assailingthe state bureaucracy,ignoringthe judiciary and oftenoverridingthe demands of business. Both left and right must decide between bargaining with traditional elites or attempting to bulldoze them.Once again, though, the odds are highly uneven. Just as the right finds it easier to win elections through populist messaging, it is also more able to navigate this choice between conciliation and confrontation. The reason is obvious. Socialists have a programme that would upend the present social order, while neo-nationalists are concerned with entrenching its hierarchies. One group wants to destroy the neoliberal consensus, the other to deepen its asymmetries of class, race and gender. The institutions that superintend this system will therefore put up greater resistance to the left than to the right. They may block some of the latter’s most destabilising actions – such as trying to steal elections – but they understand that there is no fundamental misalignment of their interests. So regardless of whether neo-nationalists are more peaceable or aggressive, gradualist or accelerationist, they can use these power centres to drive their project forward: a luxury that progressives lack.“Populism” cannot illuminate these trends – not just because the term is too broad or loaded, but because it was more relevant to a specific period in which upstarts tried to break the electoral dominance of the centre by using various language games: the many against the few, insiders against outsiders. While these discourses haven’t gone away, their importance is diminished in a world where that dominance has now been shattered, and where the contest between left and right populism has been decided in favour of the right. A better approach to our present moment would be to study how both forces are trying, from very different starting points, to make their way in the institutional landscape of neoliberalism: the left seemingly thwarted whether it chooses compromise or conflict, the right able to march onward by either means. It will be extraordinarily difficult to overturn this situation. We must start by grasping the substance of contemporary politics, not simply its style.Oliver Eagleton is managing editor at Phenomenal WorldExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionDonald TrumpGiorgia MelonicommentShareReuse this content"

Still, there is fun in seeing the world as it wasWed 18 Feb 2026 11.05 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 15.30 ESTShareThere’s a funny moment towards the end ofThe Tony Blair Story, Channel 4’s three-part documentary about the former prime minister, in which Blair is asked to introspect about his own personality. For the previous three hours or so we have enjoyed a series of talking heads picking over his premiership. Now he breaks the fourth wall and, with something like incredulity, says what’s the point of asking him to identify his own weaknesses when all he’ll give is a “politician’s answer”. Reminded he’s no longer a politician, Blair replies as honestly as at any point in the encounter: “You’re always a politician.”It is one of the more satisfying exchanges in Michael Waldman’s series, which, depending on your view, is either a futile exercise in confirming one’s existing prejudices about Blair, or more than three hours of great telly. I’m inclined towards the latter, partly for the enjoyment it offers of being yanked back to the memory of all those old horribles. Nothing dates quicker than an out of office politician and it’s a particular nostalgia that’s triggered by footage of Robin Cook at John Smith’s funeral, or Max Hastings describing Blair’s henchmen as “absolutely ruthless bastards”, or Jack Straw being interviewed in a black velvet jacket like something from Death on the Nile.View image in fullscreenTony Blair addresses the nation for the first time as prime minister alongside his wife Cherie.Photograph: PA/AlamyAnd if there’s nothing new to discover, the remembrance of old battles still satisfies. I was amused by Jonathan Powell’s recollection of Mo Mowlam telling him, in relation to Blair’s success in Northern Ireland, that “Tony succeeded because he thought he was fucking Jesus.” After Kosovo, says Robert Harris, Blair “thought he could walk on water” – diagnosing Blair’s Jesus complex runs like a motif through the show. So, too, does the accusation that Blair’s EQ always outstripped his IQ, often made by people who may themselves not be the brains of Britain. Here’s Jeremy Corbyn, look, whose assessment of Blair as “a man in denial” – not an unfair judgment – would be more authoritative if it didn’t come from someone so apparently incapable of internalising lessons from his own clanging defeats. Blair, he says, got himself into a “messianic trench” over Iraq, which is certainly a trench I’d like to see.View image in fullscreenTony Blair, John Prescott and Gordon Brown at Labour party conference in Blackpool, 1998.Photograph: Don McPhee/The GuardianIf Waldman doesn’t relitigate Iraq in any meaningful way, that leaves the voyeuristic family stuff. Look at baby Leo, now a strapping 25-year-old, and two of his three siblings, Kathryn and Euan, saying sensible things about their dad. Cherie comes across as a real force, talking with a don’t-give-a-monkeys-any-more honesty. Asked whether she felt sorry forGordon Brownwhen Blair snatched the leadership, she looks frankly astounded, as well she might. Cherie, per her own account, pushed her husband to get behind a different successor when Brown’s turn finally came around, underscoring a persistent unwillingness on the part of observers to process the vicious reality of political rivalry.Similarly delusional on the part of Blair’s critics: the perennial question of money, about which this country remains wilfully babyish, affecting to be shocked – shocked! – that someone with the ambition for high office might be interested in spending more than 300 quid on a suit or making more money than an entry level banker. (See Jacinda Ardern’s current presence on the world’s speaker circuit, and who can blame her.)Other stuff: Bill Clinton clearly sympathetic to Blair’s divided loyalties between the US and Europe in the run-up to Iraq, and choosing his words very carefully. Pushed on whether he thinks Blair made a mistake going to war, Clinton concedes of his old friend that “he was in a pickle”. Blair, meanwhile, presents his decision to support George W Bush not as poodledom, but pragmatism. Britain, he implies, is a small country with a middle-sized economy deluded about its own place in the world; of course he threw in his lot with the US.View image in fullscreenTony Blair and Bill Clinton at a Nato summit in Paris in May 1997.Photograph: Charles Platiau/ReutersThe irony of this assessment is that, of course, the thing Blair ends up being most credibly accused of is his own delusional overreach. Possibly that delusion persists. Prodded by Waldman, Blair avers that, in his role as head of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, he may have more power now than he did as prime minister. That he hasbeen announced, alongside Jared Kushner, as part of the transitional authority to oversee post-conflict Gaza makes one think: “Hasn’t the region suffered enough?”And so it wasn’t for Blair himself that I came away feeling nostalgic; shots of theGallagher brothers at Downing Streetin the late 90s remain embarrassing. I did, however, feel nostalgic for an era of political optimism that is impossible to find anywhere today; an era during which the country’s spirits matched the energy of a leader habitually captured by cameras boarding a plane by sprinting up the stairs at full speed.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTony BlairOpinionTelevisionLabourGordon BrowncommentShareReuse this content"

But it made me question all my choicesWed 18 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 06.09 ESTShareAdoctor has gone viral – which sounds like the beginning of a dad joke, but isn’t – with a hack for getting back to sleep if you wake at 3am. Cognitive shuffling is apparently the remedy for a spinning mind in the middle of the night. “Work, money, kids, planning, scheduling, problem solving. Your brain is too active to let you sleep – in fact the stress of all these thoughts tells the brain that it’s not safe to sleep, you have to stay on high alert,” says Bradford GP Amir Khan.Cognitive shuffling interrupts this process, and invites your brain to go into sleep mode. Khan says to do it, choose a random word – like “bed”, or “dream” – then think of objects starting with each letter of it, while picturing them in your head. “Bed begins with b, so maybe bat, binoculars, baseball, banana,” he adds, helpfully, “Once I’ve exhausted the letter b I move on to e – emu, elephant, eyes. And so on.”Great. Apart from when I happened to mention to my husband that I planned to try cognitive shuffling. We had such a row over suitable starting words, we were awake long past 3am. Without being dramatic, his suggestion made me wonder if I’d married the right person.The stipulation was something neutral you have no emotional connection to. The examples supplied were “bed” and “dream”. You can clearly see where Dr Khan was going with this, so my word was cloud, and I have to admit, I was pretty happy with that. My husband’s word? Mound.Obviously he fell at the first hurdle – spot the odd one out: bed, dream, cloud, MOUND. But it’s more than a genre issue. This is what’s going on in his head. Mound.Imagine discovering this when you have already procreated with the person. Mound is less a word, more a noise, like bleurgh or ugh. It’s a state of mind. A mound mind. Have you met my husband? Forget your Tech Bros and Finance Guys – he’s a Mound Man.Thanks, Dr Khan.

Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves were honest about what they found.So what on earth can have seized them, within months of taking over, to decide this was a good time for a gigantic English council re-disorganisation? Angela Rayner, who was in charge of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government at the time,kicked it offin December 2024. But why, when councils are near-bankrupt and crippled by the ballooning costs of social care and provision for children withspecial educational needs and disabilities?Steve Reed,the local government secretary,boasted to council leadersthis week that it will “deliver the most ambitious reforms of local government in a generation”. But what for? Local government reform wasn’t in the manifesto. Until it was legally challenged – because the reorganisation would have delayed local elections in 30 places in England–it barely featured on the political horizon because it had no political purpose. Few peopleknow much about what responsibilities fall to different layers of local authority and national government – which is why mayors are a good idea, putting an identifiable person in charge. Few peoplebother to vote: average council election turnout in 2024 was30.8%, not much changed over recent decades. There was scant political mileage in this, butgreat organisational risk.The shake-up merges districts into county councils, creating unitary authorities in some areas, with neighbouring councils merging in others. Given the country’s present cynical anti-politics state of mind, voters might suspect this is some kind of crafty gerrymander that will favour Labour. Not at all. On the contrary, scores of towns and cities with a distinct political identity, many with universities, which usually vote Labour, Liberal Democrat or Green, will be swallowed up into large surrounding counties that traditionally vote blue. Oxford, Cambridge, Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter, Reading and many more will disappear as civic entities, losing their identities as they are melded into counties of opposing politics. No wonder neither theTories nor Reform put up objections to the plan itself.Voters like councillors more than MPs – so why is Labour wasting time destroying local democracy? | Polly ToynbeeRead moreHow did this happen? The suspicion is that the idea came from another of those dusty files sitting around on civil service shelves and wasbrought forward to an innocent new government as a fresh idea temptingly promising “efficiency” and “savings”. The NHS goes through such a process with almost every new health minister – just look what George Osborne was sold by the Treasury in his earlyomnishambles budget of “good ideas”, such as the pasty and the static caravan tax.Bigger can always be made to sound more effective, but there is rarely good evidence for that. Most organisations can be presented as untidy, but tidying them up usually makes things worse. The vast cost of the reorganisation itself is rarely computed, including the time wasted for hundreds of thousands of employees as they areforced to reapply for old jobs under new brass plates.Goodness knows what evidence Rayner and the rest were shown to persuade them to create this huge turbulence. There is no evidence that unitary councils do any better than areas with both district and county councils, according to Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics. He tells me: “There’s no evidence that Hampshire, with its district councils, is better or worse governed than, say, Buckinghamshire or other unitaries.”The House of Commons libraryresearch is also inconclusive: “It is not clear from available evidence whether unitary councils save money compared with a two-tier system,” says Travers.Perhaps what tempted Labour was a chance to pander to anti-politician public sentiment. Rayner’s original white paper laying out the proposal in 2024 boasted that it will mean “fewer [local] politicians”. That is a blunder that runs against the spirit ofdevolution, localism and reviving neighbourhoods. In a fragile democracy in which so few participate, withbarely 2% of the electoratebelonging to one of the three main parties, the valiant foot-soldiers of democracy are those willing to be councillors or to run local parties and create the actions that bind local communities together. MPs rely on their councillors, and their local parties all but collapse when they lose too many of them.The government’s newPride in Placestrategy will rely on councillors. But this council plan, as it boasts, means there will be many fewer. Travers says we alreadyhave many fewer elected representatives than most similar countries and our councillors have been vanishing fast, “from 75,000 in 1965, to only 11,000 that will be left after this”. Each councillor will be under far greater pressure, withfewer of them to represent larger councils ofhalf a million people. Reed has been boasting about a figure of 5,000 fewer councillors than there are currently, but he ignores the fact that people tend to like them. Polls reaching far back have always shown thatvoters trust their councillorstwice as much as they trust Westminster politicians.Another U-turn could stop this now, at least for most councils that have yet to begin their great upheaval. But that might bring even worse chaos. There is a lesson here for all governments: royal commissions are a good idea when considering major technical change. There was no need to dive into this when there was no public demand, no lobbying or any interest in local reorganisation – and plenty of time to explore it first.What makes this so perverse is that local government does urgently need reform of the appalling council tax system and a review of all property taxes. Councils desperately need reform of social care, which isbringing them to a state of near collapse: where is the promisednational care service? Instead, we have a “tidying up” that has finally exploded into a row about delayed elections. The government was not cheating when it let councils decide whether to hold an election for councillors who might be in post for just a year in mutating councils, but it was easy for Reform and the Tories to make it look that way.This has all the hallmarks of a great distraction, a displacement activity from theimpossibly difficult and intractable problems the government faces.The elections bill published last weekhas a great void at its centre where electoral reform should have been. Fiddling with the borders and electorates of councils looks almost like a toy version. Labour knows all too well that leaving in place the electoral system that allowed the party to win a mammoth majority on a slender vote is holding open the door to Reform to do the same. It may make little difference to the cataclysm Labour expects in May, but it gave Nigel Farage a needless fillip to claim a win for democracy by challenging delayed council elections, and winning.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Can Labour come back from the brink?On Monday 30 April, ahead of the May elections, join Gaby Hinsliff, Zoe Williams, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr as they discuss how much threat Labour faces from both the Green party and Reform, and whether Keir Starmer can survive as party leaderBook ticketshereor atguardian.liveExplore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025OpinionLocal governmentLabourAngela RaynerSteve ReedReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Otherwise, like me, you’ll get shaftedWed 18 Feb 2026 11.38 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 15.30 ESTShareIdiot. More fool you. Serves you right. What did you expect? These were some of the things people said to me when I told them about something I had done, or rather not done, or rather – as I saw it – had done to me. I thought I was the victim. Others just thought me a bit of a pillock.For years I had breakdown cover with the same well-known name. Let’s call it SMBOBU Recovery. Skilled Mechanics But Otherwise a Bit Unscrupulous. I can’t tell you how long I’d been with SMBOBU Recovery because I can’t bear to look. I never had any problem with the service, not least because I never broke down. To be fair, the one time I remember calling on them, when my motorbike’s battery went flat, the bloke turned up promptly and played a blinder. He couldn’t get at the battery terminals to clip on his charger cables, so he executed a devilishly clever manoeuvre he called chopsticks. This involved poking a couple of long screwdrivers on to the terminals and clipping his clips on to them. Nice work, credit where it’s due, etc.My admiration might be why, when it came to what my cover was costing me, I took my eye off the ball. And in this world, in this iteration of capitalism, taking your eye off the ball costs you dear. I suppose I assumed that, yes, I was probably paying a bit more than new customers, but not so much more as to warrant getting into any faff fighting with a website or a call centre to get a better deal with SMBOBU Recovery or any of its competitors. I also vaguely assumed I might be getting some kind of discount for only ever once calling them out. If you say this fantastical thinking is partly down to me having more money than sense, then you’d have a point.But imagine my surprise to find that my cover was costing me north of £500 a year. As far as I could see, this was well over three times what I’d be paying if I came to them as a nice new customer. After bashing my forehead firmly on my desk a couple of times, I went about the not entirely straightforward business of finding the auto-renew tick box on the website. I clicked to untick the box with as much venom as my mouse could deal with, only to find that SMBOBU Recovery’s website would not allow me to untick this box online. Oh no, I’d have to give them a call. After a good 10 minutes of waiting for an answer, puffs of steam that would have done Ivor the Engine proud were coming out of my ears. The chap on the line sucked his teeth a bit and said something like: “Right, let’s see what we can do for you.” Before long he conjured up a price much less than a third of what I’d been paying. There was something in his tone of voice that suggested I ought to be grateful for his sterling efforts and the generosity SMBOBU Recovery was showing me in making this cut-price offer.By now I was wound up like an old alarm clock, ready to make an unholy racket to register my considerable fury. I thought better of it. For one thing, none of it was this guy’s fault. For another, he was on a hiding to nothing. To retain my custom he would have needed to say something like: “Good grief, we’ve been charging you how much? 500 quid!? For one motorbike? And you’ve only called us out once in all that time? I can’t believe it. That’s a disgrace. And in auto-renewing you trusted us! The shame of it! What we’re going to do is this: we’ll cover you for £150 this year, and refund you the difference between that and whatever you’ve been paying for as long as you’ve been with us. Furthermore, we’ll get hold of the mechanic who did the chopsticks thing, and he will personally be at your beck and call in perpetuity, following you everywhere you go, just in case of trouble.”As he said no such thing, I plotted my next move. I considered renewing the cover and then calling out a mechanic every day of the year, just to get my own back. In the end I settled for insisting – and, trust me, he needed some persuasion on this – that he cancel my auto-renewal. I then called my bank to let them know that I wanted the auto-renewal cancelled and was told that I’d done the right thing to contact them as it wasn’t the first time they’d heard this story about SMBOBU Recovery.At the age of 58, I’ve bought my first drill. Can it make me a new man? | Adrian ChilesRead moreLesson learned. But what is the lesson? Obviously, tediously, whatever you’re paying for – insurance, utilities, TV services, broadband, mobile phones, etc, etc – you need to watch them all like hawks. Take your eye off the ball and they’ll steal your ball. This is now the default position for consumers. Do nothing, and sooner rather than later you’ll get stiffed. All of the above areas of business exist, arguably, in bracingly competitive markets. This, you’d assume, overall exerts downward pressure on the prices consumers pay. But for which consumers? Most of them, possibly. But some more than others. And then there’s the left-behind. The ones, like me, who ought to know better but are too daft or dilatory to do anything about it. OK, limited sympathy. But what about those who may know better but lack the knowledge or help to navigate this minefield, which is laid in shifting sands of changing prices, bewildering terms and conditions, apps, bots, websites and barely a trustworthy fellow human around to pick a path through it? Get involved and get befuddled. Or do nothing and get shafted.I’ve now left SMBOBU Recovery behind for ever and got a great deal from somewhere else. But here’s the thing: I still don’t feel particularly good about it, because in this zero sum game, the seriously good deal I’m now getting is only possible because someone somewhere is paying way over the odds. More fool them? Speaking as a former fool myself, I can’t quite accept that.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMotoringOpinionCar insuranceInsurance industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s what that looks likePaul TaylorThe fledgling ‘coalition of the willing’ assembled for Ukraine could form the basis for an urgent European security responseWed 18 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 13.04 ESTShareAfter a year of Donald Trump’s second term andtwoMunich Security Conferences, we now know that Europe will have to defend itself in future with less US support; probably with much less US support; and possibly – gulp – with no US support at all.European leaders recognise that they need toreduce overdependenceon the US. Yet many, including Keir Starmer and to an extentFriedrich Merz, are stillclinging to the wreckage of the transatlantic relationship. They do so in hope, rather than certainty, that the US will come to Europe’s aid if Russia attacks Nato territory. Who truly believes that Trump, who prefers one-day displays of US power, would commit US forces to an open-ended war in Europe – with potential nuclear risks – if Vladimir Putin suddenly grabbed a Russian-speaking border town in Estonia, or the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard?All European governments now realise they will have to take responsibility for the defence of Europe, potentially on their own. This will require a decade of substantially increased military spending, something that polls show public opinion broadly supports, so far. Yet several European states – including the UK, France and Italy – are in too fragile a fiscal position to finance a defence surge without massive joint borrowing, somethingthat Germany isunwillingto countenance.Buying more weapons is only one part of building a credible, more independent European defence. It requires capabilities that politicians love to show off, such as satellites, fighters and frigates. But it also takes lots of unsexy things they don’t like to spend money on, such as ammunition and spare parts, as well as boring logistics, training and exercising, and a big increase in the size of the armed forces, potentially involving selective conscription.Just as important, Europe needs a new leadership structure to take timely decisions to counter aggression. Four years of Russia’s full-scale invasion ofUkrainehave shown that neither Nato nor the EU can be relied upon to respond swiftly and adequately.Nato is dominated by the US and cannot act when Washington does not want it involved. It did its utmost to stay out of direct support for Kyiv in 2022, rejecting Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s pleas to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. And Nato only took over coordinating military supplies for Ukraine from the US last year. The EU, for its part, imposed swift financial and economic sanctions on Moscow, and helped manage a shift away from dependence on Russian gas. But it is not a defence organisation, and pro-Russian outlier Hungary slowed subsequent sanctions packages and financial assistance to Kyiv.View image in fullscreenThe European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, addresses the Munich Security Conference, 14 February 2026.Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AFP/Getty ImagesAt last weekend’s Munich Security Conference, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and Friedrich Merz both spoke of the need to bring to lifethe EU’s mutual defence pact(article 42.7), which is on paper a more binding commitment than Nato’s equivalent,article 5. Yet the EU has scant military expertise, and as yet no operational command. No serving European general has commanded more than a brigade in action since the end of the cold war, with only small forces dispatched for expeditionary warfare or peacekeeping in Afghanistan, Iraq, Mali, Bosnia and Kosovo.The EU andNatoare shackledby the unanimity principle, and both contain awkward members – four militarily non-aligned countries in the EU, and above all the pro-Russian governments of Hungary and Slovakia. Moreover, the EU does not include three countries crucial for the defence of Europe: the UK, Norway and Turkey.Neither organisation was used when it came to designing potential security guarantees for Ukraine, in case of a ceasefire agreement. The US did not want Nato involved, to avoid upsetting its negotiations with Russia.Instead, France and the UK, Europe’s two nuclear powers and UN security council members, put together a“coalition of the willing” grouping of roughly 35 nations, including all the continent’s main military powers, but also Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Australia. Whether or not they will actually deploy forces in and around Ukraine is far from clear. That depends on Putin’s willingness to end the war, and on European countries’ still-uncertain resolve to commit boots on the ground, planes in the air and ships in the Black Sea.However, the coalition of the willing shows some promise as a plausible framework for future European security leadership without guaranteed US support. With a fledgling operational headquarters in Paris, the grouping brings together all the keycountries and organisations (including Nato and the EU), without the obstructive ones. An inner core of the so-called E3 – France, Germany and the UK – exercises the most influence, widened to the so-called E6 – addingItaly, Spain and Poland – to involve other big European powers. Nordic and Baltic countries, usually represented by Denmark or Finland, are also influential in the grouping.For the moment, the coalition of the willing has no legal status, no decision-making authority and no secretariat. It is an ad hoc body for which the UK and France have detached a few officials and officers. However, it could grow into the nucleus of a future European defence union, acting where possible through Nato structures, but if necessary under coalition command.One possibility would be to revive the1955 western European union treaty, which was finally absorbed into the EU in 2010, to give a European defence union a legal basis, incorporating willing EU countries, the UK and Norway. That might take too long for current needs, but if Europe is to defend itself with much less US assistance, a nimble body that can shape and take quick decisions in a crisis is needed. This de facto European security council looks like the best option.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsNatoOpinionEuropean UnionVladimir PutinUkraineEuropeRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

These deaths are measurable, documented and ongoing. Concluding otherwise is just playing pretend. Studies explain the mechanics, but lived experience supplies the truth. The people who suffer the consequences see the fire rising and water closing in. They need their government’s help.Despite that, the president of the United States stood at a microphone last Thursday andabdicated his duty to them. “It has nothing to do with public health,”he claimedabout the climate crisis while announcing that the federal government wouldrepeal the Environmental Protection Agency’s “endangerment finding”, a determination that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare. “This is all a scam, a giant scam.”What he was lying about is a truth the federal government – even under his first administration – has embraced for nearly two decades. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the “endangerment finding” in 2009. Drawing upon extensive scientific evidence, the EPA concluded that emissions driving the climate crisis contribute to extreme heat, intensified storms, rising sea levels, wildfires and degraded air quality, all of which carry direct consequences for human life and safety.The endangerment finding was not rhetorical flourish. It was the legal keystone of modern US climate regulation, the scientific and administrative determination that enabled the federal government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. It formed the basis for emissions standards governing vehicles, power plants and industry.Erase that finding, and you do more than undermine the Clean Air Act and the regulatory framework it supports. The move dismantles the authority that made those protections possible in the first place. In the process, the president is withdrawing official recognition of a danger millions of Americans are already living through.This is on brand. Trump is wont to redefine documented facts, definitions and knowledge until it bears no resemblance to reality. When confronted with his own electoral defeat, he reframes it asfraudanduses government powerto buttress that con.When addressing racism, he and his acolytes falsely and exclusively reframe it as discrimination against white Americans. The Trump White House doesn’t so much contest facts as it attempts to erase them.Now, confronted with a warming planet, the Trump administration is risking something even moreconsequential: redefining and exacerbating an existing danger to his constituents. Across the country, people are confronting the climate crisis not as a projection but as past and present conditions – living on top oftoxic fracking sites,smoke-choked skiesandstrained power grids.The climate crisis is not a forecast. It is an incident report. It long ago moved beyond the theoretical, and its harms do not fall evenly.Black Americans, for example, are more likely to live near polluting infrastructure and suffer disproportionate exposure to toxic air. They experience higher rates of premature death tied to pollution-related illness. Environmental justice advocates warn that dismantling the endangerment finding removes one of the federal government’s last legal shields against these harms – leaving frontline communities more exposed as climate risks intensify.That vulnerability extends beyond chronic pollution exposure to acute disaster impact.The Eaton fire in California– which destroyed more than 16,000 structures – underscores how climate-intensified catastrophes often fall hardest on communities with the least infrastructure, insurance coverage and political leverage to recover.There is also a strategic irony embedded in Trump’s latest retreat. In refusing to fight the climate crisis, the administration risks undermining the nationalist politics it claims to champion.The climate crisis does not stop at national borders. Drought, crop failure and rising seas arealready displacing populations abroad, fuelingmigration flowswealthier nations struggle to absorb. Weakening climate mitigation while simultaneously hardening borders ignores the causal chain connecting the two – a posture that risks intensifying the very displacement pressures it claims to resist.Racism may color Trump’s politics, but it is probably not the sole driver here. The economic incentives are clear: erasing the finding would benefit polluters and the oligarchs behind them. The administration’s retreat from climate responsibility is hardly passive. As it works to erase the scientific finding that allows the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases, it is simultaneouslydirecting the Pentagon to purchase coal-fired power– using federal muscle to sustain the very industry fueling planetary warming. It is one thing to deny a crisis. It is another to help finance it.What Trump’s decision most clearly reflects, however, is a governing pattern the president has exhibited for years: distancing himself from responsibility for the harm he commits, even when the consequences are measurable and grave.Recognition of danger undergirds our laws, enabling enforcement and creating the possibility of accountability. In the absence of findings like the EPA’s 2009 report, the government’s response to climate harm would rest largely on moral duty rather than enforceable obligation – a posturefar more vulnerable to political discretion. Without formal recognition of danger, citizens and states lose one of their strongest legal footholds for compelling federal action when disaster strikes.Should this erasure stand upafter the inevitable court challenges, the government’s declared obligation to confront those realities with the full weight of its authority would disappear. The harm would not disappear, however. The only thing that changes is the terrain on which citizens can demand protection. The fires still burn. The heat still kills. The floods still come.When someone like Trump rescinds the recognition of a documented danger already harming the people he’s charged with serving, it is not a mere change of policy. The president is refusing to do his job.Jamil Smith is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsClimate crisisPollutionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

That is why progress has been so slow in negotiations, whichresumed in Genevathis week. The Russian president demands the surrender of territory that his army has failed so far to win in combat. Since Mr Putin cannot be trusted to honour any agreement, Volodymyr Zelenskyy rightly insists on robust security guarantees. The Kremlin remains committed to restoring national pride through territorial expansion. Mr Putin might accept a lull in the Ukraine conflict, but only to regroup. He must be deterred from resuming a campaign aimed at extinguishing Ukraine’s sovereignty.His country’s economy and propaganda apparatus are increasingly oriented towards sustaining a long war. He has shown little sign of abandoning efforts to weaken Nato and punish European democracies for backing Kyiv. The intent is signalled by a campaign of constant provocations: sabotage, maritime and air incursions, cyber-attacks and online disinformation.Sir Keir Starmer addressed the dangers in aspeech last weekat the Munich security conference, urging fellow European nations to accelerate defence and security cooperation. The prime minister rejected the Brexit ethos of detachment from Britain’s continental allies. “There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain,” he said.The speech was an important clarification of the UK’s geopolitical interests at a time when domestic politics is too often addled with Brexit delusions. But there is a gap between Sir Keir’s ambition and its realisation. Defence and security cooperation was a foundational pillar of the “reset” in UK-EU relations agreed in a summit last May. Britain was supposed to join theSecurity Action for Europe (Safe)programme – a €140bn (£122bn) investment fund to accelerate continental defence spending. In November, negotiations broke down over the size of the UK’s financial contribution. Failure to reach agreement on a matter of such obvious mutual interest was humiliating for both sides.There is also a domestic mismatch between the prime minister’s rhetorical urgency on security matters and the rate of government action. Last June, Sir Keir committed to raise defence spending to 5% of GDP – a collective Nato target – by 2035. Last week, he said Britain would have to “go faster”, although he did not specify sums and dates.In this context, national security is broadly defined to include civil resilience. It is not simply a matter of diverting resources from peacetime public services into rearmament. Defence investment should itself expand economic capacity, generating growth that reshapes the fiscal arithmetic. But such investments take time to bear fruit, while the chancellor remains preoccupied with self-imposed metrics. Budget wrangling is the reason why a defence investment plan, due last year, has yet to materialise.It is a familiar story: a prime minister sounding purposeful in speeches without confronting thedifficult trade-offsrequired to turn bold pledges into action. Sir Keir deserves credit for articulating the geopolitical challenge posed by Russia and the obvious response – stepping up cooperation with our continental allies. Since taking office, the prime minister has been slowly grappling with the strategic blunder of Brexit, only recently daring to describe it in those terms. He must now act with the urgency implied by his own rhetoric.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But too many people are still sleeping on the streets or in temporary accommodationWed 18 Feb 2026 13.25 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 15.31 ESTShareRough sleeping in Scotland has risen by106%over the past three years. Record numbers of children are now living in temporary accommodation, official figures released this month show. In Glasgow, the city council leader warned last year that the authority hadrun outof temporary housing. This looks like a system approaching crisis point.The paradox is that Scotland has some of the strongest homelessness protections in Europe. More than a decade ago, the Scottish parliament abolished the “priority need” test, creating a statutory duty on councils to secure permanent accommodation for all unintentionally homeless applicants. The charity ShelterconsideredScotland to have had “the best homelessness law in Europe”. But having a legal right to a home doesn’t mean having a home.The trouble is that social and affordable housing supply has failed to keep pace with need – and temporary accommodation has become a bottleneck. People who have been put up in hotel rooms and B&Bs have no way of leaving due to high rents and a lack of social homes. As councils exhaust their options, rough sleeping begins to rise.Welfarepowers are largely reserved to Westminster. But building social homes is a devolved responsibility – leaving the Scottish National party, which has governed from Edinburgh since 2007, exposed. It has responded with plans for a new national housing agency to address criticism that the real failure here is housing supply.Analysts estimate that Scotland needs just under16,000new social homes each year to prevent homelessness rising further. In 2021, the SNP promised to deliver110,000affordable homes by 2032. However, it has fallen well short of that target. The Scottish government’s current commitment of36,000affordable homes over the next four years equates to around 9,000 per year, still far below the number required. Even those levels may be difficult to meet on the funding allocated. That all explains why homelessness continues to rise.Perhaps Scotland should take a leaf out of Vienna’s book. It used public housing – built at scale and sustained over decades – so that it shapes the wider market rather than serving only as a safety net of last resort. Less than 1% of the population of Austria’s capital is homeless. The lesson here is that where public supply matches private provision, rentsstabilise. Where it falls behind, the opposite occurs: costs rise and housing pressure intensifies.The plan for a new national housing agency by Scotland’s first minister,John Swinneyis a welcome, if belated, recognition that the system is not working. A body with national oversight could direct investment where need is greatest. However, Mr Swinney’s language stresses efficiency and investment partnerships, not aVienna-style expansionof public housing.Every year that the government does not deal with its housing supply, the problem compounds and the number of homes that need to be built shoots up. The issue will surely be raised on the doorstep during campaigning for May’sHolyroodelections, and is likely to feature again in five years’ time. Until then, more people will sleep on cold streets or in cramped hotel rooms. Scotland’s homelessness legislation is ambitious and humane. The test now is whether the Scottish state can build at the scale required to deliver on that promise.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromMichael Bulley,Reini Schühle, Dr Michael ParaskosandDr Peter R KingWed 18 Feb 2026 12.55 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 15.31 ESTShareThe new border controls being introduced for dual nationals create anomalies that will surprise no one who has followed recent Home Office policy changes (Dual nationals to be denied entry to UK from 25 February unless they have British passport, 13 February). At worst they are cruel; at best they are exploitative money-making exercises, unthought out, or the bureaucratic consequence of the introduction of digitisation.I, a Belgian citizen, have worked in the UK for 32 years. My “settled status” now allows me to travel freely between the UK and Belgium using my EU passport. A few years ago, I applied for British citizenship because I was uncertain whether my “entitlement” to live and work in the UK would be maintained afterBrexit, and because I wanted to vote in the UK. I have not yet applied for a British passport because I would have to submit my Belgian one for an unknown length of time, which might prevent me from visiting my ailing 96-year-old father in Brussels.Now, since I am a British citizen, I am required to apply for a newly created “certificate of entitlement”, costing £589, in order to be able to return to the UK whenever I visit my dad in Brussels, or indeed leave the country at all. Had I not become a British citizen, I would not have required this certificate.Who would have thought that obtaining British citizenship would prevent me from travelling freely between the UK and Belgium or elsewhere? This seems redolent of an increasingly unthinking, mean-mindedHome Officepolicy/society at a time of widespread and dangerous dissatisfaction.Prof Carine RonsmansLondonThe requirement that dual nationals travelling to the UK will have to pay £589 for a “certificate of entitlement”, if they haven’t got a British passport, doesn’t make sense. If, for example, you are French only and have a French passport, you can travel to the UK having obtained an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation) for £16.If you have Franco-British dual nationality and try to obtain an ETA online, and answer “British” when asked if you have some nationality in addition to French, you are told you do not need an ETA and the procedure stops. You are not told what would be valid if you don’t have a British passport.This is crazy, as someone who is Franco-British is just as legally French as someone with only French nationality. Living in France, I have taken the precaution of having a British passport as well as my French one, but I don’t think I should have had to.Michael BulleyChalon-sur-Saône, FranceI have lived and worked in the UK since the early 1970s. After the Brexit debacle, I obtained full citizenship. Since I value my cultural heritage, I kept my German passport and saw no need to apply for a UK passport. However, as I am now a UK citizen, I cannot apply for the £16 ETA. Instead, I’d have to fork out £589 for a certificate of entitlement, which is only valid for the duration of my current German passport.It seems ironic that if I had not bothered with citizenship I would have saved not only the citizenship fee of £1,300, but also £589 for the certificate. My cheapest option now is to get a UK passport as well as keeping my German passport.Reini SchühlePontefract, West YorkshireWhy does it cost £94.50 to process a paper passport, but £589 for a digital document to prove I am British? It sounds like profiteering.Dr Michael ParaskosLondonI write regarding the appalling UK entry rules for dual nationals, to be introduced within the next 10 days. It is completely disingenuous of the UK Home office to claim that this “requirement ... is the same approach taken by other countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia.” The cost of the equivalent Canadian special authorization to allow dual citizens to board their flight with a valid non-Canadian passport is C$7. This translates to just under £4. This is hardly comparable with or “the same” as the UK equivalent cost of £589, which is manifestly nothing less than an unjustifiable money grab.Dr Peter R KingCalgary, CanadaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I also have personal experience of placental delivery complications, as when my son was born, his placenta got stuck inside the womb of his mother after his birth (placental retention).Placental retention is due to the premature closure of the cervix after the birth of the baby, and is a leading cause of uterine atony and postpartum haemorrhage, affecting around one in 100 births.Placenta accreta happens when part of the placenta is abnormally attached to the uterine wall, requiring a surgical resection or hysterectomy. Placental retention and PAS are often mixed in statistics and audits, as they are both associated with difficult placental delivery and life-threatening haemorrhage, and are traumatic for the parents and obstetric staff.PAS is due to the development of the placenta inside a previous uterine scar, and there is no evidence that it is due to abnormal placental tissue invading a normal uterine wall, like a cancer. PAS is also not directly associated with a risk to the foetus, as suggested in your article, unless the baby has to be delivered prematurely due to a maternal complication.Over 90% of patients with a PAS present with placenta previa accreta and a history of low-segment caesarean section. PAS of the upper segment of the uterus is exceptional, and small spots of PAS in the upper segment are unlikely to be detected during routine ultrasounds.In the case mentioned in your article, Dr Chineze Otigbah certainly managed Amisha Adhia very well, but these cases should not be considered common or associated with the rise in caesareans. Patients should be reassured that the NHS has developed a screening programme and care plan for patients at risk of PAS, following the publication of the 2018 version of the RCOG guideline.Prof Eric JauniauxEGA Institute for Women’s Health, University College LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromProf Michael BasseyWed 18 Feb 2026 12.55 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 15.30 ESTShareThe emerging evidence on exams and mental health is alarming (More exam stress at 15 linked to higher risk of depression as young adult – study, 12 February). Exams are the fairest and most reliable way to assess what students know and can do. They provide a sense of achievement and can help to build resilience.But something is out of sync. Young people face too many GCSE exams over too short a period. As theCambridge OCR exam board has shown, England’s 16-year-olds spend longer in exam halls than almost any of their international peers. Last year, the government committed to a 10% reduction in exam time. It’s a step in the right direction, when we need a leap.As the government publishes curriculum reform plans for GCSE subjects this year, we will need more than tinkering around the edges of the curriculum. Teachers and students are pressured to rush through too much content while, in some subjects such as English, a lack of relevance is contributing to an engagement crisis in schools.We need to be laser-focused on what gets added to the curriculum, and bold enough to cut what’s not working. This won’t be easy, and it may even challenge the government’s mantra of “evolution not revolution” for the education system. But it’s where the evidence directs us. Our young people deserve nothing less.Myles McGinleyManaging director, Cambridge OCRYour report is disturbing. It points to the question as to why, since the school-leaving age was raised to 18, there is an examination at 16.

In my early days on Bluesky, I began questioning why I was spending time building a following. I wanted to promote my books because I believed that they had the potential to help many people, but book sales didn’t actually increase.Still, I continued. I posted Arwa Mahdawi’s powerfulcolumn about the Save Act. I was able to let countless people know for the first time how dangerous this law would be. Then a researcher friend told me that he was having trouble getting people to complete a survey on gender-affirming care. With the help of others on the platform, we were able to get many participants for him.The platform is only as good as the people who run it. When I first started on UpScrolled, an Australian platform, I wondered why the feed quickly ran out. Issam Hijazi designed the app to keep users from becoming addicted.Social media, like any tool, can be used for good or evil. It is the moral values of the designers and the users that determine which.Randy FairWilton Manors, Florida, USFor many, there is no ethical dilemma. Social media in its current form, contrived and controlled by greedy and malevolent tech oligarchs, serves no benefit. There is no doubt that using it is unethical. From the individual psychological, emotional and physical harm it causes its users, to the impact on personal relationships through to the deep and pervasive damage it has inflicted on society, it is nothing other than a manifestation of the worst of humanity and a mechanism for controlling and enslaving populations.Please do not assume that we all use social media. I have never used it and have far better things to do with my life. I don’t think it is a coincidence that my teenage children also show no interest. Ethically, I’d suggest that the grownups among us start setting a better example to our young people by logging out – for good.Ruth TantonBristolFrances Ryan rightly bemoans the toxicity of major social media platforms. I would ask her to please take a look at Mastodon and the broader Fediverse. These social media systems were largely created by people of various minorities who found themselves uncomfortable or unwelcome on the mainstream commercial systems. They are amateur operations that depend on user donations to keep running, but they have no advertising and no commercial pressure to exploit their users. So each user decides which people and/or hashtags they want to follow, and there is no other obscure algorithm deciding what you see or don’t see. This does mean that it can take a little longer to find everyone and everything you are interested in, but it is well worth it.Colin Macleod,High Barnet, LondonIn my opinion it is time to leave social media. I gave it up a few years ago when I was abused online by a stranger in a gardening group onFacebook. I don’t miss it. I live in the real world now. Meanwhile, the online world is reported to be nastier than ever. I am retired, with plenty of time for real-world friendships and connections. It must be a lot more difficult to make this decision if you are very time-poor or unable to leave your home due to disability or caring responsibilities. For those who find it useful, let’s keep the platforms, but regulate them better through legislation and demand ethical site management.Paula BarnettManuka,Canberra, AustraliaI left Facebook within days of Mark Zuckerbergdumping the factcheckers. It was the last straw in a relationship that was becoming increasingly wearisome. I miss some groups, such as gardening and naturalists’ fora, where useful information is shared, but so much of the platform’s content is unnecessary, even if amusing, that I feel a deep sense of relief and freedom to have escaped.Pat ReadyWelling, LondonDoes Frances Ryan think people should stop using pen and ink because some people write poison pen letters?

Curling is one of the very few sports left being contested at theWinter Olympicsin which the British fancy their chances, and Team GB’s hopes of getting anywhere near their medal target will turn on the curl of the stones in the next few days.‘The whole spirit of curling is dead’: meltdown on the ice as ruckus rumbles onRead moreHang on a minute lads, anyone got a bright idea? “Play better,” the British skip Bruce Mouat told his team. The Brits had three matches between them on Wednesday. It started just before nine in the morning with the first instalment of a double bill against USA – the women, then the men playing them – and was finished just before nine in the evening, with the conclusion of the women’s match against Japan.Team GBneeded to win all three of them, and they did, in 12 hours of excruciating slow‑mo sport, as tense as the seat of a skip’s pants as they slide down the ice to deliver the hammer.There were some extraordinary moments in among it, the best of them Becky Morrison’s 15th, and very final stone, of the 10th end against USA. Morrison’s team were trailing 7-6, USA had the hammer and a stone sitting flush on the button. There was only one possible shot Morrison could play to save the day, an improbable hit-and-roll which ricocheted off a stone sitting way out to the left, shot across the ice and knocked the USA stone off and stopped dead. It was a two-point swing, and the stunned USA team were still talking about it hours later. Minnesota Fats couldn’t have worked the angles any better.“It’s up there with the best stones I’ve ever thrown, for sure, especially considering the situation,” Morrison said. “One of the best stones I’ve ever seen,” her teammate Sophie Sinclair said. Their third, Jen Dodds, said: “What a way to finish the game. I’ve got a bit of adrenaline going, because it was so amazing to watch. That is a very high tariff shot. You’re aiming at a third of the stone, and it’s way out there on a line you don’t really play often, in the 10th end of an Olympic Games, to keep your chances alive.”View image in fullscreenGrant Hardie (left) and Bruce Mouat after the British men kept their hopes alive with victory against USA.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAAnd the fun was only just beginning. The British men beat USA 9-2 after just six ends. The problem was they don’t just need to win; they need the Norwegian and Italian teams to lose, too. Whenever Mouat and his teammates weren’t focused entirely on their own game, they had both eyes on what was happening on rinks either side. It was like the final day of the Premier League, only they were playing all the games in the same stadium.When Britain were two up against USA, Norway were trailing the Swiss by the same margin, but Italy were leading Canada by three. Then when the British were leading by six, Canada had come back to one‑down in their match against Italy, but all of a sudden the Norwegians had equalised with Switzerland. Somehow at the end of it all, everything fell the right way. Canada came back to beat Italy 8-3, and the Swiss pulled ahead again to beat Norway 10-4. Now, the British have to spend Thursday morning watching while Norway play Canada, and Italy play Switzerland.As long as one of Norway or Italy lose, GB will go through. And if you followed that here’s a Rubik’s Cube for you to do. “I’ll be literally refreshing my phone every 20 seconds,” said Hammy McMillan, who will be following it from the athletes’ village.The British women will be back at the rink. They beat Japan 9-3 in the evening, and now need to defeat Italy on Friday afternoon. Mouat, crawling ever so slowly towards the back of that wobbling bus, says only: “I’m actually oddly calm. I feel like things are going to go our way.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBCurlingWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The 12 years in between have been marked by brutal ups and downsBryan Armen Grahamin MilanWed 18 Feb 2026 16.18 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 18.07 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAlot can happen in 12 years. If you’re Mikaela Shiffrin, as a teenager you can become theyoungest ever person to win the Olympic slalom, stack a couple more medals at the next Olympics, become themost successful World Cup skier of all timewith a record 108 victories, go 10 more Olympic races in a row over three Winter Games without reaching the podium, overcome the two biggest crashes of your career andsubsequent battleswith self-doubt and post-traumatic stress disorder and eroding trust in your own skiing, and then bring it all back homewith a second Olympic slalom gold.You can also lose your dad.Shiffrin, considered by many the greatest alpine skier in history, saw her incandescent career come full circle on Wednesday beneath the jagged limestone peaks above Cortina d’Ampezzo, winning her signature race by 1.50sec – an eternity in slalom racing and the largest winning margin in any Olympic alpine skiing event in nearly three decades – to endan eight-year medal droughtthat had started to overtake the conversation. In 2014, at the age of 18, she became the youngest US woman ever to win Olympic gold in alpine skiing. Now, in 2026, she’s the oldest at 30.Sports love clean and tidy narratives like these. The arc from teenage prodigy to veteran champion. The clean line from Sochi to Cortina. But grief is never clean. As the raw emotion bubbled over in Wednesday’s aftermath, a reflective Shiffrin described how winning her first Olympic gold sinceher father’s death in 2020did not feel like a continuation so much as starting over.Mikaela Shiffrin storms to stunning slalom gold to make Winter Olympic historyRead more“Everything in life that you do after you lose someone you love is like a new experience,” she said. “It’s like being born again. And I still have so many moments where I resist this.“I don’t want to be in life without my dad. And maybe today was the first time that I could actually accept this like reality. And instead of thinking I would be going in this moment without him, to take the moment to be silent with him. It was just a little bit more spiritual than I usually am, but I’m really grateful for that.”Jeff Shiffrin, an anesthesiologist and an avid recreational skier, was deeply involved in his daughter’s development from the beginning. But unlike many parents in the hyper-competitive world of elite youth sports, he was known for being calm, steady and perspective-driven. Shiffrin has often recalled how her father encouraged her to love skiing for its own sake. If she won, great. If she didn’t, well, that was part of the sport. The emphasis was always on effort, preparation and integrity.“Part of my journey through grief has been challenging because I don’t feel this thing that a lot of people talk about, this deep spiritual connection,” she said. “People talk about feeling the presence, and I haven’t felt it in that way. I feel connected to him in my thoughts and in talking about him.”For Shiffrin, moving forward wasn’t about resolving her loss but learning how to exist alongside it. For an athlete whose career has been built on precision and repetition, grief has offered no such structure. Some days feel manageable. Others feel impossible. The only constant, she said, is uncertainty.“The only thing life can guarantee is it’s not something you can expect,” she said. “I’ve had moments I didn’t think I would survive. And in the end I get to stand here and talk about a medal. Life is crazy. I’m very grateful for that right now.”That uncertainty had come to define her performance on the sport’s biggest stage. Fair or not, the narrative had hardened. She was great in World Cup races held mostly while America was asleep. Could she still do it under the most unforgiving spotlight?Shiffrin didn’t medal in any of the six races she entered at the Beijing Olympics four years ago,reaching the bottom of the mountainin only half of them. She bounced back to win a fifth overall World Cup title across all disciplines the next year. Butafter a devastating crashtwo years ago in Killington, Vermont, there were some around the sport – herself included – who openly wondered if she’d ever be the same.View image in fullscreenMikaela Shiffrin on her way to victory in Wednesday’s slalom.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesThose gnawing questions resurfaced in Cortina on her return to Olympic snow in last week’s team combined event. After Breezy Johnson crossed first in the downhill portion, all that stood between Shiffrin and a drought-busting medal was a single run in the slalom, where her glittering World Cup results this year – seven firsts and a second in eight starts – have already wrapped upher record-extending ninth season-long title. But Shiffrin was hesitant from the starter’s gate and finished 15th of 18 skiers, her worst result in a slalom race she has started and finished in 14 years. Across the pine-dark slopes above Cortina, she could practically hear the critics:It’s easy to be the GOAT in a sport that no one is watching most of the time.“I knew after the team combined that there would be some stories out there that would be really frustrating to look at,” she said. “These moments of challenge, you don’t necessarily get to avoid them. So I just didn’t look at what anyone was saying. I didn’t look at social media, I didn’t look at anything. I just talked with [my team] and kept reminding myself what was important was the moments between the start and the finish.”She performed better in Sunday’s giant slalom – the raceshe won eight years agoin Pyeongchang – skiing with renewed confidence and coming in 11th but only 0.30sec off the podium in an atypically tight contest. But Wednesday’s third and final event of her Olympic program, in the discipline that most embodies her brilliance, was Shiffrin’s last best chance of putting the doubts to rest.She overcame a brush with disaster on her opening run down the Olympia delle Tofane track when she clipped a gate, but recovered to cross with the largest first-run lead in an Olympic women’s slalom since 1960. As she attempted to go down for one of her customary naps between runs, her father’s reassuring presence was never far from her mind.“I sort of started to cry a little bit because I was thinking about my dad,” she said. “And then I was thinking about the fact that I actually can show up today and honestly say in the start gate that I have all the tools that are necessary to do my best skiing and to earn that moment.”After one more trip down the piste, the moment was all hers. Shiffrin is the first American skier to win three Olympic gold medals. The long wait between her slalom golds represents the longest gap between individual gold medals in the same event at the Winter Games. As she found her mother and coach, Eileen, for a long embrace next to the finish area, the weight of the journey seemed to lift all at once.A lot can happen in 12 years. Records fall. Doubts grow louder. Families are irrevocably changed. On Wednesday, Shiffrin did not close a circle so much as draw another line forward: two clean runs through the gates, one quiet moment at the finish, and the understanding that even the greatest careers are built not on certainty, but on showing up anyway.Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, both star-packed teams struggled in Wednesday’s men’s ice hockey quarter-finals.Quinn Hughes scored in overtime to put the US past Sweden 2-1 after giving up the tying goal to Mika Zibanejad with 91 seconds left in the third period. Dylan Larkin deflected Jack Hughes’ shot in for the only US goal in regulation.“Just relief,” Hughes said when asked about his emotions after the game.Meanwhile, Canada’s quarter-final was an even tighter affair. Nick Suzuki tied the game on a deflection with 3:27 left, Mitch Marner scored in overtime, and Canada avoided what would have been a stunning exit at the Olympics by rallying to beat the Czech Republic 4-3.“I never had a doubt, but it was getting a little nerve-racking,” defenseman Drew Doughty said.Canada fell behind with 7:42 remaining when Ondrej Palat scored off a pass from Martin Necas. The goal sent the Czech bench and fans into a wild celebration, but their excitement was short-lived.From cursing curlers to comeback: is Canada on the turnaround after slow Olympic start?Read moreSuzuki just about did it all on the tying goal, sending the puck out to the point to Devon Toews and then redirecting the defenseman’s shot past Lukas Dostal. The Canadians still could have lost: Jordan Binnington denied David Pastrnak on a breakaway with 70 seconds left to send the game past regulation.Then Marner’s backhanded goal 1:22 into overtime put Canada into Friday’s semi-finals.“It’s the it-factor, man: Mitch Marner’s got it,” coach Jon Cooper said. “He doesn’t disappoint. Sometimes your hair falls out at times, but in the end, he never disappoints.”Canada has won more golds than any nation in Olympic ice hockey history. But this year’s men’s team have concerns beyond their struggles in Wednesday’s game. They lost star Sidney Crosby to injury five minutes into the second period after his right leg appeared to buckle as he braced for contact with rugged Czech Republic defenseman Radko Gudas. Crosby left the ice second later after he was crunched against the boards by Gudas and Necas.“Everybody had complete faith in whoever was going over the boards,” Cooper said. “It just felt it was like a matter of time. It was going to happen.”The US will face Slovakia in one semi-final on Friday night. Just before that, Canada will play Finland in the other.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Canada ice hockey teamWinter OlympicsIce hockeyUS sportsUSA ice hockey teamnewsShareReuse this content"

No one in red and white will want to remember this freezing cold night at Molineux – but it will live long in the memory of Wolves’ Tom Edozie, whose debut goal was a just punishment for thePremier Leagueleaders’ ineptitude.Arsenal are five points clear of Manchester City, having played a game more, and will feel their icy breath on their shoulders after winning twice in their past seven matches.When Bukayo Saka headed Arsenal into a fifth-minute lead it felt like a procession was coming, but as the temperature dropped so did the Gunners’ performance. Piero Hincapié struck a second to calm the jangling away‑end nerves and few could have anticipated the league’s worst team fighting back. A stunning Hugo Bueno strike reduced the deficit and changed a few minds before Edozie came off the bench to make a name for himself in Wolverhampton and east Manchester.Arteta accepts Arsenal ‘have to blame ourselves’ after blowing lead at WolvesRead moreWhen ahead Arsenal were still playing below their maximum against a Wolves side trying to make the night as difficult as possible. Even with that mindset the comparative starting lineups provided evidence of the differing qualities. While Wolves started with Adam Armstrong, a January signing from the Championship, Arsenal had the £64m Viktor Gyökeres leading the line but it was hard to tell the difference.Often games against mediocre teams in poor conditions are, in cliched circles, a good test of a potential title winner and Arsenal failed it. With the rain swirling in an arctic wind, Arsenal rightly did not look concerned by their rock-bottom opposition, controlling the ball in the early stages. Saka, moving into a more central role as a No 10, further proved his versatility with a smart run and then a header to score from a Declan Rice cross.This silenced the home crowd, removing any optimism they had of an upset. Wolves were passive in their play, drawing Arsenal on to them with a second goal looking inevitable, but like the temperature the Gunners’ performance was dipping. Noni Madueke, not popular in these partsfor calling the city “shit”, tested José Sá, who spilled his shot before the danger was removed with Gabriel Martinelli lurking.Arsenal were afforded plenty of space as Wolves stayed in a low block, without an aggressive press in the first half. With so much time on the ball, they should have created more clearcut chances but Sá was left untroubled. The isolated Gyökeres received no service, allowing him to ponder if wearing a short-sleeved shirt was the right decision.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka heads Arsenal into an early lead at Molineux, but there was plenty more drama to come.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesWolves failed to have a single shot in the opening half‑hour, which was no surprise to many considering it was a match comprising the worst attack against the best defence. As the rain turned to snow, the home support started to appreciate the resistance shown to keep the deficit at one. Tolu Arokodare, on as a substitute, won a grappling contest with William Saliba to give hope that there was some fight in the Wolves ranks.It was upon Arsenal to quell the resurgence, which was more evident in the stands than on the pitch. For so long they had enjoyed a straightforward night but there was more aggression in Wolves as the break approached and Arsenal were beginning to lose duels and have their attacks stifled.After barely having a kick, Armstrong reminded Arsenal they were in a match with a smart turn and rising shot which went over the bar. It was a sign of an intent that had been lacking on both sides but increased the noise inside Molineux, as supporters on all sides acknowledged their heroes needed them.Arsenal were forced into action and it took something a bit different. Hincapié moved up from left‑back to get between the Wolves defenders, allowing him to reach a precise pass from Gabriel Magalhães into the channel before slotting past Sá for his first Arsenal goal. The assistant referee belatedly put his flag up, only for the video assistant referee to overrule him, giving the away end a second excuse to get warm.If that was supposed to kill the game off no one told Hugo Bueno, who popped up on the right wing. He cut in and struck a curling shot into the top corner, much to the surprise of everyone.View image in fullscreenHugo Bueno’s curling shot sparks Wolves’ fightback.Photograph: MB Media/Getty ImagesWolves unsettled Arsenal and found ways to hurt them. Arteta knew the importance of a win, spending the night in the freezing cold on the touchline, becoming covered in a cocktail of rain, sleet and snow. He could not have been too concerned when Edozie came on with six minutes to play for the first senior action of his career, but Arsenal could not cope with the pressure.Edozie was more effective than the weather in sullying Arsenal’s mood. His shot hit the post and went in off Riccardo Calafiori, who was on as late substitute. It was a goal that provided what could be a pivotal moment in the title race.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Long before half-time it was fully apparent that he had rather understated things.Had this been a boxing match it would surely have been stopped by the 20th minute. Qarabag were utterly overwhelmed by the pace of their guests, and that of Anthony Gordon in particular. Gordon scored four times, boosting his tally in theChampions Leaguethis season to 10 goals.Qarabag 1-6 Newcastle United: Champions League playoff – liveRead moreIt all ensured that the 1,998 Newcastle fans who arrived on the banks of the Caspian Sea on a series of indirect flights via, among other cities, Istanbul and Warsaw, saw their endurance rewarded by the most convincing of performances from Eddie Howe’s team.“That’s as good as we’ve played in a long time,” the Newcastle manager said. “It’s a great day for us.”Howe has faced multiple problems in recent weeks but his players found this flying visit to Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, and its Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium as restorative as a week’s spa break in the sun.How Newcastle must wish more opponents attempted to play out from the back as ineptly as their Eurasian hosts. Not to mention surrender so supinely in the face of their aggressively physical, high-intensity press.Qarabag have beaten Benfica, Eintracht Frankfurt and Copenhagen in the Champions League this season but they simply folded as Newcastle sprinted away with the first leg of this playoff for a place in the last 16.The 2,529 miles Howe’s squad had travelled to Azerbaijan represented the longest away trip made by an English team in the Champions League.

When Kieran Trippier’s clever corner routine bamboozled Qarabag, Thiaw headed beyond Mateusz Kochalski.By now Gordon’s blistering acceleration was petrifying Gurbanov’s side but he relied on accuracy to score again from the penalty spot after Matteus Silva handled in the area. His hat-trick was completed when he dispossessed Kevin Medina before rounding Kochalski.Then, after Kochalski brought him down in the area, Gordon scored another penalty that provoked a heated row with Trippier, who wanted Woltemade to take it.Significantly, Gurbanov’s goalkeeper played well, proving largely responsible for keeping the score in single figures.Nick Pope had been a spectator until the moment, early in the second half, when he was arguably beaten rather too easily by Elvin Cafarquliyev’s low, hard, and just onside shot. Newcastle’s defence momentarily lost concentration and, as Qarabag fans celebrated wildly, Howe looked briefly irked.Gurbanov had switched to a back five and a deeper Qarabag looked considerably more resilient. Admittedly their cause was aided by a raft of visiting substitutions – including Gordon’s withdrawal – as visiting thoughts began turning to the Premier League engagement on Saturday night at Manchester City, where the absence of the injured Bruno Guimarães may be rather more keenly felt.Back in Baku, Jacob Murphy scored Newcastle’s sixth after cutting in from the right and watching his curling left foot, long-range, shot deflect past Kochalski.“The tie isn’t over,” Howe said. “But we are in a great position.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNewcastle UnitedQarabagEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The visitors tested Renée Slegers’s side when Sára Pusztai cancelled out Alessia Russo’s goal but a penalty from Mariona Caldentey and second from Russo secured the win, earning them a comfortable 7-1 aggregate score.This was a disjointed performance from the hosts but it will have done little to dampen the high spirits in north London.Arsenal are a team full of confidence right now and this was their sixth win in a row. Slegers’s squad have proved a lot over the last few weeks, both to themselves and those on the outside, as they near the end of a taxing period of games.Since returning from the winter break, they have won seven of their nine fixtures (losing just one) and featured in five different competitions. They have liftedthe inaugural Champions Cupand now secured progression to the last eight of the Women’s Champions League. It has been a month that will have tested them to their limits but one that will have given them belief that they can challenge on multiple fronts.Arsenal v Leuven: Women’s Champions League – liveRead moreSlegers and her players will have learned a lot about themselves. They have played brilliantly at times and proven their mettle at others; sometimes accused of not having the stomach for a fight, they have shown that they can dig in and find ways to win. This resilience has been key over a five-week stretch that has seen them play every three or four days, adapt to rotation in the squad and deal with the contrasting styles of football that their opponents have brought to the table.“We’ve learned that we have so many players in good form and so many who can perform for us in different roles as well,” Slegers said. “One example is Victoria Pelova who played in the 6 at the start of this game and finished on the right. Then the whole sum of its parts becomes really good. That’s the standout for me.”View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo shows her emotion after scoring the opener.Photograph: Molly Darlington/UEFA/Getty ImagesThey were always expected to come through this playoff unscathed. The mismatch in resources and experience between the current holders and the plucky newcomers was clear to see from the outset, particularly since they had already beaten them comfortably in the league phaseback in December.Quick GuideManchester United's Sandberg sidelined by knee injuryShowManchester United will be without the left-back Anna Sandberg for anything between four and eight weeks, the United head coach Marc Skinner has revealed, before the second leg of their Women's Champions League knockout playoff tie against Atlético Madrid on Thursday.The Sweden international has been in excellent form this season but a knee injury means she would be very likely to miss the quarter-finals against Bayern Munich, if Manchester United were to progress past Atlético. United lead 3-0 from the first leg.\"There's a little bit of a tidy up that needs to be done around her meniscus,\" said Skinner, who is hoping that Sandberg will return for the last \"three or four games\" of the season, adding: \"She will be around four to six to eight weeks, that's the timeframe we've been given. Best is four, middle is six. Obviously worst case is eight.\"We're hopeful we can get it to six [weeks]. But we won't take any risks. She's a young player so we'll make sure she's rehabbed effectively.\"Jayde Riviere and Fridolina Rolfö are also doubts for the visit of the Spanish side, while the England midfielder Ella Toone is \"doing really well\" but remains sidelined with a hip injury. Skinner said the club are aiming to welcome Toone back in time for March's local derby against the Women's Super League leaders Manchester City.Tom GarryPhotograph: Poppy Townson/Manchester UnitedWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That is perhaps the one flaw of this reimagined Champions League – with just 18 teams featuring in the league phase, the probability is that the eight teams who have to go through the playoffs will have to meet for a second time. It led to a less enticing set of games than there perhaps could have been for the two English sides involved.This tie was practically overafter the away legbut the signs of complacency that crept in on this occasion will have frustrated Slegers. Despite Russo’s early goal putting the host ahead, Leuven challenged a disjointed Arsenal defence and found a deserved equaliser through Pusztai.The context for Arsenal’s issues on this occasion were key. The conditions in Borehamwood were atrocious. The incessant rainfall made for a very heavy pitch. Things improved after the break as Arsenal regained the lead thanks to a quintessential penalty conversion from Caldentey.It took the sting out of Leuven’s tail and Russo added another as the game came to a close.Half of the defensive unit was changed with Lotte Wubben-Moy and Smilla Holmberg coming in and there was a lack of communication which perhaps explained why they were being caught out by the pace of the Leuven attackers.It saw the Gunners cruise through a hotly anticipated encounter against their London rivals.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenLeuven WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

For Pereira, the Kadikoy district of Istanbul represents familiar territory, having lived in the city across two enjoyable but trophyless spells here as a manager, most recently in 2021.Vítor Pereira has no fears about Marinakis ‘fire’ as paths cross again at ForestRead morePereira knows the difficulty of the challenge in Turkey and the players have been well versed by their fourth head coach of the season. On a crisp evening, barring the bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic that trailed Forest’s police escort to the ground from Sabiha Gokcen airport, south-east of the city, for an hour or two it all felt rather serene compared with the febrile atmosphere that will greet them on Thursday in theirEuropa Leagueplayoff first leg.Then there is the chaos that has stalked Forest’s season since they qualified for Europe for the first time since 1995-96. Their journey in this competition provides a snapshot of the story: Nuno Espírito Santo expressing his excitement at facing Porto after the initial draw was made last August, a game which laterproved Sean Dyche’s first in chargein October; the early promise under Ange Postecoglouat Real Betis; Dyche’s last win in the job,a 4-0 rout of Ferencvaros. Now it is over to Pereira to quieten the noise.Has Pereira told his players how to cope with the racket raining down from the stands? “Just to try and block it out as much as you can,” the Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White says.“It’s going to be loud, but all we can do is focus on ourselves. I don’t think you can really prepare for an atmosphere, you just have to focus on your game, the team and try to focus on what you can do to help the team as much as possible.”Pereira believes the key thing is courage and is adamant that he can instil it within a squad that have won three of their past 13 matches in all competitions and none of their past three. Last time outthey failed to beat Wolves, the Premier League’s bottom club, 35 fruitless shots ultimately prompting Forest’s fiercely ambitious owner, Evangelos Marinakis, to sack Dyche.View image in fullscreenMorgan Gibbs-White said: ‘I think as players you get used to change. It is important for us as players to stick together in these moments.’Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesPereira rescued Wolves last season and he is confident of delivering a similar bounce at Forest. “From the first day you can start to give this energy to them, to pass this energy to them,” the new head coach says.“I believe that a team absorbs a lot of the personality of the coach or manager. We need to think about the game as an opportunity to show our qualities to prove ourselves and at the end of the game be proud of what we did and what we showed.”Pereira has had only three training sessions with the squad, including one on arrival in Istanbul, and while he acknowledged it is impossible to load his players with information in such a short window, he is confident his early message has landed. Gibbs-White says the early signs under the Portuguese have been positive. “I think all of the players including myself and the staff are all really excited,” the 26-year-old says.“I think as players you get used to change, because some players come and go, managers come and go. It is important for us as players to stick together in these moments. Since the new manager has come in it has been really exciting, he’s been really clear about what he wants us to do.”Fenerbahce appear in rude health under Domenico Tedesco, the former Belgium and RB Leipzig head coach who took charge last September. A lot of that is to do with the squad at his disposal, which includes Ederson, Marco Asensio, Nélson Semedo and, as of this month, N’Golo Kanté, who joined after two and a half years in the Saudi Pro League. Fenerbahce are unbeaten in the Super Lig, second and gunning for a 29th league title, and their only home defeats this season wereby Aston Villa in Januaryand cross-city rivals Besiktas, based across the Bosphorus, in the Turkish Cup a month earlier.Pereira got to a Turkish Cup final himself with Fenerbahce in 2016, when Galatasaray triumphed. It explains why the 57-year-old was in demand before heading on to the training pitches, a queue of local journalists asking him for selfies. “It is a pleasure to be here, an honour, I have very great memories of the stadium, the supporters, the people, the club,” he says.“I’m very happy to be here again and I hope we can enjoy the game. I’m expecting a game with quality, a lot of talent inside the pitch, with two teams that want to play in a good way and with quality – and a fantastic atmosphere, for sure.”Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestFenerbahceEuropa LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Benfica manager was criticised strongly by the anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out for referencing the Real Madrid forward’s goal celebration when talking about the incident.Vinícius’s allegation that he was racially abused on Tuesday by Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni duringMadrid’s Champions League playoff winin Lisbon prompted Uefa to appoint an ethics and disciplinary inspector to investigate. Benfica said they would collaborate with the investigation but reiterated their support for Prestianni, who they said was “victim” of a “smear campaign”.Vinícius Júnior takes aim at racist ‘cowards’ after Benfica’s defeat by Real MadridRead moreThe game was delayed for 10 minutes, with Madrid’s players initially prepared to walk off, after Prestianni said something to Vinícius while covering his mouth with his shirt. Kylian Mbappé has publicly accused Prestianni of calling Vinícius a monkey five times. Prestianni has denied racist abuse. The Argentinian could face a 10-match ban if charged and found guilty byUefa.Mourinho appeared to criticise Vinícius for his celebration – which he described as “stupid” – after scoring the only goal. The Portuguese manager said to Amazon Prime: “I told him: ‘When you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back.’ They [Vinícius and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don’t believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.”Mourinho then appeared to comment on previous incidents in which Vinícius has been subject to racist abuse. “There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,” he said. “A stadium where Vinícius plays, something happens, always.”Kick It Out responded by saying: “When anyone reports discrimination in football, or anywhere, the first priority is that they are listened to and feel supported. Focusing on Vinícius Jr’s goal celebration or the history of the club, instead of acknowledging the report, is a form of gaslighting.“This approach not only harms the individual affected but also sends the wrong message to others around the world who may have experienced similar situations. Leaders in football have a crucial role in setting standards and moments like these call for responsible leadership that reinforces respect, inclusion and accountability.”The former Netherlands midfielder Clarence Seedorf also criticised Mourinho: “He’s saying it’s OK when Vinícius provokes you … and I think that is very wrong.”Because the referee did not hear what was said and could not include it in his report, Uefa’s inspector must attempt to reach a conclusion as to what happened. That is disputed and demonstrating the facts to a level of certainty that satisfies the committee and complies with “applicable law” is not simple.View image in fullscreenVinícius Junior with Gianluca Prestianni. Uefa said it would ‘investigate allegations of discriminatory behaviour’.Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty ImagesVinícius did not speak after the game but posted a message on Instagram that said: “Racists are above all cowards [who] need to put their shirts over their mouth to demonstrate how weak they are.”When the Brazilian celebrated his goal in the corner, someBenficasupporters threw bottles at him and footage showed at least one fan performing a monkey gesture. The Portuguese authority responsible for combating football‑related violence (APCVD) is to investigate the Prestianni case and reported incidents of racist gestures and noises from Benfica fans.After Prestianni had confronted Vinícius while covering his mouth, Vinícius ran to the referee, with footage appearing to show him reporting the word “mono” (monkey). Mbappé could then be seen repeatedly accusing Prestianni of being a racist.“Vini says the boy said ‘monkey’ with his shirt like this,” Aurélien Tchouaméni told reporters, while gesturing as if to cover his mouth. “Then the boy said that he didn’t say anything, that he saidmaricon[poof,sic] or something, whatever. In the end we spoke as a team and Vini said we have to keep playing.”Prestianni denied using racist language, writing on Instagram: “I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults at Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard. I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received fromReal Madridplayers.”In a post on X, Benfica attached Prestianni’s message, and declared themselves “together by your side”. The club also posted a video of the moment in which Vinícius went to the referee, claiming: “As the images demonstrate, given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they are saying they heard.”Real Madrid are studying footage and audio clips. Uefa’s inspector will do the same and also gather evidence from those involved, including Vinícius and Prestianni.Benfica said they would “collaborate fully” with the investigation. “The club reiterates, clearly and unequivocally, its historic and unwavering commitment to defending the values of equality and inclusion at a club where Eusebio is the greatest symbol,” a statement said.“Benfica reiterate their unwavering support to the version of events put forward by Gianluca Prestianni, whose behaviour within the club has always been guided by a respect for opponents, institutions and the principles that define Benfica’s identity. The club deplores the smear campaign of which the player has been a victim.”In a post on X, Mbappé encouraged Vinícius to keep on dancing, insisting: “We will never let them tell us what to do.”Explore more on these topicsFootballKick It OutJosé MourinhoVinícius JúniorBenficaReal MadridUefanewsShareReuse this content"

In a related development, last week Real ended their five‑year legal battle with Uefa bywithdrawing formally from the European Super League. They appear ready to fall in line with the global football establishment led by Infantino, Ceferin and Nasser al-Khelaifi, the Paris Saint‑Germain president who chairs European Football Clubs.The Guardianrevealed before the Club World Cupin the US last summer that Fifa was open to expanding the tournament from 32 teams, primarily to guarantee the participation of more of the biggest European clubs after Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United failed to qualify.Infantino then said in a speech at the general assembly of European Football Clubs in Rome last October that expansion was on the agenda, sayingFifawas working “to see how we can make this event bigger, even better, even more impactful”.Uefa’s opposition was a potentially significant obstacle, but another remains with Fifa subject to legal action from the lobby group European Leagues that has been taken to the European Commission. That relates to the international match calendar, including decisions concerning the Club World Cup.While some at Uefa remain concerned that the huge financial rewards of the Club World Cup will have a destabilising effect on European football, an expansion to 48 clubs is regarded as less disruptive than making it a biennial event.Although the fine detail has yet to be agreed, European clubs would be among the main beneficiaries of the expansion, with the number of Uefa qualifiers likely to increase from 12 last year to 16 in 2029. Chelsea won £85m from the competition’s £774m prize pot forwinning it last yearand adding more European teams would have implications for the competitive balance of the Champions League.Uefa’s position is the latest sign of improved relations with Fifa, which reached a nadir when Ceferin and a group of European delegates including the Football Association chair, Debbie Hewitt, staged a walkout at Fifa congress in Paraguay last May in protest at the late arrival of Infantino, who had been on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East involving Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman. With Ceferin and Infantino likely to seek re-election for fourth terms next year, sources close to both men have indicated that a period of calm is in both their interests.Spain and Morocco are favourites to host the next Club World Cup, which will take place in the summer of 2029, before their co‑hosting of the 2030 World Cup.Uefa declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsClub World CupUefaFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

By the end, he was clearly disenchanted, describing his first year atFerrarias a “nightmare”.F1 2026: a look at the cars for the new season – in picturesRead moreThe Scuderia have looked promising in pre-season, and in Bahrain at the third and final test Hamilton, who has regrouped over the winter, presented a buoyant figure, optimistic about the forthcoming challenge.“I’ve gone through quite a bit and left everything, all of last year, behind me,” he said. “I spent a lot of time rebuilding over this winter, refocusing, really getting my body and my mind to a much better place. I generally feel personally in the best place that I’ve been in a long time with rearranging things within my team.”Hamilton joined Ferrari at the end of a stable period of regulations and with the car already designed but this season, having been in place with the team, he has had the chance to help shape the new model.“Last year we were locked into a car that ultimately I inherited,” he said. “This is a car that I’ve been able to be a part of developing on the simulator for the last 10 months, eight months and so like a bit of my DNA is within it, so I’m more connected to this one for sure.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton puts his new Ferrari to the test in Bahrain.Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersThe British driver was also clear that, despite the travails of 2025, he was committed to a long‑term project at Ferrari. “My belief in the team is still absolutely the same. I understand the faith in this team and what they’re capable of and that’s why I joined the team.“I knew it wasn’t going to be an overnight thing where we’d have success immediately, that’s why I signed a longer deal, because I knew it was a process and I feel like we’ve also learned a huge amount from last year as a team.”The FIA, the sport’s governing body, will attempt to end the row over Mercedes’s controversial use of a loophole in the regulations involving the compression ratio of their engine. It is believed Mercedes have stolen a march on their rivals by exploiting a higher ratio than the 16:1 mandated when the engine is running because it is measured when “cold”, or at ambient temperatures.The other engine manufacturers have been aggrieved at what they see as an unfair advantage, if one that is still within the letter of the regulations. After a meeting of the power unit advisory committee, the FIA has allowed a proposal that as of 1 August – after 13 of the season’s 24 races – the rules would be changed so that the compression ratio would also be measured at a representative operating temperature of 130°C. The vote on the proposal will be decided in the next 10 days and requires a super-majority of five of the seven on the committee, which consists of the FIA, F1 and the five manufacturers, Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull, Audi and Honda.George Russell topped the timesheets for Mercedes on the firstday of the final test, from McLaren’s Oscar Piastri and Ferrari’s Leclerc. The session concluded with a test of a new starting procedure the FIA is evaluating because of concerns that cars at the back of the grid would not have time to reach the necessary revs to bring the turbo up to speed before the lights go out. An additional hold of five seconds was trialled before the usual start sequence began and all the cars did get off the line successfully.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Lewis HamiltonFerrariMercedes GPFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

With the exception, it turns out, of Princess Anne who was involved in a case of mistaken identity during the Calcutta Cup pre-match formalitiesat Murrayfield last Saturday.Clearly unaware Marler had retired from rugby 15 months ago, the Princess Royal stopped for a chat with her new favourite prop while being introduced to the England team in her role as patron of Scottish Rugby. She even confided how amusing she had found him on Celebrity Traitors, which would have been fine had the player in front of her been Marler rather than another bearded English front-rower, Joe Heyes.Pollock promotion reflects England’s need to banish Murrayfield blues | Robert KitsonRead more“She thought I was Joe Marler which was … quite upsetting,” said Heyes. “She said: ‘You’re awfully funny on TV.’” To his credit, the 26-year-old Leicester tighthead – “I was a bit starstruck to start with” – did his best to avoid a diplomatic incident. “Who am I to correct her? I didn’t really know what to say. I almost went with it.”The princess has been patron of Scottish Rugby since 1986 and her daughter Zara is married to Mike Tindall, an England World Cup winner. She is not the first person, however, to mix up Marler and Heyes.View image in fullscreenThe England bearded prop Joe Heyes, not Joe Marler.Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport/Getty Images“I’ve had all sorts about me looking like Joe Marler, but not from a royal,” said Heyes, who was winning his 19th cap for England. The Leicester forward, however, stressed that last Saturday’s encounter had still been a special one. “I do like it when you get to meet the patron of whatever union you’re playing against. It’s a very cool moment.”Marler, 35, who won 95 caps for England before retiring from rugby in November 2024, has become an increasingly familiar public face sinceappearing on the BBC’s Celebrity Traitors. A slightly incongruous contestant in the castle alongside Stephen Fry, Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross, he reached the final round before being voted out.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unionThe TraitorsnewsShareReuse this content"

To satisfy the unprecedented demand, they have taken ownership of the venue of their great rivals, Hull FC, for one night only – with 25,000 supporters, double the capacity of their Craven Park home, buying tickets in record time.Opening shocks could set scene for most unpredictable Super League yetRead moreIt is a far cry from the many nadirs Hudgell has experienced during his 25-year ownership of the club. Rovers have languished in the sport’s second tier for lengthy periods during that time, coming close to financial ruin on more than one occasion. But they have risen as aSuper Leagueforce, culminating with the historic treble last year, their first trophies for 40 years.Hudgell, more than most given the millions he has invested into his boyhood club, will take pride at how far they have come and specifically where they have come from. “I vividly remember the old Craven Park, crowds of barely more than 1,000. People just weren’t really interested in Hull KR for long periods of time. The old ground had a greyhound track running around it, we’d all be mucking in to get the pitch playable. There was one food kiosk.View image in fullscreenNeil Hudgell lifts the Challenge Cup at Wembley, the first of three trophies Hull KR won last season.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA“Everyone knew each other by name because it was more akin to a religion of habit rather than any sense of belief you could go on and achieve something. We’ve waited a hell of a long time for this.”Hudgell was in the crowd as a boy the last time Hull KR faced Australian opposition, when the last great Rovers side defeated a touring Queensland team 8-6. It was 1983 and at their peak, until now, at least. By the time the 1990s arrived, financial problems emerged and Rovers began the Super League era in the third tier.For Hull KR to be champions of the rugby league world … well that’s immortality stuff isn’t it?Neil Hudgell“I’ve seen 10 years of absolutely everything and 30 years of nothing,” Hudgell says, smiling. “The moral of the story here is to take nothing for granted. I grew up with Hull KR being a great team. Thursday is the moment of a return to those nights and those days, but I’m very conscious nothing lasts for ever. I hope people embrace the moment like I’m going to.”The people of Hull – one side of it, at least – appear to have certainly done that. Hull KR’s decision to move the game across the city with Craven Park not being big enough raised eyebrows, but the switch has been vindicated. Rovers’ crowds flirted around the 7,000 mark in recent times, but last year more than 11,000 attended every match.The game represents a chance to solidify Hull KR’s position at the top of the sport and attract a whole new generation of supporters to the club, with Hull KR’s Super League stars such as the England half-back Mikey Lewis going toe-to-toe with the Brisbane and Kangaroos superstar Reece Walsh.“We probably could get over 15,000 people in at Craven Park,” Hudgell says. “There’s thousands on a waiting list and that job has been done quietly in the background. A few years ago, the demographic was basically me: older, middle-aged white males. But we’ve worked to get young kids invested and I suppose that’s what you’re going to see when it’s full on Thursday.”View image in fullscreenThe Brisbane and Kangaroos superstar Reece Walsh will bring stardust to Hull on Thursday.Photograph: Mark Nolan/Getty ImagesBrisbane are heavy favourites, with Hull KR reeling froma surprise defeat in the Super League openerlast week against the promoted York Knights. But the odds have been stacked against English sides before and Hudgell is acutely aware of the opportunity to join Leeds, Wigan and St Helens by being crowned world champions.“I’m always asked whether it’s been worth it; the blood, sweat, tears and investment,” Hudgell says. “I would have always said no right up until the day we completed that treble. We now have a legacy in the history of the sport and the city of Hull. That made it a yes for me.“To lay a World Club Challenge on top of that, for Hull KR to be champions of the rugby league world … well, that’s immortality stuff isn’t it? There has never been a world champion team in Hull. To be the first, that’s pretty much what you dream of.”Explore more on these topicsHull KRBrisbane BroncosRugby leagueSuper LeagueNRLAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The two superpowers have so far developed the most powerful AI systems.The fourthintergovernmental AI summit, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, follows editions in the UK, Korea and France and is focusing on harnessing AI to the benefit of countries in the global south, for example by embracing more regional languages and applying AI to improving agriculture and public health.It is also aiming to improve safety standards, which some experts fear are falling short of addressingthe potential catastrophic risksbeing posed by the most advanced AIs amid White House opposition to red tape.“A lot of countries who aren’t the United States of America and who aren’t the People’s Republic of China essentially face two kind of slightly contradictory feelings at the same time,” Osborne said. “The first is a Fomo: are we missing out on this huge technological revolution? How to be part of it? How do we make sure that our companies feel the benefits of it? How do we make sure our societies feel the benefits of it?”At the same time, he said, these countries wanted to safeguard their national sovereignty while relying on powerful AIs controlled in the US and China.Osborne said: “There’s another kind of sovereignty, which is: don’t be left behind, because then you will be a weaker nation, a poorer nation, a nation whose workforce will be less willing to stay put.”His comments came as the White House’s senior AI adviser, Sriram Krishnan, emphasised the Trump administration’s desire for AI supremacy, telling the summit: “We want to make sure the world uses our AI model.”He also took a fresh swipe at the EU’s attempts to regulate AI, saying he would continue to “rant” against them.“The EU AI Act is not really very conducive to an entrepreneur who wants to build innovative technology,” he said.Europeans are dangerously reliant on US tech. Now is a good time to build our own | Johnny RyanRead moreBut other technologists, and AI leaders inAfrica, said the case for reliance on the two AI superpowers was not so clearcut.“The idea that countries other than China and the US won’t be able to build big things – and we [hear] that a lot – is actually a false premise,” Mark Surman, the head of Mozilla, said. “It benefits the companies within those two countries.”“For us, it’s not a US or China thing,” said Kevin Degila, in charge of of AI and data at theBeningovernment’s digital agency. “We are Africans and our job is to collaborate [with each other] to build our own AI.”He said 64 languages were spoken in his country of 15 million people and the government agency was building AIs for the public that fuse both American and Chinese AI technologies and their own large language datasets.“Anthropic andOpenAIdon’t reach the farmers,” he said.Paula Ingabire, Rwanda’s minister of ICT and innovation, said her country was looking at partnerships with AI companies “that are going to be progressively less necessary”, withRwandanot wishing to be “locked into very dependent partnerships”.Also speaking at the summit was Rishi Sunak, the former UK prime minister, who now advises one of OpenAI’s main rivals, Anthropic, and Microsoft.He urged political leaders to take bolder steps to lead the rollout of AI, saying: “If you are a prime minister you can only do a few things that you drive personally, and this has to be one of them.”“One of my concerns is that I think some political leaders think that AI is going to be tomorrow’s issue, where I think they need to recognise that it’s an ‘action this day’ issue,” Sunak said. “AI needs to go to a centralised responsibility so we can realise the benefits.”Explore more on these topicsGeorge OsborneOpenAIAI (artificial intelligence)Global economyEconomicsTrump administrationIndianewsShareReuse this content"

They name Sarina Esmailzadeh – who died in September 2022 aged 16 after being beaten by Iranian security forces during the protests, according to an Amnesty International investigation. Iranian officials claimed she killed herself.Bono sings: “Sarina, Sarina, she’s the song of the future playing in my mind.” In his interview, he characterises Iran’s ruling class as “a priestly class of men whose subjective interpretation of sacred text becomes a club to beat the heads in of anyone who disagrees”.The song One Life at a Time is aboutAwdah Hathaleen, a Palestinian activist who was killed in the West Bank in July 2025 by an Israeli settler. Hathaleen had worked on the Oscar-winning film No Other Land. Bono called the killing “heinous” and said he hoped the song would be “a balm”.The Tears of Things takes its name from the book by Richard Rohr, which applies wisdom from Jewish prophets to address violence and anger today. The lyrics imagine a conversation between Michelangelo’s David and its sculptor. The EP also features the recitation of a poem by Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai, entitledWildpeace, read by Nigerian musician Adeola with music from U2.Bono said: “It’s the moral force of Judaism that helped shape western civilisation,” and celebrated Jewish “mathematicians, scientists, writers, not to mention songwriters”. He added: “As with Islamophobia, antisemitism must be countered every time we witness it. The rape, murder and abduction of Israelis on 7 October was evil, but self-defence is no defence for the sweeping brutality of Netanyahu’s response.”He also acknowledged the lives lost and displaced during conflict in Sudan, and criticised the Trump administration for cutting US foreign aid.Ed Sheeran guests on the closing track, Yours Eternally, alongside Ukrainian musician turned soldier Taras Topolia, who inspired the song, which is sung as a letter from a soldier on duty in the conflict with Russia. Sheeran had initially brokered a meeting between Topolia, Bono and the Edge, which then happened when the three played a set in a Kyiv metro station converted into a bomb shelter, in May 2022.View image in fullscreenBono and The Edge performing with Taras Topolia in a metro station bomb shelter in Kyiv, 8 May 2022.Photograph: Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty Images“Ask anyone in east Germany or Poland or Latvia if they think Putin will stop at Ukraine if he can get away with it?” Bono said. “He’d find an excuse to invadeIrelandif it suited his purposes.” He hailed Sheeran as a “whirling dervish of a talent” and Topolia as having “this dark sense of humour and defiant spirit that we love about the best rock’n’roll music”.A short documentary accompanying Yours Eternally, directed by Ukrainian film-maker Ilya Mikhaylus, who was embedded with frontline Ukrainian soldiers, will be released on 24 February to mark the fourth anniversary of the Russian invasion.U2 have released a few one-off new songs in recent years, such as Atomic City and Your Song Saved My Life. In 2023, they released the album Songs of Surrender, featuring reworkings of earlier songs, and in 2024 they released unheard material from the sessions for 2004 album How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. But they haven’t put out an album or EP of new material since the 2017 album Songs of Experience.In the accompanying fanzine, The Edge wrote: “We believe in a world where borders are not erased by force. Where culture, language and memory are not silenced by fear. Where the dignity of a people is not negotiable. This belief isn’t temporary. It isn’t political fashion. It’s the ground we stand on. And we stand there together.”Larry Mullen Jr added in an interview: “Going way back to our earliest days, working with Amnesty or Greenpeace, we’ve never shied away from taking a position and sometimes that can get a bit messy, there’s always some sort of blowback, but it’s a big side of who we are and why we still exist.”Drummer Mullen Jr was absent from U2’s concert residency at the Las Vegas Sphere, as he recovered from neck surgery. He added: “Being honest, I wasn’t sure if I’d get back to playing at all so it was a big deal to be back.” He said he had adapted his posture at the kit to enable him to play, as well as changing his “approach and intention” to the music.Elsewhere in the zine, bassist Adam Clayton shared his cultural picks (including the band Geese and writer Deborah Levy) and heralded the importance of “tolerance, freedom and choosing not to jump to judgment”.Bono also outlined his vision for a “radical centre” in politics.View image in fullscreenCover art for U2 - Days Of Ash.Photograph: PR“The death of truth is the birth of evil,” he said. “I have confidence the righteous will rise up against this aberration. I have many dear conservative friends who are as worried about the far right as my democratic ones are worried about the far left. Surely the world needs a ‘radical centre’ that draws from both traditions.”U2 also confirmed a long-rumoured new album, saying it would arrive later in the year and be totally separate to the EP material.“The songs on Days of Ash are very different in mood and theme to the ones we’re going to put on our album later in the year,” Bono said. “These EP tracks couldn’t wait; these songs were impatient to be out in the world. They are songs of defiance and dismay, of lamentation … because for all the awfulness we see normalised daily on our small screens, there’s nothing normal about these mad and maddening times and we need to stand up to them before we can go back to having faith in the future. And each other.”He added: “Songs of celebration will follow, we’re working on those now,” saying that the new album would have “a carnival vibe … a more defiantly joyful feel”.Despite the political content of the EP, and U2’s songwriting and activism more generally over the years, he acknowledged that “we have to be sparing with our amplification [of political messaging] … I suggest rationing the bad news as there’s only so much a soul can take”.Explore more on these topicsU2Pop and rockIrelandICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

However, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday that it had seen an email to claimants from their legal team which said UCL had agreed to pay £21m to settle the lawsuit.Neither UCL nor lawyers representing the students would confirm the figure, but it is likely to send shock waves through the university sector, which is already facing severe financial challenges.Pre-action claim letters have been sent to 36 universities in England and Wales, including Bath, Bristol, Cardiff, Exeter, Imperial College London, Leeds, Liverpool and Warwick, but more institutions could find themselves targeted.Shimon Goldwater, partner at Asserson solicitors, and Adam Zoubir, partner at Harcus Parker solicitors, who are jointly representing students, said: “As the terms of the settlement between the claimants and UCL are confidential, we are unable to make any comment beyond what we have stated previously.“However, we can confirm that, since the UCL settlement was announced, approximately 30,000 additional claimants who attended universities during the pandemic have joined Student Group Claim. We continue to advance the next stage of the litigation on behalf of affected students.”The legal action is being brought under consumer law, which states that where a consumer pays for a service but is provided with a different service of lower value, they may be entitled to compensation.Lawyers argue that students paid annual tuition fees for in-person teaching and full access to facilities, but Covid restrictions meant their courses moved online and campuses were closed for significant periods.Fees for online degree courses are typically 25-50% less than those for traditional in-person courses, and the students’ lawyers maintain their clients are owed “fair financial compensation”.Dr Michael Spence, UCL president and provost, said last week: “Covid-19 created disruption across society, and universities were no exception. Throughout the pandemic we provided clear routes for students to seek redress, and many secured compensation through those established processes.“This resolution enables us to focus on our core mission of delivering world-leading research and education.”Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesHigher educationStudent experienceStudentsnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023 and 2024, it was up to more than 60 days a year.“These sorts of changes that we have seen increase the likelihood in a lot of areas that there will be fires that are going to be very challenging to suppress,” said study co-author John Abatzoglou, a fire scientist at the University of California, Merced.The researchers did not look at fires but weather conditions: warm, with strong winds and dry air and ground.“It increases the likelihood of widespread fire outbreaks, but the weather is one dimension,” said study lead author Cong Yin, a fire researcher at University of California, Merced. The other big ingredients to fires are oxygen, fuel such as trees and brush, and ignition such as lightning or arson or human accidents.This study is important because extreme fire weather is the primary – but not only – factor in increasing fire impacts across the globe, said fire scientist Mike Flannigan of Thompson Rivers University in Canada, who wasn’t part of the study. And it’s also important because regions that used to have fire seasons at different times and could share resources are now overlapping, he said.Abatzoglou said: “And that’s where things begin to break.”More than 60% of the global increase in synchronous fire weather days can be attributed to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Yin said. He and his colleagues know this because they used computer simulations to compare what has happened in the past 45 years with a fictional world without the increased greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels.The continental US, from 1979 to 1988, averaged 7.7 synchronous fire weather days a year. But in the last 10 years that average was up to 38 days a year, according to Yin.But that is nothing compared to the southern half of South America. That region averaged 5.5 synchronous fire weather days a year from 1979 to 1988; over the last decade, that’s risen to 70.6 days a year, including 118 days in 2023.Of 14 global regions, only south-east Asia saw a decrease in synchronous fire weather, probably because it is getting more humid there, Yin said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

He said they had tried to restore existing patches of banksia woodland and been unable to bring it back to its original state.“This is not simple gardening,” he said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBiodiversity offsetting is meant to compensate for the environmental damage caused by development by providing an equal or greater environmental benefit elsewhere. But offsetting has been beset with problems, including that promised offsets are sometimes never delivered or they fail to adequately compensate for the environmental loss.Like other capital cities around the country, Perth is facing a housing crunch, with the median housing price in the WA capital surpassing the $1m mark.Some new developments areplacing increased pressure on already threatened ecosystems such as the banksia woodland.Species in the woodland include herbaceous plants, flowering woody shrubs and native sedges. A canopy storey contains banksias and eucalypts.In addition to threatened Baudin’s and Carnaby’s black cockatoos, the habitat also supports insect communities and animals such as the honey possum.Dixon said it was the collective mix of species that created the “broader ecological balance” for a resilient banksia woodland ecological community “with a unique assemblage of species that are not represented elsewhere”.Of the three housing developments – two in the south of Perth and one in the north – one was approved by the federal environment department last yearand the other two are under assessment.Most of the offset options put forward by Emerge Associates would involve trying to create banksia woodland from scratch within stands of tuart woodland in public reserves. Tuart, if it meets the right conditions, is a critically endangered ecosystem in its own right.Dixon said the tuart woodlands had the wrong soil and canopy type to support a true banksia woodland. He said the two ecosystems had some common species and it was possible for a simple type of banksia woodland to exist within a tuart woodland, but not the same type of complex banksia ecosystem that was being cleared.He said that meant the offsets proposed were unlikely to result in a like-for-like environmental benefit and there would be a net loss of banksia woodland as it was pushed closer to the critically endangered category.The AustralianConservationFoundation’s national biodiversity policy officer, Brendan Sydes, said the proposals highlighted concerns that offsetting, rather than being a last resort, had become a tool to facilitate development at the expense of vulnerable species and ecosystems.“These examples demonstrate that there’s an overreliance on offsets and an optimistic assumption about the ability to recreate ecosystems when in many cases the answer should be ‘no, don’t destroy the habitat’,” Sydes said.“We’ve just got to the point where there’s so little left that the priority should be protection.”Following the passage of amendments to Australia’s national environmental laws last year, detailed rules for offsets are under development.“It’s critical that it delivers a clampdown on when offsets can be used, and that new rules and offsets funds don’t actually end up acting as habitat destruction accelerators by facilitating inappropriate use of biodiversity offsets,” Sydes said.A spokesperson for the federal environment department said in the case of the housing development it had approved, it had worked closely with the environmental consultancy to “ensure the offset is achievable and aligns with a banksia [threatened ecological] community that is known to coexist with tuart woodlands”.They said that project was approved with “rigorous” conditions to deliver and monitor the offset.They could not comment on the two developments still under assessment. They said federal offset policy did not prevent offsets on land that was publicly owned.A spokesperson for Emerge Associates said there had been a public consultation process for each development, including their proposed offsets, and public feedback was reflected in the assessment documentation.They noted some of the developments were still being considered by the department.Explore more on these topicsEndangered habitatsPerthEndangered speciesHousingWestern AustraliaConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

But one thing is certain: now, there are two of them.Until last week, experts believed there wasonly one wild beaverliving in Pensthorpe nature reserve, about 20 miles outside Norwich. But just in time for Valentine’s Day, two were caught on camera going for a late-night swim together and grooming each other by the riverbank.The couple are the first wild pair to settle in Norfolk since the early 16th century. The age and sex of the beavers is unknown. “We won’t know for sure whether they’re a breeding pair until the camera shows they have kits, but they’re quite well bonded and they’re living together and behaving as a family unit,” said the reserve’s manager, Richard Spowage. “They are clearly wild animals. They’re not interacting with us at all, they’re avoiding us completely.”Footage of a lone beaver establishing a lodge on the reserve made headlines in December when the Guardian revealed it was the first free-living beaver recorded in Norfolk in more than 500 years.Spowage now suspects both beavers built the “family-size” lodge but only one had been captured on camera. “Beavers are very hard to catch on camera, especially as a pair.”Norfolk beaversThe native species has been re-establishing itself in the English countryside since 2015, when alitter of wild kits was born in Devon, but how a pair of beavers managed to get all the way to Norfolk remains a mystery.It has been almost a year since the government decided to grant licences for wild beaver releases, but only two pairs and a family have been legally released so far, inCornwalland inSomersetearlier this month.Spowage suspects that the beavers were illegally released last year, a practice known as“beaver bombing”, which the reserve does not support. “We don’t condone it, but our view is that now we have these animals here, playing a role in the ecosystem that was missing from our river, it’s our responsibility to protect them.”He said he was relieved to discover there was a second beaver. “Beavers live in family groups. They’re not brought up to be lone animals.”In just three months, the animals had cleared debris from the river without affecting water levels, Spowage said, adding: “You can now see a lovely riverbed, with sand and gravel starting to reappear at the base, which is really amazing. They’re opening up little glades along the river edge, where they’ve taken down willows and birches. That will let sun into the river, encouraging vegetation and invertebrates to grow and fisheries to improve.”Prof George Holmes, who sits on a government advisory group for species reintroduction, said there was a “lot of frustration” among people who wanted to release beavers, because they perceived the licensing application process as unnecessarily costly and time-consuming.Beavers’ dams could cause flooding and their burrows could undermine the banks of rivers and watercourses, he said, and once a beaver was released into the wild, it was classed as an ordinarily resident species in the UK, with protected status. “Introducing a species isn’t straightforward and it can go badly wrong.”But he added: “In a nature reserve, it [the beaver] won’t be causing too many problems.”Spowage would like to see other beavers legally introduced into the River Wensum. “Genetically, you can’t have just one pair of beavers on the river,” he said. “This is our opportunity to return an animal to our river system which has been missing for 500 years.”Natural England, the government advisory body, said it was investigating the reports of beavers at Pensthorpe and “working closely” with the reserve on the matter.As well as Cornwall, Somerset, Devon and Kent, wild beavers could also be found in England in Hampshire, Wiltshire and Herefordshire, according to the Beaver Trust, a charity that aims to restore beavers to regenerate landscapes. A Guardian reader also reportedseeing one in his garden in Berkshire.Since 2021, the Scottish government has formally allowed the movement and release of beavers and thepopulation there is estimated at 1,500. A wild beaver has also beenspotted on the River Dyfinear Machynlleth in Wales.Explore more on these topicsNorfolkAnimalsWildlifeConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

The data transmitted enabled analysts to determine their precise and real-world fuel consumption, as opposed to that stated in the vehicles’ official EU approved certification.Only seven new petrol-powered cars sold in Norway in JanuaryRead morePHEVs, cars which combine a petrol or diesel engine with a battery-powered electric motor that is charged from an external energy point, give drivers the flexibility to be able to switch between the ecologically safer power source, and the more conventional, but environmentally more damaging one, as and when conditions allow. Manufacturers typically market the vehicles as energy efficient. On paper at least, the vehicles are said to use much less fuel, between one and two litres per 100km, than conventional cars. However environmental groups have long since voiced scepticism over the claims.According to the study, the vehicles require on average six litres per 100km, or about 300%, more fuel to run than previously cited.The scientists of the Fraunhofer Institute found that the main reason for the higher-than-stated fuel usage was due precisely to the fact that the PHEVs use two different modes, the electric engine and the combustion engine, switching between both. Until now it has been claimed by manufacturers that the vehicles used only a little or almost no fuel when in the electric mode. The studies showed that this was not in fact the case.Patrick Plötz of the Fraunhofer Institute told German broadcaster SWR they suspected that the combustion engine in PHEVs is triggered to turn on far more frequently than previously thought. German-manufactured PHEVs were among those with the highest average fuel consumption, with the high-end Porsche model performing worst.Rural drivers to face steepest bills under UK’s mileage-based electric vehicle taxRead morePlötz urged regulators to use the real-world emissions data. “Then one could say a manufacturer who does not comply with the (emissions) limits on the road may have to pay a penalty,” he said.Porsche hybrids consumed more fuel – around seven litres per 100km – than other PHEVs when the electric motor kicks in, and significantly more than non-PHEVs in combustion engine mode. The lowest fuel consumption levels were found in the cheaper end of the PHEV market, in Kia, Toyota, Ford and Renault vehicles, which often used under one litre per 100km, or as much as 85% less fuel than the Porsche.Asked by SWR, which published the results of the study on Wednesday, how to explain the discrepancy, Porsche referred to “differing usage patterns”, which it said influenced fuel consumption. Porsche insisted its fuel consumption measurements were in line with legal requirements, stating: “The fuel consumption figures of our vehicles are based on the legally prescribed EU measurement procedures.” These, it said, ensured “uniform and comparable values across Europe”.“Deviations from individual real-world consumption figures can arise due to different usage profiles and external conditions,” such as road conditions, or driver behaviour, the company told SWR.The scientists have called on EU regulators to adjust their measurements to fit the real-world findings, urging stricter controls as to how fuel consumption of plug-in hybrids is measured. According to the findings, the CO2 limits a car manufacturer’s fleet of vehicles is allowed to emit on average needs to be urgently adjusted.Contacted by SWR, the EU Commission, which is responsible for CO2 limits, declined to comment on the findings.The German Association of the Automotive Industry said it believed that existing measures to determine fuel consumption and CO2 emissions were reliable.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoringGreenhouse gas emissionsTravel and transportEthical and green livingnewsShareReuse this content"

And I suspect more of them are incontinent than are willing to tell us.”The agony of ketamine addiction: ‘I felt like I was peeing glass’Read moreCorbett said most of their patients were 14 to 15, with many reporting they had been using ketamine for one or two years, suggesting some are taking up the drug at 12.Excessive use of the drug can cause problems as ketamine and its breakdown products sit in the bladder for a long time, where they can damage the lining and muscle tissue.This causes inflammation and the bladder to decrease in size, with the main symptom being an urgent need to urinate frequently. In extreme cases it can lead to the bladder needing to be removed or to kidney problems.“We need to shout loudly about this because if we can encourage them to stop using, that will potentially save themselves a miserable life of medical interventions,” said Corbett. “There is a point at which you can’t recover.”There is still little research on exactly how many young people are using ketamine in the UK.A 2023 NHSEnglandsurvey of more than 13,000 students in 185 schools found that 0.9% of 15‑year‑olds had used ketamine, up from 0.4% in 2013, and 11% had been offered the drug. But medical professionals fear numbers could be higher than the data shows.Prof Rachel Isba, a consultant in paediatric public health medicine who runs the clinic alongside Corbett, said: “There are probably many other children and young people out there who have bladder symptoms, or non-specific tummy pain, which may be due to their ketamine use but you need somebody to make the connection.“We need to be specifically asking about ketamine use, but the vast majority of GPs and paediatricians in the UK will never have seen a child who’s used ketamine.”The pair set up the clinic after what started as a “slow trickle” of cases in 2023, a “handful” in 2024 and then an escalating number in 2025.Corbett said: “The numbers were going up and I was beginning to think, wow, this could be a problem. What are we going to do? It’s on everyone’s radar now because it’s snowballed; it’s gone a bit crazy.”‘Absolutely frightening’: surge in ketamine cases hits urology wards in England and WalesRead moreThe clinic combines Corbett’s expertise in dealing with bladder problems in children with Isba’s knowledge of tackling addiction and referring young people to rehabilitation services.The reasons behind the surge in ketamine use are also unclear. Isba said young people might take the drug socially but become addicted and start doing it at home in their bedroom. Their patients may have experienced childhood trauma, and many also have some form of neurodivergence, particularly ADHD.“What we hear from the kids is: ket is great, it’s a break from your busy brain or just a bit of a rest,” said Isba. “They want to belong. So they feel if they don’t participate, they won’t be able to. We’ve heard stories of young people who’ve changed the entire way they go about their day in order to avoid being exposed to other people’s ketamine use.”Another emerging issue is that many children are starting to use ketamine to ease the pain caused by their bladder problems. Corbett said: “When they get bad bladder pain, for some of the only pain relief they find that is helpful is ketamine. So they get into a very nasty downward spiral.”Explore more on these topicsHealthDrugsYoung peopleChildrenNHSLiverpoolEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The girl has cerebral palsy, cannot eat, walk or talk, and is only expected to live until she is 29.The high court in 2015 awarded her parents a £6.8m lump sum and £350,000-a-year payments to cover the costs of their daughter receiving 24/7 care from two carers. But it also ruled that CCC could not pursue compensation for earnings she would never have as a result of her injuries.Her family took that decision to the supreme court using a “leapfrog appeal”, meaning it went straight to the UK’s highest court. The five justices who heard their appeal upheld it by a majority of four to one.Drydale said: “This ruling will make childbirth negligence cases more expensive for theNHSto settle. It will mean more compensation.“Undoubtedly, there will be more compensation for the NHS in future in cases where children have had their life shortened as a result of being a victim of negligence.“It’s unconscionable that children have been prevented from pursuing such damages until now.”Campaign urges NHS to improve diagnosis of potentially life-threatening childbirth conditionRead moreThe court’s ruling overturns more than 40 years of legal practice since the high court ruled, in the case of Croke v Wiseman in 1981, that children could not make “lost years” claims.“I welcome the excellent reasoning of the law lords, who have set out that the court of appeal’s decision in Croke v Wiseman is inconsistent with other case law. They have overturned this out of date and unjust decision,” added Drydale.The high court will now rule on the family’s bid to receive £800,000 in further damages. That is to reflect what their daughter would have earned while working and receiving a pension, based on average earnings and average pension sums, between the ages of 29 and 85, which is the average life expectancy for a woman in the UK.Paul Whiteing, the chief executive of the patient safety charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said: “This judgment will undoubtedly add to an already significant cost of clinical negligence. But as parliament’s public accounts committee recently said, preventing harm from happening in the first place is the most effective way to reduce the widespread impact of clinical negligence.”Jodi Newton, the head of birth and paediatric negligence at Osbornes Law, said: “This is a monumental ruling for the many children and young people left with serious and life-changing injuries as a result of medical negligence.”Explore more on these topicsNHSEnglandChildrenUK supreme courtChildbirthHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Our libraries serve all the residents of Lancashire.”Reform-led Worcestershire set to issue England’s largest council tax riseRead moreThe move, which appears to have taken fellow councillors by surprise, was sharply criticised by other parties.“Mean-spirited is an understatement,” said David Whipp, a Liberal Democrat county councillor. “It’s a vicious attack on some of the most marginalised people and no doubt driven by Reform’s xenophobic tendencies.“I would urge them to reconsider and like in the Wizard of Oz try and find some heart.”A City of Sanctuary UK spokesperson said: “We are disappointed that Lancashire county council has chosen not to renew its Library of Sanctuary award.Reform UK’s Kent council faces ‘extreme risk’ after passing first budgetRead more“Achieved in 2023, this accreditation recognised Lancashire’s libraries as welcoming, inclusive spaces for everyone in the community.

Last month, local leadersreversed their planto sell off five council-run care homes to save £4m a year after a public outcry.Stephen Atkinson, the Reform leader of Lancashire county council, said in January the group was on track “to make £65m worth of savings and efficiencies”, however the Conservatives have claimed it began some of these initiatives before it lost power in May 2025.Atkinson has defended plans to increase council tax by 3.8% despite previously pledging to “cut waste and reduce taxes”. He said “some branch people” may have made comments about council tax freezes but that “officially, from the party, that was never the position”.Lancashire county council has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsLancashireLibrariesRefugeesReform UKLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

He also called on Belgium to do “a much better job” on antisemitism.Circumcision is legal in Belgium but must be carried out under strict conditions by a medical professional. The investigation concerns three mohels, or ritual circumcisers, in Antwerp suspected of performing circumcisions without any medical training.White’s post drew animmediate rebukefrom Belgium’s foreign minister, Maxime Prévot. “Any suggestion Belgium is antisemitic is false, offensive, and unacceptable,” Prévot said, accusing the ambassador of violating “fundamental diplomatic norms”.White responded that Belgium should change its law or label the investigation into “three beautiful religiously qualified and wonderful men” antisemitic. Accusations that he was interfering in Belgium’s judicial affairs were a “political distraction”, he said.After being summoned to the foreign ministry on Tuesday, White insisted there was “no need” for him to apologise. He had “explained our position and that of President Trump and of our country”, he said, and hoped Belgium could “legalise this process”.Belgian authorities said White had been reminded of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, adding: “Personal attacks on a member of the government and interference in Belgium’s internal affairs are contrary to these basic diplomatic rules.”The ministry said in its statement that while Belgium attached great importance to its relationship with the US, dialogue “must be based on respect for our institutions and our sovereignty”. It reaffirmed its condemnation of antisemitism and racism.The Belgian newspaper De Morgen reported on Wednesday thatWhite had handed an official complaintto Belgium’s top diplomat at the meeting, demanding “immediate condemnation” of statements by Conner Rousseau, the leader of the Flemish socialist Vooruit party.Rousseaulast month postedthat the “gruesome” behaviour of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the US showed “history was repeating itself” and “we have not listened” to the calls of “never again” after the horrors of Nazi Germany.Rousseau said on Wednesday he was unrepentant. “I posted that on social media five weeks ago, and yesterday it suddenly turns out to be a problem,” he said. “I suspect [White’s] intervention regarding the circumcision did not go as he would have liked.”Rousseau, whom White reportedly threatened with a travel ban to the US, told the Flemish broadcaster VRT: “I can only say that we in Belgium have the right, and I also believe a political duty, to express our concerns about what’s happening in the US.“I respect the ambassador’s opinion, but I also ask for respect for ours.”Explore more on these topicsBelgiumUS foreign policyJudaismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His lawyer, Kurt Jelinek, called Kerstin G’s death “a tragic accident”.The senior public prosecutor Hansjörg Mayr and his team are citing the legal concept of the “tour guide acting as a courtesy” in the case, which designates the person with more experience and knowledge and the key decision-maker as having most responsibility.The prosecutors therefore accuse Thomas P of failing in his responsibility as the more experienced climber, listing nine major errors. These include forging ahead with the climb despite the fact Kirsten G had “never undertaken an Alpine tour of this length, difficulty and altitude and despite the challenging weather conditions”.The couple had started out two hours later than advised and had not been sufficiently equipped with emergency bivouac equipment, the prosecutors said. Neither had Thomas P advised Kerstin G that the snowboard boots she was wearing were inadequate for the terrain.Prosecutors also allege Thomas P was negligent in failing to turn back and question why, despite his partner’s exhaustion, he failed to make an emergency call before nightfall and did not send distress signals to a passing rescue helicopter.“Around 2am, the defendant left his girlfriend unprotected, exhausted, hypothermic, and disoriented approximately 50 metres below the summit cross of the Großglockner,” Mayr said.Jelinek disputes the prosecutor’s version, saying the couple had organised the tour together, and were “sufficiently experienced, adequately prepared and well-equipped”, with “relevant Alpine experience” and “in very good physical condition”.More than 7,000 people climb the 3,798-metre-high (12,461ft) Großglockner every year. About 200 deaths of mountaineers have been recorded there, but none has attracted as much attention as that of Kerstin G.Her mother, Gertraud G, who is due to give evidence, has said she does not hold Thomas P responsible for her daughter’s death and has spoken of a “witch-hunt” against him.In a recent interview with the German weekly Die Zeit, Gertraud G said she was upset at the way in which her daughter, who she said had discovered her passion for mountain climbing during the pandemic, had been depicted.“It makes me angry that Kerstin is being portrayed as a stupid little thing,” she said. “Kerstin was in top physical condition. And she had already mastered far more difficult climbing tours, both alone and with her boyfriend.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaMountaineeringEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Güell was the owner of a cement company with mines in the region and he needed somewhere to house the engineers, many of them British, who would help extract the coal for his factories.View image in fullscreenGaudí’s Park Güell in Barcelona.Photograph: MasterLu/Getty/iStockphotoIt has long been suspected that the chalet, now not in use, was the work of Gaudí but historians had not firmly established the architect. The building contains elements of Gaudí’s naturalistic style, evoking the forms of plants and animals that would later be expressed in works such as Park Güell and the Casa Batllò in Barcelona. The pointed arch structure also foreshadows Gaudí’s best-known work, theSagrada Famíliain Barcelona.View image in fullscreenGaudí died on 10 June 1926, at the age of 73, three days after being hit by a tram in Barcelona.Photograph: Heritage Images/GettySònia Hernández Almodóvar, the Catalan culture minister, said the attribution was the fruit of “rigorous research which is of enormous value for our heritage” and enriched Gaudí’s legacy on the centenary of his death.The analysis was carried out by the Catalan heritage department led by the chair of Gaudí studies, Galdric Santana Roma. “After much research we have concluded that the Xalet del Catllaràs is the work of Gaudí,” he said. “However, this attribution is strictly limited to the initial stages of the project as Gaudí didn’t supervise the work which didn’t follow faithfully the original design.”Santana said the process of certifying an architectural work is very different from that of a painting and the knowledge acquired in the study of the chalet will contribute to investigating other works attributed to Gaudí.Gaudí died on 10 June 1926, at the age of 73, three days after being hit by a tram in Barcelona, and numerous commemorative events and exhibitions are planned throughout the centenary year.View image in fullscreenThe central tower of Gaudí’s Sagrada Família in Barcelona will be completed in June.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/GettyThe installation in June of the final elements of the illuminated cross atop the central Jesus Christ tower of the Sagrada Família, more than 140 years after the project began in 1882, is likely to have the longest-lasting impact on the city’s skyline.Initially funded by repentant sinners and more recently by tourism, the completion of the tower will make it, at 172.5 metres, Barcelona’s tallest building. The Sagrada Família is already the world’s tallest church since part of its central tower was lifted into place in October.View image in fullscreenThe chalet in the Catllaràs mountains features pointed arches that Gaudí also used in the Sagrada Família.Photograph: Sergi Boixader/AlamyGaudí devoted the latter part of his life to the Sagrada Família, but little of it was completed in the architect’s lifetime, and work practically came to a halt at the outbreak of the Spanish civil war in 1936. The rise of mass tourism after the 1992 Olympic Games helped to make Barcelona a popular tourist destination and work on the church accelerated and moved into its final stages.Work on the Glory facade is expected to last another 10 years, and there remains the thorny issue of constructing the grand entrance stairway, in Gaudí’s original plan, that would now entail rehousing 10,000 people and demolishing about 3,000 apartments.Explore more on these topicsAntoni GaudíBarcelonaSpainEuropeArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.The DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.The judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.The reprieve from theCaliforniaDMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.Explore more on these topicsTeslaAutomotive industryCaliforniaElon MuskWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

That won’t be easy as the UK continues to upgrade its networks and infrastructure. That investment is needed if we want an energy system that is more secure and resilient, after the consequences of exposure to global energy markets were made all too apparent in recent years. However, there needs to be an open conversation about the fact that such a transition will not be cost‑free.”Energy graphicEven if energy bills fall as expected, they will remain about a third higher – about £425 a year – than they were before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered an energy market crisis across Europe. This is in part because gas market prices remain higher owing to the cost of importing more gas by tanker from the US and the Middle East, but also reflects the higher costs of the UK’s energy transition.The impact of wholesale gas market costs on the price cap is about £170 a year higher than four years ago, while the cost of Britain’s energy networks has climbed by £143 a year over the same period.“The most important thing is transparency – being honest with people about why these changes are happening and how they fit into a longer-term plan,” Lowrey said. “Bills aren’t going to drop by two or three hundred pounds overnight, but long-term progress is possible if we stick with the transition. Ultimately, a move to homegrown energy gives us a stronger chance of eventually achieving price stability while providing greater energy security in the process.”A UK government spokesperson said: “This government is delivering on our promise to take an average of £150 of costs off bills from 1 April. Ofgem will set out the final price cap figure in the usual way next week.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsEnergy industryHousehold billsFamily financesConsumer affairsRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

The average price of petrol fell by 3.1p a litre between December and January to stand at 133.2p a litre, while diesel fell by 3.2p to stand at 142.5p a litre.Inflation peaked last year at 3.8% and most economists expect it to drop back quickly to the Bank’s 2% target this year. The latest figures would allow for a rate cut as early as next month, with Threadneedle Street’s policymakers concerned about the slowing pace of economic growth.Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: “These figures make a spring interest rate cut look almost assured, though a lingering question among policymakers will be whether to pull the trigger in March or April as some may want slightly more evidence of easing inflation before reducing rates.”Inflation graphicMoney markets indicated an 86% chance of a rate cut to 3.5% in March, up from 77% before the inflation data was released.The ONS chief economist, Grant Fitzner, said, along with petrol prices: “Air fares were another downward driver this month with prices dropping back following the increase in December. Lower food prices also helped push the rate down, particularly for bread and cereals and meat. These were partially offset by the cost of hotel stays and takeaways.“The cost of raw materials for businesses fell over the past year, driven by lower crude oil prices, while the increase in the cost of goods leaving factories slowed.”Core inflation, which strips out the more volatile elements such as energy, food and alcohol, slowed to a rate of 3.1% in the year to January, down from 3.2% in December, and the lowest level since 2021. However, services inflation, which measures consumer-facing services such as hospitality and entertainment, only slowed to 4.4% from 4.5% in December, above the Bank’s forecast of 4.1%.The inflation figure adds to signs that the Bank may conclude that the economy could benefit from another cut in interest rates from its current level of 3.75%. The country’s economy expanded by only 0.1% in the three months to the end of December, the ONS said last week.Unemployment also increased to a five-year high of 5.2%, according to official figures covering the same period. Private sector earnings grew by 3.4% over the year to December, down from 3.6% in November.The chancellor,Rachel Reeves, will be cheered by the inflation figure, having used the budget in November to cut the cost of living, mainly through reductions in energy bills and rail fares. The effects of these measures should lead to a further drop in the consumer prices index in April.Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG, said: “The combined impact of the government’s energy bill package and the fall in wholesale gas prices could see household energy bills decrease by about 7% from April.” She added that food prices were also likely to fall, with recent declines in global food prices being passed on to UK households.Reeves said on Wednesday: “Cutting the cost of living is my number one priority. Thanks to the choices we made at the budget we are bringing inflation down, with £150 off energy bills, a freeze in rail fares for the first time in 30 years and prescription fees frozen again.“Our economic plan is the right one, to cut the cost of living, cut the national debt, and create the conditions for growth and investment in every part of the country.”Explore more on these topicsInflationEconomicsInterest ratesBank of EnglandOffice for National StatisticsRachel ReevesPetrol pricesnewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s a guide to the wild new mediumStuart HeritageWed 18 Feb 2026 09.36 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 13.11 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIf you haven’t heard of vertical dramas, chances are you will soon. These quick, grabby series – usually split into minute-long episodes – have risen unstoppably over the past couple of years, and now Hollywood is taking an interest.Last year, the former Showtime executive Jana Winograde announced MicroCo, a studio devoted to vertical drama, and claimed that she was shocked by the amount of top-tier talent that has approached her. Two months before, former Miramax boss Bill Block launched GammaTime, which promises original microdramas by CSI creator Anthony E Zuiker.“Every single Hollywood studio you can think of is involved or trialling,” says vertical drama consultant Jen Cooper. “For actors in America, 90% of the jobs on [major casting platform] Actor’s Access are verticals.” Indeed, in a stagnating entertainment market, verticals are one of the few places of real growth – last year Deadline reported that revenues in the sector are up 8,000% year-on-year.People pay more attention to verticals because they’re not also on WhatsApp at the same timeVertical dramas get their name from the fact they’re filmed in 9:16 format: they are taller than they are wide, making them perfect for smartphone viewing. They’re typically shot fast, in around a week, by small crews and actors who are expected to nail their performances in a couple of takes. And, because their job is to keep you watching (ideally to the point where you start paying for them, more on which later), they have a tendency to crack along at an incredible pace. Imagine a film that pivots from cliffhanger to cliffhanger every 90 seconds and you get the idea.“They have obviously mastered the clickbait and the hooks that get you past the paywall,” says Cooper. “But the reason it’s gone so big is that it’s serving a massively underserved audience, which is women who read romance novels. You might watch them and think, ‘This is not The Godfather – this is bizarre,’ but then you look at romance novels and you’re like, ‘Ah, right, OK.’ It’s serving all that audience that couldn’t find anything anywhere else. And it meets people where they are, which is on their phone. People pay more attention to verticals because they’re not also on WhatsApp at the same time.”But are they any good? If you download a vertical app, such as the Chinese-owned ReelShort or DramaBox, you’ll find yourself overwhelmed with berserk titles such as (and I promise these are real) My Sister Is the Warlord Queen and Ms CEO’s Baby Daddy Is the Merchant of Death. Everyone in these films is a billionaire. Most people are horny. It’s like being lost at sea watching them.This being so, I ask Cooper to supply me with some verticals that show where the industry is right now. Here’s what she suggests …Breaking the IceReelShort“This went supernova and brought in a lot of new watchers, especially in areas like Indonesia and the Philippines,” says Cooper. And, since it’s about a sexy ice hockey star, it’s worth pointing out that it predatesHeated Rivalry. Breaking the Ice is the story of an up-and-coming player who leaves his childhood sweetheart behind, not knowing that she is pregnant, before returning eight years later.It is absolutely bananas. Within the first minute, the female lead discovers she’s pregnant, then gets slapped by her boyfriend’s mother, who offers her thousands of dollars to break up with him. In the second minute, she’s called a “crazy bipolar bitch” for kissing someone else. Halfway through, a kidnapping is initiated and resolved in the space of about 45 seconds. There are countless one-punch fights, to a wildly overblown musical score. It’s frantic, tonally all over the place and makes almost no sense. The precision with which Breaking the Ice can weaponise a low attention span is frightening. It is also stupidly entertaining.However, as soon as there’s a shower scene, the paywall kicks in. This might be where people get turned off. To keep watching, you have to amass coins, as you would in a mobile game. You can do this by watching an advert (usually for Temu) every couple of minutes, or by buying 1,000 coins for £4.49. You could also buy a subscription to the app, which costs about £200 a year. This is more expensive than either a standard Netflix subscription or the licence fee, but Cooper says that for many viewers, verticals are “a fan thing. If they were into live music, or sport, or buying wool for their knitting, they’d be spending the same amount.”How to Tame a Silver FoxReelShortBuoyed up by my unexpected enjoyment of Breaking the Ice, I try this, described by Cooper as an age-gap romance that has gone viral on TikTok. It is, by all accounts, slightly harder to enjoy.How to Tame a Silver Fox is a slightly grim love story about a girl falling for her dad’s friend. The main issue I have is that her dad’s friend is an absolute cluster-bomb of red flags. He drives a sports car. He carries a gun. He wears a leather jacket and has a teddy boy haircut. His shirt, which is perpetually half undone and soaking wet, keeps getting taken off and put back on with no real logic. He keeps saying things (to his friend’s daughter, remember) like “You’re a beautiful woman but I’m too much for you, kid,” and “You had better not test me or I’ll break you.” Worst of all, he isn’t actually a silver fox, just a brown-haired man who seems to have Pepé Le Pewed himself with talcum powder. Not my cup of tea in the slightest, but there’s a good chance I’m not the target audience here.Television in titbits: the rise of the billion-dollar microdrama industryRead moreAmerican Sniper: The Last RoundReelShortCooper describes this one as “a big hit near the end of the year, and part of the attempt to bring in a male audience”. Which is great, because I am a man. This one should be a slam dunk.Except it isn’t, because the more I watch American Sniper: The Last Round, the more I become convinced that nobody in the vertical drama industry has ever met a man. Within the first five seconds, someone gets shot in the head. We meet a guy with the nickname the King of Guns, which we know because they call him the King of Guns approximately once every 30 seconds. Every scene is accompanied by music that sounds as if it was pirated from a pickup truck commercial. Also, very importantly, this has nothing to do withClint Eastwood’s film American Sniper. That was about Chris Kyle, a decorated Navy Seal sniper eventually murdered at a shooting range. This is about the King of Guns, a guy who leaves his military post to work at a shooting range, then shoots a load of baddies. It is profoundly dumb, like the sort of thing you’d watch drunk at 2am.Spark Me TenderlyMy DramaCooper calls this one “Fifty Shades of Grey rubbish, but a massive hit”, which is accurate. The success of Spark Me Tenderly comes from a blanket social media push full of TikTok videos that make it look like pornography. It is not that, but it is extremely Fifty Shadesy. A young woman gets a job with a handsome pervert who makes her sign a BDSM contract. There’s a brief battle of wills and some fully clothed heavy petting, and (spoiler alert) it ends with the pervert setting his kink aside because he’s fallen in love, and the woman getting really into BDSM. A bit like Grease, then, without the flying car. Absolute tosh, but there is an enormous audience who would lap this up.In Other Words, I Love YouDramaBox“This is one of my all-time favourite verticals,” says Cooper, and I’m inclined to agree. This is a YA story about a poor American scholarship student who gets sent to a posh British school and butts heads with an arrogant British guy, and it feels the direction verticals should probably start heading if they want to shake off their clickbaity reputation.For a start, the young and largely British cast do extremely well with the material, which isn’t always the case with verticals. Second, the bizarre need to send the plot spinning off in a silly new direction has been flattened out, so it feels like an actual film rather than a procession of interstitial YouTube ads. Early on, there is a long scene where the characters critique the work of William Golding. This is a vertical that knows and trusts its audience, which a lot of these things seem petrified to do. As a result we’re left with something lightweight, but extremely well made. Now that actual film-makers are getting involved with the medium, this will be the benchmark against which all other verticals are measured. A joy.Game of ChoiceTallflixDescribed by Cooper as “one of the most ambitious verticals,” this is an action drama in the mould of Squid Game. And by that I mean that it is exactly Squid Game, squeezed into a couple of hours and done on the cheap. However, by verticals standards it represents a huge leap forward. There are stunts and action scenes, and the story relies more on internal drama than ridiculous cliffhangers. It is gripping, and the perfect demonstration of a medium desperate to break out and become mainstream. When you’re all watching vertical dramas by the end of the year, it’ll be in part thanks to this.This article was amended on 18 February 2026 to state that 90% of all adverts for acting jobs on the casting platform Actor’s Access are currently for vertical dramas. A previous version said this applied to all acting jobs.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSmartphonesMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His theory was everyone has a clown. For example,David Mitchell, who I worked with on Back, has an angry clown. When David is cross and he rants, it’s hilarious. Without Philippe, I don’t think I could have done Cass in Back, Deb inSuch Brave Girlsor Muriel inWoman in Mind, because he gave me permission to be an idiot. I can take the piss out of myself and it doesn’t hurt.The only moment I ever saw Philippe break into a smile at anything I did was when I was dressed top to toe in leather, hitting everyone with a stick and doing Lady Macbeth in a German accent.

We played a game where he was the “king” and you were the clowns or court jesters – think naughty minions – who had to entertain him. You had to be mischievous, unruly and test the boundaries of foolery. But mostly you had to keep him entertained and interested, otherwise you were expelled from this imaginary court. You didn’t want to bore the king or be banished for going too far. He was one of the great teachers and it was one of the greatest lessons. I think of this and him often and I feel very lucky to have been taught by him.View image in fullscreenDamien Warren-Smith’s Garry Starr: Classic Penguins.Illustration: Garry Starr‘I failed and failed and failed’Damien Warren-Smith (AKA Garry Starr)I’d moved to the UK from Australia and I found myself in ensembles doing classical plays where I was the butt of the joke for being uncultured. People were constantly referring to me as a convict. When I discovered clown, I realised not only does it not matter if people don’t take me seriously, it is an incredible feeling to embrace it and say, “Whatever you find ridiculous about me, I give you permission to laugh at that.”Going to ÉcolePhilippe Gaulierwas tough. I failed and failed and failed. I can still remember the first time I really made him laugh. Two clowns were doing a scene that was going really badly and I stepped on as Monsieur Loyal, the boss clown, and started clapping and saying, “I told you they were great, didn’t I?” Philippe chuckled and pointed at me: “He’s such a bastard!”You will be your funniest, you will come alive, you will be your most beautiful in your moment of failure. It is not the doing that makes you funny, it is seeing how you feel about the shit thing you have just done.Garry Starris a high-status character and an idiot. The reason people are so willing to get up in my shows is that I’m the butt of the joke. I fail, but I’m so happy to fail. People who say they would never get up on stage are all of a sudden volunteering to do horrific things.‘Philippe said: You! Kick him up the arse!’Simon MunneryIn the workshops, everyone seemed to have a moment when they were hilarious. We were coming towards the end and he asked who hadn’t had a moment. It was me and a Swiss juggler.He was a big, tall, muscular bloke and not in any way funny. He started talking and Philippe pointed to someone and said, “You! Kick him up the arse!” It was like being tortured. He clearly didn’t enjoy it. “You! Kick him on the cheek!” He was fiddling with this bloke’s performance, in front of him, live. He tried various things until he said, “OK, speak loudly!”The Swiss bloke started shouting and it was hilarious. All 25 of us wept with laughter. It was genuine: he was so angry at the position he’d been put in. Later, I told him it was funny and it wasn’t what he wanted to know. He wanted to be in control.Then Philippe got me to talk and he tried the same things. Nothing was working. Then he said, “OK, talk, but don’t make any sound.” And I had a moment. It was hilarious. I couldn’t put a foot wrong. It was like walking along a thick tightrope. I sat down and I could see then why the Swiss bloke was so upset. It was the pain of people laughing at you.View image in fullscreenSally Phillips: ‘This kind of play has been a foundation of my professional career.’Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImage‘The ghost of the game was there’Sally PhillipsYou could apply his method to anything.

Then I remembered Gaulier and thought: Ah! The funniest thing would be not knowing. It’s about how your humanity is visible when you don’t know what you’re doing. And it’s completely gripping watching that. It was a girl who’d stopped concentrating and she didn’t have a good answer. It was much better than having a reason.His teaching has fed into my experience of parenting my son with Down’s syndrome. Olly never has a fail, he is always 100% alive and he is not boring. You’re anti-productivity, anti all these masks, the world isn’t about A-levels and you’re being in the moment. I’ve found a language to speak with Olly because this kind of play has been a foundation of my professional career.‘I had never seen somebody speak in such a polarising, hilarious way’Zach Zucker (AKA Jack Tucker)I was a very unfunny 19-year-old student, working at the UCB theater in Los Angeles. My manager used to work for Sacha Baron Cohen’s company and told me there was an intern spot there and, by the way, Sacha’s clown teacher is coming to LA. I went to this workshop and I had never seen somebody speak to people in such a polarising, hilarious way. I got the job with Sacha and, six months in, I told him I wanted to go to Gaulier. Sacha said, “Go!”I was only supposed to go for six months but, three weeks in, I saw my second-year counterparts do a vaudeville scene that blew my mind. I signed up for the whole two years that night. My company,Stamptown, is named after Étampes, where the clown school is based, and our logo is the castle from the town.People’s stories tend to be, “Philippe told me I was terrible and it was very embarrassing.” But first and foremost, the guy was a clown. He loved to laugh more than anything.View image in fullscreenEmily Woof in Revolver at the Edinburgh fringe in 2025.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian‘You didn’t hold back’Emily WoofI loved some of the other things he taught, especially melodrama and bouffon. Doing melodrama, we used to do this exercise where you would sit at a table, drinking a glass of wine in a stew of melancholy. There would be music playing. Then you’d suddenly slam the table, look up to the gods and go, “Not that music!”In melodrama, he wanted you to play to the gods, to the poor people who couldn’t afford the other seats in the theatre. It was about unleashing a generosity of spirit, you didn’t hold back. You had a lift in the head and in the voice. His way of playing it was generous and embodied. It was a real discipline. If you didn’t hit it, you couldn’t get away with it because it’s too crazy, too big. You had to be absolutely true.Bouffon is almost the opposite of clown: you’re an outsider who comes in to mock the bourgeoisie. You’re the one that’s got the upper hand. You come on stage with an edge and I took that edge into my own work. In clown you love the audience, but bouffon is a much more twisted form.‘Slowly, you realised how to engage with the audience’Hamish McCollThe word everyone dreaded was “suivant” (next) which really meant “get off”. You would go up and open your mouth and get “suivant”. You would come away mystified. “What did I do? I just opened my mouth!” Slowly, you realised what it was, which was how to engage with the audience in that moment.As a director, you’re constantly looking for the work to be present, true, alive and dynamic. His short threshold for things not working – and he was tyrannical – stayed with me. “Pour faire rire le public,” he would say. “It’s to make the audience laugh.” Are they engaged? Are they with you? If they’re not, “suivant!”View image in fullscreen‘You didn’t want to bore the king’ … Philippe Gaulier‘It’s about what’s happening in that moment’Cal McCrystalHe told you not to bring ideas in with you because it was like filling your arms with suitcases. When you come in, you see this wonderful suitcase on the floor but you can’t pick it up because your arms are full. The performance has got to be about what’s happening in that moment.My whole career leads back to Philippe. Even when I’m working at English National Opera, I say, “This feeling of pleasure, mischief and connection with the audience is not a layer that you put on top of the show: it is the show.”Philippe once said you should come in with the pleasure of your four-year-old son who thinks it’s a good idea to come down stairs naked when you’ve got guests. The child who doesn’t know why it’s wrong but really wants to do it: that is mischief.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreClownsPhilippe GaulierComedyLouise BrealeyRachel WeiszfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We have IP (beloved Ealing comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets), a Black List script (originally titled Rothchild back in 2014), a man-of-the-moment lead (the ubiquitous Glen Powell), a woman-of-the-moment co-star (the equally ubiquitous Margaret Qualley), an of-the-moment trend (eat the rich), an indie company turned merch-able brand (A24) and a film-maker who recently broke out with a buzzed-about debut (Emily the Criminal’s John Patton Ford). If ChatGPT were to create an AI service for studio execs, this would be an obvious green light.Crime 101 review – bracing tale of master thief lifts a trick or two from Michael MannRead moreBut when dragged into the real world, of discernment and taste, it’s a package that brings up a string of concerning questions. Can Powell pull off burgeoning murderous psychopath? Is it time to stop relying on the Black List as a taste test for quality? Has eat the rich fatigue set in? And, most importantly, why on earth would one try to remake a close-to-perfect classic?At the end of 110 minutes, I can provide the answers: no, yes, 100% and I really have no idea.I had plenty of thinking time at least, given how utterly tepid the whole thing is, an experience akin to watching someone try to light a match when the entire box is wet. Ford wants this to be snappy and stylish, and while it certainly has the feel of prestige pop (apart from Cape Town making for an unconvincing New York stand-in), there’s no spark here, no breath that hasn’t been stolen from elsewhere.The 1949 original, one of the most deliciously black-hearted comedies ever made, is both very much of its time (including the jarring usage of a racist nursery rhyme) and timeless in its plotting. The story, of an unfairly cast out man killing his way up the family tree to get his inheritance, remains as darkly alluring as it ever was, a captivating game of push-pull as our protagonist descends from a place of sympathy to a position of monstrosity. Reports had suggested the redo was “inspired” by the original but this is a clearcut remake, many of the beats remaining almost identical, just effortfully pulled into a new era.Louis is now Becket, whose mother rejected her wealthy family’s insistent suggestion of an abortion after she found herself young, unmarried and pregnant. She’s pushed out of their cushioned luxury (all the way to New Jersey) to become a struggling single mother but when she dies years later, Becket becomes a young orphan, forced into the foster system. Yet more years later, unhappily toiling away as a low-paid retail worker, he hatches a plan to get what’s rightfully his.The route to the top of the food chain is similar but with some modern tweaks – the rowboat has become a yacht, the village photographer an insufferable Brooklyn artist, the reverend a flashy celeb-preacher – but the edges have all been smoothed. There’s nothing here that comes close to the sour nastiness of Louis’s glee over diphtheria killing twin infants in the infinitely icier original (plus the mother as a bonus) with Ford making Becket’s victims all more obviously awful and deserving of whatever violence comes their way (it’s perhaps wise that no one tried to repeat Alec Guinness’s astonishing gambit of taking on all eight victims, instead they’re played by actors including Topher Grace and a scene-devouring Ed Harris).Powell, with his exaggerated comic book attributes, plays the character like a Disney-fied Patrick Bateman, completely lacking in any real darkness, smooth rather than slippery, swapping acid for snark (his delivery is increasingly in danger of dipping into dreaded Ryan Reynolds territory). As his childhood friend turned adult foe, Qualley certainly has more bite (one can see her swiftly dispatching Powell in a knife fight) but there’s no chemistry and no serious stakes to his relationship with Jessica Henwick’s increasingly suspicious hipster.Ford is far too keen for us to side with Becket, portrayed as a man just trying to stay afloat in a sea filled with snakes, and so whatever interest we might have had in watching someone gleefully discover their psychopathic knack for murder is evaporated (Ford managed Aubrey Plaza’s criminal discovery far better in his previous film – in fact Plaza would have made a far more suitable lead here). Updating a story such as this, with the original set at the start of the 1900s, means that whatever tricks Louis might have used back then would mostly be impossible now, with DNA and security cameras, and Ford falls over himself trying to awkwardly explain things away, turning an elegant crime caper into something far clumsier. There’s also no real satire here either (moneyed folk are apparently bad, did you realise?) and at this stage of the rich-eating cycle, I just want it to be over. Forget a killing, Ford has made a real mess instead.How to Make a Killing is out in the US on 20 February, Australia on 5 March and the UK on 13 MarchExplore more on these topicsGlen PowellComedy filmsComedyMargaret QualleyEd HarrisThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is about the nature of intimacy between the two; and about the moment this becomes a problem for the grownup children with a conflicting sense of their own responsibilities.Queen at Sea is directed by indie US film-maker Lance Hammer, absent sincehis 2008 Sundance winner, Ballast. This is an almighty comeback, a lacerating movie bearing comparison withMichael Haneke’s AmourorGaspar Noé’s Vortex. It concludes with a heartbreakingly ironic and enigmatic final sequence refusing the traditional final cadence; a diptych of love, contrasting the pleasures and expectations of intimacy across the generations.The setting is a gloomy and wintry London, with porridge-grey cloud cover.Juliette Binocheplays Amanda, a recently divorced academic. She has taken a sabbatical with her teen daughter, Sara (Florence Hunt), to be closer to her elderly mother, Leslie (Calder-Marshall) – who has dementia – and her stepfather, Martin (Courtenay).One dull weekday morning, she looks in on Martin and Leslie, catching them having sex, with a mask of incomprehension on her mother’s face. Furiously, she accuses him of raping Leslie. The shock and disgust clearly stem at one level from the fact that he is her stepfather, not her father; and also because they have already received the GP’s advice that Leslie can no longer give meaningful consent.Yet Martin has done his own research on the internet contradicting this, claiming that marital sex comforts dementia patients just as much as all the other things that are done for them without meaningful consent: food, shelter, medical care. Crucially, it comforts the carer, too. He loves his wife and this is a vital way to keep this alive.Ballast – reviewRead moreIcily livid, Amanda calls the police, which sets in train events that she almost instantly regrets. Martin is prevented from seeing Leslie, who is terrified by the rape exam and whimperingly baffled as to why her husband is not there. The only way to suspend the legal action is for Leslie to go into a care home, which has long been Amanda’s demand. This is furiously resisted by Martin, who now sees all this as a malicious, dishonest way of forcing the situation on them both – it’s a care home, or it’s the cops – and a permanent stain on his character whatever the outcome. Meanwhile, Sara is developing a relationship with a boy at her new London school that her mother knows nothing about.The story moves from one agonisingly difficult and ambiguous situation to the next – each a terrifying point of no return, each the awful occasion of things seen and said that can’t be unseen or unsaid. Is Amanda right to take the view that she has – or has she, in some crucial way, mishandled things? Is Martin an abuser of the most sinister and hateful kind, or misunderstood? Is the care home itself such a bad place? Even the crisis that this entails, connected to the unmentionable truths about older people’s sexuality and propensity to abuse, doesn’t exactly solve the question. Everything that happens, each station of the cross, each unbearable ordeal, is just a function of the overall situation, which can only be managed up to a point.The crux of the film is a four-way conversation between a social worker, Amanda, Martin and Leslie. This involves Martin’s tearful, passionate declaration of love for his wife and best friend; a virtual reaffirmation of vows, which Leslie poignantly returns. Has dementia made her affirmation valueless?

Nice work if you can get it, andGordon Ramsayhas got it. Being Gordon Ramsay, a six part –six part– documentary, follows the chef ’n’ TV personality as he embarks on his most ambitious venture yet. It’s “A huge undertaking”, “high risk, high reward”, a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and “one of my final stakes in the ground … If it fails, I’m fucked.” It is opening seven billion (five, but it feels like seven billion) restaurants on the top floors of 22 Bishopsgate at once. There is going to be a 60-seat rooftop garden place with retractable roof, a 250-seater Asian-inflected restaurant called Lucky Cat, a Bread Street Kitchen brasserie and a culinary school.But we begin with a family scene. The youngest of Ramsay’s six children with wife of 30 years, Tana, are having pancakes. Gordon thinks they are too thick. They’re American-style, not the crepes he thinks they should have. “Darling,” says Tana, not for the first time even that morning, you suspect, “Could you just give it a rest?”View image in fullscreenTilly Ramsay with dad Gordon.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe defining feature of Ramsay, of course, is that he cannot. No Michelin-starred chef can. They are not made that way. When he is with his children, he is fully with his children (“Megan’s 27, the twins Holly and Jack are 25, Matilda’s 23, Oscar’s six, Jessie James is 18 months. Did I miss any of them? Thank fuck for that”). Running and jumping and playing with the little ones, planning weddings and engagement parties and buying inaugural chef whites with the older ones – he is apparently inexhaustible and they, like Tana, clearly adore him, while also (in the elders’ case at least) having a firm handle on the man.The same – at least in this extended advert for the Ramsay brand – is essentially true at work. His chefs respect him because he’s walked the walk before, talking the talk, and they all strive to do their best, both for him and – as they are all cut from the same perfectionist cloth as Ramsay – justbecause.It is watching these people adhere to an abstract ideal – to the idea so unfashionable that it is rapidly becoming unfathomable – that everyone should work to the highest standard at all times because that is the right thing to do that saves Being Gordon Ramsay from being (as the man himself might put it) the absolute bollocks it could be. And then there’s just the simple pleasure of seeing them construct the most mouthwatering dishes you will ever, if you can afford it, eat – with a knowledge and skill that is almost as delicious to watch.View image in fullscreenRoom at the top … Ramsay surveys the view from his new premises.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixSix hours of the many dramas associated with getting five businesses up and running at the same time does feel like quite a lot – each of the premises needing to be designed and built from scratch and a retractable roof added to one. But it does at least allow for an appreciation of the attention to detail that must be paid to a successful launch. The menus and the tastings – you can’t make a rum baba too small or it won’t aerate properly – are only part of it. There are the pockets on the prototype aprons that must be removed because Ramsay knows wait staff naturally fill them with bits and pieces and soon look scruffy. There is the vetoing of leather seating being added to one restaurant’s design, taking up space that would cost them two covers, or £300, a night. There are a million other things and Ramsay is across them all. Does he have time to couch every decision in soft words? No. Is he needlessly rude? No and no. There’s a reason for everything he does, he gives it, he moves on. You need to have a good sense of self and plenty of confidence to deal with him, for sure, but if you don’t I am of the school of thought that says that is a you problem, not him. He is nonetheless a Marmite proposition, that’s for sure, and an entire sociology module could be written around him and people’s reactions to him.In the meantime, there’s this fluffy nonsense with occasional nuggets of insight. Enjoy or don’t. No offence, but Ramsay’s got better fucking things to worry about.Being Gordon Ramsay is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionGordon RamsayDocumentaryFactual TVBusiness TVFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was a natural and human-made disaster that left 20,000 dead and a further 164,000 displaced from the area, some with no prospect of return. The earthquake damaged the cooling systems that prevent meltdowns and caused three near-apocalyptic explosions, bringing the nation close to a catastrophe that would have threatened its very existence. Incredibly, the ultimate calamity was finally staved off by nothing more hi-tech than a committed fire brigade spraying thousands of tons of water on the exposed fuel rods.The film plunges us into the awful story moment-by-moment, accompanied by interviews with the chief players of the time – prominently nuclear plant employee Ikuo Izawa, a shift supervisor and de facto leader of the“Fukushima 50”(actually 69 people) who became legendary in Japan and beyond for their self-sacrificial courage, staying in a nightmarish reactor when everyone else had been evacuated.Perhaps we could have been given more context and less immediate drama, particularly more background about the plant’s dismal corporate owners, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, which had closed a nuclear plant in 2007 after an earthquake, with a resulting loss of profits. But to skimp on the drama might be obtuse, given the pure hair-raising shock of events. The archive footage of the tsunami spreading across the fields and farmland ofJapanis deeply disturbing; “nightmare” is a word casually used, but appropriate here.The Japanese soul had been uniquely traumatised by the nuclear issue in 1945 andFukushimawas the opening of an old wound; Barack Obama’s offers to help were received warily and the film hints that some of a certain age might have even suspected a kind of opportunistic emergency takeover, like the Douglas MacArthur rule that followed the war. There is something chillingly military in the company’s need for volunteers for a so-called “suicide squad” to vent the reactors to forestall a pressure buildup.And as far as comparisons with the Chornobyl disaster go, that involved a single reactor; Fukushima had six ready to blow. Before I watched this film, I assumed that Japan’s modern democracy would at least have meant more transparency than the sclerotic and malign Soviet apparatchiks. But maybe not. Tepco has still not released a full history of exactly what went wrong and what discussions took place at the time. And in any case, politicians were themselves dismally eager to cover themselves by tentatively blaming Tepco.The Fukushima towns frozen in time: nature has thrived since the nuclear disaster but what happens if humans return?Read moreThe most robust witness here is the New York Times’s Tokyo bureau chief Martin Fackler, who gives us a crisp account of the official chaos and bungling – and the fact that Tepco had already received a report indicating the Fukushima plant was vulnerable to an earthquake and did nothing. He is interesting on corporate obeisance to the “safety myth”, an industry article of faith which does not result in vigilant and innovative efforts to improve safety, but rather icy disapproval of anyone who questions existing safety provisions. Doing so was disloyalty to the industry and could damage your career.Perhaps inevitably, the larger questions are left open. Fossil fuels cause slow-motion catastrophe to the planet – in fact, not so slow – while nuclear fuel does not cause climate change, but could cause instant calamity. So is the answer simply what the industry says it is? More and better safety? Or can other renewables fill the gap? Either way, this is a gripping film.Fukushima is out in the UK and US from 20 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsFukushimaJapanJapan disasterNuclear powerAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

When the curtain drops, it reveals a huge band that launches into the rousing and infectious funk stomp of Where Is My Husband!. Raye and her singers reappear in sparkling red dresses, creating an air of elegance and glamour reminiscent of old school Vegas, before thundering drums, brass and strings collide with the theatrical heft of a James Bond number.

But before I tell you what it is, I had better tell you what it is not. On Morrison is not a biography. Except for scattered references, there is little here about Chloe Anthony Wofford’s birth and early life in Lorain, Ohio; her education at Howard and Cornell universities; her editorial work at Random House; or her phenomenal success as a novelist. Nor is this book for fans who turn to Toni Morrison for inspirational quotes or to scorepolitical points.Instead, On Morrison offers readers who can tell their Soaphead Church from their Schoolteacher something they have long hoped for: a rigorous appraisal of the work. Despite her enormous contribution to American letters, Morrison’s novels are still too often read for what they have to say about black life, rather than how they say it.Song of Solomonand Jazz are more likely to be found on African American studies syllabi than creative writing ones. In her introduction to On Morrison, Namwali Serpell identifies the reason: “She is difficult to read. She is difficult to teach.”Serpell, the author of two ambitious novels thatstraddle genres,generationsand continents, brings to the project of reading Morrison an understanding of what it means to be difficult, and to be called difficult. She does Morrison the respect of reading her seriously. Across the book’s 12 essays, she identifies and critiques narrative strategies, puzzles over craft choices, compares formal techniques across novels, and chases edits and revisions in the archives.This journey through Morrison’s oeuvre begins withThe Bluest Eye. To tell the story of Pecola, the little black girl who wishes she had blue eyes, Morrison broke the narrative into parts, each filtered through a different character’s perspective, forcing the reader to “piece together the myriad overdetermined forces that have obliterated this young girl”. Pecola suffers horrifying abuse at the hands of her father, who eventually rapes and impregnates her. The fragmented narrative “is an effort to create a specific reading experience – not passive pity or easy demonising, but active reassembly and self-interrogation – through a formal structure”.“The structure is the argument”, as Morrison often said. In Recitatif, the only short story she ever published, the narrative is built around five encounters between two women, Roberta and Twyla, over several decades. Early on, we learn that one of the women is white and the other black, but we are never told which is which. Morrison draws readers into a guessing game that demonstrates the arbitrariness of race and its dependence on contrast for it to acquire meaning. Serpell uncovers startling details in the archives. I did not know, for example, that Recitatif started out as a screenplay treatment for actors Marlo Thomas and Cicely Tyson.I felt guided by a writer who shares both my admiration of Morrison and my fear of lionisingCan the mystery of the women’s identity finally be solved, then? “Personally, I’ll never tell,” Serpell promises. Instead, she doggedly traces the transformation from treatment to story, finding more intriguing nuggets along the way. In June 1982, about the time the film was likely turned down, Morrison had just finished reading Nettie Jones’s Fish Tales, which is structured as a series of first-person vignettes that refrains from revealing characters’ races. A month later, Serpell writes, “Morrison submitted … a radical revision” of her story, this time with “an experiment in the removal of all racial codes”. It’s comforting to know that even geniuses take inspiration from others.Elsewhere, Serpell identifies the humour in Morrison’s work, especially in Song of Solomon. The protagonist, Milkman Dead, visits his paternal aunt Pilate Dead, prompting her to quip: “Ain’t but three Deads alive,” and Milkman to respond: “I’m a Dead! My mother’s a Dead!” Milkman embarks on an Odyssean quest to find out more about his great-grandfather, who escaped slavery by “flying” back to Africa. By grounding its narrative in folktales, Greek and African, the novel “syncretizes disparate traditions, both reinforcing the originary hybridity of archetypal tales and making them coincide and conflict in its mid-20th-century milieu”.One reason On Morrison was such a joy to read is that I felt guided by a writer who shares both my admiration and my fear of lionising. Serpell happens to be African and an immigrant, facts that I think attune her to the centrality of the black experience as well as the estrangement of peripheral characters. Morrison read widely, learning from African elders such as Camara Laye (for whose novel The Radiance of the King she wrote an introduction),Chinua Achebeand Bessie Head. By contrast, she could be incurious about Native American characters in her earlier novels, an oversight she addressed inA Mercy.At times Serpell’s tone slips from the ruthlessly observant “I” of the critic into the “we” of the professor guiding students through a thorny text (she teaches at Harvard). Though she agonises over panning the woman she calls “my elder”, she admits Morrison’s poetry is “not good” and pours deserved scorn on a messy post-9/11 essay that is unworthy of Morrison’s intellect.Yet such criticisms only reinforce the integrity of her analysis. With On Morrison, Serpell has managed to deliver a book that works on many levels: as a study of craft, as a critical appraisal, and as a tribute to an artist who was difficult in all the right ways.On Morrison by Namwali Serpell, is published by Chatto & Windus (£25).

A sequence of events, mostly beyond her control, leaves her stranded in an unfamiliar town. It’s dead quiet, except for a travelling circus camped on the outskirts. M checks into a hotel, ignores her phone and wanders around, reminiscing about books read, films watched, museums visited. Some of these recollections are grounded in fable; others are vividly realistic. Among the latter are memories of her childhood and youth, spent in a “country that no longer exists apart from on old maps and in history books”.M describes the country she comes from as a “beast” waging war against its neighbour. We can guess her meaning without turning to the author’s biographical note. Maria Stepanova – whose masterlyIn Memory of Memorycombined family memoir, essay and fiction – left her native Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We might also wonder how closely The Disappearing Act tracks her own life. But the novelist M is not here to discuss autofiction – she has more important things to reflect on.What was it like inside the beast? “She’d lived her whole life … doing nothing, or doing only what came naturally to her, and wanting to believe she had got away with it.” Was it wrong of her to enjoy her life there? She understands that “joy was the very thing the beast was bent on annihilating … and that it was important to keep it alive to spite the beast”, but that’s little consolation now that her former compatriots are killing others “with missiles, with fire from the sky, with bare hands”.She forces bread into her mouth, as if trying to convince herself that she is hungry and therefore still thereM’s relationship with the legacy of her one-time homeland – first and foremost, its language – is inevitably compromised. One of the stories she retells, the tale of a linguist whose tongue is cut out before he can use it, could be about herself. But the book’s laconic style, with distant echoes of poetry, skilfully conveyed by translator Sasha Dugdale, shows that M still has the power of telling.True to the novel’s title, M’s presence gradually diminishes, starting from her realisation that she is “cut off, a spare limb”. Watching young lovers, “she felt as if these things no longer affected her; the economy of erotic selection and exchange bore no relation to her current existence”. Served bread in a cafe, she leaves it on the plate before suddenly forcing it into her mouth, as if trying to convince herself that she is hungry and therefore still there. These transformations may be alarming, but when “her inner self … gradually quietened, becoming soft, childlike”, it brings a sense of freedom and possibility. Part of her longs to recreate the dream in which “she was on a train to the dacha, the years falling away from her as she travelled” until she was a small child again.Her mother once told her about a sign reading “There is no way out”: M considers her own exit strategy. Can she find a “novel way out of a hopeless situation”? With no set plan, she visits the circus and offers to help perform a magic act. It involves lying in a sarcophagus with her knees up to her chin, which she finds “boring and painful” though not hard. The owner of the circus asks her if she is a Jew, and M, happily discarding her “Russian novelist” identity, says yes.The world has labelled her a writer, yet she wants to be seen as herself – whatever that might be – and the circus promises a chance of that. She leaves most of her possessions behind and sets off to join the troupe. She’ll walk through the empty town; she’ll start again at the beginning. It’s not too late, is it?“There was so much guilt around M, and in her, that it was hard to breathe” – over the past four years, this sentiment has become familiar to many Russians opposing the war in Ukraine. Authors such asMikhail Shishkinhave spoken about collective guilt in their nonfiction; a “common enough motif”, as M says of yet another remembered story. Wherever her escapade brings her next, she is proof that it takes a novelist with poetic imagination to capture the nature of the beast.The Disappearing Act by Maria Stepanova, translated by Sasha Dugdale, is published by Fitzcarraldo (£12.99).

The idea of plummeting down a hill on anything but a plastic sledge is totally alien to me. And yet, my wife and I have been gripped by the Winter Olympics, especially the snowboarding and freestyle skiing events. And I think I know why. Those events are really channelling the look and feel of the wintery sports sims I’ve always loved – especially those that arrived during a golden period in the mid-1990s.This was the era in which snowboarding was exploding in popularity, especially among twentysomethings with disposable incomes and no responsibilities – which coincidentally was the games industry’s target market at the time. Perhaps the first title to take advantage of this trend was Namco’s 1996 arcade game Alpine Surfer, which challenged players to stand on a snowboard-shaped controller and swoop as quickly as possible down a mountainside – it was one of the most physically exhausting coin-ops I ever played. Later that year came the self-consciously hip PlayStation sim Cool Boarders, and then in 1998, my absolute favourite, 1080°Snowboardingon the N64, with it’s intuitive analog controls and incredibly authentic sound effects of boards cutting through deep, crisp snow.What I think is bringing these classics back to mind is the highly immersive presentation of the events at Milano Cortina. Most obviously, there’s the innovative use of first-person view drone cameras, which provide live chase-cam footage from behind and slightly above the competitors. Watching the snowboard cross events, in which four competitors race against each other over steep, ramped courses, now looks and feels almost exactly like playing the Race mode in 1080° Snowboarding, which was viewed from a similar angle and pitted players against AI-controlled boarders. In both experiences, you’re right there among the riders, pushing and jostling for the perfect racing line.View image in fullscreenClose to the action … a snowboard race at the Milano Cortina games.Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the use of stroboscopic analysis and 360-degree replay systemsthat together let broadcasters freeze, zoom in on and slow-mo very specific moments, also mimics the highly elaborate replays that modern 3D sports sims revel in. A decade ago, sports channels such as ESPN started to pull inspiration from the Fifa Football games by using CGI to enliven replays and on-screen stats, bringing viewers closer to the action and helping them understand the skills and tactics on show. Could the Olympic Broadcasting Services be breaking out their retro consoles for similar inspiration?The BBC is also channelling – perhaps unknowingly – this era of video games in its Olympic commentary. For the freestyle events, the corporation is using ex-competitor Tim Warwood and veteran extreme sports presenter Ed Leigh. The duo has brought a huge amount of technical knowledge to the events, but also a sense of relaxed, playful fandom, recalling the wildly enthusiastic in-game commentary used in the Cool Boarders and SSX titles, where experienced voiceover actors such as Mark Hildreth (Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots) and Mel McMurrin (Twisted Metal), yelled all the 90s boarder slang they could muster. SSX even featured famed beatboxer Rahzel bringing his range of sound effects to the mix. Those games recognised pro snowboarding not just as a sport but as a culture, like skateboarding, with its own music, language and fashion sensibilities – and the Milano Cortina games are reflecting that.View image in fullscreenSmooth … 1080° Snowboarding.Photograph: MobyGames/NintendoIn 1999, Activision released Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, the series that truly cemented the relationship between street/extreme sports and video games – but the snowboarding titles got there first, and it has been curiously emotional to find their analogue in the Milano Cortina coverage. After watching Huw Nightingale and Charlotte Bankestake the goldin the snowboard cross event on Sunday evening, I dug out 1080° Snowboarding and gave it a shot. Although the graphics are dated, it still has that lovely feel of smooth movement through deep snow, the camera lurking just behind the boarders as they zigzag down the narrow slopes. Games borrow from sport and viceversa, and this symbiotic relationship has no doubt proved profitable for both. But it can also create unexpected moments of magic and nostalgia – and that has certainly been the case at Milano Cortina, even for those of us who have never stood on a snowboard, let alone at the peak of a frosty mountain run.What to playView image in fullscreenHuge-toothed violence … Dino Crisis 1.Photograph: CapcomReleased in the shadow of the Resident Evil series, Capcom’s dinosaur horror adventures share a lot of similarities with their zombie stablemates: groups of spec-ops soldiers placed in remote locations with minimal ammo only to be attacked by a variety of dangerous monsters. Now, bothDino Crisis 1 and 2have been rereleased on Steam allowing veterans and newcomers to discover and reassess these overlooked classics.Director Shinji Mikami, who also created Resident Evil, refers to them as “panic horror” games in contrast to the slower-paced “survival horror” of the Resi titles. Taking cues from Jurassic Park, you’re are continually stalked and ambushed by giant reptiles in wild moments of huge-toothed violence, but there are periods of tension too. Of the two, I prefer the original which more closely resembles Mikami’s Resident Evil titles. The sequel produced by another Resident Evil veteran Kobayashi Hiroyuki dials up the action and bloody intensity. The rereleases update the visuals but don’t mess too much with the formula. I’m hoping they will foreshadow a long-awaited reboot for the series.Available on:PCEstimated playtime:15-20 hours eachWhat to readView image in fullscreenHideki Sato managed to bring the excitement of arcade games into people’s homes.Photograph: Justin Towell/AlamyOn Sunday,the news brokethat Sega’s hardware mastermindHideki Satohas died.

In Super Nintendo, I explore how this singular developer shaped the modern video game industry – and why its games have meant so much to so many. Drawing on interviews with its leading creators and lifelong fans, this is more than a nostalgia trip: it’s a story about why play matters, and what Nintendo can teach us about ourselves.

I dusted them down and miraculously they’re still working. Now I’d really like to maintain them properly – but how do I do that?”As the owner of about 20 vintage gaming systems, from a Prinztronic Tournament TV Game (one of the many Pong-style consoles released in the late 1970s) to a Sega Pico (a garish green electronic reading toy for children), maintenance is a constant obsession of mine. Your main concerns are environmental – you need to keep the machines at about 18C and no more than 50% humidity. I have a dehumidifier that comes on automatically when the number creeps up to 51. Wipe them regularly with a decent microfibre cloth that removes and retains dust, or use a small vacuum cleaner attachment to suck dust from the grills and other vulnerable places. Also, give your consoles plenty of room for ventilation when switched on – don’t stack them on top of each other, or put them in cubby holes.If you put them back into storage, I’d advise airtight plastic containers, with a silica gel pack or two to take care of any moisture (these will need to be replaced – I do it quarterly). Sadly, there’s always a chance that an internal component will fail at some point – your SNES is likely to be over 30 years old, after all. If you’re not ready to let go, there are a growing number of vintage console restorers online. You and I are certainly not alone.If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter –email us onpushingbuttons@theguardian.com.Explore more on these topicsGamesPushing Buttons newsletterWinter Olympics 2026SnowboardingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps best known as T’Challa in Black Panther, he was also a writer – and this2005 playbears all the lost promise of his talents.It is an ambitious, sprawling, music-filled story of a Black woman, Azure (Selina Jones), mourning her fiance, Deep (Jayden Elijah), who has been killed by a police officer. Inspired by the 2000 death of a university student, Prince Jones, it splices the theme of police violence in the US with a Shakespearean plot of jealousy, injustice, revenge and grief.The last of these is explored through a powerful portrait of Azure’s eating disorder alongside the reactions of Deep’s friends Tone (Elijah Cook) and Roshad (Justice Ritchie). Jones is astounding in the intensity of her performance, in her character’s anguish and interludes of movement.View image in fullscreenIntense … Selina Jones as Azure.Photograph: Sam TaylorThe play is a rich blend of hip-hop, song and verse, the language Shakespearean, too, in its lyricism. It was partly inspired by Shakespeare’s poetry and features snippets of his writing (such as the “too too solid flesh” soliloquy from Hamlet). The central storyline on avenging (or otherwise) the unjust death of a loved one traces that of Hamlet itself.The details around Deep’s death are initially opaque and Boseman’s experimental narrative appears deliberately abstruse, jumping from modern-day America to tsarist Russia, Rasputin and the enactment of a caterpillar chrysalis transforming into a butterfly. There are also satirical riffs on TV culture (such as Jerry Springer) and consumerism by a chorus.Dynamically directed by Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu, this ensemble has a vital presence as they beatbox, rap, sing and dance, although they are another puzzle of the piece, dressed in space-age costumes at the beginning, later turned into the marching-band members of a fictional university that Deep attended. They are human or not, as required, becoming parts of a car or cooing pigeons.‘You are all the Black Panther’: the electric theatre of Chadwick BosemanRead moreThere are times when the narrative grows too arcane to follow, the various strands seeming disparate and diversionary. The play pulls out some shocking twists and is faster, smoother and less perplexing in the second half, when its puzzling parts come together.It is complicated in its non-naturalism, but that is no bad thing.

Except it’s not deliciously wicked in adapter-director Kip Williams’ stage reinvention. Williams has proven himself a Midas-touched spinner of old stories to new. His one-woman version ofThe Picture of Dorian Graywas deliriously original. His take on Jean Genet’sThe Maidswas punk inspired. What has happened here?Arifa Akbar, the GuardianAs in the Australian director’s hit adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray (immaculately interpreted by the Succession star Sarah Snook), the stage is sometimes so crowded with camera operators and stage crew that it’s not always easy to see Erivo. The shallow rake in the stalls makes this theatre a less than ideal setting for Marg Horwell’s handsome scenic design: I spent at least half the evening watching the action on the large screen hanging overhead. Yet it becomes a hallucinatory experience all the same.Clive Davis, the TimesErivo dons wigs and skirts and recalibrates her voice to play Harker’s fiancee Mina and her friend Lucy; then spectacles to play psychiatrist Dr Seward and comic Saruman tresses for a guttural Van Helsing. It’s to her credit, and Williams’, that one sometimes loses track of which character is being broadcast live and which is recorded. The integration is mostly seamless. Personifications of Irish and American characters are knowingly ridiculous, but Dracula always had a vein of camp.Nick Curtis, the StandardIt’s refreshing to see Erivo get to own her queerness on stage, licking her lips lasciviously as a lace-decked Lucy who’s in sexual thrall to an androgynous Dracula – or strutting confidently in a masculine vest with silver chains (a welcome escape from her feminine get-ups in Wicked). She unleashes her ethereal voice to haunting, vulpine effect in the final scenes, where she finally gets to embody Dracula’s power on a bare stage, unobscured by tech and crowds.Alice Saville, the IndependentView image in fullscreen‘One sometimes loses track of which character is being broadcast live and which is recorded’ … Cynthia Erivo playing all the characters in Dracula at the Noël Coward theatre.Photograph: Daniel BoudThe multi-faceted approach speaks to the way that Stoker cut between first-person perspectives using a document-sharing and epistolary form. Equally, Williams’ boundary-breaking artistic toolkit brings out the thematic heart of the matter; it emphasises the way in which the predatory count stokes fears but also embodies deep-rooted desires.Dominic Cavendish, the TelegraphErivo seems ill at ease with the material. There’s a hesitancy about her performance, as if she were wrong-footed by the technology that surrounds her. A scattering of arch, self-conscious moments and sly humour are part of the deal in Williams’ interpretation, but nothing feels truly felt and, as she switches between characters, the individual voices are not always properly differentiated. The overall effect is slightly ramshackle, sluggish and, in the end, frustratingly short on dash and drama.Sam Marlowe, the StageErivo’s range is remarkable – alternately placid, pert, prowling and predatory. A Tony award-winning star of musical theatre in The Color Purple, she despatches one melancholy torch song by Clemence Williams with wistful nonchalance. Otherwise, her athletic efforts are magnified by a filmic soundtrack encompassing Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker, Chopin, Björk and even a bit of electro-trance music. For truly this is a mind-bogglingly complex show, which goes beyond the kitchen sink in its attempts to create an audio-visual hallucination.Patrick Marmion, Daily MailThe effects, with Craig Wilkinson as video designer, are impressive: a vampire flying by, Dracula crawling down the wall. The camera operators, wig providers, stage managers and props assistants are all assiduous and wonderfully efficient. Marg Horwell’s design is effectively flexible, Nick Schlieper’s lighting and the sound design by Jessica Dunn suitably dramatic, though Clemence Williams’ score becomes increasingly over-emphatic.Sarah Crompton, WhatsOnStageDespite stumbling over the odd line, Erivo is charismatic, game, and essentially does her best as a cog in Williams’ elaborate machine. But if you agree to tie your big comeback to a very specific directorial vision, there’s not much even a superstar actor can do if that vision is faulty.Andrzej Lukowski, Time OutExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndCynthia ErivoBram StokerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Ukrainian composerAnna Korsun’s piece Terricone is one of the most shattering creative acts of the war that began four years ago this month. Korsun was born in Donbas, where terricones, the slag heaps of the mining industry, bear witness to the way humankind has always reshaped the landscape. Her composition was premiered by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and its then chief conductor, the Ukrainian Kirill Karabits, at the start of 2023 – when news of the invasion brought worldwide shock and horror.I’ll never forget being in Poole for that performance, as the vividness of it brought the fear and desolation of the emotional landscapes of the war to the audience. The Russian conductor Vladimir Jurowski –a vocal criticof Putin’s regime – brought the powerful piece to London last month, as part of a bold Ukrainian/Russian programme with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.The creative courage of Korsun is astounding but far from unique, as Ukrainian musicians and composers find ways of living and working through the war. Among other performances that brought the cultural realities of the conflict to the UK isOpera Aperta’s Chornobyldorf, which the Kyiv-based company staged at the Huddersfield contemporary music festival in November 2022. Part opera, part video-installation, a folk-punk ritual for a post-Soviet, post-nuclear age, the performance brought the seismic forces of Ukrainian history to life in a breathtaking and unforgettable event.Gergiev’s closeness to Putin was clear in 2012 – yet these ties were only interrogated after the Ukraine conflict beganBut it is not only the Ukrainian musicians’ compositions and performances that matter: the war continues to expose and shatter the half-truths and hypocrisies of classical music culture. The Russian conductor Valery Gergiev’s closeness to Putin’s regime was as clear in 2012 as it was in 2022, yet it was only after the conflict began that these ties were interrogated and his performances and contracts outside Russiawere cancelled. (And I’m as culpable as any journalist, back in the yearswhen Gergiev was principal conductorof the London Symphony Orchestra, and when he was conductor of theWorld Orchestra for Peace– yes, that really happened, from 1998-2019, when Gergiev conducted 23 concerts and world tours.)For some Ukrainian musicians, the new reality they have chosen is “no Russian words from my lips, no Russian music from my hand”, as Nazarii Stets, one of the players of the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra (UFO), founded and conducted by Keri-Lynn Wilson, puts it. Works such as Beethoven’s fifth and ninth symphonies – both of which the UFO have toured and recorded (with a version of the Ode to Joy sung in Ukrainian) – were also composed in a time of conflict, andhave been mobilisedas bellicose ideological soundtracks ever since. The feverish intensity and commitment of the UFO’s playing, on the new recording of Symphony No 5 especially, is the sound of fierce hope, the sound of lives depending on the purpose and possibility of this music as a herald of peace and a call to action.Four years on, the war is more terrifying and more confronting precisely because it has become a fact of life, a steady state of horror. It no longer makes headlines in the same way, and those of us in the west risk forgetting that, for millions of Ukrainians today, the horror and trauma of the conflict is ever-present. Pieces like Korsun’s reveal the deeper realities of the consequences of the war. They are among the world’s most urgent musical messages.Happy 100th, Kurtág!View image in fullscreenGyörgy Kurtág on the stage of the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music in Budapest this month.Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Hungarian composer György Kurtág celebrates his 100th birthday tomorrow. His reaction to the world of conflict in which he was born was a radical journey inwards, to a place in which each note is live with energy and possibilities: “The F# is also a human being,” is a typical phrase.Kurtág’s longest piece,his opera on Beckett’s Endgame, premiered in 2018, when he was a mere 92. If his music isn’t yet part of your life’s listening, all you need are his most essential pieces, the 11 volumes ofJátékok (Games).These are aphoristic piano pieces, some mere seconds long, and often taking just one idea or even one note for a tiny walk in time. They are like a composer’s diary entries, full of puns, play and pleasure, with titles like The Bunny and the Fox, Thistle, and – my favourite – Play With Infinity. They’re also tributes and memorials to his friends, to fellow musicians, and to his life-partner, the pianist Márta Kurtág, with whom he shared a soul and a piano bench. (Listen and watch their duet performances, her arms enclosing his on the keyboard in Bach transcriptions, and you’ll feel immediately what I mean.)But watch out: these are “games” that play with the deepest and most existential stuff of music: they’re all playing with infinity.This week Tom has been listening to:Kurtág’s Movement for Viola and Orchestra. Written in 1954, this is music that goes straight into your soul. The piece unfurls from gorgeously desolate dissonance to a strange, radiant vision of hope in its final moments.Explore more on these topicsMusicTom Service on musicClassical musicValery GergievUkraineEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

His first concerts in the early 1960s, in London, New York and other major cities such as Milan, Vienna and Berlin, gave promise of a new talent that was exciting for its poetic expressivity rather than for daredevil virtuosity.That priority was maintained as his career unfolded, and although his repertoire was also to embrace Debussy, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven and Schumann, as well as the concertos of Rachmaninov and the chamber music of Brahms, it was Chopin and Liszt to which he constantly returned.From an early age he had aspired to the podium, too, and having studied conducting in Vienna and London, he eventually, in 1971, was able to make his conducting debut at the Menton festival, on the French Riviera. In 1979 he became musical director of the Northern Sinfonia (later Royal Northern Sinfonia), based in Newcastle upon Tyne, by which point he was devoting as much attention to conducting as to playing.Tamás Vásáry performing Zoltán Kodály’s Dances of MarossékFurther conducting appointments followed, including that of principal conductor of the Bournemouth Sinfonietta (1989–97), with which he recorded works by Respighi and Honegger, and in 1993 music director and principal conductor of the Hungarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, with which he toured to Britain in 1995. He also made guest appearances with leading orchestras such as the Berlin Philharmonic, the Accademia di Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome and the Orchestre de Paris. In 2006 he founded the Kodály Zoltán World Youth Orchestra for talented young players.As a musically gifted child he was supported, when his parents were forcibly relocated by the Hungarian government, by Zoltán Kodály, who handed him a packet of hundred-forint bills, gave him a Steinway grand piano and invited him to take over half his solfège class. Kodály regarded him as his adopted son, while the composer was for Vásáry a role model who greatly influenced his upbringing.View image in fullscreenVásáry in 1981.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyFollowing successes in international competitions in Warsaw, Paris and Brussels (1955–56), he was able to emigrate, initially to Brussels, in December 1956. On the overthrow of the Hungarian revolution his father, who as a political figure had been placed under house arrest in 1951, was released from detention on the intervention of the Belgian dowager Queen Elisabeth, after whom the country’s music competitions are still named. The family settled in Switzerland the following year, where Ernest Ansermet, on Kodály’s recommendation, offered Tamás concerts. He also received substantial financial support from leading members of Swiss society.From 1970 he lived in London, and continued to reside there after taking Swiss nationality in 1971. His career in Britain had taken off in the previous decade thanks to a series of recordings for Deutsche Grammophon and a successful Tchaikovsky concert with the Royal Philharmonic. He was soon giving more than 100 concerts a year with the world’s leading orchestras, and later calculated that he had given more than 8,000 concerts over the course of his life.Born in Debrecen, Hungary’s second-largest city, Tamás was the son of Erzsébet (nee Baltazár) and Jozsef Vásáry, a senator in the Hungarian National Assembly, who became a secretary of state in the cabinet of the reformist communistImre Nagy. He studied at the music conservatory in Debrecen under Margit Höchtle and made his stage debut at the age of eight in his home town, playing one of Mozart’s early piano concertos. His solo recital debut took place the following year.He then studied under József Gát, Lajos Hernádi and Kodály at theFranz LisztAcademy of Music, winning the Franz Liszt Competition there at the age of 14. He contributed to the family income when his father was dismissed from office, gaining experience in cabaret, jazz and operetta.Tamás Vásáry playing and directing Mozart’s Piano Concerto No 21 in C major, K467, with the Savaria Symphony OrchestraHe was still only 24 when in 1957 he was invited by Deutsche Grammophon to record a disc of popular pieces by Liszt, including two Hungarian Rhapsodies, two Consolations, the Paraphrase on Verdi’s Rigoletto and La Campanella. On a subsequent rerelease of the disc, the critic Bryce Morrison wrote: “When it comes to terms such as leggierissimo and precipitato Vásáry has few equals,” while the opening flourishes of the Rigoletto Paraphrase would “make less nimble pianists weep with envy”. Other Liszt recordings from this period included the two concertos with the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra under Felix Prohaska (1960) and another of theB minor Piano Sonatacoupled with the Réminiscences de Don Juan and a polonaise (1961).Then came the abundance of Chopin recordings between 1964 and 1966, including the two concertos with the Berlin Philharmonic under Janos Kulka and Jerzy Semkow, the Scherzi, the Second andThirdSonatas, both sets ofEtudes, the Nocturnes, Impromptus,Ballades, Waltzes and a selection of Mazurkas. The concertos were notably less demonstrative than some other readings, the slow movements characterised by superbly expressive touches, the finales full of imagination. All the solo pieces were marked by Vásáry’s clarity of articulation and digital dexterity, though the pieces were never allowed to become vehicles of superficial virtuosity.The Nocturnes were dispatched with unaffected candour, with contained rubati, lacking Romantic excess. Inthe Waltzeshe was skilful at teasing out the melancholy under the surface glitter. Sometimes the playing could be criticised for lacking expressive variety and tonal richness, but there were ample compensations in the tenderness and poetic sensitivity always in evidence. He returned to the concertos in recordings with the Northern Sinfonia in the 1980s.In 1967 he married Ildikó Kutasi-Kovács, a cultural anthropologist; she died in 1994. His subsequent marriage to Henriett Tunyogi, a ballet dancer, actor and director, ended in divorce in 2019.Tamás Vásáry, pianist and conductor, born 11 August 1933; died 5 February 2026Explore more on these topicsClassical musicHungaryFrédéric ChopinFranz LisztobituariesShareReuse this content"

It was a Warner Bros civil war epic, the kind of production where the scale alone made you feel small. I was playing a low-ranking Confederate aide-de-camp to General Stonewall Jackson. I was young, unsure of myself, and painfully aware of exactly where I stood in the hierarchy of things.That morning, they placed him on the horse.He sat tall and still in the saddle, dressed as Robert E Lee – grey coat, grey beard, grey sky above him – and he didn’t seem like an actor in costume. He seemed as if he had stepped out of the earth itself. He was Lee, and more than that, he was Duvall –a distant relative of Lee, too, which somehow made it all feel inevitable. He carried the weight of history effortlessly.View image in fullscreenRobert Duvall as General Robert E Lee, right, with Stephen Lang as Lt Gen Thomas ‘Stonewall’ Jackson in Gods and Generals, 2003.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarI remember standing there in my uniform, the wool damp and heavy on my shoulders, and feeling terrified. Not of him, but of disappointing the truth in the scene. He had a way of making you aware of truth without ever saying a word. We worked the entire day in that mud. Horses breathing. Cannons in the distance. Extras shifting in formation. And then it was over.I retreated to my honey wagon – a sliver of a room somehow called a trailer. It was barely wide enough to turn around in, but to me it was a palace. I was just grateful to be there. I peeled off my boots, my socks damp and stiff, and began to change back into myself.I tried to hide my shock. The idea that he had noticed me at all was overwhelmingThere was a knock at the door. I opened it to find Bobby’s assistant. He said, simply: “Mr Duvall would like to know if you’d join him for dinner.”I tried to hide my shock. Duvall was legendary for calling out actors when they weren’t being truthful. He had no patience for falseness. He protected the work fiercely. The idea that he had noticed me at all was overwhelming.Of course I said yes.We met at a quiet restaurant not far from where we were staying. He was already seated when I arrived, relaxed, unassuming, almost invisible despite being one of the greatest actors alive. He looked at me for a moment and said, in that soft, unmistakable voice: “You’re a nice actor. You didn’t push the emotion.”The scene was ultimately cut from the film. But that moment was not.View image in fullscreenDuvall directing on location for The Apostle in 1996.Photograph: Butcher’s Run Films/AllstarHe didn’t elaborate. He didn’t need to. In those few words, he gave me something no one else ever had: permission. Permission to trust stillness. To trust restraint. To trust myself.That dinner began a friendship that would shape the rest of my life. At the time, my acting career was unremarkable. I wasn’t getting the parts I wanted. I was drifting, quietly losing faith in the path I’d chosen. Bobby saw that before I ever said it aloud. He told me I should write. He had done it himself withThe Apostle, released in 1997 and one of the most personal films ever made. He understood that sometimes you have to create the thing you’re meant to inhabit.View image in fullscreenDuvall and Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart, Scott Cooper’s directorial debut feature, which was produced by Duvall.Photograph: Album/AlamySo I began writing. That screenplay becameCrazy Heart. It was deeply influenced by his performance in Tender Mercies – that gentle, heartbreaking portrayal of a man worn down by his own life, searching for grace in the quiet corners. It remains one of the most truthful performances ever captured on film.Bobby was the first person to read the script. He called me shortly after. “You’re going to direct it,” he said. Not a question. A statement. “I’ll produce it. Who do you want to play Bad Blake?”I told him I had written it forJeff Bridges, whom I didn’t know. And that I wanted T Bone Burnett to produce the music. I didn’t know him, either.A year later, Jeff Bridges finally read the script. The rest became part of my life’s storyBobby said, “Then write them letters.” Passionate letters. Honest letters. So I did.A year later, Jeff finally read the script. The rest became part of my life’s story. But it began with Bobby’s belief. To call him a mentor is inadequate. He was as close to a father as I’ve ever known. He didn’t have children, and I think, in some quiet way, we found something in each other that filled a space in both of us.We spoke nearly every day. Sometimes several times a day. We talked about Virginia – his beloved state, and mine. We talked about film endlessly. Coppola.Grosbard. Ford. Then Ray. Loach. Leigh.The Dardennes. International cinema we both loved, where truth was allowed to breathe.View image in fullscreenDuvall and Scott Cooper backstage at the Independent Spirit awards in Los Angeles in 2010.Photograph: Jeff Vespa/WireImageOne afternoon at his home in Virginia, he took me into his library – a quiet room filled with books, scripts, and the accumulated life of a man devoted entirely to the work. He led me to a corner where two handwritten notes were framed side by side on the wall.One was from Gene Kelly, praising Bobby’s performance inLonesome Dove. It ended with a gentle tease: “PS What, no tango?” Bobby smiled when I read it. Tango had become one of the great passions of his later life, something he shared with Luciana, his beloved Argentinian wife. He spoke about tango the way he spoke about acting – not as performance, but as truth. As listening.The other note was from Marlon Brando. Brando praised Bobby as one of the greatest screen actors that ever lived, and ended with words that felt at once deeply personal and universal: “In the meantime, take care of yourself, direct another movie, and stop looking for Tangerine. She doesn’t exist.”View image in fullscreenDuvall and Tommy Lee Jones in 1989’s Lonesome Dove.Photograph: Columbia/Sportsphoto/AllstarBobby never explained what Brando meant. He didn’t have to. He wasn’t showing me those letters to impress me. He was sharing something quieter – a reminder that even the greatest artists carry doubt, longing and the lifelong search for truth.That search defined him.Regarding acting and directing actors, he would say: “Don’t rehearse your actors and never have a goal in mind. Start at zero and let the scene take you somewhere unexpected. If you’ve done your work, it will take you where you’re supposed to go.”He believed that completely. He lived that way as an actor. You see it in The Godfather, in the quiet intelligence of Tom Hagen –consigliereto the Corleone crime family – the stillness behind the eyes. You see it in Apocalypse Now, in Kilgore’s terrifying calm. You see it in Tender Mercies, in every pause, every breath. And perhaps most of all, in his beloved Gus McCrae in Lonesome Dove. He never showed you emotion. He allowed you to discover it.He never performed. He simply existed.View image in fullscreenFrom left, front, Harry Melling, Cooper and Duvall, on set for The Pale Blue Eye in 2022.Photograph: Scott Garfield/Everett Collection/AlamyMy wife, Jocelyne, and I were married on his Virginia estate, land viewed by George Washington himself in 1746. At that house and mine, we talked about everything. Sports. Politics. He was an old-school Republican. I was a liberal Democrat. But we listened to each other. Really listened. There was no performance in those conversations, either. Just curiosity. Respect. But it was film that bound us most deeply.For more than two decades, Bobby was a steady presence in my life. He saw something in me before I had earned it. He protected that fragile early belief when it mattered most.Years later, I had the privilege of directing him, alongsideChristian Bale, in The Pale Blue Eye, in the winter of 2021-22. Watching him work again, after everything we had shared, felt like time folding in on itself. He was older, quieter, but the truth in him had only deepened. He needed less than ever. A glance. A breath. And everything was there.Robert Duvall: a life in picturesRead moreJust recently, we had spoken about another role – a blind man in a story about a wounded civil war soldier making his way home through enemy territory, like Odysseus finding his way back to Ithaca. Bobby understood that man immediately. He knew his weariness. His dignity. His grace. It was a role he was meant to play. One we never got to make.Robert Duvall’s legacy is secure. He is one of the greatest actors who ever lived. His work will endure as long as cinema itself endures. But that isn’t what I will miss most.I will miss his voice on the phone.His laughter.The way he made me feel that the work mattered, and that I mattered, too. I will miss my friend.I will miss Bobby D.Explore more on these topicsFilmRobert DuvallFilm industryJeff BridgesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is also an unusual point from which to draw a line to a former first lady of the US, but while pairing a tiny animated rodent with Michelle Obama as co-style icons is a mismatch on paper, it is not so in spirit. At the 2009 inauguration, Obama wore a lemongrass coat and dress by Isabel Toledo, offset by olive-green leather gloves. Her daughters, Malia and Sasha, were chicly bundled in scarf-and-glove sets chosen to contrast with their coats. Their clothes were elegant, but it was the accessories that made the look memorable.

It’s safety first, and function-led. You choose your coat for warmth, your shoes for traction.

But it was also the start of something new: an experiment in multigenerational living and building a house with zero experienceAlison TaylorWed 18 Feb 2026 01.45 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 03.37 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleWeekend breakfasts have always been big in our house. Usually a cereal course followed by a full English. It’s the execution that makes it special for me – the colourful tablecloth, the mix of breadandtoast (so you can fold over a slice of your choice to make a mini bacon sandwich), the teapot, the ginger biscuits you dunk into your tea for “afters”.When I’d visit home in Yorkshire from London, where I lived for 20 years, I treasured these breakfast moments, sitting around the table with Mum and Dad and enjoying the well-oiled ritual in the suburban three-bed semi where I’d grown up.In January 2025, I sat down for my final breakfast at that table, marking a turning point in all our lives. After we had twins and became a family of five, my partner and I decided to move our three small children back to Yorkshire in 2020, to be closer to Mum and Dad.Around the same time, they sold their house and we decided to build them a bungalow in our garden. We put 80% of their belongings into storage and moved Mum and Dad in with us until the build was complete.Packing up Mum and Dad’s house, my house, felt like a massive goodbye – that bedroom, those memories, the feeling of safety and refuge I always felt there. I knew exactly where all the creaks were on the stairs and how many steps in total (13).That evening, I basked in the blue glow of the gas fire watching a Jane McDonald travelogue on Channel 5, temporarily free of my own responsibilities, sedated by nostalgia. We ordered “an Imran’s” – curry from the best takeaway in town – our treat after a day of packing.View image in fullscreenMoving on to the next adventure.Photograph: Courtesy of Alison TaylorEven though I’m a grown woman in my 40s with my own family, it felt scary to take the leap, and not have “home” to go back to.On our final morning in the house, Mum diligently wrapped mixing bowls and jugs of every size, and separate biscuit containers for each genre of biscuit. We packed at least four types of vacuum cleaner (they’re big on cleaning), and crockery I’ve known since childhood: the weird pot with the face on it that houses scouring pads; the bright red bread bin.We took a break from the mind-bending, never-ending enormity of packing to sit down for that last breakfast. Mum voiced what we were all thinking: it was strange to see the place so empty. I worried that they’d begin to think they’d made a mistake.“How do you feel?” I asked, tentatively. There was a pause as Dad continued to pour the tea, and I held my breath.“Well, it’s pretty awesome, isn’t it?” he replied.I breathed a huge sigh of relief. I had expected sadness, maybe even doubt – but, ever the optimist, he was already looking to the future. His response made something shift in me, too.Yes, it was a huge goodbye in so many ways, but it was also the start of something new: an adventure in multigenerational living – and building a house with zero experience. I realised this wasn’t about loss at all, but about movement and trust. Moving them into our home wasn’t a rescue mission; it was our next adventure.For months, I’d been quietly spiralling about the future – as an older mum of three small kids with two ageing parents, it’s hard not to worry about the practicalities. I had a creeping panic that time was speeding up, and kept returning to the idea that if we were going to do something bold to future-proof our family set-up, it had to be now – while they were still well enough to enjoy it, and while the kids were young enough to see it as normal rather than an intrusion. I didn’t want care to reach a crisis point; I wanted it to be a choice.Hearing Dad’s cheerfulness – his utter absence of regret – I realised that what I’d been framing as “the end of an era” was actually the start of a new one. Sitting at the table, making my mini bacon sandwich, I realised I was ready for our next chapter.I’ve learned that future-proofing isn’t just practical planning, it’s optimism, disguised as logistics. Breakfast still happens; it’s just at a different table now. And we’re creating new rituals: I talked Dad into trying a breakfast burrito with me the other day. He observed me prepping the avocado (his nemesis), refried beans and other foreign-to-him accoutrements, and I could almost hear a drum roll in my head as he took his first bite of the filled tortilla wrap. A pause. “Mmmmmm.” Then his face lit up, and in the style of Peter Kay, he proclaimed: “It’s the future”.Alison Taylor can be found at:alitaylormovesmumanddadin.substack.comExplore more on these topicsLife and styleA moment that changed meFamilyParents and parentingAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s what we turn to in times of strife, when spirits are flagging, or to start our day. And when a visitor calls, one of the first things we do is put the kettle on.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While many small appliances have evolved beyond their original form, the kettle’s basic principles remain largely unchanged. Water goes in and heats up until a thermostat switches it off; the water then pours out, and we enjoy a cuppa. However, the technology that goes into a kettle has been slowly improving: better insulation to keep water hotter for longer and reduce reboils; different temperature settings to suit every drink from green tea to herbal brews; and more features such as filters and concealed elements to keep scale out of our cups.When your existing kettle makes its last brew and must be taken to the big recycling centre in the sky, it pays to check out what’s on offer to replace it. The next one you buy may make more of a difference to your day than you might think.At a glanceBest kettle overall:Bosch Sky kettle£79.99 at AmazonBest budget kettle:Kenwood Ripple kettle£39 at John LewisThe forever kettle:Dualit Classic kettle£149.99 at John LewisThe fastest-boiling kettle:Ninja Perfect Temperature kettle£79.99 at NinjaBest quiet kettle:Zwilling Enfinigy Pro kettle£124.95 at Harts Of SturBest budget variable temperature kettle:Lakeland Digital double-walled kettle£44.99 at LakelandWhy you should trust meWhen a friend heard I was writing this, she asked me, “Aren’t all kettles the same? They all boil water, don’t they?” And while she’s right about the second part, it took me at least 15 minutes to explain why she was wrong about the first. I’ve been testing kettles for years, and they vary greatly – in design, weight, ease of maintenance, ease of use and build quality. Some will last for decades while others will barely make it past the basic guarantee period. In short, yes, all kettles boil water – but they are far from being all the same.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach kettle was hooked up to a power meter to assess electricity consumption.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianAs you can imagine, I boiled a lot of water. Litres upon litres of the stuff. Enough to turn my kitchen into the steamiest hammam and clear my pores of blackheads I’ve had since I was a teenager.But testing wasn’t just about making gallons of tea and having a deep skin cleanse on the cheap. I also brought a lot of gadgets to the party: a power meter to assess electricity use for each kettle when boiling exactly one litre of water from cold; a timer to measure how long that took; and a probe thermometer to gauge how long it took for the kettle to click off once it had reached boiling point.Fancy a cuppa? My epic kettle showdown – and what I learnedRead moreExternal temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer and the highest reading noted, while maximum noise levels were recorded with the Decibel X app. After boiling, water temperature was checked at the 30-minute, one- and two-hour points to see how much it had cooled.I tested 13 kettles in total. Those we tested but haven’t included areCurrys Essentials C17JKW17 jug kettle, which is a snip at £6.99 but lacks durability, and theRussell Hobbs 23840 lightweight travel kettle, which is probably one of the best travel models you can buy at £15, but took almost six minutes to boil its 850ml.The ones that made the cut were selected on the basis of good energy efficiency or low minimum fill, plus ease of use or maintenance. Value for money has also been considered, as have longer guarantees and durable build quality that should translate into a lengthy lifespan for the appliance. All samples have been returned to their supplier or donated toCaterham Round Tableto raise funds for local causes and charity projects.The best kettles in 2026View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest kettle overall:Bosch Sky kettleBoschSky kettlefrom£79.99£79.99 at John Lewis£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe lower temperatures are ideal for green tea drinkersWhat we don’t loveIt’s not the priciest here but it’s still an investment buyPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£79.99 at John Lewis£79.99 at AmazonOffering variable temperatures and a double-walled stainless-steel housing, the 3kW Sky is a brilliant blend of robust form and function. It boasts a low minimum boil (300ml), a keep-warm setting and touch controls.Why we love itI found it difficult to select a best kettle from so many that performed well, but the Bosch Sky clinched it because it’s such a good all-rounder that will suit most people. It pours well, has a button that’s within easy reach of the handle so it’s simple to open the lid without touching it, and it’s insulated so the exterior doesn’t become too hot to touch. From a design perspective, it has a more industrial feel than many others – no frippery here – but not too modern that it wouldn’t fit into most kitchens. Its display is thoughtfully designed, easy to keep clean and lights up as it heats.The exterior doesn’t get too hot (up to 40C), and while it wasn’t the fastest to boil in testing, it was only seconds behind the Dualit below. It clicked off at boiling point, and the water was still a toasty 78C 30 minutes later. At the hour point, it was 66C, and two hours 52C, meaning you’ll spend less time and energy reboiling.It’s a shame that …its premium look ends at the handle, which seems cheap and plasticky next to the sleek aesthetic of the rest of it.Time to boil one litre:2mins 22secsMinimum fill:300mlPower use:0.112kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximumnoise recorded:59dBTemperature settings:70C, 75C, 80C, 85C, 90C, 95C, 100C, keep warmWarranty:two yearsBoschSky kettlefrom£79.99£79.99 at John Lewis£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe lower temperatures are ideal for green tea drinkersWhat we don’t loveIt’s not the priciest here but it’s still an investment buyBest budget kettle:Kenwood Ripple kettleKenwoodRipple kettlefrom£39£39 at John Lewis£39 at AmazonWhat we loveThe single cup marking makes it great for a solo householdWhat we don’t loveIts base is light but also feels flimsyPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£39 at John Lewis£39 at AmazonAvailable in four “ocean-inspired” shades – eggshell blue, storm blue, pure white and midnight black – Kenwood’s Ripple kettle has a subtle design that belies its affordable price tag. It’s practical, too: there’s a 3kW element, a wide pouring spout to prevent drips, and two water windows showing cups on one side and litres on the other (making it left-hander friendly).Why we love itMore affordable kettles tend to demand a higher minimum fill – usually 500ml – but the Ripple enables those on a budget to boil a single cup (200ml), providing excellent energy economy. There’s even a plastic marker inside for one and two cups and max, so you don’t need to watch the water window as you’re filling. It’s lightweight at 950g without feeling flimsy, has a pull-off lid for easier filling, and it boiled quickly in testing, retaining its heat well for the first 30 minutes (72C) and hour (60C).It’s a shame that …the lightweight plastic body meant that the external temperature was very hot after boiling (80C). Its two-hour temperature (44C) was also much cooler than the one-hour point, meaning more energy is needed to reboil.Time to boil:2mins 30secsMinimum fill:200mlPower use:0.118kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:57dBTemperature settings:100CWarranty:one yearKenwoodRipple kettlefrom£39£39 at John Lewis£39 at AmazonWhat we loveThe single cup marking makes it great for a solo householdWhat we don’t loveIts base is light but also feels flimsyThe forever kettle:Dualit Classic kettleDualitClassic kettlefrom£129£129 at Hughes£149.99 at John LewisWhat we loveLong-life appliances are a win for your pocket and the planetWhat we don’t loveThe matching toaster is UK-made but the kettle isn’tPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£129 at Hughes£149.99 at John LewisAlthough it comes with a higher initial outlay, Dualit’s Classic kettle is more of a “buy right, buy once” appliance. It’s as robust as they come, with a durable stainless-steel body, hinged lid, anti-wobble feet and non-drip spout. But it’s the repairable nature of this kettle that makes it an eco-friendly buy. The 3kW element is replaceable, so a pro can swap it for a new one or repair it if it wears out, meaning you may never need to buy a new kettle again.Why we love itRepairability aside, the Dualit Classic kettle also makes it easy to boil only as much water as you need, with a low minimum fill (250ml) and dual water windows indicating cups and litres via multiple markings. There’s no button to raise the lid, meaning one less thing to go wrong; instead, it has a heatproof plastic handle. It was also the fastest boiling of all the kettles tested and clicked off bang on boiling point.It’s a shame that …the exterior gets hot after boiling – our sample reached 71C. It also lacked a choice of temperatures and a keep-warm function, despite the higher price.Time to boil one litre:2mins 15secsMinimum fill:250mlPower use:0.114kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:57dBTemperature settings:100CWarranty:one yearDualitClassic kettlefrom£129£129 at Hughes£149.99 at John LewisWhat we loveLong-life appliances are a win for your pocket and the planetWhat we don’t loveThe matching toaster is UK-made but the kettle isn’tThe fastest-boiling kettle:Ninja Perfect Temperature kettleNinjaPerfect Temperature kettlefrom£79.99£79.99 at Ninja£79.99 at ArgosWhat we loveSpeedy boiling means no waiting around for your waterWhat we don’t loveThere’s only three colours: black, silver or dark bluePhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£79.99 at Ninja£79.99 at ArgosAs you’d expect from Ninja, this kettle has features galore, right down to the same familiar beep all Ninja appliances use when you turn them on. However, most notable is its “hold temp”, which keeps your water at a selected temperature for up to half an hour – great for the easily distracted and busy households alike.Why we love itOut of all the kettles tested, this was the fastest, boiling its litre in just over two minutes with its 3kW element. Also in its favour is a 250ml minimum fill, although this is only shown on the inside of the kettle, not the outside. Both cups and litres are denoted in multiple increments on its water window, so there’s little chance of boiling more than you need. The six different temperatures each has its own button, meaning no need to scroll until you reach your desired heat. The only place it came unstuck was a lack of insulation. Heat was retained for the first 30 minutes (72C) and hour (58C), but its two-hour temperature was 43C.It’s a shame that …the exterior becomes very hot: the meter registered a temperature of 97C just before boiling. Plus, it took a couple of seconds to click off once 100C had been reached.Time to boil:2mins 7secsPower usage:0.102kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesNoise:55dBTemperature settings:60C, 70C, 80C, 90C, 95C, 100C, hold tempWarranty:two yearsNinjaPerfect Temperature kettlefrom£79.99£79.99 at Ninja£79.99 at ArgosWhat we loveSpeedy boiling means no waiting around for your waterWhat we don’t loveThere’s only three colours: black, silver or dark blueBest quiet kettle:Zwilling Enfinigy Pro kettleZwillingEnfinigy Pro kettlefrom£124.95£124.95 at Harts Of Stur£143 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s rare to find a lifetime warranty on a kettleWhat we don’t loveYou can’t just boil a single cuppaPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£124.95 at Harts Of Stur£143 at AmazonTaking variable temperature kettles to new heights, the Enfinigy Pro kettle doesn’t just feature different temperatures for your tea and a keep warm option, it also boasts a baby bottle sterilisation setting. Add in the wipe-clean touchscreen, fast boiling and insulated dual-wall body to maintain the water’s heat, and it makes a bettergift for new parentsthan all the nappy cakes in the world.Why we love itWhile the 500ml minimum fill is higher than many, I liked the robust feel and sleek look of this kettle, with its cup and litre measurements marked neatly inside the jug. I also appreciated the clear display and choice of temperatures, as well as the reassuring lifetime warranty. It was easily the quietest when boiling and didn’t grow hot on the exterior, reaching a cool-touch 31C. Heat retention was brilliant: after 30 minutes, the water was still 81C, dropping to only 71C after an hour and 57C after two.It’s a shame that …it’s a seriously slow boiler, due to its 1.85kW element, and it continued to boil for three seconds after reaching 100C.Time to boil:4mins 7secsMinimum fill:500mlPower use:0.121kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:43dBTemperature settings:40C, 60C, 70C, 80C, 93C, 100C, keep warmWarranty:lifetimeZwillingEnfinigy Pro kettlefrom£124.95£124.95 at Harts Of Stur£143 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s rare to find a lifetime warranty on a kettleWhat we don’t loveYou can’t just boil a single cuppaBest budget variable temperature kettle:Lakeland Digital double-walled kettleLakelandDigital double-walled kettlefrom£44.99£44.99 at Lakeland£44.99 at AmazonWhat we love5C increments give greater temperature choiceWhat we don’t loveThe markings are inside, making accurate filling trickyPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£44.99 at Lakeland£44.99 at AmazonLakeland’s Digital double-walled kettle proves you don’t have to splash the cash for a well-insulated, variable temperature kettle – or one with a decent warranty length. With a powerful 3kW element, a wide choice of temperatures and a keep-warm setting, plus easy controls, it’s hard to ask for more at this price.Why we love itWhat impressed me most about this kettle, aside from its choice of 13 temperatures, was its large, clear display. It’s easy to read from afar, and the temperature is easy to set with plus and minus buttons. The kettle looks and feels premium for the price, with its measurements all marked on the interior.The double-walled construction served it well: the exterior reached only 27C, while the water was still 78C after 30 minutes, dropping to 67C after an hour and 53C after two. However, it did take a couple of seconds to click off after boiling.It’s a shame that …this kettle’s lid catch isn’t as well engineered as the rest of it: its flimsy feel makes me worry that it may not go the distance.Time to boil:2mins 30secsMinimum fill:500mlPower use:0.112kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:57dBTemperature settings:40C, 45C, 50C, 55C, 60C, 65C, 70C, 75C, 80C, 85C, 90C, 95C, 100C, keep warmWarranty:three yearsLakelandDigital double-walled kettlefrom£44.99£44.99 at Lakeland£44.99 at AmazonWhat we love5C increments give greater temperature choiceWhat we don’t loveThe markings are inside, making accurate filling trickyThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Used the least energy of those tested’: the Swan Alexa smart kettle.Swan Alexa smart kettleSwanAlexa smart kettlefrom£79.99£80 at AO£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveLooks seriously hi-tech on the worktopWhat we don’t loveThe kettle is robust but the handle feels cheapPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£80 at AO£79.99 at AmazonBest for:energy efficiencyThis wifi-connected kettle won’t be for everyone, but it might appeal to those who, hands full with kids or shopping, would like Alexa to put on the kettle for them.

It’s well insulated too, with the exterior only reaching 32C after boiling and the water still registering a balmy 57C after two hours.It didn’t make the final cut because …its 1.8kW element meant it was slow to boil, and it took about six seconds to click off after reaching boiling point.

However, there’s no getting away from the fact that it’s one of the priciest while not offering much more than the others. The good stuff: it’s stylish, has excellent build quality and a 3kW element that boiled very fast. It also clicked off as soon as it reached 100C, and has a base that allows the cable to emerge from anywhere it pleases. There’s an extensive choice of colours, too, plus a soft-rise lid for minimal splashes.It didn’t make the final cut because …minimum fill appears to be 500ml, although it’s not marked as such, and the external temperature reached a sizzling 99C after boiling. Heat retention was decent at first – 70C after 30 minutes – but after two hours, it had reduced to a tepid 41C, meaning more energy is required for a reboil.Time to boil one litre:2mins 17secs;minimum fill:500ml;power use:0.114kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWh;matching toaster?Yes;maximum noise recorded:60dB;temperature settings:100C;warranty:two yearsSmeg50s-style kettlefrom£128£128 at John Lewis£149.95 at SmegWhat we loveFeels robust while oozing styleWhat we don’t loveA high minimum fill means you’ll always be boiling for twoTower Scandi kettleTowerScandi kettlefrom£27.46£27.46 at Wayfair£29.99 at TowerWhat we loveA bargain price frees up more money for luxe tea and coffeeWhat we don’t loveLooks lovely but feels a bit plastickyPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£27.46 at Wayfair£29.99 at TowerBest for:an affordable luxury kettleIf the price of the two stylish kettles above has you wincing, fear not: you can bag an attractive kettle for less than £30.

It’s also not very well insulated: the exterior reached 84C after boiling, and while the water temperature was 72C 30 minutes after boiling, it registered at only 44C two hours later.Time to boil one litre:2mins 21secs;minimum fill:500ml;power use:0.117kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWh;matching toaster?Yes;maximum noise recorded:59dB;temperature settings:100C;warranty:one yearTowerScandi kettlefrom£27.46£27.46 at Wayfair£29.99 at TowerWhat we loveA bargain price frees up more money for luxe tea and coffeeWhat we don’t loveLooks lovely but feels a bit plastickyWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenWhat key features should I look out for?How you use your kettle will probably dictate which functions you’ll find the most useful, but generally, any feature that helps to save energy is valuable. For example, kettles that are dual-walled help to trap heat inside, so the water stays warmer for longer while the outside stays cool to the touch.Those with low minimum fills enable you to boil just enough water for a single cup, so you don’t waste energy heating more than you need. Some kettles also have a keep-warm function that stops the water cooling below a certain temperature, which is ideal for those who become distracted after boiling or drink consecutive cuppas. It’s a good idea to check for safety features too, such as an auto shut-off to prevent it from boiling dry if there’s not enough water.Other features are more “nice to haves”: variable temperature models enable you to choose water heated to lower temperatures than boiling, such as 70C or 80C, for other types of tea or for filling a hot-water bottle. Concealed elements, which are easier to keep scale-free, and removable, washable limescale filters will be useful for those who live in hard-water areas. Then there’s connectivity. While wifi-enabled and voice-controlled kettles can feel a little gimmicky, they can be a gift for busy parents who usually have their hands full.Are rapid-boiling kettles faster than normal ones?Rapid-boil kettles don’t have a strict industry definition, so while a rapid-boil kettle should boil water quickly, it may not differ much from one that’s not labelled as such.A more reliable indicator of how fast a kettle will boil is its power rating: this is listed either in watts (eg 3,000W) or kilowatts (eg 2.2kW). The higher the number, the more power its element can use to heat water quickly. However, this isn’t the whole story: boiling times can also be quicker in double-walled kettles (as they lose less heat to their surroundings) and those with concealed or flat elements (which provide more surface area to heat the water than a coil).How to descale your kettleLimescale reduces your kettle’s efficiency, costing you more to boil each time, and shortening the appliance’s lifespan. Descale it monthly, especially if you live in a hard-water area. Standing water encourages the buildup of limescale, so try not to leave water in the kettle after use.While you can buy descaler in the supermarket, a lower-cost and more eco-friendly option is to combine a weak food-safe acid, such as white vinegar or lemon juice, with water. Fill the kettle three-quarters with either water and the juice of one lemon or equal parts water and vinegar. Let it soak for an hour, then boil the kettle (once for vinegar, three times for lemon). Once it’s cooled, rinse thoroughly. If your kettle has a removable filter, take it out and rinse it under running water at the same time.For more:The best toasters for toast, bagels and crumpetsThe best frying pans for every kind of cookKitchen gadgets top chefs can’t live withoutRachel Ogden has worked as a consumer journalist for decades, becoming an expert unboxer before it was a thing, although she’s much lessadept at repacking.

The war in Sudan has been going on for almost three years now, and Ramadan is a month that arrives with heightened feelings for those fasting in the middle of conflict and displacement. The cookbook, a first-of-its-kind collection of Sudanese recipes, is both a celebration of Sudan and a reminder of all that is at stake.View image in fullscreenFood culture on the ground … Sudan’s political story is heavily linked to its gastronomy.Photograph: Mazin Al Rasheed Zein, Manuel Krug, Antonie RobertsonAl Tijani first realised he needed to learn how to make his own Sudanese food while he was a student at the University of Manchester in the early 2010s. The packages of treats his mother prepared never lasted long enough; he grew sick of student food and began looking for recipes, but there were few resources. Over 15 years, his passion for tracing and documenting Sudanese recipes took him all overSudan, and his work became, as he told me, “bound” in Sudan’s political story. He gathered recipes and food culture on the ground during the revolution that overthrew president Omar al-Bashir, Sudan’s dictator of 30 years.“As I embarked on the project,” Al Tijani told me, we were “embroiled in the revolution, we drove all over Sudan during fuel cuts, protests, sit-ins. Khartoum itself was teeming with revolutionary spirit.”What he found is a cuisine that is not uniform, just as Sudan is not.A diverse country and cuisineView image in fullscreenMix of influences … women prepare dried okra in the yard of a typical Sudanese house.Photograph: Ala kheirSudanese food, Al Tijani tells me, encompasses a colossal range of dishes across a vast country, mixing African and Arab influences. But because Sudan’s political and economic power was centred in Khartoum and the heartlands of the country’s elites, so much of Sudan’s food is unknown to its own people. The Sudanese Kitchen, he said, is a revelation to both non-Sudanese and Sudanese people. He himself was astonished to find that mushrooms were grown in parts of Sudan, and that they were cooked in a dish called “chicken stew without bones”. (I tell him that I was similarly astonished that “gurasa”, a thick salty pancake that was a staple in our household, was not something everyone else consumed. It was like hearing that others didn’t eat toast.)Perusing the book is an experience of meeting the country, so diligently has Al Tijani traced recipes to regions and topographies. But there is an inescapable sense of loss that hovers over the whole endeavour. One made even more poignant by all the imagery of homes, yards, and mothers and grandmothers at their stoves. For so many, life is either suspended or erased due to a war that has led Sudan to experience the largestdisplacement and hungercrisis in the world.Food in the long shadow of warView image in fullscreenRelics of joy … a man making agashe, a grilled meat dish, in El Obeid, central Sudan.Photograph: Ala kheirIf The Sudanese Kitchen had come out before the war, it would have inspired a very different response. Today, it feels like something much more fraught and inflected with trauma. “It hit a nerve with many people,” Al Tijani said. “Many were emotional at the launch – it was the first time the country came back to them, it was alive again, it was well again, it was full of joy. It inspired a visceral reaction.”Now, Sudanese food is simply no longer the thing that you enjoy in peace, even if you are not in the conflict zone. It is a reminder, an artefact, a relic, even a symbol. I was reminded of meeting a friend for dinner in Nairobi, a city that is now the home of many Sudanese refugees, and seeing a drink on the menu named after the iconic Sudanese female warriors of the past, the “kandakas”. “Once your culture becomes a cocktail,” my friend said, “you know your country is in trouble.”Food now, Al Tijani said, is “not just dinner” but something you are experiencing in a new way that is hard to process, outside home and context. This feeling is even heavier during Ramadan. Al Tijani described the aura around Ramadan in Sudan: how hyper-domestic it is, how swirlingly social. Sudanese food has little street or casual cafe-friendly features. Heavy in long-stewed meat dishes; hand-processed and cut leaves and spices; fermented, hand-spun savoury crepes and pancakes; it’s not a cuisine you are grabbing in the street. It’s something you go home for.View image in fullscreenThe aura of home … mullah tagalia is a dish of ground beef and ground okra in a rich tomato sauce.Photograph: Ala kheirEven before Ramadan starts, the streets are full of caramelised and dried ingredients for juices and stews. “The few days at the start of Ramadan are a culinary climax. People are way more open in Sudan during Ramadan,” Al Tijani said – houses open up, and invitations are extended. “The whole preparation takes weeks. Your house looks different, it feels different. Different people are in it because you can’t prepare for Ramadan on your own. So you’ll find women going from one house to another.”There’s a whole social formation and opening up of domestic spaces that makes the sense of loss of those spaces even more painful. is right – Ramadan used to feel like a wedding. On top of that, I think, there is the heightened taste of the food itself, consumed after a long fast, that forges a love and passion for its richness. Breaking the fast with a hot, salty, lemony broth of peanut paste, for example, is – no pun intended – a religious experience.Keeping Sudan on the mapView image in fullscreenMade with love … Omer Al Tijani making kunafa malfufa pastry on a hotplate.Photograph: Ala kheirWith food, though, Al Tijani said, there is an element of keeping something alive. We are all renegotiating our relationship with an identity that is still very much alive, and a country that is being destroyed. “Ever since the war, I have felt even more of a calling to make it a mission of mine,” he said of getting information about Sudan out to as many people as possible.“For me, this book is my form of resistance. The one way that I can put Sudan on the map to counter destructive narratives, to tell Sudan’s story. It’s the opposite of erasure; these are fixed things. We lived in these houses, we cooked these ingredients, we used these utensils – this is how we constructed our lives.”To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsRamadanThe Long WaveFoodBlack British cultureSudanAfricaIslamnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Lemon curd is the original and a classic, but you can make curd with almost any fruit, as long as you add a little lemon juice for acidity. Each version is intense, indulgent and dreamy. So, please approach with caution: this spread is deeply moreish, in the best possible way.Any Fruit CurdWhen testing this recipe, I had some leftover frozen mango that had been accidentally defrosted on the counter, a sad golden kiwi and some wrinkled grapes, so I split the recipe and made three small batches of different curds.Banana curdis also a treat.Fruit curds set smoothly thanks to the magic combination of protein, fat and acid, which lowers the temperature that the egg proteins coagulate and helps everything thicken smoothly without scrambling. Fruits such as citrus, passion fruit, pineapple and rhubarb are naturally acidic, so they set easily on their own. Less sour fruits such as pears, apples, mangoes and peaches need a little help in the form of lemon juice to reach the same glossy texture.Curd recipes vary in calling for whole eggs, yolks only or a combination of both. All methods work fine. I recommend using whole eggs, unless you have a use for the whites or leftover yolks ready to go.Makes450mlPrep10 minCook10 min150g prepared fruit(eg cubes of passion fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, rhubarb, orange, lime, berries, pear, apple, mango, peach, etc)Juice of ¼ lemon(and zest if using an organic unwaxed lemon)100g runny honey, maple syrup or granulated sugar3medium eggsor 6 egg yolks (if leftover from another recipe)1 tbsp cornflour(optional, if making a pie filling)75g butter(I use salted but unsalted will do), cubedPut the cubes of fruit into a small saucepan with up to 80ml water – adding more for firm fruits (pineapple, rhubarb, pear, say) and less for watery ones, such as oranges, passion fruit or berries. Cover with a lid, bring to a simmer and cook gently for about five minutes, until soft. Set aside to cool.Blend the cooked fruit to make a smooth puree, then return it to a clean saucepan. Stir in the lemon juice and zest (if using).In a large bowl, whisk the honey (or maple syrup or sugar) with the eggs and cornflour (if using ). Whisk this into the fruit, then place the pan on a low to medium heat and cook slowly, stirring constantly with a spatula, scraping the sides and base, for five to 10 minutes or until the curd thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon or reaches 75C (167F) on a thermometer.Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, until glossy and smooth. Pass through a sieve and transfer into a sterilised jar. Cool, then chill in the fridge for up to two weeks.Explore more on these topicsFruitWaste notFoodFood wastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

For me, citrus isn’t just acidity: it’s a complex alternative to sugar and vinegar, with varieties that offer bitterness, floral tones, sweetness and sharpness in equal measure. With more than a hundred types of lemons, clementines and limes now available, I find it easiest to think of them in two groups: sour citrus and sweet citrus. Once you know which you’re working with, you can explore each variety’s complexity and decide how best to use it.Pork chop with citrus butter (pictured top)A well-seasoned pork chop needs little embellishment, but a punchy citrus butter brings lift and freshness, and cuts through the richness of the meat. For the butter, I use sour lemons for acidity, and balance that with the juice of sweet clementines to round things out.Prep10 minCook40 minServes2For the citrus butter150groom-temperature butter20g parsley leaves, finely chopped20g chives, finely chopped1 tspflaky sea salt40ml lemon juice, or other sour citrus juice30ml clementine juice, or other sweet citrus juiceFor the porkSalt and pepper1 large pork chop, or 2 small ones – the best quality you can get your hands onNeutral oil, for searingFirst make the citrus butter. Put everything in a bowl, whisk smooth, then taste and adjust the seasoning. It should have gentle sweetness and salinity, with a sharp, citrus finish. Cover and chill, or, if cooking straight away, keep at room temperature.Now for the pork. Heat the oven to 70C (50C fan)/140F/gas low. Put a frying pan on a medium-high heat until it’s very hot. Meanwhile, lightly season the chop on both sides. Add a little oil to the hot pan, then sear the chop for a minute on each side.Transfer the pork to a rack set over a tray, then transfer to the oven for 10 minutes. Do not wash out the pan: you want the fat and the caramelised bits in there. After 10 minutes, return the pork to the hot pan for a quick second sear on both sides, then return it to the rack and the oven for another 10 minutes: you’re aiming for a core temperature of 60C.Once the chop reaches temperature, give it a final sear in the same pan on the stovetop to crisp up the crust and raise the core to 63C.Thinly slice the chop, arrange the meat on two plates and serve with all the citrus butter melting over the top.Citrus curd, amaretti and pearView image in fullscreenMax Coen’s citrus curd with amaretti and pear.A light, balanced dessert that’s built around sharp citrus curd, amaretti and fresh pear for a play on texture and acidity that keeps the sweetness in check.Prep15 minCook40 minChill30 min+Serves4-6For the amaretti70g egg whites200g caster sugar200g ground almondsFor the citrus curd100ml fresh lemon juice, plus about 35ml extra to taste40g caster sugar100g whole eggs160g unsalted butterUp to60ml fresh clementine juice, or other sweet citrus juice (optional and to taste)For the cardamom chantilly1 tbsp icing sugar½ tsp ground cardamom100ml double creamA pinch of salt, pink ideallyTo finish2 fresh pears, cored and thinly sliced at the last minuteFirst make the curd. Put the lemon juice, sugar and eggs in a bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water, and whisk until the mix comes up to 80C. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, ensuring the mixture is well combined, then add the butter and whisk hard for 20 seconds, until very smooth and emulsified. Transfer to a bowl and taste – adjust with the extra lemon to taste, and if need be balance the acidity with a little sweet clementine juice. Divide the curd mix between four small serving glasses (those tiny French glass tumblers or similar), then put in the fridge to chill and set for 30 minutes.Now for the biscuits. Whip the egg whites until fluffy, then gradually whisk in 50g of the caster sugar until it’s dissolved and the mix forms soft peaks. In a second bowl, combine the ground almonds with the remaining 150g caster sugar, then gently fold in the whipped egg white mix to make a sticky dough.Lightly dampen your hands with water, then portion the dough into 15g balls – you should get about 20 in all – and arrange these on a greased and lined oven tray, spacing them apart to allow for expansion while baking.Heat the oven to 185C (165C fan)/360F/gas 4½, then bake the biscuits for 12-15 minutes, until crisp at the edges but still with a chewy centre. Transfer to a rack and leave to cool completely.Meanwhile, mix the icing sugar and cardamom in a small bowl. Whisk the cream, then gradually beat in the icing sugar mix until the cream forms soft peaks – take care not to overwhip, so it stays smooth and light. Season lightly with salt.To assemble, top each glass of set curd with a spoonful of the cardamom chantilly, then top first with two crumbled amaretti biscuits and then with six thin slices of fresh pear. Serve at once, or chill until ready to serve.Max Coen is chef/co-owner ofDorian, London W11Explore more on these topicsFoodFruitPorkMain courseDessertBiscuitsBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"

For a marathon, you’ll probably need to be a regular runner who has completed several 10ks or the half distance.Most marathon training plans take about 16-20 weeks, so it is wise to book a race at least six months in advance to give yourself enough time.Book your placeWhile there is less pressure for places in some local races, many big marathons sell out in a few days – or operate a lottery system.This is particularly the case with London: it attracted a record 1.1m applications for this year’s event, with a less than 5% success rate. Those lucky in the ballot paid about £80 to enter if UK residents and £225 if international runners. The majority of runners secure their places by running for charities, which require a registration fee (typically £50-£150) plus a minimum fundraising target (usually about £2,500).View image in fullscreenGetting to the London marathon start line can be a  challenge in itself.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersAs an alternative, you can run the distance on the route of your choice via theLondon Marathon MyWay virtual event, which costs £30 for UK runners and £40 for international participants.Other big UK marathons have similar fees: Edinburgh costs £82 this year, Brighton about £80 and Manchester from £65.Kieran Alger, who has run 64 marathons, says: “Plenty of local UK races come in much cheaper. Those, like the Chester Marathon (£55), are brilliantly organised and often more chilled.”Other good-value races include theCambridge Boundary Runat £25 (£20 for Cambridge University students), theMalvern Midsummer Marathonat £26 (£18 for members of the Long Distance Walkers’ Association), and theBoston Marathonin Lincolnshire at £42.View image in fullscreenTraining in winter can mean buying extra kit to keep you warm.Photograph: Katja Kircher/Getty Images/MaskotThe time of year can affect the cost.Adharanand Finn, the author of the book Running with the Kenyans, says: “Choosing an autumn marathon over a spring one can cut costs. (Most marathons, in northern Europe at least, are in either the spring or autumn.) An autumn marathon means training through the summer, so you won’t need as much kit as you will training through the winter (for a spring marathon). In winter you’ll need a running jacket and maybe some leggings, at the very least. Probably some warm base layers and gloves, too.”Sort travel if neededConsider the cost of travel and accommodation if you are planning a race away from home. Flights, trains and hotel bills can easily add up, and it’s worth booking as early as possible to get the best prices.For example, the Travelodge hotels and the Premier Inn at Greenwich, near the London marathon start line have already sold out for the night before this year’s race in April, compared with rooms from £96 the weekend before. It’s perfectly possible to stay further away, but may mean leaving for the race earlier.Finn says: “Most marathons start early in the morning so staying nearby is essential. Choose a marathon as close as possible to where you live so you can stay at home, or, alternatively, in a city where you have friends or family who might put you up the night before the race. Hopefully they’ll get into the spirit of things and even cook you a hearty meal the night before you run.”Get the right gearThe accepted wisdom is “nothing new on race day”, so make sure whatever you wear is tried and tested in advance.Avoid running in shoes that are worn out (many last about 300 to 500 miles), but there’s no need to dash out and buy the latest “supershoes” when you start your training.“Probably the biggest way people get suckered into spending more than they need to is on running shoes,” Alger says. “It’s easy to get drawn into thinking everyone needs the latest £250 carbon plate race shoes to run a marathon. Or that the newest, most expensive shoes are always better. They don’t and they’re not. Lots of non-plated shoes have good marathon credentials and the really smart thing to do is hunt deals on those that are one generation old.”Sites such asSportShoes.comandStart Fitnessoften have deep discounts on a range of shoes, including last year’s offerings.Alger, who tests shoes for a range of sites, says: “For getting lots of training miles in, I really rate the newKiprun Kipride Max(£120).View image in fullscreenThe Adidas Evo SL shoes are great for training, particularly speed sessions, and are available for less than £100.Photograph: Adidas“But we’re also seeing lots of really good versatile ‘all-rounders’ that can cover loads of training miles and step up to race day. So if you really wanted to, you could just buy one. TheSaucony Endorphin Azura,Adidas Evo SLand theHoka Mach X3could all fit that bill.”Alternatively, scour eBay, or other auction sites, for items that may only have been worn a few times. “Vinted is a treasure trove of running gear,” Alger says. “There are some real bargains to be had.”He also advises asking friends if they have any spare gear: “Every runner I know also owns hundreds of technical race tees they never use and would probably happily donate. So if you need training tops, ask a runner.”Find a training planIf you want to get the most out of your marathon, use a plan to schedule your training. Finn says: “There are tons of free basic training plans available online. The simplest way to train is to slowly increase the distances you run week by week over about 12 weeks, increasing your total running distance by about 10% each week.”It’s also not vital to pay for an app to track your runs. The basic version of the popularfitness app Stravacosts nothing, while Nike Run Club and the Adidas Running app are also free.View image in fullscreenYou can use the Strava app to track your training runs – and its basic version is free.Photograph: picsmart/AlamyAlger says: “Training apps can be great for those with less experience who might benefit from being guided to the start line. Unlike a free off-the-shelf plan you might find on the web, some apps have the added bonus of being adaptive, so they evolve with you.“You can also get free adaptive marathon training plans on some Garmin and Coros watches.“And it’s not perfect, but with the right prompts, it’s also possible to get ChatGPT to be a pretty good free coach. And if you tell it what you ran in the past few days and how you felt, it can even offer updated advice that’s almost as good as a subscription app.”Get the fuelling rightTraining for long distances takes a lot of energy. Using gels, or other sources of carbohydrates, can help you avoid “hitting the wall”.Gels can cost from less than £1 to almost £3 each, and you may need eight to 12 for a four-hour marathon. Some runners swear by dried fruit such as dates, apricots or bananas; others mix their own carbohydrate gels or drink at home.View image in fullscreenEnergy gels can cost from less than £1 to almost £3 each.Photograph: Hi5Whatever you use, make sure you have tested it beforehand: tummy troubles can make any race a misery. The online storeXMilessells gels singly, or in small numbers, allowing you to test a range of products.Alger says: “You don’t need to be guzzling expensive electrolyte powders all the time. When you’ve run longer, harder or in hot conditions, topping up lost salts can help. But it’s not necessary after every single run. Ditto gels. You don’t need to eat a £2.50 energy gel on that 45-minute easy training run. Save the budget for runs at least over an hour.”Get to the starting lineThis can be the biggest problem for many runners. Too much – or not enough – training can put you in danger of picking up injuries. Act at the first signs of muscle pain or niggles: taking a few days off training or booking a sports massage can get you back on track.So it’s best to mix hard training sessions with more gentle runs and rest to give your body time to recover. Finn advises: “Don’t run every day – rest days are important for your body to adapt.”Make sure you include some strength and conditioning work in your training – this can be as simple as doing leg exercises at home if you aren’t a gym member.View image in fullscreenDoing strength exercises at home will build your core and legs, helping you avoid injuries.Photograph: BartekSzewczyk/Getty Images/iStockphotoAnd don’t try to make up for lost training by overdoing it in the final weeks before a race: it is unlikely to benefit you, and could leave you unable to make it to the start line.Finally, make sure you have all the logistics of getting to your race, and what you will wear, straight in your mind before race day.You may well feel nervous, but a last-minute scramble to find your race number, or having to dash for transport, is unlikely to leave you in the best state for the miles ahead.Explore more on these topicsRunningMoney hacksMarathon runningConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rolled-back federal funding has led longhaulers to ask: is this all in my head?Savannah BrooksWed 18 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 12.31 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIam 30ft below the surface of the Blue Grotto, a crystalline diving hole in central Florida. Between the water’s embrace and the restriction of my wetsuit, my blood pressure finally stabilizes. The long, deep breaths I pull from my respirator keep my heart rate nice and low.I feel lighter than I have since April 2022, when I first contracted long Covid. I feel childlike at the fact that I can do this at all – get scuba certified – when on land I’m often confined to a wheelchair or a walker.But when I tuck my fins away for the day, reality crashes back down. I’m a 34-year-old woman who was forced to move back in with her parents, had no choice but to retire from her dream career as a literary agent and a lecturer at the University of Minnesota, and had to cash out her retirement savings to cover the medical expenses that keep her in a chokehold.Long Covid has more than 200 potential symptoms. Selective gullibility is one of mineRead moreMy bodily existence is unpleasant. I wake up every day so nauseated that even the smell of food can make me vomit. I have to stretch for an hour before I can fully move my body. If I don’t sleep for 10–12 hours, my brain and muscles will be too depleted to manage anything beyond the rote tasks of keeping me alive. When I push myself to socialize, fatigue steamrolls my body with flu-like symptoms – but my suicidal ideation blooms like a mushroom cloud when I sequester myself away.Each month, I make the four-hour drive from Asheville, North Carolina, where I now live, to Chapel Hill, where I’m a patient in the rehabilitation clinic that was previously the university’s specified long Covid clinic. Federal research funding and coordination for the condition have been rolled back under the current Trump administration, complicating care for patients like me. After I check into my hotel, I nap for an additional four hours, working up the energy to sit down for a 10-minute shower. I can’t stand for that long, not in one place, not without fainting, seizing or becoming short-term paralyzed. Typically, it’ll be a combination of all three.The unbearably tricky thing about the condition is that it’s the culmination of a million moving parts. Even though most Covid longhaulers will only ever exhibit a handful,there are more than 200 possible symptoms, and treating one often means off-balancing another. Once one internal system starts to dysregulate, the rest tend to fall out in suit. This domino effect is predictable, but that doesn’t make it easy to treat, prevent or even diagnose.How many people are living a compromised life, but they don’t recognize why?Dr Michael OsterholmWhen I speak with Dr Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s center for infectious disease research and policy and appointee to Biden’s 2020 transition Covid-19 advisory board, I ask how he’s seen the landscape of long Covid change over the past few years. Thoughrates of infection are decreasing, primarily due tothe effectiveness of getting vaccinated, he highlights the difficulty in collecting research on a disease that’s so societally charged, one people have been incentivized to distrust.“How much of [long Covid] has actually disappeared due to recovery?” Osterholm asks. “How much of it has disappeared because people just stopped talking about it, tried to move on with their lives? And then how many don’t even recognize what they have? How many people are living a compromised life, but they don’t recognize why?”This, Osterholm says, is one of the biggest challenges of long Covid: keeping people informed, especially during a time of rampant fearmongering, misinformation and politicization of the human body.“In some ways, [the difficulty in diagnosing long Covid is] also about the concept of mental health,” he continues. “Because long-term chronic compromise leaves one to begin to wonder: how much of this is in my head?”‘We’re losing decades of our life to this illness’: long Covid patients on the fear of being forgottenRead moreAnd when resources are stripped back from studying a disease, instead of layered on, it reinforces the idea that the disease is mild enough to be ignored, making it even more likely that people will doubt what their body is telling them.Where Osterholm observes the state of long Covid from a bird’s eye view, Dr Lisa Sanders, medical director of Yale’s long Covid multidisciplinary care center, spends her time one-on-one with patients.The good news, she says, is that even if individuals are still struggling to recognize their long Covid symptoms, the medical field isn’t.These days, it doesn’t typically take long before doctors and their patients are able to start the trial-and-error process of treating symptoms. It’s hard work, often requiring multiple specialists, because long Covid often affects multiple bodily systems. It’s potentially years-long work, which is why it’s so important to start as early as possible. Because for some patients, long Covid doesn’t resolve – it hardens.Partner with your body and ... integrate some level of activity into your daily life so that your heart and your lungs do not deteriorateDr Lisa Sanders“There is a serious degree of deconditioning that comes with long Covid,” Sanders says. For some patients, “Covid comes in, whacks you, and you’re left with ME/CFS,” adebilitating variationof chronic fatigue syndrome. Other patientsare leftwith postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a condition in which your heart rate accelerates when you stand, often leading to a loss of consciousness. Othersdeveloporthostatic hypotension, in which your resting blood pressure falls frighteningly low. Some, like me, are left with a mix of all of the above.“So a lot of times, the patients I see are reasonably deconditioned because they have learned that when they exert themselves, they feel bad,” Sanders says.Unfortunately, being less active further increases a person’s limitations, which can in turn exacerbate symptoms, trapping them in a cycle of physical decline.So what do long Covid patients do?“My advice to them is to partner with your body and figure out how you can integrate some level of activity into your daily life so that your heart and your lungs do not deteriorate,” Sanders says. She emphasizes thatsomelevel is often a verylowlevel, otherwise patients risk pushing into post-exertional malaise, an extreme exacerbation of fatigue symptoms that can last for up to a week.This advice resonates strongly with my own case. When I first contracted long Covid, I was immediately accepted into the University of Minnesota’s long Covid clinic. For nine months, I was driven to the hospital three times a week to do low-level activity in the form of cardiac physical therapy. As much as my body will allow, I’ve stuck to that regimen every single day for the past four years. Six months before my trip to Florida, I added in buoyancy-assisted swimming. It doesn’t look like much – maybe two laps in a pool using a kickboard twice a week – but, as it turns out, diving doesn’t have to take much.‘We think of the body as a map’: a new approach to deciphering long CovidRead moreAs I speak with Osterholm and Sanders, I consider how much worse my case would be without the medical intervention I received early on. I consider how lucky I am that doctors saw my symptoms for what they were and started working with me right away, unlike so many others struggling with the same array of symptoms.As Osterholm put it, when thinking about managing a disease like long Covid, “it’s very, very important to look at your community in terms of what you can accomplish together.”Getting scuba certified was an achievement I could only accomplish with my medical and dive teams. Honestly, the only way I’m able to make it through each day is because I am surrounded by others – but isn’t that the way it should be? There is a way to live with long Covid – there is a way to dive with it – but no one gets there alone.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyLong CovidCoronavirusHealthInfectious diseasesMedical researchMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And that those of us privileged enough to have a downstairs loo that visitors see, routinely leave the posh soap there while the resident family rely on a bumper dispenser of Carex? Surely no one is above such behaviour.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.An illicit bargain refill last autumn inspired a hunt for stylish-looking and luxury-feeling hand soaps that, while not weekly-shop cheap, feel at least like a justifiable luxury. I’ve rarely enjoyed my research more.Let’s get the most expensive one out of the way, because it cannot be ignored: Beauty Pie’sLemon Butter & Hemp Seed Hand Washis £12.50 to members for a whopping half-litre of a glorious, creamy wash that leaves hands soft and fragrant. It is a rare combination of fresh (the lemony scent is a joy) and comforting (that’s the glycerin) and a little goes a long way – although the bottle is so large that one can be guiltlessly lavish. Try it and you’ll see that it’s comparable with washes at more than three times the price.M&S’s Calm variety combines the scent of oily orange peel and mellow woods to provide a gratifying spa moment at the basinI love M&S’s Apothecary range for candles and personal fragrance, but I’d never before tried the hand washes. They look and smell as lovely as their stablemates – all brown glass medicine bottles, clean fonts, botanical fragrances and plant oils.TheCalmvariety combines the scent of oily orange peel and mellow woods to provide a gratifying spa moment at the basin. It’s £6 for 250ml, but can be refilled from a520ml pouch costing £9.50, making it more cost-effective.Zara Home has added smart design to generic plastic bottles to make a stylish and affordable bit of bathroom decor. And what’s inside is pretty good, too.Light Cotton Hand & Body Wash(£5.99 for 250ml) is a gentle, slightly orangey, woody, clean musk fragrance suspended in a wash that suds up well without stripping moisture from the hands.For £11.99, there’s a whopping 750ml of the same formula inPoetic Mind, with a zesty lemon and comforting magnolia scent, which smells and looks like something way more pricey.If your soap is bought exclusively at the supermarket, I enthusiastically recommend Baylis & Harding’sGoodness Oud, Cedar & Amber Natural Hand Wash(£4). It can be refilled from thematching pouch, which is just £6.50 for a full litre and should last a good couple of months.Explore more on these topicsBeautySali Hughes on beautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ialways think that the most stylish woman in a room is the one who looks the most comfortable. She might be nonchalant in a pair of wide trousers and a loose white shirt, or stroll in casually wearing the butter-soft leather loafers she’s had for years. It was a longing to be more like one of those women, as opposed to one who fell over regularly in public because I couldn’t balance in platforms, which made me give up wearing heels for good in 2012. So it was a natural progression, a decade later, to shunning another wardrobe constraint that was making me fidget in social situations: the waistband.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’m about to turn 49 and in the past eight years I’ve been fluctuating between sizes 10 and 14, which is hardly surprising when you consider thatthe average British woman may change dress size a whopping 31 timesin her adult life. I attribute my own yo-yo-ing partly to the hormonal changes that a body in its 40s inevitably goes through, but I should also acknowledge that during lockdown, I developed a taste for the elasticated tracksuit bottoms that working from home allowed, as well as a macaroni cheese, or two, each week.By the time I needed to go back to the office, none of my favourite trousers fit properly any more. I hated that these clothes I once loved were making me feel bad about myself, but my longing for comfort meant I would spend all day regretting it if I tried to squeeze into them. So I bit the bullet and – after a dalliance with the prairie dresses of the greatcottagecore movementof 2021 – sold them, investing in a few pairs that fit not only my new, fuller self, but other future selves that might decide to present themselves.View image in fullscreen‘While adjustable trousers are undoubtedly comfy, it’s often down to more than just added stretch at the waist.’Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianMy gateway to adjustability was a tad more chic than the bog-standard elastic waists of the lockdown years: a pair of balloon leg trousers with an elasticated waist in linen gingham rather than grey jersey. But there are plenty of options out there. I lovethis unisex style from Wawwa; with their balloon legs and generous drawstring, they deliver comfort with the added bonus that they are sustainably made-to-order in Manchester.For even more flexibility, it’s possible – but a little harder – to find trousers with buckles and straps or wrap designs that are even more adjustable. I found a pair with a crossover design from a local maker and they’ve seen me through three dress sizes over the past four years.Les Animaux’s Fisherman pants, which are made in Margate, are only available in one size, but thanks to the option to tie them multiple ways, they fit pretty much anyone, including pregnant women; some couples have even gone halves on a pair to share.They come in three lengths and the brand offers lifetime repairs. Founder Lisa Jackson thinks all brands should be thinking about taking a similar route, because “having this trouser in one size is very economical for us”.Initially, adjustable waists were championed by smaller independent designers, but now the high street has begun to follow suit,with 2025’s insatiable appetite for baggy trousers helping to facilitate the movement. Toast currently has a range of smart elastic waist barrel leg trousers in linen, cord and even quilted, which would be great for work, and Cos is among many brands that have introduced tailored wide-leg trousers with a discreet part-elasticated waistband that is only visible from the back. Uniqlo has taken the same covert approach to jeans and even Levi’s, whose original jeans featured an adjustable cinch in the 1870s, has recently reintroduced the style. Another way to adjust is with cinching buckles or drawstrings on the side of the trousers, a popular menswear design feature that is making a comeback at modern tailoring brands includingBatch LDN,Acre & RowandWith Nothing Underneath.While adjustable trousers are undoubtedly comfy, it’s often down to more than just added stretch at the waist. Sometimes, it is also about their ability to sit at different points on the body on different people, rather than, as with a standard pair of trousers, being designed to sit at the same point across multiple different body shapes. Many trousers in the 26-year-old influencer Molly-Mae Hague’s fashion line Maebe, for instance, come with a concealed adjustable waistband designed to allow the wearer to choose just how high or low they sit on the body. Sadly, the majority are also made from virgin polyester.Naomi Pike, commissioning editor at Elle UK, is an advocate for body diversity in the fashion industry. She thinks adaptive waistbands could be a good solution, and not just for our fluctuating bodies. “They acknowledge that not all figures are the same shape,” she says. “You might have a smaller waist measurement than most people your clothing size, so this would accommodate diverse body types. Fashion often forgets that there are different shapes as brands choose to focus their inclusivity efforts on size, as opposed to shape. This feels like a step in that direction of acknowledgment.”View image in fullscreenOversized clothes read so much more modern than their tighter fitting cousins … Billie Eilish at the Grammys in her Hodakova ensemble.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/ReutersIn 2026, oversized clothes read so much more current and chic than their tighter-fitting cousins – for evidence, see the singer Billie Eilish’s oversized Grammys ensemble, which was made from an upcycled pair of wool trousers by the Stockholm-based brand Hodakova, compared withLauren Sánchez’s fitted, outdated-looking suits at Paris haute couture week last month. But while adjustable trousers lend themselves to this oversized moment, because the majority of styles feature a wide, loose leg, the joy of adjustable waists is that you don’t necessarily need to choose between two silhouettes. Get the baggy look and/or nip in at the waist, depending on how you feel that day. Or even that time of day.For me, at 5ft 3in, simply nipping in the oversized clothingdu jourwith a belt isn’t a solution, since I am generally swamped by all of the excess material. I’m much happier with a tighter top half and looser leg, and a more structured option than a drawstring to cinch in or let out the waist area as I see fit.If all of this seems very modern – I’m admittedly writing about adjustable waists as if they’re some kind of sartorial epiphany – they’re not. Flexibility was being embraced hundreds of years ago. “This is a radical move in recent fashion, but not in fashion history,” says the fashion historian Serena Dyer. “Historically, women’s waistbands were fundamentally flexible. In the 18th century, petticoats included adjustable ties, allowing for adjustment around weight gain and pregnancy. We often assume fashions of the past were uncomfortable and rigid, but it’s the fixed sizes of mass production that have created the uncomfortable and inflexible waistband.”Our comfortable waists actually have a lot to thank sport for, because drawstring waists didn’t really come into their own until the invention of the tracksuit in the 1930s.View image in fullscreen‘By choosing designs with flexible waistband sizes, I save money, am more sustainable and generally feel much better about myself.’Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianIf this level of adaptive clothing was more widely available, it would perhaps also help to tackle the industry’s returns problem. The practice of “bracketing” (buying multiple sizes with the intention of returning most of them) has heavy costs: financially for brands, and environmentally if the returned items are never resold and sent to landfill. Retailers including Zara, H&M andAsosnow charge for returns. “Many of us are between sizes so need to purchase multiple sizes to figure out which is right,” says Pike. “I once ordered a dress in four different sizes as I was unsure how it would fit, but also how Iwantedit to fit. I’m not sure [adaptive sizing is] a perfect solution but it’s certainly much better than smaller, binary sizing.”My new trouser collection has made me realise that by choosing designs with flexible waistband sizes, I not only save money in the long run and am therefore being more sustainable, but I feel much better about myself. The size of my middle can vary wildly on any given day, time of the month or season. I no longer need to feel as if I’m losing my mojo when this happens. I don’t want to micromanage my body, but this way, I can regain control of my style.Furthermore, as Dyer points out, clothes that morph can help us feel better prepared in a volatile world. “When the world feels unpredictable, we gravitate toward clothing that offers longevity and personal agency,” she says, noting that “adaptability and adjustability suddenly became essential in a post-pandemic world”. In this landscape, “an adjustable waistband is, in many ways, a micro-strategy for survival in a macro-world that demands constant flexibility”.It might sound highfalutin, but as a middle-aged freelancer who could be writing on the sofa one day and heading into town for an important meeting the next, I now have a wardrobe that caters for whatever life – or my waistline – might throw at me.Explore more on these topicsFashionWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Angling his lean frame into the wind, he digs his plastic snow-shoes into a steep drift and pauses, scanning the white ridgeline. He’s looking formariolas– small cairns of rocks, fused by ice, that will indicate our onward trail. “The landscape changes every day so you have to learn how to read it afresh,” he says, setting off again. “At this time of year, nature is a true artist.”Manteigas locator mapI plod inelegantly in his wake, still clumsy in the frames clipped to my boots to keep me from sinking into the powder. At a quartzite outcrop rippled with rose and amber, we pause and drink in the view. Below us, cupped in the glacial scar of the Zêzere valley, is the terracotta-roofed town of Manteigas – founded in the 12th century and today the modest hub for tourism in the region. Ahead, on the horizon, João Pedro points out mainland Portugal’s highest peak, the 1,993-metre Torre, home to a small ski resort suited to beginners. “This region is full of surprises,” he grins.As head of activities for Casa das Penhas Douradas, a design-led hotel created in 2006 and inspired by Alpine lodges, João Pedro leads treks through the massif in all seasons. More than 100 miles of trails extend from the property, following old shepherd paths into pine forests, around lagoons and across barren passes stacked with huge granite boulders – the remnants of the last ice age, scattered like a giant’s abandoned toys. This is wild country – recognised in 2020 by Unesco as aglobal geoparkfor its remarkable biodiversity and geology – but the human story is equally rich.View image in fullscreenGuide João Pedro Sousa on one of the trails that follow old shepherd paths.Photograph: Amelia DugganThe hotel is a renovated 100-year-old sanatorium, its 17 birch-panelled rooms and suites gazing eastwards to the rising sun. All have vast sliding windows and doors to let in the curative mountain air during the milder months. Down the main corridor, leading from one log fire-warmed sitting room to another, a gallery of sepia photographs remembers the pioneering 1881 expedition by the Lisbon Geographic Society to this high plateau, looking for a place to treat the scourge of tuberculosis.This is wild country – recognised in 2020 by Unesco as a global geopark for its remarkable biodiversity and geology“The refined air, pure water and protein-rich diet here worked wonders for patients. For a period at the start of the 20th century, this was Portugal’s answer to the Swiss health resorts of St Moritz or Davos,” João Pedro tells me when we are back at the lodge, warming up with apple cake andcarquejamountain tea. The chalets peppering the surrounding slopes certainly look as if they have been plucked from northern Europe, with steep roofs, sunrooms and occasional fairytale flourishes, like finials or turrets. “Built from stone, not timber, though,” João Pedro clarifies. “The style is mixed with our Lusitanian mountain architecture.”For the rest of my stay, the Serra is a violently shaken snow globe, the whiteout preventing safe hiking and forcing a thorough exploration of the hotel instead. I shuffle between the indoor sauna and bath-temperature swimming pool; seek out the resident masseuse for a thoroughly undeserved sports massage; and indulge in a series of three-course meals where I sample the region’s famous Iberian pork – always tender and expertly sauced. Afternoons are seen out with a glass of port and a well-thumbed tome on mountaineering from the library, a lived-in space charmingly decorated with antique skiing paraphernalia. The pièce de résistance of the property? The Nordic-style wooden hot tub, which I book for a late-night soak after the storm subsides, the stars winking down at me through spindrift and steam.View image in fullscreenA lounge with a view in Casa das Penhas Douradas.Photograph: Luis PinheiroAs well as injecting some panache into the local tourism scene, I discover the founders of the hotel have been pivotal in saving a dying mountain craft: burel fabric, a thick, water-resistant weave made from bordaleira sheep’s wool and used for shepherds’ capes since the middle ages. “I fell in love with the local material when creating the upholstery for the hotel – it’s amazingly tough and versatile,” owner Isabel Costa tells me, as we tour her warehouse of whirring antique looms on the outskirts of Manteigas. “Nine textile mills had already gone out of business when this one closed – I knew we had to buy it.”As well as injecting some panache into the local tourism scene, I discover the founders of the hotel have been pivotal in saving a dying mountain craft: burel fabricIn 2010, the mill reopened as theBurel Factory, with a fresh directive: vibrant colours, modern designs and new applications as tactile wall art and furniture coverings, as well as fashion. Isabel was able to rehire experienced artisans, who in turn trained a new generation of craftspeople. I meet some of them in the Room of Light, where workers stand before great windows reeling bolts of cloth to check for skipped stitches. “Generations of Manteigas women have worked in this business,” seamstress Marta Neves tells me. “It’s delicate work, and with the quantity of bespoke commissions now coming in, every day is different.”View image in fullscreenThe hotel is decorated with antique skiing paraphernalia.Photograph: José VicenteOwing to the success of her initial projects, Isabel was able to expand further, opening the town’s first five-star hotel in 2018,Casa de São Lourenço, with a third property currently in the works. The fabric of local life has been rewoven in the process: with expanding job opportunities, young people are choosing to stay and build lives. The local school has even reopened. Today, burel shops sit on Lisbon and Porto’s most upmarket thoroughfares, popularising a native art form – and a destination – long overlooked. “It was my husband who first fell in love with Manteigas. The nature, the people – it’s like nowhere else in Portugal,” Isabel says.I stay on in the small town itself, checking intoCasa das Obras, a time-warp mansion that has been in the noble Ribeiro de Portugal family since its construction between 1770 and 1825, serving as a guesthouse for the past two decades. Here, history is palpable. Stern-looking ancestors of the current owner, Maria Amélia, look down from oil paintings lining the monumental stone staircase. Lower chambers include a tapestried billiards room and bar, while the upstairs breakfast room – a living museum of antiques, trinkets and heavy drapes – boasts original ceiling art. The bedrooms are underwhelming in comparison, but there’s a pretty garden blooming with camellias, and the location is unbeatably central.View image in fullscreenManteigas.Photograph: Tolo Balaguer/AlamyNot that there’s too much of Manteigas to explore. One twisting lane of commerce offers up a souvenir shop stacked with knitted socks and wool slippers; a bakery famous for creating the town’s signature sweet treat, the syrupypastel de feijoca; and a couple of delis selling wheels of creamy Serra de Estrela sheep’s cheese. The great treasure of the town is its looks, its cobbled streets and snow-dusted churches framed in all directions by dramatic valleys and forested peaks, all seemingly ripped from a storybook.Come summer, the community will be humming with hikers and adrenaline junkies – biking, paragliding, climbing and ATV buggy rides can all be organised here, with information at the little tourist office. But for now, during its coldest months, Manteigas insists on visitors slowing down – filling their lungs with crisp air, lining their stomachs with hearty cuisine and exploring scenic mountain trails when Mother Nature allows.The trip was supported byCasa das Penhas Douradas, where rooms startat€189B&B, including guided hikes and a tour of the Burel Factory.

But with a shrinking number of positions come ever more hoops to jump through, from personality tests, to trial shifts, to towers constructed of marshmallowsSumaiya MotaraWed 18 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIt is 10.30am, and Zahra is sitting in a business centre in Preston, attaching marshmallows to sticks of uncooked spaghetti. There are 30 interview candidates in the grey-carpeted room, split into groups of five, competing to build food towers. Already today they have had to solve anagrams, complete quizzes and rank the importance of various kitchen items. Just to be shortlisted for this two-hour interview round, Zahra had to write an online application consisting of 10 paragraphs about her work experience. As she builds her spaghetti and marshmallow tower, she thinks: “What am I actually doing here? This doesn’t relate to the job at all.”The job in question is not what Zahra, 20, plans to do for ever. It is as a crew member for Wingstop, a chicken shop chain, with a salary of £10.80 an hour – 80p an hour above minimum wage for her age range. During the interview, she says, “a woman with a notepad was staring at us, and all the shift managers were watching. It was so awkward.” A week or so later, Zahra received a short rejection email. “It felt like a waste of time,” she says. “What a joke.”View image in fullscreenCandidates for a role in a fast-food chain were asked to build a marshmallow tower with spaghetti.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThis is far from Zahra’s first experience of long, tedious recruitment processes for jobs paying around the minimum wage. According to figures announced this week, UK unemployment reached itshighest rate in almost five yearsat 5.2%. For those aged 18-24, the rate has risen to 14% – another five-year high, and the market for entry-level opportunities has become increasingly competitive. Experts say hiring staff has also become more costly and risky for British businesses. “There’s been an increase in the minimum wage and the employer’s national insurance, against a backdrop of really challenging trading environments,” says Martin Warnes, managing director of the job websiteReed.co.uk. He believes this is leading businesses to “de-risk the recruitment process” by “putting more emphasis on pre-employment screening to help evidence that they’re bringing the right person into the business. The flipside of that is that more burden is put on the individual who’s seeking work, and what feels like a mismatch in terms of the effort of the application process v the pay rate.”Eve, 19, from London, is on a gap year after finishing her A-levels. As well as speculatively handing out her CV to 30 employers near where she lives (“I didn’t hear back from any of them”), she says she has applied for 40 jobs online. One of these, a shop-floor sales assistant role, was with Inditex, the parent company of high-street brands including Zara, Pull&Bear and Bershka. Shewas invited for a 90-minute group interview with about 20 other candidates. “We had a career day in school, and we did activities like group interviews,” she says. “So I thought it would be fine.” She did not anticipate that the interview would be more like an exercise in public speaking. “It was nerve-racking,” she says. “I was really desperate for the job … I’ve worked in shops before, and I can very easily speak to customers. But this was about talking in front of a big group of people. Speaking to one customer is different from speaking in front of 20 people.”View image in fullscreenA candidate for a sales assistant role was told to create an outfit for a celebrity such as Lady Gaga.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage for Live NationThe interview began with Eve having to introduce the person next to her to the other candidates and recruiters. She was then placed in a smaller group, handed an iPad and told to create an outfit for a celebrity such as Lady Gaga, before talking about it to the whole room. “It was a bit weird because, realistically, this wouldn’t have anything to do with the job,” she says. After that, the candidates were given scenarios that might happen in a shop, and had to describe how they would deal with them, in front of everyone. Finally, the recruiters put up pictures of different items of clothing, and candidates raised their hands to guess which Inditex brand they were from. “You’re having to find a way to get a word in over other people who obviously want a job as well, which makes it harder to get hired,” Eve says. “It’s like The Hunger Games, but you’re all trying to get a job in a shop where you’re going to be folding clothes all day, for just over minimum wage.”Group assessments, explains Warnes, have been a fixture of hiring for a long time. “I was part of a group assessment a number of years ago,” he says. “You would probably expect to see them more around graduate trainee scheme-type roles. Here, it seems to be a frontline customer role that’s having the assessment.” He says the company is probably looking to assess candidates’ “ability to work as a team and their communication skills, which might be really important to the role. However, to the individual who has been part of that, it might have felt onerous, particularly if they didn’t get the job; it was probably half a day of their time that they’ve committed without success. That might be being repeated over multiple jobs. And that is a really difficult situation for jobseekers.”View image in fullscreen‘I never even got rejected. I just got ghosted,’ says a candidate for a job in TK Maxx.Photograph: Peter Scholey/AlamyAlice Martin, head of research at the Work Foundation, a thinktank based at Lancaster University, believes that some employers are making recruitment processes harder because “they’re taking advantage to some extent of the fact that there are that many people out there who need the job. We have a high number of people looking for work and a shrinking number of jobs available. So to some extent, that puts power into the hands of employers to be quite selective about who they take on.” And big group interviews are more efficient. “It’s the best time spent for them to see that many people in one go.”But what if the group interview tasks have no bearing on the job itself? Warnes says: “I think if you’re looking to test someone’s skills and their fit for your organisation, then you want to create an environment that will be close to a real-life scenario. If we’re asking people to do presentations to groups, if that’s not part of the role, then you’re testing the wrong skill.”Big group interview presentations are not the only hoops jobseekers are having to jump through. Maya, 22, graduated with a degree in neuroscience in 2024, and started applying for part-time jobs to tide her over while she searched for a full-time role. When she applied for a job in a tuition centre, she was asked to work a four-hour trial shift, unpaid. The company had also said it would pay for the enhanced DBS check she needed to work with children, which costs £49.50, but she was never compensated for it. She later found a job in an art club, which not only paid for her two-hour trial shift but also covered the cost of her DBS check.View image in fullscreenThe ‘marshmallow tower’ team-building activity.Photograph: graphixchon/Getty Images/iStockphotoIn late 2024, she found an advert for a minimum-wage marketing job and immediately sent in her CV. The company invited her for a 20-minute online interview, which went well, and then asked her to go to its offices for the next stage. “They didn’t specify what the interview entailed, but I was desperate for a chance,” Maya says. So she paid the £30 train fare into London. “It turned out we would be practising door-to-door sales,” she says. “The manager took another candidate and me to multiple areas in London. We had to pay our own tube fare, and then watch while he tried to persuade people to sign up for a charity scheme. No one signed up.” After four hours, she and the other candidate were taken to a “random food shop to do a writing task on what skills we think are important for door-to-door sales”. Then the company passed Maya on to another in-person interview stage. She pulled out of the process – realising that the “marketing specialist” role wasn’t what it was advertised to be. “The pay was £8 an hour,” she says. “That isn’t minimum wage for a 21-year-old, but they were getting away with it because of the commission rate.” She believes the process was “taking advantage of people”.When Zahra applied for a sales assistant role at TK Maxx in August 2025, she had to do a personality test and was then invited into the shop. It was supposed to be a group interview, but only two other people showed up, along with four senior staff members. They were asked to do an “interview task”, which involved going on to the shop floor, choosing a section and organising it. “It wasn’t even an interview,” she says. “We were basically by ourselves, on different sections of the shop, making their merchandising look nice.” After 20 minutes, the manager brought out another rack and told Zahra to do the same again for another 10 minutes. Then, after an hour, the process was over. “I never even got rejected. I just got ghosted.” She hasn’t set foot in that TK Maxx since.View image in fullscreenOne ‘interview task’ consisted of organising a section of the shop floor.Photograph: nattrass/Getty ImagesWhen Grace, 20, applied for a minimum-wage job as an admin assistant at a nonprofit organisation, she did not expect that the recruitment process would amount to 10 hours of what she considers to have been unpaid work. The first stage was an admin task – building a database – followed by the second stage, a virtual interview a week later. Grace was then invited to the organisation’s office in London to complete the third stage, which was two hours of assessments and interviews. One of these tasks was to rebuild an Excel database that would be used by the organisation’s staff, as its old one was out of date. “Even if I didn’t get the job, I think they’d be building on my work,” she says. “I count that as a trial shift because it felt like I was making a spreadsheet and then passing it on to them to use. It felt weird.”UnderUK law, candidates aren’t entitled to the national minimum wage if the tasks only last a few hours and are deemed proportionate to the role. “There’s a grey area here around assessing a potential candidate v actually that candidate doing work,” says Warnes. “Bringing someone in and assessing their skills and cultural fit is really important,” he says, and this may include role play exercises with other team members. However, “the law is quite clear that if someone is doing real work, they should be paid”.Grace did get the job. But she was surprised that – given the interview process was “so strenuous” – the job itself, which she worked in for around a year, was “very easy”.Martin says that, again, this is common at an insecure, often low-paid end of the job market where “workers tend to cycle in and out of jobs”. Often, either the job itself is made redundant, or it’s so low-income that people attempt to move on to something higher-paying. “There often isn’t a lot of time spent by the employer in training up those employees or providing progression routes for them because it’s seen as quite a transient type of work,” she says. And so potential employers use the “recruitment process itself to try to provide some of that initial training”.View image in fullscreenA spokesperson from Zara said its recruitment process is ‘open, inclusive and accessible to people without prior retail experience’.Photograph: Alexey Panferov/AlamyAfter the companies were contacted by the Guardian, a spokesperson for TK Maxx said that “store‑based work is not part of our interview process”, and that, after reviewing Eve’s experience, “the practices outlined would not reflect our norms, values or recruitment approach”. A spokesperson from Zara said that its recruitment process is “open, inclusive and accessible to people without prior retail experience”. It said the group interview “uses informal activities to understand communication and teamwork skills, which are core to the role”. Wingstop said that “assessment centres are common practice in hospitality and are used in place of traditional interviews with the aim of bringing out people’s personalities” and to ensure “candidates display teamwork [and] creativity and are service-minded”. All tasks, it said, “are relevant to Wingstop UK’s values”.In September, after an online interview and paid “training” (which was sorting out the stock room), Zahra got a job as a server in a cafe. She never had a contract for this minimum-wage role and often worked long shifts by herself without a break, as her employers weren’t willing to hire more staff. She quit after five months and secured another part-time job at a supermarket after a 20-minute interview. “It’s above minimum wage, but it’s not my passion,” she says. “I just needed a part-time job to make some money. And everyone else is being stingy about hiring people. So I’ll take anything.” Her plan is to work there for three months before she goes travelling, after which she plans to return to studying. “I just hope the job market gets better by the time I’ve graduated,” she says.Names and identifying details have been changedExplore more on these topicsJob huntingWork & careersYoung peopleYouth unemploymentUnemploymentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

By the end of the month, outages were lasting up to 24 hours, with eastern Cuba worst affected.The government argues that renewable energy projects will ease Cuba’s power shortages and help the countryadapt to the impacts of the climate crisis.Cuba is among the countries most vulnerable to extreme weather events,according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC). While hurricanes have long been a feature of Caribbean life, the IPCC’s studies suggest thestorms are becoming more frequentand intense, along withsevere floodingand unusuallow temperatures.Reinaldo Funes, a professor of environmental history at the University of Havana, says the effects of the climate crisis are aggravated by centuries of environmental degradation dating back to the colonial period.The sugar industry caused severe soil erosion, reducing the land’s resilience to floods and droughts – a vulnerability documented in the early 20th century. “Almost 90% of the country’s original forest cover was cleared, first to supply the Spanish naval industry and later to expand sugarcane production,” he says.In early February, the government announcedemergency measuresin response to a crisis likened to the 1990s “special period” after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Óscar Pérez-Oliva Fraga, the deputy prime minister, said the government’s priority would be to press ahead with theconstruction of solar parks, largely with Chinese support.View image in fullscreenLuaces solar park, in Camagüey province, where 1,638 solar panels were installed with the help of Chinese investment.Photograph: Luis BustamanteCuba’s engagement with renewable energy is not new.The country began installingsolar panels in rural health centres in the late 1980s and opened its first windfarm in 1999. Since 2006, renewables have been part of Cuba’s national “energy revolution”, aimed at improving efficiency and reducing dependence on imported fuel.The energy transition would require investments of $8bn-$10bn … Cuba does not have that kind of moneyRicardo Torres, economistWith increasing numbers of blackoutsdue to breakdowns in old power plants and falling oil imports, the government published itsNational Energy Transition Strategyin September 2024. This aims to transform Cuba’s energy mix by increasing its own oil output (it produces up to 30,000 barrels a day of low-quality heavy crude)and its renewables, with the long-term goal of generating electricity entirely from national resources.China has emerged as a key partner in thisgreen transition. In December 2024, Havana and Beijing signed an agreement to build seven solar parks with acombined capacity of 35MW.The Cuban government has also set a target ofinstalling 92 solar parkswith a total capacity of 2GW by 2028, with Chinese investment playing a central role. By October 2025, the island had35 completed solar parks, with a maximum generating capacity of 750MW and estimated savings of 111,620 tonnes of fossil fuels, according to government data.View image in fullscreenSolar panels wait to be installed at a photovoltaic park in Cienfuegos. The 44,000 panels are part of Cuba’s solution to cut its reliance on oil.Photograph: Yamil Lage/AFP/GettyThe country already hasfour experimental windfarmswith a combined capacity of 11.8MW. Its largest wind project in Herradura is expected toproduce 33MW from 22 turbines, again built with Chinese backing.Cuba’s peak energy demand during the day is about 3,200MW, according to Cuba’sstate electricity utility, of which renewables, mainly solar, nowsupply roughly 9%.Installed renewable generation capacity increasedby 350% during 2025.One of the newest solar parks, completed in May 2025 near Vertientes in Camagüey province, produces 21.8MW of electricity, fed directly into the national grid. Raúl, a technical engineer at the Luaces solar park, says the challenge is the lack of battery-storage capacity.“Building a completely new energy system takes time,” he says, adding that renewables will significantly ease the country’s energy shortages. “With renewable energy, the wars over oil will one day come to an end.”View image in fullscreenLuaces solar park in Vertientes, Camagüey province, which produces 21.8MW of electricity that feeds directly into the national grid.Photograph: Luis BustamanteYet experts warn that Cuba’s prolonged economic crisis leaves it without the resources needed to transform its energy system at the required scale.“The energy transition outlined by the government would require investments of around $8bn to $10bn over the next decade,” says Ricardo Torres, an energy economist at the American University in Washington. “Cuba simply does not have that kind of money, andChinawill not pay for everything.”Cuba’s transmission system looks like Italian spaghetti. About 16% of the electricity generated is lost along the wayJorge PiñonTorres argues that geopolitical considerations are driving Beijing’s support. “China does not want Cuba to collapse,” he says. “They are looking for a solution, and energy is the foundation of any country.”China is now overproducing solar panels, giving it the capacity to donate equipment to Cuba. In other cases,panels have reportedly been exchanged for nickel– some of the world’s largest reserves of the mineral can be found on the island.View image in fullscreenNew electricity pylons in rural Herradura, Cuba.Photograph: Luis BustamanteJorge Piñon, an expert at the University of Texas’sEnergyInstitute, says the government’s transition strategy underestimates the investment required to modernise Cuba’s ageing power infrastructure.“Cuba’s transmission system looks like Italian spaghetti,” Piñon says. “About 16% of the electricity generated is lost along the way.”While praising the rapid expansion of solar parks, Piñon says generation alone is not enough. “You also have to think about how the energy is transmitted and stored.”While solar plants can only supply electricity during daylight hours, peak demand typically occurs between 7pm and 8pm but Cuba lacks battery-storage capacity, and this remains the most expensive component of any solar energy system.According to Piñon, Cuba’s ambitious energy transition is also constrained by a lack of technical expertise to manage renewable energy projects at the pace required.Torres and Piñon agree that while renewables are essential, they cannot be the sole solution. “Cuba also needs to upgrade its fossil fuel-based thermoelectric plants,” Torres says. “The shift to renewable energy will not happen overnight.”But despite infrastructure deficits, solar energy is becoming a viable alternative for Cubans who can afford it. In Vertientes, two farmers say some villagers have begun installing solar panels to cope with power cuts.“I don’t have that option,” says one, noting that a single solar panel costs about £100, while theaverage monthly salary was about £10in Camagüey province last year.View image in fullscreenOrley Estrada, 30, among the photovoltaic panels he installed on a roof in the Guanabacoa neighbourhood of Havana this month.Photograph: Adalberto Roque/AFP/Getty ImagesThose who can afford solar panels or lithium generators are often entrepreneurs, such as guesthouse owners, or people who receive remittances from relatives abroad.In the wealthy Havana suburb of Miramar, many villas are now topped with newly installed solar panels.

Local people are hopeful the park will ease the energy crisis.At the village entrance, Roberto strokes his horse and says the windfarm will help, but farmers face more immediate challenges, including access to irrigation during droughts.“I’m happy living in the countryside,” he says. “But many things still need to change.”This story was supported by thePulitzer Center.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanRenewable energyAccess to energyEnergy (Technology)Fossil fuelsClimate crisisCubafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The two superpowers have so far developed the most powerful AI systems.The fourthintergovernmental AI summit, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, follows editions in the UK, Korea and France and is focusing on harnessing AI to the benefit of countries in the global south, for example by embracing more regional languages and applying AI to improving agriculture and public health.It is also aiming to improve safety standards, which some experts fear are falling short of addressingthe potential catastrophic risksbeing posed by the most advanced AIs amid White House opposition to red tape.“A lot of countries who aren’t the United States of America and who aren’t the People’s Republic of China essentially face two kind of slightly contradictory feelings at the same time,” Osborne said. “The first is a Fomo: are we missing out on this huge technological revolution? How to be part of it? How do we make sure that our companies feel the benefits of it? How do we make sure our societies feel the benefits of it?”At the same time, he said, these countries wanted to safeguard their national sovereignty while relying on powerful AIs controlled in the US and China.Osborne said: “There’s another kind of sovereignty, which is: don’t be left behind, because then you will be a weaker nation, a poorer nation, a nation whose workforce will be less willing to stay put.”His comments came as the White House’s senior AI adviser, Sriram Krishnan, emphasised the Trump administration’s desire for AI supremacy, telling the summit: “We want to make sure the world uses our AI model.”He also took a fresh swipe at the EU’s attempts to regulate AI, saying he would continue to “rant” against them.“The EU AI Act is not really very conducive to an entrepreneur who wants to build innovative technology,” he said.Europeans are dangerously reliant on US tech. Now is a good time to build our own | Johnny RyanRead moreBut other technologists, and AI leaders inAfrica, said the case for reliance on the two AI superpowers was not so clearcut.“The idea that countries other than China and the US won’t be able to build big things – and we [hear] that a lot – is actually a false premise,” Mark Surman, the head of Mozilla, said. “It benefits the companies within those two countries.”“For us, it’s not a US or China thing,” said Kevin Degila, in charge of of AI and data at theBeningovernment’s digital agency. “We are Africans and our job is to collaborate [with each other] to build our own AI.”He said 64 languages were spoken in his country of 15 million people and the government agency was building AIs for the public that fuse both American and Chinese AI technologies and their own large language datasets.“Anthropic andOpenAIdon’t reach the farmers,” he said.Paula Ingabire, Rwanda’s minister of ICT and innovation, said her country was looking at partnerships with AI companies “that are going to be progressively less necessary”, withRwandanot wishing to be “locked into very dependent partnerships”.Also speaking at the summit was Rishi Sunak, the former UK prime minister, who now advises one of OpenAI’s main rivals, Anthropic, and Microsoft.He urged political leaders to take bolder steps to lead the rollout of AI, saying: “If you are a prime minister you can only do a few things that you drive personally, and this has to be one of them.”“One of my concerns is that I think some political leaders think that AI is going to be tomorrow’s issue, where I think they need to recognise that it’s an ‘action this day’ issue,” Sunak said. “AI needs to go to a centralised responsibility so we can realise the benefits.”Explore more on these topicsGeorge OsborneOpenAIAI (artificial intelligence)Global economyEconomicsTrump administrationIndianewsShareReuse this content"

As her credit cards, Amazon and Google accounts were cancelled, she reeled from what she described as a “direct and flagrant attack” on one of the world’s most prominent courts.“These are coercive measures designed to attack our ability to do our jobs objectively and independently,” she said. “We want people to appreciate how wrong this is.”Since Trump returned to power last year, hisadministration has worked steadilyto hobble the Hague-based court. To date, 11 of thecourt’s officials– including the chief prosecutor and eight judges–have been placed under sanctions, subjecting them to measures that include bans on travel to the US and fines and prison sentences for American companies who provide them services.View image in fullscreenThe international criminal court in The Hague.Photograph: Peter Dejong/APIn an executive order last year, Trumpaccused the courtof engaging in “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel”, suggesting that the sanctions were in retribution for pursuing investigations into US and Israeli officials. Neither the US nor Israel is among the 125signatoriesof theRome statute,the 1998 treaty that gave rise to the court.The executive order led 79 countries – including Canada, Brazil, Denmark, Mexico and Nigeria – tocome togetherin support of the court. The sanctions, they said in a joint letter, “increase the risk of impunity for the most serious crimes and threaten to erode the international rule of law”.Republicans and Democrats unite to condemn Trump’s attacks on alliesRead morePrior to joining the ICC, Prost had spent five years working with the United Nations on its sanctions programme. Even so, she was surprised at how far-reaching the sanctions were. “It has such a serious impact in terms of day-to-day life, it’s not symbolic,” she said. “You lose all your credit cards, no matter where they were issued.”Simple tasks, from booking an Uber to reserving a flight or hotel room, became impossible. Bank transfers now included uncertainty over whether they would sail through the system or be rejected. Following the cancellation of her Amazon and Google accounts, Prost lived with the constant worry that her other accounts would also vanish. “Everything becomes such a challenge,” she said.For the Peruvian judge Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza, the US sanctions marked the second time she had been targeted by a global superpower for her work with the ICC. In December, a Russian courthad tried herin absentia, along with the court’s chief prosecutor and seven other judges, following the ICC’s decision to put out an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine. They were handed sentences of up to 15 years in prison.View image in fullscreenLuz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza (back row, second from left) sitting at the international criminal court.Photograph: Sem van der Wal/ANP/AFP/Getty ImagesBut the US sanctions were on another level, given the country’s weight in the global financial system. Soon after she was sanctioned, Ibáñez Carranza said her bank in the Netherlands cancelled her credit card.“Why? It’s a European bank, not an American bank,” she said. “We’ve seen a kind of over-compliance with the sanctions, because some banks are terrified about their relations with US banks or institutions.”What had been most painful, however, was to see how the sanctions had targeted her daughter, leading to the cancellation of her US visa and Google accounts. “She lives in another part of the world, she has no link to the ICC,” she said. “It’s sad. This is pure retaliation for something she hasn’t done.”It was a pattern seen across the ICC, she said, where spouses, parents and children of officials had ended up caught in the dragnet of the sanctions. “This is the kind of persecution that I think the world should not allow to happen,” said Ibáñez Carranza. “We serve humanity. We are delivering justice for the most vulnerable victims around the world, for millions and millions of women and children who have no voice.”She pointed to the critical work the court did in taking on cases when nations were unable or unwilling to prosecute crimes on their territory. “So my call is for the entire world to defend this institution that is the cause of humanity.”The sanctions have added to an already complicated panorama for the court, landing months after its top prosecutor, Karim Khan,was accusedof sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations.While the measures have so far focused on individuals, the court has been wrestling with fears that Washington could impose sanctions on the court as a whole. “The concern is the sanctions will be used to shut the court down, to destroy it rather than just tie its hands,” one ICC officialtold the Guardianlast year.The court had since sprung into action, said Prost. “It has been taken very seriously and a number of preventative measures are in place,” she said.She and Ibáñez Carranza were resolute that the actions of theTrump administration, while challenging on a personal level, had not impacted the work of the court. “These measures are completely futile,” said Prost. “I can say that, on behalf of all of the judges of this court and the prosecutors, we will continue to do our jobs independently. It does not affect the way we look at our cases or how we decide them.”Explore more on these topicsInternational criminal courtCanadaDonald TrumpInternational criminal justiceAmericasUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, she resigned from the cabinet two years later, after the two politicians became embroiled in a bitter feud.Relations between them reached rock bottom last year after Rodrigo Duterte was arrested in Manila anddramatically flown to The Hagueto face charges of crimes against humanity at the international criminal court (ICC). At the time, Sara Duterte condemned his arrest as “oppression and persecution”.Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest could be telling blow in the Philippines’ dynastic feudRead moreRodrigo Dutertewill appear before the ICC next week for a pre-trial hearing. The case relates to killings committed during hisanti-drugs “crackdowns”, where thousands of people were gunned down in the streets, many of them men in poor, urban areas.Duterte said after his arrest that he wouldaccept responsibilityfor the crackdowns. In 2024, he told a senate inquiry into the killings that he offered“no apologies, no excuses”for his policies, saying: “I did what I had to do, and whether you believe it or not, I did it for my country.”In her speech on Wednesday, Sara Duterte apologised for once running in tandem with Marcos, her ally-turned-nemesis, saying she was sorry she had once helped his election bid.“I am sorry if there is blatant abuse of our institutions for the personal interests of politicians. I am sorry that the prices of basic goods continue to rise while the income of every family remains insufficient. I am sorry that we do not even have genuine food security. I am sorry that some are falling ill and losing their lives because of the lack of a proper and effective healthcare system,” she said in a press briefing.Polls suggests Sara Duterte would be a strong contender in a future election. Her father, who styled himself as a straight-talking everyman, remained popular throughout his presidency, despite international condemnation over his so-called “war on drugs”.Sara Duterte is also facing legal troubles. Impeachment cases have been filed against her, including most recently by a group of nuns, priests, and lawyers, accusing her of misuse of funds as vice-president and when she was previously education secretary. She has also been accused ofthreatening to assassinatepresident Marcos. She has previously denied such allegations.Sara Duterte was impeached last year, though the case was later thrown out by the country’s supreme court over procedural issues.Like her father, Sara Duterte has been known for her extreme rhetoric. She once threatened todig up the remains of Marcos’ dictator fatherand throw them into the sea.Speaking on Wednesday she explained her decision to run for the presidency, saying: “It took me 47 years to understand that my life was never meant to be only mine. Unlike others, I may not have been born just to chase happiness. For a long time I questioned the weight of responsibility to my family, to my country, to everyone who called upon me. Today, I have peacefully accepted that my life is unlike any other.”President Marcos cannot seek re-election because he is limited to a single six-year term under the constitution. He has faced increased pressure over a corruption scandal, after it emerged billions of dollars had allegedly beenmisspent on bogus flood relief projects. Marcos has pledged zero tolerance for corruption and said those found to have misused funds will face jail.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesRodrigo DuterteAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House said Japan would also invest in a deepwater crude oil export facility off the coast of Texas, and a synthetic industrial diamond manufacturing site.The projects are the first batch of the $550bn Japan committed to invest under atrade deal with the USlast year. In return, Trump agreed to reduce US tariffs on Japanese exports including cars.“The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, tariffs,” Trump claimed on Tuesday. His controversial trade strategy alarmed economists in the US, who warned it risked exacerbating inflation.Most of the first wave of investment will go towards the plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, which will generate 9.2 gigawatts of electricity each year, according to the administration. It will be operated by SB Energy, which is a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group.The industrial diamond manufacturing site in Georgia, valued at about $600m, is designed to ensure the US can fully produce all the synthetic diamond grit – a critical material for advanced manufacturing and semiconductors – it requires domestically. The project “will end our foolish dependence on foreign sources”, said Trump.China controls much of the critical minerals market, dominating the world’s mining and processing of rare earths that are essential across a wide array of industries, from oil refining to car manufacturing.Beijing has not hesitated to wield this dominance, imposing restrictions on global imports of its rare earths. Such curbs were at the heart of aneconomic spat with Washingtonlast year. While Trump and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, reached a deal last October which reduced tensions in the short term, US officials have repeatedly spoken of the need to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals.Beijing has started in recent months to restrict some exports of rare earths to Japan, amid a row with Tokyo over Taiwan. Takaichi angered Chinese officials in November 2025 by suggestingJapan could become militarily involvedin the event of an attempted Chinese invasion of the self-governing island.“We will no longer rely on foreign supply for this essential material,” Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, said of the planned industrial diamond project.“Japan is providing the capital,” added Lutnick. “The infrastructure is being built in the United States. The proceeds are structured so Japan earns its return, and America gains strategic assets, expanded industrial capacity, and strengthened energy dominance.”Japan reported on Wednesday that its exports rose almost 17% in January, driven in part by a sharp rise in exports to China despite the current tensions.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeJapanChinaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyAsia PacificCritical mineralsnewsShareReuse this content"

They lunged and backflipped (landing on their knees), they spun around and jumped. Not one fell over.The display was impressive, but prompted some to wonder: if robots can now dance and perform martial arts, what else can they do?Experts have mixed opinions, with some saying the robots had limitations and that the display should be viewed through a lens of state propaganda.TikTok creator ByteDance vows to curb AI video tool after Disney threatRead moreDeveloped by several Chinese robotics firms, the robots performed a range of intricate stunts, including kung fu, comedy sketches and choreographed dance moves alongside human performers.Clipscirculatingonline quickly drew comparisons with last year’s lunar new year broadcast, which also featured dancing robots but with noticeably simpler movements.View image in fullscreenThe performance showed China’s push to develop more advanced robots powered by improved AI capabilities.Photograph: CCTV Video News Agency/YoutubeKyle Chan, an expert in China’s technology development at Brookings Institution, a policy organisation in Washington DC, said Beijing uses these public robot performances to “dazzle domestic and international audiences with China’s technological prowess”.“Unlike AI models or industrial equipment, humanoid robots are highly visible examples of China’s technological leadership that general audiences can see on their phones or televisions,” he said.Pointing to intensifying competition in the tech space between China and the US, Chan added: “While China and the US are neck-and-neck on AI, humanoid robots are an area where China can claim to be ahead of the US, particularly in terms of scaling up production.”Georg Stieler, the head of robotics and automation at the global technology consulting firm Stieler Technology and Marketing, also emphasised the symbolism of China’s prime time broadcast.“What distinguishes the gala from comparable events elsewhere is the directness of the pipeline from industrial policy to prime-time spectacle,” Stieler said in a statement.Comparing this year’s performances with last year’s – when viewers saw “fundamentally a single choreographic mode” with limited motions including walking, twisting and kicking – Stieler said one key signal of China’s robot progress is “the ability to run large numbers of near-identical humanoids in synchronised motion with stable gaits and consistent joint behaviour”.But Stieler also noted: “Stage performance does not equate to industrial robustness, yet.” He said what the robots did was the result of being trained for a routine “hundreds or thousands of times – you could not just tell them to change direction or do something completely different”.“These dance motions involve very little environmental perception and are essentially imitation learning plus a balance-keeping controller. That has little bearing on reliability in unstructured environments, a prerequisite for factory-grade deployment. Also the progress in dexterity is not as fast as in locomotion,” he added.The unveiling of China’s latest generation of robots underscores the country’s broader technological ambitions.By the end of 2024,Chinahad registered 451,700 smart robotics companies, with a total capital of 6.44tn yuan (approximately $932.16bn), according tostate data. Major government projects such as Made in China 2025 and the 14th Five-Year Plan, have made robotics and AI key Beijing priorities.Morgan Stanley projects that China’s humanoid sales will more than double to 28,000 units in 2026; and Elon Musk has said he expects his biggest competitor to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its flagship humanoid Optimus. “People outside China underestimate China, but China is an ass-kicker next level,” Musk said last month.Marina Zhang, a technology professor at the University of Technology Sydney, said that such a visible showcase likely hints at a new phase in China’s manufacturing masterplan, “where robotics becomes a linchpin in the shift from low-cost assembly to high-end, smart manufacturing”.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsChinaRobotsAI (artificial intelligence)Asia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Critics decried the move, which led to mass layoffs, as ceding ground to China and other US adversaries.However, Bay Fang, RFA’s president and chief executive, wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Wednesday: “We are proud to have resumed broadcasting to audiences in China in Mandarin, Tibetan, and Uyghur, providing some of the world’s only independent reporting on these regions in the local languages.”She said the ability to restart the broadcasts was “due to private contracting with transmission services”. She did not provide details, but added that rebuilding the network would require consistentfunding to be approved by Congress.A bipartisan spending bill that Trump signed into law earlier in February included $653m for USAGM, which oversees RFA, VOA and other government-funded outlets. That figure is down from the $867m appropriated for the agency each of the past two years, but more than the $153m Trump requested that Congress provide to shut down USAGM.US lawmakers of both parties had said Trump’s drive to dismantle the news outlets diminished Washington’s clout globally at a time when Beijing is expanding its own sphere of influence.A spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington declined to comment on what he said was US domestic policy, but accused RFA of having an anti-China bias.“Radio Free Asia has long spread falsehoods and smeared China, and they have a poor record when it comes to reporting on China-related issues,” the Chinese embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said. “We hope more media outlets in the US can make objective and fair-minded reports on China and China-US relations.“Chinese state media had praised last year’s cuts.Rights activists have said that for decades RFA has shone light on abuses by China and other authoritarian countries, raising awareness about the plight of oppressed minorities such as China’s Uyghur Muslims.On Friday, the RFA spokesperson Rohit Mahajan said the outlet had contracted with private companies to broadcast to audiences in Tibet, North Korea and Myanmar.Mahajan said the outlet’s Mandarin audio content is online only, with the aim to resume regular broadcasts over airwaves soon. Its Tibetan, Uyghur, Korean, and Burmese radio programming airs over short and medium-wave frequencies. Previous satellite transmissions via USAGM have not resumed yet, he said.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificRadio industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Successful applicants can only purchase homes in New Zealand worth more than $5m.Immigration New Zealand said the new scheme offering residency to wealthy foreigners has attracted 573 applications, representing 1,833 people. Before the changes, the visa attracted 116 applications over two-and-a-half years.‘Everybody’s at each other’s throats’: James Cameron says he has left the US permanentlyRead moreThe most recent data released by the government showed that investors from the US made up nearly 40% of applicants, followed by China and Hong Kong. Since August 2025, the number of applications from China more than doubled, from 45 to 95.The remaining top 10 countries in order included Germany, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan and South Korea tied, and Great Britain.There are two categories of “golden visa” in New Zealand. Most have applied under the “growth” category, which requires a minimum NZ$5m ($3m) investment over three years. A smaller group applied under the “balanced” category, which sets a minimum investment of $10m over five years. The previous scheme required an investment of $15m.table showing visa applications by nationalityCourtney and Jim Andelman, a couple from California who run a venture capital firm, were, alongside their twin daughters, the 100th family to be granted a visa.The visa provided an opportunity for the family to spend more time in New Zealand – a country Courtney fell in love with during a backpacking trip 30 years ago, while being an opportunity “give back” to the community, she told the Guardian.The visa was also good for business, she said.“This is not just about fun and games and having a chance to live in one of the most amazing countries on the planet – this is also a really smart investment scheme. It’s smart for us.”New Zealand was an “underserved” market with “incredible entrepreneurial habits, history and technologies”, she said.The family has invested in various venture funds and is also eyeing up companies for direct investment. They are particularly interested in New Zealand’s “deep-tech” industry, including artificial intelligence, robotics and biotechnologies.The couple have decided not to buy a home in New Zealand, in part because the $5m price tag is too hefty, and because they do not want to add strain to the housing market. Meanwhile, they will split their time between New Zealand and Santa Barbara, where they live.“We feel a real responsibility to participating, not just in one country, but in both countries.”View image in fullscreenJim Andelman, left, and his wife, Courtney Andelman, right, pictured with their daughters, were granted one of New Zealand’s ‘golden visas’.Photograph: SuppliedRobbie Paul, the chief executive of the Auckland-based venture capital firm Icehouse Ventures, has worked with more than 30 people who have applied for a golden visa. Paul helps applicants fulfil their visa requirements by assisting with their investments in New Zealand.Many of the Americans Paul has worked with have said the visa provides an opportunity to escape Trump’s administration.“I’ll put it this way, never in my time in New Zealand, did I have an applicant reference Biden or Obama … and then, absolutely, a lot of references to people’s feelings towards Maga and Trump,” he said.New Zealand had become an appealing option for those investors because it is English-speaking, political stable, beautiful and “very connected to the world”, Paul said.It is not the first time New Zealand has attracted the interest of Trump-weary Americans and other wealthy foreigners seeking to make New Zealand their “bolthole” at a time of societal division.After Trump election victory in 2016, visits to the country’s immigration website rose almost 2,500%. After the US supreme court ruled there was no constitutional right to abortion – upending the landmarkRoe v Wade– visits to New Zealand’s immigration sitequadrupled to 77,000. After Trump’s 2024 election win,there was a surge of interestfrom the US in New Zealand’s property market.Billionaires acquiring residency or citizenship in New Zealand have been subject to controversy in the past. After Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, was granted citizenship in 2017despite spending only 12 daysin the country, the former Labour prime minister Jacinda Ardern tightened the rules on investment visas.Ardern also banned foreign home ownership in 2018, because of concern that foreign buyers were driving up prices during a housing crisis.In 2025,the government announced that while the ban largely remains, holders of a “golden visa” would now be able to buy homes valued at more than $5m.At the same time wealthy investors are flocking to the golden visa, New Zealand citizens have beenleaving the country in record numbersin recent years, due to a weak economy, high living costs and high unemployment. Themost recent migration statisticsreleased in February, however, show signs of improvement, with 66,300 citizens departing in 2025 compared with 67,200 in 2024.The Active Investor Plus visa scheme has generated $3.39bn investment in New Zealand, Immigration NZ said. The immigration minister, Erica Stanford, said the new visa settings are helping to open up investment in New Zealand.“International investment is critical for lifting productivity, supporting jobs, and helping New Zealand businesses to expand,” she said in a statement.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

I think I learned more from the students than they learned from me,” she said.“I taught in an area that was really socioeconomically diverse, out at Mount Druitt … And I’ll never forget the relationship you develop with students, the responsibility of being a teacher and having those little minds at your hands.View image in fullscreenBurney says a strong Aboriginal perspective in the curriculum is important.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian“Opening up worlds for those kids they wouldn’t normally see.”Burney also helped develop the first Aboriginal education policy in Australia in the 1980s before being elected to NSW parliament, a trailblazing document that mandated teaching all children about contemporary and traditional Aboriginal society for the first time.She said she had “always had a dream where not only do we reach equity and parity for First Nations young people and older people”.“But also to make sure that, particularly in things like nursing and teaching, there’s a very strong Aboriginal perspective through curriculum,” she said.UTS has anIndigenous education and research strategywith targets to increase its Indigenous employment to 3% of its full-time equivalent (FTE) staff by 2026 – bringing it into line with population parity – and to increase its Indigenous student participation rate to 700 students by 2030.It is a long road ahead: in UTS’s latest annual report in 2024, just 2.2% of its FTE staff were Indigenous, and its Indigenous student cohort was 406 students, or 1.09%.View image in fullscreenBurney arrives at UTS amid a controversial restructure.Photograph: Richard Glover/View Pictures/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThe NSW minister for skills, Tafe and tertiary education, Steve Whan, who is a longtime friend of Burney, said she had an “incredible amount” of expertise in encouraging Indigenous students to tertiary education and a “great skill set” from her time in politics that would be useful for the university council.“I’ve never forgotten Linda’sinaugural speechin this place [NSW parliament] in 2003 when [she] talked about … how important education was to her future and to everyone’s future,” he said.In the speech, which has gone on to be widely cited, Burney said education was the “cornerstone of social justice” and “is what equals us out whether we are from Canterbury boys high school … or the King’s school”.UTS ordered by SafeWork NSW to pause job cuts due to risk of ‘psychological harm’Read moreBurney arrives at UTS amid the university’s continued restructure and associated backlash.Last week, management announced it would push forward with cutting 121 full-time roles as part of itsacademic change plan– however UTS said all redundancies would be voluntary. It has paused any changes to courses until 2027, after fury from the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) over its handling of the restructure.Initially, UTS told its staff that 150 academics and 250 operational employees couldlose their jobs– about a tenth of the workforce – andmore than 1,000 subjectswere slated to be slashed.Whan said universities were at a “really critical time”, with many in financial distress.“That requires a new way of thinking and bringing someone else into the board means new ideas,” he said.“There’s been quite a lot of denigrating of universities from each end of the spectrum at the moment. I think it’s really important that we value that role of independent institutions in our society and that we aren’t seeking to undermine them.”View image in fullscreenBurney with NSW minister Steve Whan at Parliament House in Sydney.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianLast August, the NSW government established an inquiry into the “crisis” in the university sector after backlash over rolling university restructures, including at UTS, from the tertiary community and its chair, the Labor MP Sarah Kaine.Itsterms of referenceincluded the qualifications and experience of council appointees.Whan said with governance a “national focus”, the state government’s ability to appoint board members was a way to ensure council appointments were not just from commercial or business backgrounds.“We want to make sure that they are also looking at the educational side and the equity side,” he said. “In the interest of the institution and not at the direction of some external party.”Explore more on these topicsLinda BurneyAustralian universitiesAustralian educationNew South Wales politicsNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

He said they had tried to restore existing patches of banksia woodland and been unable to bring it back to its original state.“This is not simple gardening,” he said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBiodiversity offsetting is meant to compensate for the environmental damage caused by development by providing an equal or greater environmental benefit elsewhere. But offsetting has been beset with problems, including that promised offsets are sometimes never delivered or they fail to adequately compensate for the environmental loss.Like other capital cities around the country, Perth is facing a housing crunch, with the median housing price in the WA capital surpassing the $1m mark.Some new developments areplacing increased pressure on already threatened ecosystems such as the banksia woodland.Species in the woodland include herbaceous plants, flowering woody shrubs and native sedges. A canopy storey contains banksias and eucalypts.In addition to threatened Baudin’s and Carnaby’s black cockatoos, the habitat also supports insect communities and animals such as the honey possum.Dixon said it was the collective mix of species that created the “broader ecological balance” for a resilient banksia woodland ecological community “with a unique assemblage of species that are not represented elsewhere”.Of the three housing developments – two in the south of Perth and one in the north – one was approved by the federal environment department last yearand the other two are under assessment.Most of the offset options put forward by Emerge Associates would involve trying to create banksia woodland from scratch within stands of tuart woodland in public reserves. Tuart, if it meets the right conditions, is a critically endangered ecosystem in its own right.Dixon said the tuart woodlands had the wrong soil and canopy type to support a true banksia woodland. He said the two ecosystems had some common species and it was possible for a simple type of banksia woodland to exist within a tuart woodland, but not the same type of complex banksia ecosystem that was being cleared.He said that meant the offsets proposed were unlikely to result in a like-for-like environmental benefit and there would be a net loss of banksia woodland as it was pushed closer to the critically endangered category.The AustralianConservationFoundation’s national biodiversity policy officer, Brendan Sydes, said the proposals highlighted concerns that offsetting, rather than being a last resort, had become a tool to facilitate development at the expense of vulnerable species and ecosystems.“These examples demonstrate that there’s an overreliance on offsets and an optimistic assumption about the ability to recreate ecosystems when in many cases the answer should be ‘no, don’t destroy the habitat’,” Sydes said.“We’ve just got to the point where there’s so little left that the priority should be protection.”Following the passage of amendments to Australia’s national environmental laws last year, detailed rules for offsets are under development.“It’s critical that it delivers a clampdown on when offsets can be used, and that new rules and offsets funds don’t actually end up acting as habitat destruction accelerators by facilitating inappropriate use of biodiversity offsets,” Sydes said.A spokesperson for the federal environment department said in the case of the housing development it had approved, it had worked closely with the environmental consultancy to “ensure the offset is achievable and aligns with a banksia [threatened ecological] community that is known to coexist with tuart woodlands”.They said that project was approved with “rigorous” conditions to deliver and monitor the offset.They could not comment on the two developments still under assessment. They said federal offset policy did not prevent offsets on land that was publicly owned.A spokesperson for Emerge Associates said there had been a public consultation process for each development, including their proposed offsets, and public feedback was reflected in the assessment documentation.They noted some of the developments were still being considered by the department.Explore more on these topicsEndangered habitatsPerthEndangered speciesHousingWestern AustraliaConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Mazda has accrued a potential liability of about $25m, Nissan of more than $10m and Subaru $7m. Liabilities can accumulate or reduce, and become due in 2029.Too fancy? Not rugged enough? Or a mainstream sweet spot? We took Australia’s cheapest EV ute out for a dayRead moreOther companies to have missed their initial target include Hyundai, General Motors, Honda, Porsche, Ferrari and Jaguar.The federal transport minister, Catherine King, said average pollution for new light passenger vehicles across the industry outperformed the target by 21%. “These results make it clear the [standard] supports both lower emissions and consumer affordability,” she said.Electric vehicles were 12% of new sales in the second half of last year – an increase, but significantly short of what will be needed for the scheme to play its forecast role in meeting national climate targets. The remaining 88% were petrol and hybrid vehicles.Globally, about 25% of new cars sold last year were electric. Australia hasconsistently trailed other developed, and many developing, countries in EV uptake. China is by far the world’s biggest EV market. Our World in Datalast year reportedChina was home to more than 60% of global EV sales.The Australia vehicle efficiency standard requires carmakers to supply new vehicles that meet an average per-kilometre emissions target. The target will be reduced over time to encourage cleaner cars. No cars are banned. More polluting models can still be sold and offset by EVs or low emissions vehicles.Companies that beat their target are awarded units, or credits, that can be sold to those that miss their target and need to offset the extra pollution from their vehicles.In the first six months, companies earned 17.2m credits for beating their targets. Those that missed their target faced a combined potential liability of 1.3m tonnes. It leaves a net surplus of 15.9 credits that can be used to meet targets in future years.The Electric Vehicle Council said the results showed the standard was a success.The council’s chief executive Julie Delvecchio said when the [standard] was legislated critics had warned of “supply shortages, soaring prices and market disruption”. She said the reality was emissions were coming down, the choice of new cars was expanding and EV sales were growing.“Instead, the first performance report shows strong industry performance, healthy competition and a clear acceleration in cleaner vehicles coming to Australia,” she said. “The data confirms what we said all along: clear, predictable standards drive innovation and investment. They don’t break markets, they modernise them.”Delvecchio said the results showed an upcoming review should lead to targets being strengthened. If they were not, there was a risk the momentum in introducing clean cars could be slowed as companies collected excess credits for beating targets that were not exacting enough, she said.The National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association said the results were encouraging but showed Australia was likely to fall short on EV uptake and climate targets if a contentious fringe benefits tax exemption on clean cars was removed.Explore more on these topicsElectric vehiclesEmissions tradingnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re a huge part of household budgets,” she said.“It’s very important that pricing claims and product claims are clear and truthful.”The criticism comes during a period of reigniting inflation, with groceries and other household costs rising strongly again.Separately, the ACCC issuing Coles and Woolworthsover allegations they offered “illusory” discounts on many everyday products. Cass-Gottlieb could not comment on the proceedings which are being heard in the federal court in Melbourne.In stores, Woolworths,Colesand Aldi have all expanded their use of per-item produce pricing, and often do not display the weight price next to it. There are no scales at Aldi’s Australian stores.The supermarkets have different online practices, with Woolworths using fixed prices for some produce, regardless of the weight, while Coles and Aldi adjust the final price depending on the weight.The supermarketshave argued that per-item pricing can make it easier for customersto quickly budget for, and choose, the number of items they need.Under existing rules, the major supermarkets can price fruit and vegetables per item or per kilogram, whether they are packaged or loose. While the Albanese government has said it would strengthen aspects of the unit pricing code, it has not announced reforms to the practice.The rise of per-item charging has led to huge price discrepancies, given larger cauliflowers, broccoli, capsicums, mangoes, avocados and other produce are likely to be snapped up quickly, leaving the smaller ones behind for the next wave of shoppers.Online shoppers using delivery services have no control over the size chosen.Ian Jarratt, a consumer advocate who pioneered the Queensland Consumer Association’s unit pricing in Australia, said all produce should be priced, and displayed, per weight.“If they want to give an approximate item price they can do that, but it should be charged on a per-kilo basis,” Jarratt said.“The base problem with what supermarkets are doing is that there is not sufficient transparency.“Why should you be penalised because someone else picked up the big cauliflowers?”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)Consumer affairsSupermarketsColesWoolworthsAustralian economynewsShareReuse this content"

His lawyer, Kurt Jelinek, called Kerstin G’s death “a tragic accident”.The senior public prosecutor Hansjörg Mayr and his team are citing the legal concept of the “tour guide acting as a courtesy” in the case, which designates the person with more experience and knowledge and the key decision-maker as having most responsibility.The prosecutors therefore accuse Thomas P of failing in his responsibility as the more experienced climber, listing nine major errors. These include forging ahead with the climb despite the fact Kirsten G had “never undertaken an Alpine tour of this length, difficulty and altitude and despite the challenging weather conditions”.The couple had started out two hours later than advised and had not been sufficiently equipped with emergency bivouac equipment, the prosecutors said. Neither had Thomas P advised Kerstin G that the snowboard boots she was wearing were inadequate for the terrain.Prosecutors also allege Thomas P was negligent in failing to turn back and question why, despite his partner’s exhaustion, he failed to make an emergency call before nightfall and did not send distress signals to a passing rescue helicopter.“Around 2am, the defendant left his girlfriend unprotected, exhausted, hypothermic, and disoriented approximately 50 metres below the summit cross of the Großglockner,” Mayr said.Jelinek disputes the prosecutor’s version, saying the couple had organised the tour together, and were “sufficiently experienced, adequately prepared and well-equipped”, with “relevant Alpine experience” and “in very good physical condition”.More than 7,000 people climb the 3,798-metre-high (12,461ft) Großglockner every year. About 200 deaths of mountaineers have been recorded there, but none has attracted as much attention as that of Kerstin G.Her mother, Gertraud G, who is due to give evidence, has said she does not hold Thomas P responsible for her daughter’s death and has spoken of a “witch-hunt” against him.In a recent interview with the German weekly Die Zeit, Gertraud G said she was upset at the way in which her daughter, who she said had discovered her passion for mountain climbing during the pandemic, had been depicted.“It makes me angry that Kerstin is being portrayed as a stupid little thing,” she said. “Kerstin was in top physical condition. And she had already mastered far more difficult climbing tours, both alone and with her boyfriend.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaMountaineeringEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Güell was the owner of a cement company with mines in the region and he needed somewhere to house the engineers, many of them British, who would help extract the coal for his factories.View image in fullscreenGaudí’s Park Güell in Barcelona.Photograph: MasterLu/Getty/iStockphotoIt has long been suspected that the chalet, now not in use, was the work of Gaudí but historians had not firmly established the architect. The building contains elements of Gaudí’s naturalistic style, evoking the forms of plants and animals that would later be expressed in works such as Park Güell and the Casa Batllò in Barcelona. The pointed arch structure also foreshadows Gaudí’s best-known work, theSagrada Famíliain Barcelona.View image in fullscreenGaudí died on 10 June 1926, at the age of 73, three days after being hit by a tram in Barcelona.Photograph: Heritage Images/GettySònia Hernández Almodóvar, the Catalan culture minister, said the attribution was the fruit of “rigorous research which is of enormous value for our heritage” and enriched Gaudí’s legacy on the centenary of his death.The analysis was carried out by the Catalan heritage department led by the chair of Gaudí studies, Galdric Santana Roma. “After much research we have concluded that the Xalet del Catllaràs is the work of Gaudí,” he said. “However, this attribution is strictly limited to the initial stages of the project as Gaudí didn’t supervise the work which didn’t follow faithfully the original design.”Santana said the process of certifying an architectural work is very different from that of a painting and the knowledge acquired in the study of the chalet will contribute to investigating other works attributed to Gaudí.Gaudí died on 10 June 1926, at the age of 73, three days after being hit by a tram in Barcelona, and numerous commemorative events and exhibitions are planned throughout the centenary year.View image in fullscreenThe central tower of Gaudí’s Sagrada Família in Barcelona will be completed in June.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/GettyThe installation in June of the final elements of the illuminated cross atop the central Jesus Christ tower of the Sagrada Família, more than 140 years after the project began in 1882, is likely to have the longest-lasting impact on the city’s skyline.Initially funded by repentant sinners and more recently by tourism, the completion of the tower will make it, at 172.5 metres, Barcelona’s tallest building. The Sagrada Família is already the world’s tallest church since part of its central tower was lifted into place in October.View image in fullscreenThe chalet in the Catllaràs mountains features pointed arches that Gaudí also used in the Sagrada Família.Photograph: Sergi Boixader/AlamyGaudí devoted the latter part of his life to the Sagrada Família, but little of it was completed in the architect’s lifetime, and work practically came to a halt at the outbreak of the Spanish civil war in 1936. The rise of mass tourism after the 1992 Olympic Games helped to make Barcelona a popular tourist destination and work on the church accelerated and moved into its final stages.Work on the Glory facade is expected to last another 10 years, and there remains the thorny issue of constructing the grand entrance stairway, in Gaudí’s original plan, that would now entail rehousing 10,000 people and demolishing about 3,000 apartments.Explore more on these topicsAntoni GaudíBarcelonaSpainEuropeArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

He also called on Belgium to do “a much better job” on antisemitism.Circumcision is legal in Belgium but must be carried out under strict conditions by a medical professional. The investigation concerns three mohels, or ritual circumcisers, in Antwerp suspected of performing circumcisions without any medical training.White’s post drew animmediate rebukefrom Belgium’s foreign minister, Maxime Prévot. “Any suggestion Belgium is antisemitic is false, offensive, and unacceptable,” Prévot said, accusing the ambassador of violating “fundamental diplomatic norms”.White responded that Belgium should change its law or label the investigation into “three beautiful religiously qualified and wonderful men” antisemitic. Accusations that he was interfering in Belgium’s judicial affairs were a “political distraction”, he said.After being summoned to the foreign ministry on Tuesday, White insisted there was “no need” for him to apologise. He had “explained our position and that of President Trump and of our country”, he said, and hoped Belgium could “legalise this process”.Belgian authorities said White had been reminded of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, adding: “Personal attacks on a member of the government and interference in Belgium’s internal affairs are contrary to these basic diplomatic rules.”The ministry said in its statement that while Belgium attached great importance to its relationship with the US, dialogue “must be based on respect for our institutions and our sovereignty”. It reaffirmed its condemnation of antisemitism and racism.The Belgian newspaper De Morgen reported on Wednesday thatWhite had handed an official complaintto Belgium’s top diplomat at the meeting, demanding “immediate condemnation” of statements by Conner Rousseau, the leader of the Flemish socialist Vooruit party.Rousseaulast month postedthat the “gruesome” behaviour of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the US showed “history was repeating itself” and “we have not listened” to the calls of “never again” after the horrors of Nazi Germany.Rousseau said on Wednesday he was unrepentant. “I posted that on social media five weeks ago, and yesterday it suddenly turns out to be a problem,” he said. “I suspect [White’s] intervention regarding the circumcision did not go as he would have liked.”Rousseau, whom White reportedly threatened with a travel ban to the US, told the Flemish broadcaster VRT: “I can only say that we in Belgium have the right, and I also believe a political duty, to express our concerns about what’s happening in the US.“I respect the ambassador’s opinion, but I also ask for respect for ours.”Explore more on these topicsBelgiumUS foreign policyJudaismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On web forums, some said their monthly loan repayments would double, or almost double.It is unclear precisely which countries have had their thresholds cut (or increased) and how many UK graduates are affected. The Department for Education declined to confirm how many people would be affected; it intends to formally announce the 2026-27 overseas earnings thresholds in April.Reeves is under increasing pressure over the row, which centres on an estimated 5.8 million people who took out a plan 2 loan between 2012 and 2023, many of whom say they have been saddled with ballooning debts.Some graduates claim they were the victims of government “mis-selling”, and the consumer champion Martin Lewis has told Reeves that changing the terms of the deal was not “a moral thing” to do.There are 201,000 English UK nationals living overseas with student loans “in repayment”,according to official data, though some graduates from Wales and Scotland are also affected by the changes for those living overseas.One UK national who graduated from Sheffield University after five years of study – a degree followed by a PhD – and now works in Germany, was told by the Student Loans Company (SLC) that his plan 2 loan repayments would increase from £213 to £251 a month – an extra £456 a year – even though his salary had not gone up.A representative of the SLC, the government-owned organisation that administers the loans – told the graduate the annual repayment threshold for Germany was being cut to £23,510 a year from April, according to screenshots of his conversation seen by the Guardian.The graduate said: “How can this be legal? The talk was of freezing, but this is a massive drop.”OnRedditandMoneySavingExpertforums, other graduates in Germany and Belgium said they had also been informed the new threshold was £23,510.One user posted: “It’s messed-up logic. Germany isn’t cheaper to live in, so they should raise the UK threshold, not reduce/reclassify Germany.” They have a plan 4 student loan – they studied in Scotland – and said their monthly repayments were being hiked from £84 to £127.German inflationedged higher to reach 2.1%last month, data revealed this week, while UK inflationfell to 3% in January.The SLC saysthe overseas earnings thresholds are based on living costs such as food, housing and transport, and are set using information published by the World Bank.Asked about the new overseas thresholds, a government spokesperson said: “We inherited the student loans system, including plan 2, which was devised by the previous government.“Threshold freezes [in the UK] have been introduced to protect taxpayers and students now, alongside future generations of learners and workers. The student finance system protects lower-earning graduates, with repayments determined by incomes and outstanding loans and interest being cancelled at the end of repayment terms.”They added: “Since we were elected, we have been committed to supporting the aspiration of anyone who can and wants to attend higher education, including by reintroducing targeted maintenance grants to support the prime minister’s target of two-thirds of young people taking a gold standard apprenticeship, higher training or heading to university by the age of 25.”Explore more on these topicsStudent financeStudentsTuition feesGermanyBelgiumHigher educationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

These deaths comprised 56% of violent deaths in Gaza.“The combined evidence suggests that, as of 5 January 2025, 3-4% of the population of the Gaza Strip had been killed violently and there have been a substantial number of non-violent deaths caused indirectly by the conflict,” the authors of the study, a team including an economist, demographer, epidemiologist and survey specialists, wrote in the Lancet Global Health.The exact death toll in Gaza has been bitterly disputed, although last month a senior Israeli security officer told Israeli journalists thatfigures compiled by health authorities in Gaza were broadly accurate, marking a U-turn after years of official attacks on the data.The officer was quoted as saying that about 70,000 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli attacks on the territory since October 2023, excluding those missing.Graph showing estimated cumulative deaths in Gaza as a result of violenceGaza health authorities now say the direct toll from Israeli attacks has exceeded 71,660 people,including more than 570killed since a ceasefire came into effect in October 2025.Researchers who published a study in the Lancet last year estimated the death toll in Gaza during the first nine months of the war given by the Palestinian territory’s health ministry was about 40% lower than their estimate.The new research also suggests that official death toll was a substantial undercount, and by a roughly similar margin. It was based on a survey of 2,000 families in Gaza, carefully selected to be representative of the territory’s population, who were asked to give details of deaths among their members. The survey was run by experienced Palestinian pollsters known for their work inPalestineand elsewhere in the region.“This is a very sensitive survey, and potentially very upsetting [for respondents], so it was important to have Palestinians both asking and answering the questions,” said Michael Spagat, a professor of economics at Royal Holloway, University of London, one of the authors of the peer-reviewed study.Spagat, who has worked on the calculation of casualties of conflicts for more than 20 years, said the new research suggested 8,200 deaths in Gaza from October 2023 to January 2025 were attributable to indirect effects , such as malnutrition or untreated disease. He questioned another study published in the Lancet in 2024 that estimated there would befour “indirect” deaths for every “direct” death.“There is a huge variation depending on the specific circumstances of every conflict. In Kosovo [conflict of 1998-99] almost all the deaths were violent. In somewhere like Darfur, you see something very different. In Gaza, at least initially, there were resources in terms of well-trained doctors and a health system … Also, the territory is very small, so when aid does flow you can reach people,” Spagat said.“I would push back on the notion that this is a small number of deaths. I think we’re experiencing desensitisation effects …. But, yes, it’s much lower than what many people say and believe.”The Hamas raid of October 2023 killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, while 250 were taken hostage by the militant Islamist organisation. Israel launched its retaliatory assault within hours, devastating much of Gaza with airstrikes, tank shelling and artillery bombardment.The study covers the most intense and lethal period of Israel’s offensive, but not the most acuteperiod of the humanitarian crisisin the territory. Famine in Gaza wasdeclared by UN-backed expertsin August last year.The proportion of combatants to non-combatants among those killed in Gaza has also been bitterly disputed. Israeli officials have claimed their attacks killed an almost equal number of each. The new study contradicts this claim.In November, a research team from theMax Planck Institute for Demographic Researchestimated that 78,318 people had been killed in Gaza between 7 October 2023 and 31 December 2024 – almost exactly the same period as the new study. But that research also suggested a much higher number of indirect deaths, which contributed to a reduction of life expectancy in Gaza by 44% in 2023 and by 47% in 2024.Spagat said reaching a definitive figure of those killed in the conflict would take a long time and significant resources. Figures given even in the most recent study published this week have significant margins of error.“It is not a given that there will be a multimillion-pound research project to reconstruct what actually happened. It will be a long time before we get to a full accounting of all the people killed in Gaza, if we ever get there,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

There also was little indication how a Board of Peace could break a key deadlock in negotiations between Israel and Hamas, he added.“The board is a convenient way for a president who’s interested in quick wins, transactions and a lot of motion in lieu of serious movement as a way to project that things are somehow … not dead,” he said, referring to diplomacy. “So you could get some impressive pledges. But pledges are one thing, delivering is another.”Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has declined her invitation, and the leaders of key US allies including the United Kingdom, Germany and France have also said they won’t join the Board of Peace. Trump rescinded an invitation to Canada’sMark Carneyfollowing a critical speech by the Canadian prime minister at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month.The White House initiative received another blow this week asPope Leo XIVannounced that the Vatican would not join the board, which critics have said is an attempt to usurp authority from other major international organisations including theUnited Nationsand may allow Trump to remain as its chair even after his presidency ends.“One concern,” said Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s top diplomat, “is that at the international level it should above all be the [United Nations] that manages these crisis situations. This is one of the points on which we have insisted.”The meeting instead will be attended by Middle Eastern delegations, including from Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan and Qatar, along with a bevy of international states with little direct engagement in the conflict in Gaza, from Argentina and Paraguay to Hungary to Kazakhstan. Many are seen as currying favor with theTrump administrationby joining the Board of Peace – which proposes securing a permanent seat for a $1bn donation – in an effort to prop up his latest signature initiative.Max Rodenbeck, the Israel/Palestine project director for the International Crisis Group, said that the initiative would be under heavy scrutiny and that there was “huge global scepticism about the shape and intentions of the Board of Peace”.“If this meeting does not result in fast, tangible improvements on the ground – and particularly on the humanitarian front – its credibility will quickly crumble,” he said.Israel’sBenjamin Netanyahu, who signed up to the idea during a visit to Washington last week, has chosen to skip the meeting. The foreign minister, Gideon Saar, a rightwing ally of Netanyahu, will attend instead.Winning Israeli cooperation with the peace plan is expected to be extremely hard in an election year when Netanyahu is trying to hold on to the extreme far-right wing of his party and wants to avoid the perception of working alongside regional powers like Qatar or Turkey, which have close links to Hamas.Developments on the ground have indicated that few of the political or security organisations under the Trump-backed peace plan have actually made progress toward resolving the conflict or easing Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.Nearly a month on from the unveiling of the 100-day peace and recovery plan by Kushner, who is also Trump’s son-in-law, the people designated to carry out that plan are still hazy about how it is supposed to work.Fifteen members of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), a body of technocrats established under Trump’s plan, are waiting in Cairo, anxious to show rapid improvements in living standards to the people of Gaza, but lack the tools to get anything done.Nickolay Mladenov, who is supposed to act as the Board of Peace’s high representative for Gaza, has had little visibility so far and said even less about his role. The NCAG’s first major post on social media, put up on Saturday, suggested a degree of frustration, and a message that it was not willing to be a puppet.“We emphasize that full administrative, civilian, and police control by the NCAG is not merely procedural; [the] NCAG cannot be expected to carry responsibility without the full administrative, civilian, and police powers necessary to implement its mandate effectively,” the NCAG post on X said.“Everything is going slower than expected, and everyone is very frustrated,” said Gershon Baskin, an Israeli commentator and peace activist who played a role in negotiating the peace plan.“The NCAG are staying in Cairo until they have a clear understanding that they can achieve something. Going to Gaza now would be very unconstructive. They would not be able to achieve anything,” Baskin said. They don’t even know what their budget is, how much money they have to work with and what their tasks are going to be. It’s not even clear to them under whose authority they’re working.”There are some moves towards building an international stabilisation force (ISF) envisaged in the Trump plan as a support to the Palestinian police. Indonesia has already offered 8,000 troops; a barracks site is being prepared for them inside Gaza and there is reportedly an office at a civil-military coordination centre with “ISF” on the door. But no one is inside.Diplomats in Jerusalem are worried that the ISF plan will be doomed to failure if the right conditions are not created for its deployment, which include a feasible plan for Hamas disarmament and IDF withdrawal.Aid into Gaza remains severely limited, and, in a key obstacle to any reconstruction efforts, there has been no change in the highly restrictive list of “dual-use” items that are banned, which include almost anything made of metal, including metal tent poles.“Israel is continuing to encroach on Gaza territory with the yellow line going further west. People are still being killed, buildings are still being demolished,” said Sam Rose, the acting Gaza director of the UN relief agency, Unrwa. “It seems we’ve kind of fallen into a pattern of managing the conflict, or managing the post-conflict, in a way we never thought we would.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationGazaDonald TrumpUS politicsPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.Meanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioningIndiaas the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.Modi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raisedserious concernsabout India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”View image in fullscreenA visitor looks at a Jio intelligence bot on display at Bharat Mandapam, one of the venues for the AI Impact Summit in Delhi.Photograph: Bhawika Chhabra/ReutersView image in fullscreenDelhi commuters walk past a hoarding advertising the summit.Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty ImagesSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.Indian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.If a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.India’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”Safety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi at the inauguration of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in Delhi on 16 February.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”One of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”But the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.Companies such asGoogleare focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”Google’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)IndiaNarendra ModiComputingSouth and central AsiaGoogleOpenAInewsShareReuse this content"

It must fall on perpetrators and on the companies that enable harm.”The prime minister said that institutional misogyny being “woven into the fabric of our institutions” meant the problem had not been taken seriously enough. “Too often, misogyny is excused, minimised or ignored. The arguments of women are dismissed as exaggerated or ‘one-offs’. That culture creates permission,” Starmer wrote.Government sources said they expected to give the new powers to Ofcom to enforce by the summer and companies will be legally required to remove this content no more than 48 hours after it is flagged to them.View image in fullscreenElon Musk’s Grok AI tool has sparked fury over the creation of sexual images that it facilitates.Photograph: Pablo Vera/AFP/Getty ImagesPlatforms including social media companies and pornography sites that fail to act could face fines of up to 10% of their qualifying worldwide revenue or having their services blocked in the UK.Victims would be able to flag the images either directly with tech firms or with Ofcom – which would trigger an alert across multiple platforms, according to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.Ofcom would be responsible for enforcing the ban on the images, with the aim to remove the onus on victims to need to report the same image potentially thousands of times as it is continually reposted.The media regulator will be told to explore ways for “revenge porn” images to have a digital watermark to allow them to be automatically flagged every time they are reposted.Internet providers will also be given new guidance on how to block hosting for rogue sites who specialise in hosting nonconsensual real or AI-generated explicit content.The Grok “nudification” tool that sparked an outcry in early January saw ministers threaten to banXif it did not act. About 6,000 bikini demands were being made to the chatbot every hour, according to analysis conducted for the Guardian, with many requests made to create images of women bent over or wearing just dental floss.But there has also been a rise in recent years of nonconsensual real or deepfake images being used to blackmail young women and men,which charities have linked to a number of suicides.Starmer said the horror stories of women and girls who saw intimate images spread across the internet was “the type of story that, as a parent, makes your heart drop to your stomach”.“Too often, those victims have been left to fight alone – chasing action site to site, reporting the same material again and again, only to see it reappear elsewhere hours later,” the prime minister said. “That is not justice. It is failure. And it is sending a message to the young people of this country that women and girls are a commodity to be used and shared.”Creating or sharing nonconsensual intimate images will also become a “priority offence” under the Online Safety Act, giving it the same level of seriousness as child abuse images or terrorism. The law does not require platforms to independently identify nonconsensual intimate imagery, but just to remove these images when they are flagged.Google, Meta, X and others already do this for child sexual abuse content through a process called hash matching – which assigns videos a unique digital signature that can be matched against databases of abusive content. And while the 48-hour timeline is brief, India has recentlymandatedthat social media companies remove some deepfake content in three hours.Abusers using AI and digital tech to attack and control women, charity warnsRead more“I think that 48 hours is certainly possible, to be honest with you,” said Anne Craanen, who researches online misogyny at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.“The problem is, it may not necessarily incentivise a quicker response rate from companies. But 48 hours is longer than the timeframe for the removal of other types of content, such as terrorist content in the EU.”Craanen added that there are already existinginitiativesto use hash matching to protect victims of intimate abuse; although it can be challenging getting different tech platforms to coordinate among themselves, so that an abusive video uploaded to Facebook, for example, is automatically detected on Reddit.Hash matching is not a perfect technology, Craanen emphasised, and can be circumvented. Terrorist groups, for example, often add emojis or small alterations to videos already hashed as terrorist content, thus making them unrecognisable to hash matching systems.The advent of AI tools and AI deepfakes will make this problem worse, allowing nonconsensual intimate images and other content to be quickly altered and spread around the internet, Craanen said, evading attempts to quickly detect it with tools such as hash matching. In a moment like the January Grok bikinification crisis, some abuse might be impossible to reign in.While the law appears to apply to all tech platforms, including “rogue websites” that fall outside the reach of the Online Safety Act, there are questions as to how it could apply on encrypted messaging services such asWhatsAppand Signal.In his article, Starmer said he was also determined to challenge misogyny in government and in politics, after several weeks where the prime minister has faced criticism for the appointment of Peter Mandelson as US ambassadordespite knowing about his friendship with the disgraced financierand child sex offender Jeffery Epstein. Mandelson was fired after new revelations about the closeness of their friendship.2:23Mandelson ‘lied repeatedly’ over Epstein links and betrayed Britain, Starmer says – videoThe prime minister is also facing a row over the appointment of a new cabinet secretary, Antonia Romeo,tipped to be the Home Office permanent secretary, who was cleared of bullying allegations nine years ago but remains a divisive figure in the civil service. Some of her defenders have said the criticism of Romeo is based on sexist double-standards.Starmer suggested he wanted to appoint more women to senior leadership roles in government and said he was “determined to transform the culture of government: to challenge the structures that still marginalise women’s voices”.“And it’s why I believe that simply counting how many women hold senior roles is not enough,” he said. “What matters is whether their views carry weight and lead to change.”Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsSocial mediaXInternetGrok AIElon MuskKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

However, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday that it had seen an email to claimants from their legal team which said UCL had agreed to pay £21m to settle the lawsuit.Neither UCL nor lawyers representing the students would confirm the figure, but it is likely to send shock waves through the university sector, which is already facing severe financial challenges.Pre-action claim letters have been sent to 36 universities in England and Wales, including Bath, Bristol, Cardiff, Exeter, Imperial College London, Leeds, Liverpool and Warwick, but more institutions could find themselves targeted.Shimon Goldwater, partner at Asserson solicitors, and Adam Zoubir, partner at Harcus Parker solicitors, who are jointly representing students, said: “As the terms of the settlement between the claimants and UCL are confidential, we are unable to make any comment beyond what we have stated previously.“However, we can confirm that, since the UCL settlement was announced, approximately 30,000 additional claimants who attended universities during the pandemic have joined Student Group Claim. We continue to advance the next stage of the litigation on behalf of affected students.”The legal action is being brought under consumer law, which states that where a consumer pays for a service but is provided with a different service of lower value, they may be entitled to compensation.Lawyers argue that students paid annual tuition fees for in-person teaching and full access to facilities, but Covid restrictions meant their courses moved online and campuses were closed for significant periods.Fees for online degree courses are typically 25-50% less than those for traditional in-person courses, and the students’ lawyers maintain their clients are owed “fair financial compensation”.Dr Michael Spence, UCL president and provost, said last week: “Covid-19 created disruption across society, and universities were no exception. Throughout the pandemic we provided clear routes for students to seek redress, and many secured compensation through those established processes.“This resolution enables us to focus on our core mission of delivering world-leading research and education.”Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesHigher educationStudent experienceStudentsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the state department gave its official backing to the deal.However, in a post on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, the US president wrote: “Our relationship with the United Kingdom is a strong and powerful one, and it has been for many years, but prime minister Starmer is losing control of this important island by claims of entities never known of before. In our opinion, they are fictitious in nature.”Trump added that if Iran did not make a peace deal with the US, “it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia”, as well as RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, to “eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime – an attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly countries”.“Prime minister Starmer should not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia, by entering a tenuous, at best, 100-year lease,” the US president continued.“This land should not be taken away from the UK and, if it is allowed to be, it will be a blight on our great ally. We will always be ready, willing and able to fight for the UK, but they have to remain strong in the face of wokeism, and other problems put before them.”Last month, the US president had described ceding sovereignty as an “act of great stupidity”.His latest statement comes only a day after the US Department of State said it “supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago”.When asked about Trump’s latest social media post on Wednesday evening, his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: “The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration. It’s coming straight from the horse’s mouth.”The UK’s shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, said Trump had “once again publicly rebuked Keir Starmer and his government over their ill-judged, unnecessary and expensive Chagos surrender. This is an utter humiliation for Starmer.”The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said Trump’s “flip-flopping” on the issue showed why Starmer’s approach was “doomed to fail”.“Britain can’t rely on the US while Trump is in the White House,” he said. “It’s time to strengthen our ties with allies we can depend on, starting with our neighbours in Europe.”A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The deal to secure the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia military is crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe.“The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base.”On Wednesday, British authorities issued removal orders againstfour Chagossians who landed this weekon a remote atoll in the Chagos Archipelago in an attempt to complicate British plans to transfer the territory.The four landed on Monday on Île du Coin, part of the Peros Banhos atoll, with more expected to join them in what would be a permanent settlement.The removal orders seen by Reuters, addressed to them individually, were issued by a British Indian Ocean Territory immigration official and stated they are unlawfully present in the territory and will be removed.It warned that breaching the order by returning would be a criminal offence punishable with up to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of £3,000 ($4,060).The UK’s deal is opposed by some Chagossians, who accuse Mauritius of decades of neglect. Mauritius has denied the accusations.Up to 2,000 Chagossians were forcibly removed from the archipelago in the 1960s and 1970s and resettled mainly in Mauritius and Britain. Many want the right to return to their homeland.The UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination has urged Britain and Mauritius not to ratify the 2025 agreement, saying it risks perpetuating historical rights violations.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsnewsShareReuse this content"

Based on Colbert’s comments, CBS had faced criticism for “corporate capitulation”, as the lone Democrat on the FCC, Anna M Gomez, put it, for enforcing the rule even before the network had received a complaint.But Carr told reporters that the FCC was simply enforcing the rules on the books. “If you have a legally qualified candidate on, you have to give comparable air time to all other legally qualified candidates, and we’re going to apply that law,” he said. “There was no censorship here at all.”Networks can request exceptions for what are called bona fide news interviews – but Carr said that CBS and ABC’s parent company, Disney, had not done so. Late-night and daytime shows had previously operated under the assumption that host-conducted interviews with politicians would qualify for the exception, based on past precedent.A day after his initial broadside against his bosses, Colbert on Tuesday night harshly criticized a statement released by the network that contested his version of events. In the end, Colbert aired the interview – but only on YouTube, where it has piled up nearly 6.1m views by the time of publication, far greater than the average traditional television viewership for the Late Show. The controversy has also been a boon for Talarico’s campaign,which has said it raised $2.5min the 24 hours since Colbert’s initial comments.On Wednesday, Carr also confirmed to the Guardian that the FCC had opened an enforcement action into ABC’s the View over an appearance Talarico made on the program earlier in the month. He declined to provide further comment on the nature of the investigation.“Every single broadcaster in this country has an obligation to be responsible for the programming that they choose to air, and they’re responsible whether it complies with FCC rules or not, and if it doesn’t, those individual broadcasters are also going to have a potential liability,” Carr said.But, in her own remarks, Gomez took a different approach. “This equal time rule issue is just one of a long pattern of this administration using the FCC to go after content it doesn’t like,” she said in response to a question from the Guardian. “What you are seeing is using and weaponizing our enforcement process in order to pressure broadcasters to self-censor.”Colbert, whose show ends in May, said it was “really surprising” that CBS had not consulted him on the statement it released on Tuesday afternoon, which he said seemed to be written by a panel of lawyers. At the end of his segment, Colbert picked up a printed copy of the statement as if it was pet waste.“Here’s where I do want to tell the lawyers how to do their jobs: they know damn well that every word of my script last night was approved by CBS lawyers who, for the record, approve every script that goes on the air,” Colbert told viewers. “They told us the language they wanted me to use to describe that equal time exception. So, I don’t know what this is about.”While it’s unusual for a network host to criticize their employer, Colbert said he did not wish to start a war with CBS – though he did take a shot at the network.“For the record, I’m not even mad,” he said. “I really don’t want an adversarial relationship with the network. I’ve never had one. I’m just so surprised that this giant global corporation would not stand up to these bullies.”Gigi Sohn, who served as counselor to then-FCC chair Tom Wheeler during Barack Obama’s administration, said she was less concerned about the equal time rule than about what she fears is unequal enforcement of it to crack down on liberal media opposition to Trump.“My feeling is that ifStephen Colbertis going to give James Talarico 20 minutes to basically give a campaign speech, then CBS should provide equal opportunity,” she told the Guardian in an interview. “In theory, I don’t oppose what he’s doing. What I worry about is that it’s going to be unevenly unenforced.”Sohn also said that the onus was on rival candidates, not the FCC, to request and pursue the equal time opportunity.“It’s not for the FCC to go around sniffing around what The View did three months ago,” Sohn said. “[Carr] has a tendency to start his own investigations when nobody is complaining. If Carr sets his enforcement bureau out to find liberal bias shows and starts to go after them, that’s not how the equal opportunities rule is supposed to work.”Carr ended his comments to reporters with an attack on Colbert, who has relentlessly mocked him on his show. Carr said that Colbert sees that, with the cancellation of his show, his time in the limelight is “coming to an end”.“That’s got to be a difficult time for him. I get it,” he said. “But that doesn’t change the facts of what happened here.”Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertCBSUS television industryTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The US saw a decline of $1.2bn, or a 5.5% drop, in tourism revenue from September 2024 to September 2025, according to the report.“We need immigrant workers. They’re an important part of our workforce. They’re my members, they’re my neighbors, and the way they’ve been treated in this time is really abhorrent,” said Wade Lüneburg, political director for Unite Here Local 17 in Minneapolis, which represents 6,000 workers in Minnesota, including workers at the Minneapolis-St Paul international airport.Because of the federal government’s immigration crackdown, “many of our members have been afraid to go to work,” Lüneburg said. Sixteen airport workers were detained by immigration enforcement earlier this year, Lüneburg said. “These are workers that are authorized to work and passed TSA background checks,” he added.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the White House did not comment on these members being taken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Even as Minnesota seeks to recover from Operation Metro Surge, Trump’s immigration policies – from cancelling temporary protected status,expandingtravel visa bans, to havingtourists detained– have driven a slump in tourism across the US.International visitors to the US declined by 2.5 million in 2025, even as international tourism increased around the world, according to Unite Here’s report.Lüneburg said regional declines of Canadian tourism to Minnesota drove a15% declinein overall international air travelers to Minnesota in 2025 and a recentplungein Canadians attending the World Junior Hockey championships. Small businesses in Minneapolis reportedly lost up to$81min revenue in January 2026.“The economic ramifications of what is happening are much further-reaching than just to immigrants and their families, as horrific as that is,” said Gwen Mills, president of Unite Here, during a panel introducing the report last week. “The scenes of violence on the streets in our major cities, the anti-immigrant rhetoric, the fearmongering, it’s discouraging domestic travel, it’s discouraging foreign visitors from coming to the United States.”The slowdown is being felt in other cities. In 2025, a record number of restaurantsclosedin Washington DC while restaurant openings slowed by 30%. Meanwhile, tourism in Las Vegas dropped7.5%in 2025.Shaleah Taylor, a guest room attendant in Las Vegas, said in the report that “you can feel that business has slowed down.”“People are spending less, and some of my co-workers who depend on tips are seeing a real drop,” Taylor said.Moana Molly, a hotel housekeeper in Atlantic City, New Jersey, said duringthe panelthat several co-workers left due to the immigration crackdown, increasing the workload for herself and the remaining workers.“We don’t have the staffing that we need and nobody’s applying,” said Molly.A July 2025reportby the Economic Policy Institute found Trump’s deportation goals of 4 million people would result in job losses of 3.3 million for immigrants and 2.6 million for US-born workers.But the policies are creating fear among US citizens, too. Greg Barney, a line cook at St Anselm in Washington DC, said there was a significant drop-off in visitors to the restaurant.“I wasn’t afraid about being scooped up myself, but a lot of my close friends were, and everyone, all my co-workers, regardless of whether they were born here or not, could feel that fear and that tension, and it was hard on all of us,” Barney said during the panel.Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, told the Guardian that “if there was any correlation between rampant illegal immigration and a good economy, Biden would have had a booming economy.“Removing these criminals from the streets makes communities safer and more welcoming for business owners, customers, and for tourists,” she added.In an email to the Guardian, Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, cited an article that pointed to a 8.9% youth unemployment rate in 2024, saying “there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessTrump administrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationUS politicsHospitality industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Wexner, who hired Epstein in 1991 to manage his money, has insisted that he was not aware of Epstein’s abuse when he worked with the financier.The Wall Street Journalreportedin 2019 that Wexner was integral to Epstein’s success in finance, with Epstein reportedly earning $200m from the deal.“To my enormous embarrassment and regret I, like many others, was duped by a world-class con man,” Wexner continued.Several Democrats on the oversight committeespokeabout Wexner’s closed-door testimony during a midday break and said that questioning, which is taking place at Wexner’s Ohio home, will continue throughout the afternoon. They also said no Republican members of Congress were present, though some Republican representatives’ staffers attended.Ranking Democrat Robert Garcia said that “there are many, many questions” they want to ask Wexner.“As this day moves forward, we are here because we want to talk to anyone that has information about Jeffrey Epstein andGhislaine Maxwell’s … abuse and trafficking of women and girls,” Garcia said. “There is no single person that was more involved in providing Jeffrey Epstein with the financial support to commit his crimes than Les Wexner.”California representative Dave Min said that Wexner had claimed not to know about Epstein’s crimes.“I can basically say that he has basically alleged that he saw no evil, heard no evil, despite being in the room with Jeffrey Epstein over and over and over – and it’s really just not credible,” Min said.“I realize he’s an elderly gentleman. Memories fade, but the reputation of Jeffrey Epstein is very clear. Everyone around Jeffrey Epstein knew exactly what he’s up to, and to spend that much time, to give that much trust, to Jeffrey Epstein, and then to say, ‘I don’t remember seeing any young girls. I didn’t hear anything about Jeffrey Epstein,’ it really is just not plausible,” Min said.Wexner has insisted that he cut ties with Epstein in 2007, before Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state-level prostitution charges in 2008, andclaimedthat Epstein “misappropriated” $46m of his assets.Wexner is among several people with close ties to Epstein to whom Congress has issued subpoenas. Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping traffic teen girls for Epstein,refusedto answer questions during her deposition last week.Maxwell’s attorney, David Oscar Markus,saidin a statement that she invoked her right to remain silent because of her ongoing legal fight against her conviction and claimed Maxwell “is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump”.The oversight committee also subpoenaed Bill and Hillary Clinton, who will sit for closed-door depositions next week. The former president has said publicly that he flew on Epstein’s airplane in the early 2000s for humanitarian work, but insisted he never visited Epstein’s private island.The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress in November of last year, mandated that the justice department release all investigative files into Epstein within 30 days. To date, it has released several tranches of documents, and a sprawling 3.5m page release on 30 January, but transparency advocates have insisted that potentially millions of pages remain undisclosed.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He sought roughly $10m in damages.“Halim does not plausibly allege that reasonable consumers are deceived by boneless wings, so he has failed to state a plausible claim for relief,” the judge wrote.Tharp noted that “boneless wings” are “not a niche product for which a consumer would need to do extensive research to figure out the truth” but said that instead, “‘boneless wings’ was a common term that had existed for over two decades.Tharp described boneless wings as “essentially chicken nuggets: pieces of chicken breast meat, deep-fried and tossed in whatever sauce or dry seasoning the customer wants”.Tharp wrote that though Halim has “standing to bring the claim because he plausibly alleged economic injury” he “does not plausibly allege that reasonable consumers are fooled by Buffalo Wild Wings’ use of the term ‘boneless wings’”.According to the ruling, Buffalo Wild Wings had argued that a reasonable consumer “would not be misled by the term ‘boneless wings;’ because context clues make clear that the nuggets cannot be made of wing meat”.Tharp, in his order, wrote that “words can have multiple meanings” adding that “Indeed, the term ‘buffalo wing’ refers to the type of sauce on the wing, rather than indicating it is made of buffalo meat”.He wrote later in the order that “a reasonable consumer would not think that BWW’s boneless wings were truly deboned chicken wings, reconstituted into some sort of Franken-wing”.Halim purchased the boneless wings from Buffalo Wild Wings in January 2023, and filed his lawsuit against the company on 10 March of that year, arguing that the name and description of the boneless wings “leads reasonable consumers to believe the products are actually chicken wings.”The product, Halim argued, is “more akin, in composition, to a chicken nugget rather than a chicken wing”, and said it was “false advertising” that “should not be permitted”.Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Buffalo Wild Wingsposted a statementon social media that read: “It’s true. Our boneless wings are all white meat chicken. Our hamburgers contain no ham. Our buffalo wings are 0% buffalo.”In his order on Tuesday, Tharp noted that Halim had asked for the opportunity to amend his complaint. Tharp has given Halim until 20 March to do so.Attorneys for both sides did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Buffalo Wild Wings also did not immediately respond.Explore more on these topicsIllinoisRestaurantsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House said Japan would also invest in a deepwater crude oil export facility off the coast of Texas, and a synthetic industrial diamond manufacturing site.The projects are the first batch of the $550bn Japan committed to invest under atrade deal with the USlast year. In return, Trump agreed to reduce US tariffs on Japanese exports including cars.“The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, tariffs,” Trump claimed on Tuesday. His controversial trade strategy alarmed economists in the US, who warned it risked exacerbating inflation.Most of the first wave of investment will go towards the plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, which will generate 9.2 gigawatts of electricity each year, according to the administration. It will be operated by SB Energy, which is a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group.The industrial diamond manufacturing site in Georgia, valued at about $600m, is designed to ensure the US can fully produce all the synthetic diamond grit – a critical material for advanced manufacturing and semiconductors – it requires domestically. The project “will end our foolish dependence on foreign sources”, said Trump.China controls much of the critical minerals market, dominating the world’s mining and processing of rare earths that are essential across a wide array of industries, from oil refining to car manufacturing.Beijing has not hesitated to wield this dominance, imposing restrictions on global imports of its rare earths. Such curbs were at the heart of aneconomic spat with Washingtonlast year. While Trump and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, reached a deal last October which reduced tensions in the short term, US officials have repeatedly spoken of the need to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals.Beijing has started in recent months to restrict some exports of rare earths to Japan, amid a row with Tokyo over Taiwan. Takaichi angered Chinese officials in November 2025 by suggestingJapan could become militarily involvedin the event of an attempted Chinese invasion of the self-governing island.“We will no longer rely on foreign supply for this essential material,” Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, said of the planned industrial diamond project.“Japan is providing the capital,” added Lutnick. “The infrastructure is being built in the United States. The proceeds are structured so Japan earns its return, and America gains strategic assets, expanded industrial capacity, and strengthened energy dominance.”Japan reported on Wednesday that its exports rose almost 17% in January, driven in part by a sharp rise in exports to China despite the current tensions.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeJapanChinaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyAsia PacificCritical mineralsnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the decline,public approvalof labor unions has increased in recent years. Approval of unions now ranges between 67% and 71%, according to Gallup, levels last reached in the late 1950s and early 1960s.“The secondTrump administrationlaunched the most vicious attack on public sector union workers since the Reagan era. While the assault’s full effect remains to be seen, the numbers from 2025 leave room for cautious optimism,” said Hayley Brown, a researcher at the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), in a statement on the union density increase.The Trump administration is pushing tocancelcollective bargaining agreements forabout 1 millionfederal workers, which would offset these slight gains.Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute and former chief economist off the US Department of Labor, noted the increase of 463,000 workers represented by a union is the highest number in the US in 16 years.“This is an extremely welcome departure from prior years’ declines,” Shierholzpostedon Bluesky. “In a time of fear, uncertainty, and hardship, workers are realizing they are better off in a union. Workers are exerting control over their jobs and their lives through unionization. This is especially clear in the federal government, where unionization surged despite unprecedented attacks.”She cited the increases in 2025 to “years of sustained effort. Organizing and winning union elections is a lengthy process, and the groundwork laid over many years definitely contributed to this year’s gains.”Explore more on these topicsUS unionsUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.Meanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioningIndiaas the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.Modi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raisedserious concernsabout India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”View image in fullscreenA visitor looks at a Jio intelligence bot on display at Bharat Mandapam, one of the venues for the AI Impact Summit in Delhi.Photograph: Bhawika Chhabra/ReutersView image in fullscreenDelhi commuters walk past a hoarding advertising the summit.Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty ImagesSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.Indian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.If a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.India’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”Safety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi at the inauguration of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in Delhi on 16 February.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”One of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”But the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.Companies such asGoogleare focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”Google’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)IndiaNarendra ModiComputingSouth and central AsiaGoogleOpenAInewsShareReuse this content"

No one in red and white will want to remember this freezing cold night at Molineux – but it will live long in the memory of Wolves’ Tom Edozie, whose debut goal was a just punishment for thePremier Leagueleaders’ ineptitude.Arsenal are five points clear of Manchester City, having played a game more, and will feel their icy breath on their shoulders after winning twice in their past seven matches.When Bukayo Saka headed Arsenal into a fifth-minute lead it felt like a procession was coming, but as the temperature dropped so did the Gunners’ performance. Piero Hincapié struck a second to calm the jangling away‑end nerves and few could have anticipated the league’s worst team fighting back. A stunning Hugo Bueno strike reduced the deficit and changed a few minds before Edozie came off the bench to make a name for himself in Wolverhampton and east Manchester.Arteta accepts Arsenal ‘have to blame ourselves’ after blowing lead at WolvesRead moreWhen ahead Arsenal were still playing below their maximum against a Wolves side trying to make the night as difficult as possible. Even with that mindset the comparative starting lineups provided evidence of the differing qualities. While Wolves started with Adam Armstrong, a January signing from the Championship, Arsenal had the £64m Viktor Gyökeres leading the line but it was hard to tell the difference.Often games against mediocre teams in poor conditions are, in cliched circles, a good test of a potential title winner and Arsenal failed it. With the rain swirling in an arctic wind, Arsenal rightly did not look concerned by their rock-bottom opposition, controlling the ball in the early stages. Saka, moving into a more central role as a No 10, further proved his versatility with a smart run and then a header to score from a Declan Rice cross.This silenced the home crowd, removing any optimism they had of an upset. Wolves were passive in their play, drawing Arsenal on to them with a second goal looking inevitable, but like the temperature the Gunners’ performance was dipping. Noni Madueke, not popular in these partsfor calling the city “shit”, tested José Sá, who spilled his shot before the danger was removed with Gabriel Martinelli lurking.Arsenal were afforded plenty of space as Wolves stayed in a low block, without an aggressive press in the first half. With so much time on the ball, they should have created more clearcut chances but Sá was left untroubled. The isolated Gyökeres received no service, allowing him to ponder if wearing a short-sleeved shirt was the right decision.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka heads Arsenal into an early lead at Molineux, but there was plenty more drama to come.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesWolves failed to have a single shot in the opening half‑hour, which was no surprise to many considering it was a match comprising the worst attack against the best defence. As the rain turned to snow, the home support started to appreciate the resistance shown to keep the deficit at one. Tolu Arokodare, on as a substitute, won a grappling contest with William Saliba to give hope that there was some fight in the Wolves ranks.It was upon Arsenal to quell the resurgence, which was more evident in the stands than on the pitch. For so long they had enjoyed a straightforward night but there was more aggression in Wolves as the break approached and Arsenal were beginning to lose duels and have their attacks stifled.After barely having a kick, Armstrong reminded Arsenal they were in a match with a smart turn and rising shot which went over the bar. It was a sign of an intent that had been lacking on both sides but increased the noise inside Molineux, as supporters on all sides acknowledged their heroes needed them.Arsenal were forced into action and it took something a bit different. Hincapié moved up from left‑back to get between the Wolves defenders, allowing him to reach a precise pass from Gabriel Magalhães into the channel before slotting past Sá for his first Arsenal goal. The assistant referee belatedly put his flag up, only for the video assistant referee to overrule him, giving the away end a second excuse to get warm.If that was supposed to kill the game off no one told Hugo Bueno, who popped up on the right wing. He cut in and struck a curling shot into the top corner, much to the surprise of everyone.View image in fullscreenHugo Bueno’s curling shot sparks Wolves’ fightback.Photograph: MB Media/Getty ImagesWolves unsettled Arsenal and found ways to hurt them. Arteta knew the importance of a win, spending the night in the freezing cold on the touchline, becoming covered in a cocktail of rain, sleet and snow. He could not have been too concerned when Edozie came on with six minutes to play for the first senior action of his career, but Arsenal could not cope with the pressure.Edozie was more effective than the weather in sullying Arsenal’s mood. His shot hit the post and went in off Riccardo Calafiori, who was on as late substitute. It was a goal that provided what could be a pivotal moment in the title race.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 30-year-old American surged to victory in the women’s slalom on a sun-splashed Wednesday in the Dolomites with a two-run time of 1min 39.10sec, becoming the first US skier to win three Olympic gold medals.Switzerland’s Camille Rast, the reigning world champion and only woman to have beaten Shiffrin in her signature discipline this season, came in a yawning 1.50sec behind for the silver – the largest winning margin in any Olympic alpine skiing event since 1998 – while Anna Swenn-Larsson of Sweden took the bronze.

She managed to build on her early lead, becoming the second woman to win the Olympic slalom more than once after Switzerland’s Vreni Schneider. The Vail native stared in disbelief at the clock after gliding through the line before acknowledging the roaring crowd and finding her mother and coach, Eileen, near the finish area.“The skiing is what I cared about and, of course, to medal and [to win] gold. That’s a dream come true,” ­Shiffrin told NBC. “But at some point this week, I just said: ‘Stop dreaming, just ski.’ I’m so happy to be able to do the right thing in the right moment.”View image in fullscreenMikaela Shiffrin (centre) celebrates with silver medallist Camille Rast (left) of Switzerland and Sweden’s Anna Swenn Larsson (right), who won bronze.Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesShiffrin’s Olympic ledger stripped of context – slalom gold as an 18-year-old prodigy in Sochi, giant slalom gold and combined silver in ­Pyeongchang – would be career-defining for most. But she had failed to win a medal in the six races she entered in ­Beijing four years ago, including three ­shocking DNFs.While she rebounded to win a fifth overall World Cup title across all disciplines the following year, there were some around the circuit – includingShiffrin– who wondered if a harrowing crash two years ago during a World Cup race in Killington, Vermont, had taken something out of her she would never get back.But she answered those questions with brio on Wednesday, becoming the oldest US woman to win a gold medal in alpine skiing 12 years after becoming the youngest. She has now won 58 of 72 slalom races when leading after the opening run, an 81% conversion rate that places her among the sport’s great closers.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsMikaela ShiffrinUS sportsSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

She filed the suit on Monday in Dallas County, Texas, and is seeking damages of more than $1m, according to attorney Ron Estefan.Per the lawsuit, Rice and Jones lived together in Victory Park, Texas, and Lee’s Summit, Missouri. Jones, in the lawsuit, claims Rice strangled her in December 2023, and alleged that between 2023 and 2025, he “grabbed, choked, strangled, pushed, thrown, scratched, hit and headbutted Ms Jones, as well as hit her with inanimate objects”.According to the lawsuit, Rice displayed violent behaviors, including “throwing objects, destroying property, punching walls, and breaking furniture, as well as locking her out in the middle of the night”.As part of the damages in the lawsuit, Jones claimed physical pain and mental anguish, physical impairment, disfigurement, previous and future medical care and loss of earnings.One of Jones’s attorneys declined comment to ESPN. Rice, who has not been charged criminally in this matter, and his agents had not responded to attempts by the Athletic and ESPN for comment.“The club is aware [of the lawsuit] and remains in communication with the National Football League,” the Chiefs said in a statement Wednesday.Jonesposted photoson her Instagram account last month that appeared to show signs of physical abuse.“I’m so tired of keeping quiet I’m so tired of protecting his image,” Jones wrote in a since-deleted post. “I’ve been through too much in the span of 8 years and I’ve had ENOUGH! I’ve dealt with abuse for years, me and this man decided to break up a couple months ago and since then it’s been nothing but hell.“He literally left us in Kansas and I had to beg him to send money so that I could drive to Texas with my kids and all our stuff,” she wrote. “We have an agreement because of everything he’s put me through and he still doesn’t follow it. He’s now trying to remove me and my kids from our home for no apparent reason. I’ve known this man for YEARS. He tries to put on this persona like he’s dad of the year. He does the bare minimum and I have to beg for that. I’ve protected his image too long and I’m done doing that. It’s time to protect my peace, protect my children and stand up for myself.“TheNFLsaid on Wednesday that the matter “remains under review.“Rice, 25, started the 2025 season by servinga six-game suspensionfor violating the league’s personal conduct policy stemming from his role in a multi-car crash in Dallas that left several people injured during the 2024 season. He pleaded guilty in district court to two third-degree felony charges – collision involving serious bodily injury and racing on a highway causing bodily injury.The crash involved six vehicles. Rice and four of his friends didn’t check on those injured and fled on foot before police arrived.Rice was sentenced to five years of deferred probation and 30 days in jail. He also was required to pay more than $115,000 in restitution to the victims of the crash.Explore more on these topicsKansas City ChiefsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

José Mourinho: in favour of restrained celebrations.José Mourinho, once of the poke‑in‑the‑eye, sprint‑down‑the‑touchline, accost‑the‑referee-in-the-car-park school of footballing expression: now apparently very big on showing respect to the game. Well, it seems like we’ve all been on a journey here.“I told him the biggest person in the history of this club was Black,” Mourinho recounted when asked about his conversation withVinícius Júnioron Tuesday night. “This club, the last thing that it is, is racist.”Mourinho accused of gaslighting for response to Vinícius’ allegation of racismRead moreAnd doubtless these words will have been a profound source of comfort to Vinícius in his lowest moment, having been insultedon the pitchby an opposition player in a Champions League playoff.After all who among us, having been racially abused in a public place, has not turned to the memory of Eusébio, and felt all that residual resentment and ambient anger subside in an instant? With Benfica on the verge of Champions League elimination, knocked out of both cups and seven points back in the Primeira Liga, perhaps Mourinho’s glittering future career as a trauma therapist is even closer than we think.“A stadium where Vinícius plays, something happens, always,” Mourinho said after Benfica’s 1-0 defeat byReal Madrid. And remember: this guy is a master communicator, right? A man who chooses his words with incredible precision and a brilliant strategic mind, right? That’s why he’s “box office”. That’s why, a decade after he was objectively good, so many want him back in the Premier League.But of course Mourinho is the symptom rather than the virus here. The substanceof this caserests on whether Gianluca Prestianni really did call Vinícius “a monkey”, or whether – as Prestianni claims – the whole thing is just an unfortunate misunderstanding, albeit one that could surely have been avoided had Prestianni not inconveniently covered his mouth with his shirt as he spoke.Naturally, there’s going to be a lot of equivocation here. You’re going to say: what if it wasn’t actually a racist incident at all? You’re going to say: what if Prestianni was simply covering his mouth to say something entirely innocuous? You’re going to say: show me the smoking gun, your irrefutable proof. You’re going to say: it’s a heated situation, things get uttered in the moment, think about the career and reputation of this angelic Argentinian kid being dragged through the mud.I believe Vinícius when he says he was racially abused because, unless he has grossly misinterpreted it across a distance of about four feet, to accept any other explanation is to accept a nonsensical, absurd sequence of events. That somehow a player who has spent his whole career in Europefending off racismhas somehow invented this episode for shits and giggles. That he has maliciously imagined what was said to him. That he would willingly walk off the pitch, and halt a Champions League tie being broadcast across the world, on the basis of a fiction.View image in fullscreenVinícius Júnior has spent his career in Europe fending off racism.Photograph: José Sena Goulão/EPAAnd yet at the time of writing, the only person to have received any tangible, meaningful punishment for the events that followed Vinícius’s winning goal is Vinícius himself, booked for the exuberance of his celebration. “The problem in this situation is that Vinícius Júnior has not helped himself,” the former referee Mark Clattenburg said on Amazon. “He has made this difficult for the referee.”At which point it is worth recalling the words ofthe Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffelast week. In an interview with Sky News, Ratcliffe stated that the UK had been “colonised by immigrants”, citing incorrect population data to back up his view. A lot of the subsequent commentary focused correctly on the diversity of the United squad and the city of Manchester itself. But of course in so doing we end up in a familiar trap: the immigrant continually forced to justify their very existence, to defend their presence against a dominant narrative that seeks to position them as troublesome disruptors.I’m less interested here in the false division between “racists” and “non-racists”, a division that in any case is primarily concerned less with proscribing racist behaviour than legitimising anything else that fails to meet an arbitrary threshold. But some of the immediate reaction to the abuse of Vinícius felt telling in bleakly familiar ways. Not racist, but. Not condoning what was said, but. And ultimately, what a shame we have to talk about this, rather than the stuff that actually matters.There is a particular strain of football discourse that tends to regard racism as a reputational risk rather than a lived reality. That the true injustice is not so much the insult as the allegation. That the real victims are not the players who endure it, but the institutions forced to deny it and the neutral observers forced to talk about it. As if the correct response to abuse is strategic restraint. As if simple human dignity is conditional on decorum.In the meantime people who have no problem linking smaller personal aggressions to larger cultural forces when it comes to – say – phone thefts or sexual grooming, remain weirdly resistant to the idea that the tolerance of individual incidents can scale to a broader societal trend. Let’s defer to the Uefa panel, who will invariably conclude that it was one player’s word against another. Let’s just ask Grok whether it was racism.View image in fullscreenJim Ratcliffe’s controversial comments about immigration last week have only increased divisiveness.Photograph: Lucy North/PAThis is what links the comments of Mourinho and Ratcliffe and Clattenburg, as well as the many criticisms of Black players such as Jude Bellingham and Marcus Rashford: the insistence on perfect victims. Shall we all be good little immigrants? Not antagonise crowds, not claim benefits, not write seditious columns in the newspaper, not have difficult dads, not make defensive errors or go on the piss, not make things difficult for the referee, return respectfully to our own half after celebrating a goal? Will that save us? Will that help us win your approval?Mourinho’s invocation of Eusébio was interesting, although probably not in the way he intended. After all, Mourinho spent his early years under the right-wing dictatorship of António de Oliveira Salazar, during which Eusébio, the indisputable star of Portuguese football in the 1960s and 1970s, played an outsized role. For the regime’s advocates, Eusébio’s sporting success and integration into polite Portuguese society was an indicator of the essential benevolence of empire: a colonial exploit run along the lines of the “civilised” and the “indigenous”. As long as you kept your head down, spoke the language, practised Christianity, erased all traces of your African identity, you too could be edified by your contact with European civilisation.At a time when football’s anti-racist impulses have rarely felt more under threat – from the systematic online abuse of players to a men’s World Cup being held under an explicitly white supremacist regime – these questions feel more urgent than ever. Is this a sport genuinely invested in eradicating racism, or one that regards it as no more than an inconvenience, a distraction, a smudge on the business model?Eusébio was tolerated only to the extent that he kept scoring goals and kept his mouth shut. As Vinícius faces his latest gauntlet of lies and bad faith, it’s tempting to wonder whether anything has meaningfully changed.Explore more on these topicsVinícius JúniorJosé MourinhoReal MadridFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Remind you of anyone?Wed 18 Feb 2026 10.13 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 10.25 ESTShareDid British petrochemicals billionaire and Manchester United’s controlling minority owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, really mean itwhen he proclaimedto Sky News that “the UK is being colonized by immigrants”?Is Ratcliffe simply a gutter racist or actually making a cynical political play that may redound to his benefit down the line when Britain faces downyet another period of political upheavalas the country’s old factions continue to fracture? There’s reasonabledebate to be had there.There’s also a good point about whether even engaging with this sordid rhetoric puts an unfair onus on immigrants by forcing them to tout their contributions and accomplishments – andit, too, has been made. You may even ask the question of whether prefixing someone with a royally conferred honorific in recognition of all their good work insuperheating the planetmakes them feel untouchable.As far as soccer is concerned, however, the outcome of any of these discussions sort of doesn’t matter. Neither does Ratcliffe’s half-hearted walk-back of his comments in that actually-not-really-walking-it-back kind of way, doing the semantic I’m-sorry-if-you-were-offended non-apology. Nor does theswift backlash, or Manchester Uniteddistancingthemselves from the words of the man ostensibly running the club.Because the upshot is the same. The sport has taken another long stride towards total Trumpism. And perhaps its journey to that fetid place is now complete.David Squires on … Jim Ratcliffe’s comments and his need for some home truthsRead moreRatcliffe has been in the public eye more than long enough to know that, when he speaks, he not only represents himself but also his pollution empire and the privatized public good, United, that has wound up in his care. He has offered Bad Takes before, frombacking Brexittopromisingthat Ruben Amorim would serve out his three-year contract as United manager, and understands how they will be received. Still, he felt free to make his comments on immigrants before a TV camera and an audience of millions anyway.Set aside, for a moment, that a member of the English elite has an opinion on colonialism, and the fact that United’s senior men’s team alone currently counts 19 players from outside the UK. Ratcliffe plainly thinks that there are no longer any limits to what can be uttered out in the open without getting expelled from polite society, or indeed damaging the brand of one of the world’s most popular soccer clubs.In that sense, the sport remains in lockstep with our overclouded zeitgeist.Just an inch or so beneath its veneer of beauty, soccer is an odious sport. It has historically turned a blind eye to all manner of abuses. It will take money from anyone at all. It will make money in any way it can. Clubs embraced NFTs when everyone involved should have known they were a fad. Whatever brings in the money required to win games.The paranoid style has coursed through the sport for decades, but it’s been dialed up recently with Real Madrid TVgoing full tinfoil hat, while fans of every club appear to see any decision going against their teamas a global conspiracy. To the list of sins already containing grifts and intrigues and swindles we can add performative political incorrectness. Because that barrier has been broken through now, no matter the intentions or merits behind Ratcliffe’s words.US actions in Venezuela put the 2026 World Cup in disgraceful company | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreSound like any recent political movement you may have heard of?If soccer’s tribalism made its slow creep towards this toxicity somewhat inevitable, it was knowingly led there by its putative leader, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, and hisembrace of Donald Trump. Infantino’s kowtowing to Trump aligned soccer with the US president’s combativeness and scheming and nihilism from the top down. The generous view is that Infantino debased himself in the interests of pulling off a successful and maximally lucrative World Cup in North America in 2026, the better to safeguard his organization and the sport it stewards. But the outcome is all the same. And this trend will not be readily reversed.The thing that is likely to long outlast Trump’s hateful political career is the blanket permission he bestowed on people to let their asshole flags fly. The effects of this unspoken edict are readily discernible throughout everyday American life in the erosion of its common courtesies. People are a little meaner, a little angrier, displaying a kind of road rage that spills out of them long after they leave their cars.Whereas much of the soccer industry once took care to stay out of the politics of the day, hewing instead to more long-term values, many of the sport’s prominent figures have abandoned their studious apolitical stance. What was once ostensibly a gentleman’s game is now animated in no small part by grievance and wariness. The people in it feel less and less constrained in their behavior and speech, from the player verbally abusing the referee all the way up to the billionaire co-owner heaving up his anti-immigrant views for everyone to hear.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

The 12 years in between have been marked by brutal ups and downsBryan Armen Grahamin MilanWed 18 Feb 2026 16.18 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 18.07 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleAlot can happen in 12 years. If you’re Mikaela Shiffrin, as a teenager you can become theyoungest ever person to win the Olympic slalom, stack a couple more medals at the next Olympics, become themost successful World Cup skier of all timewith a record 108 victories, go 10 more Olympic races in a row over three Winter Games without reaching the podium, overcome the two biggest crashes of your career andsubsequent battleswith self-doubt and post-traumatic stress disorder and eroding trust in your own skiing, and then bring it all back homewith a second Olympic slalom gold.You can also lose your dad.Shiffrin, considered by many the greatest alpine skier in history, saw her incandescent career come full circle on Wednesday beneath the jagged limestone peaks above Cortina d’Ampezzo, winning her signature race by 1.50sec – an eternity in slalom racing and the largest winning margin in any Olympic alpine skiing event in nearly three decades – to endan eight-year medal droughtthat had started to overtake the conversation. In 2014, at the age of 18, she became the youngest US woman ever to win Olympic gold in alpine skiing. Now, in 2026, she’s the oldest at 30.Sports love clean and tidy narratives like these. The arc from teenage prodigy to veteran champion. The clean line from Sochi to Cortina. But grief is never clean. As the raw emotion bubbled over in Wednesday’s aftermath, a reflective Shiffrin described how winning her first Olympic gold sinceher father’s death in 2020did not feel like a continuation so much as starting over.Mikaela Shiffrin storms to stunning slalom gold to make Winter Olympic historyRead more“Everything in life that you do after you lose someone you love is like a new experience,” she said. “It’s like being born again. And I still have so many moments where I resist this.“I don’t want to be in life without my dad. And maybe today was the first time that I could actually accept this like reality. And instead of thinking I would be going in this moment without him, to take the moment to be silent with him. It was just a little bit more spiritual than I usually am, but I’m really grateful for that.”Jeff Shiffrin, an anesthesiologist and an avid recreational skier, was deeply involved in his daughter’s development from the beginning. But unlike many parents in the hyper-competitive world of elite youth sports, he was known for being calm, steady and perspective-driven. Shiffrin has often recalled how her father encouraged her to love skiing for its own sake. If she won, great. If she didn’t, well, that was part of the sport. The emphasis was always on effort, preparation and integrity.“Part of my journey through grief has been challenging because I don’t feel this thing that a lot of people talk about, this deep spiritual connection,” she said. “People talk about feeling the presence, and I haven’t felt it in that way. I feel connected to him in my thoughts and in talking about him.”For Shiffrin, moving forward wasn’t about resolving her loss but learning how to exist alongside it. For an athlete whose career has been built on precision and repetition, grief has offered no such structure. Some days feel manageable. Others feel impossible. The only constant, she said, is uncertainty.“The only thing life can guarantee is it’s not something you can expect,” she said. “I’ve had moments I didn’t think I would survive. And in the end I get to stand here and talk about a medal. Life is crazy. I’m very grateful for that right now.”That uncertainty had come to define her performance on the sport’s biggest stage. Fair or not, the narrative had hardened. She was great in World Cup races held mostly while America was asleep. Could she still do it under the most unforgiving spotlight?Shiffrin didn’t medal in any of the six races she entered at the Beijing Olympics four years ago,reaching the bottom of the mountainin only half of them. She bounced back to win a fifth overall World Cup title across all disciplines the next year. Butafter a devastating crashtwo years ago in Killington, Vermont, there were some around the sport – herself included – who openly wondered if she’d ever be the same.View image in fullscreenMikaela Shiffrin on her way to victory in Wednesday’s slalom.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesThose gnawing questions resurfaced in Cortina on her return to Olympic snow in last week’s team combined event. After Breezy Johnson crossed first in the downhill portion, all that stood between Shiffrin and a drought-busting medal was a single run in the slalom, where her glittering World Cup results this year – seven firsts and a second in eight starts – have already wrapped upher record-extending ninth season-long title. But Shiffrin was hesitant from the starter’s gate and finished 15th of 18 skiers, her worst result in a slalom race she has started and finished in 14 years. Across the pine-dark slopes above Cortina, she could practically hear the critics:It’s easy to be the GOAT in a sport that no one is watching most of the time.“I knew after the team combined that there would be some stories out there that would be really frustrating to look at,” she said. “These moments of challenge, you don’t necessarily get to avoid them. So I just didn’t look at what anyone was saying. I didn’t look at social media, I didn’t look at anything. I just talked with [my team] and kept reminding myself what was important was the moments between the start and the finish.”She performed better in Sunday’s giant slalom – the raceshe won eight years agoin Pyeongchang – skiing with renewed confidence and coming in 11th but only 0.30sec off the podium in an atypically tight contest. But Wednesday’s third and final event of her Olympic program, in the discipline that most embodies her brilliance, was Shiffrin’s last best chance of putting the doubts to rest.She overcame a brush with disaster on her opening run down the Olympia delle Tofane track when she clipped a gate, but recovered to cross with the largest first-run lead in an Olympic women’s slalom since 1960. As she attempted to go down for one of her customary naps between runs, her father’s reassuring presence was never far from her mind.“I sort of started to cry a little bit because I was thinking about my dad,” she said. “And then I was thinking about the fact that I actually can show up today and honestly say in the start gate that I have all the tools that are necessary to do my best skiing and to earn that moment.”After one more trip down the piste, the moment was all hers. Shiffrin is the first American skier to win three Olympic gold medals. The long wait between her slalom golds represents the longest gap between individual gold medals in the same event at the Winter Games. As she found her mother and coach, Eileen, for a long embrace next to the finish area, the weight of the journey seemed to lift all at once.A lot can happen in 12 years. Records fall. Doubts grow louder. Families are irrevocably changed. On Wednesday, Shiffrin did not close a circle so much as draw another line forward: two clean runs through the gates, one quiet moment at the finish, and the understanding that even the greatest careers are built not on certainty, but on showing up anyway.Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, both star-packed teams struggled in Wednesday’s men’s ice hockey quarter-finals.Quinn Hughes scored in overtime to put the US past Sweden 2-1 after giving up the tying goal to Mika Zibanejad with 91 seconds left in the third period. Dylan Larkin deflected Jack Hughes’ shot in for the only US goal in regulation.“Just relief,” Hughes said when asked about his emotions after the game.Meanwhile, Canada’s quarter-final was an even tighter affair. Nick Suzuki tied the game on a deflection with 3:27 left, Mitch Marner scored in overtime, and Canada avoided what would have been a stunning exit at the Olympics by rallying to beat the Czech Republic 4-3.“I never had a doubt, but it was getting a little nerve-racking,” defenseman Drew Doughty said.Canada fell behind with 7:42 remaining when Ondrej Palat scored off a pass from Martin Necas. The goal sent the Czech bench and fans into a wild celebration, but their excitement was short-lived.From cursing curlers to comeback: is Canada on the turnaround after slow Olympic start?Read moreSuzuki just about did it all on the tying goal, sending the puck out to the point to Devon Toews and then redirecting the defenseman’s shot past Lukas Dostal. The Canadians still could have lost: Jordan Binnington denied David Pastrnak on a breakaway with 70 seconds left to send the game past regulation.Then Marner’s backhanded goal 1:22 into overtime put Canada into Friday’s semi-finals.“It’s the it-factor, man: Mitch Marner’s got it,” coach Jon Cooper said. “He doesn’t disappoint. Sometimes your hair falls out at times, but in the end, he never disappoints.”Canada has won more golds than any nation in Olympic ice hockey history. But this year’s men’s team have concerns beyond their struggles in Wednesday’s game. They lost star Sidney Crosby to injury five minutes into the second period after his right leg appeared to buckle as he braced for contact with rugged Czech Republic defenseman Radko Gudas. Crosby left the ice second later after he was crunched against the boards by Gudas and Necas.“Everybody had complete faith in whoever was going over the boards,” Cooper said. “It just felt it was like a matter of time. It was going to happen.”The US will face Slovakia in one semi-final on Friday night. Just before that, Canada will play Finland in the other.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Canada ice hockey teamWinter OlympicsIce hockeyUS sportsUSA ice hockey teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Then a deluge of soft toys lobbed from the stands. But across the face of the brilliant Russian skater Adeliia Petrosian there was only the faintest of smiles. For now.So far at theseWinter Olympics, a Russian is yet to win a medal. But there is a possibility that could change on Thursday when the 18‑year‑old Petrosian, who sits in fifth after the short programme, takes to the ice again shortly after 9pm.Russia plays prideful, but there’s no doubt the Olympics ban is hurting | Bruce BerglundRead moreIt won’t just be in Milan where people will be watching the result closely, but in the very highest places in Moscow too. Which tells you something about how the mood music has shifted in Russia – and how its return from the sporting cold is closer than you might think.Two years ago the Kremlin could not have been more frigid about the Paris Olympics. In fact, the few Russians who competed as “authorised neutral athletes”, after they were vetted to check they did not explicitly support the war in Ukraine, were criticised.Irina Viner, Russia’s rhythmic gymnastics president, even went as far as to call those who went “traitors”, and suggested that only “homeless” athletes competed without their flag and anthem. One rower told Match TV that the Kremlin had compensated Russian competitors who dropped out.Now, though, Russia is firmly behind its Olympians again. As Russia’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said before the Games: “I’ll definitely be watching wherever our guys perform. It’s a must-see.”That view was amplified vociferously on Wednesday by the TV presenter and Putin loyalist Dmitry Guberniev. After calling Petrosian “a great girl” and predicting she would beat everyone, he reflected the shift in Moscow’s support for the 13 Russians here in Milano Cortina, in bawdy terms.“It’s interesting how life changes,” he said. “I see posters everywhere on the roads about our beloved Olympians in Italy. Many called the Paris Olympians traitors. Life is changing for the better, all those arrogant little bastards and assholes are keeping their mouths shut now.”It might sound strange to western ears – especially given the war in Ukraine is still raging, and Russia was also previouslybanned for massive state-sponsored dopingat the Sochi Olympics they hosted in 2014 – but most seasoned Olympic insiders believe Russia will be allowed back this year.Look at the direction of travel. In December theInternational Olympic Committeecalled for Russian youth athletes to be allowed to compete internationally under their own flag, paving the way for them to compete at the Youth Games this summer.View image in fullscreenKirsty Coventry said ‘every athlete should be allowed to compete freely without being held back by the politics and divisions of their governments’.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAAnd this month Kirsty Coventry, the IOC president, insisted that “every athlete should be allowed to competefreely without being held back by the politics and divisions of their governments”. She did not explicitly mention Russia, but everyone in the room knew which country she was talking about.Certainly Mikhail Degtyarev, Russia’s sports minister and head of the Russian Olympic Committee, sounded bullish on Wednesday, as he predicted a return to international sport under the Russian flag and anthem could come as soon as April or May.And there was also a jagged edge to his remarks, as he warned the IOC what would happen if it did not hurry up. “If the IOC doesn’t bring our case up for discussion, we will, of course, go to court,” he told the Russian website Championat.“The cutoff date is May. And we won’t just go to court demanding the reinstatement of the Russian Olympic Committee, but we will file a commercial lawsuit in Swiss civil courts, because we are losing money that we spend on training athletes who were barred from competition due to the IOC’s decision. An unlawful decision, in our opinion.”Two outstanding issues remain. The first is over Russia’s breach of the Olympic charter by unilaterally including regions of Ukraine in the Russian Olympic Committee – which is the reason it is banned from Milano Cortina. And it also still has to pay outstanding fees to the World Anti-Doping Agency. But no one – including Degtyarev – believes these are significant barriers to re-entry.Meanwhile on the slopes in Italy there has been only the occasional gripe and grudge from the Russian team about how they have been treated. This week the Russian ski mountaineer Nikita Filippov claimed that the organisers did not give him a free mobile phone because he was a neutral athlete. “All athletes are given Samsung phones, but we were shortchanged, only given shampoo and toothpaste,” he said in an unboxing video on social media. “Oh well, we didn’t come here for phones.”There was also mild frustration back in Russia when Petr Gumennik was awarded sixth place in the men’s figure skating, with even Peskov, whose wife is the former Olympic champion Tatiana Navka, getting involved. “I am not a specialist, but my wife says that Petr could have easily been in the top three with a different attitude from the judges,” he said.While some back home remain queasy about their athletes competing as neutrals, rather than in the red of Russia, Degtyarev urged them to think of the bigger picture. “I can tell these people that our athletes, who are making their way abroad as neutrals, have not given up their passports, citizenship, flag and anthem. They love Russia, they fight for it, and the whole world knows they are Russian.”And if there are no medals, will that be a blow to prestige, he was then asked. “It would be a blow if we weren’t there at all,” came the reply. “And the fact that we’re there is already a good result.”So what price we see Donald Trump shaking hands with Vladimir Putin at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics opening ceremony – and the Russian flag waving as 250 of its athletes enter the coliseum? A year ago it would have sounded preposterous. Now only a fool would rule it out.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Russia Olympic teamInternational Olympic CommitteeSport politicsWinter OlympicsRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

By the end, he was clearly disenchanted, describing his first year atFerrarias a “nightmare”.F1 2026: a look at the cars for the new season – in picturesRead moreThe Scuderia have looked promising in pre-season, and in Bahrain at the third and final test Hamilton, who has regrouped over the winter, presented a buoyant figure, optimistic about the forthcoming challenge.“I’ve gone through quite a bit and left everything, all of last year, behind me,” he said. “I spent a lot of time rebuilding over this winter, refocusing, really getting my body and my mind to a much better place. I generally feel personally in the best place that I’ve been in a long time with rearranging things within my team.”Hamilton joined Ferrari at the end of a stable period of regulations and with the car already designed but this season, having been in place with the team, he has had the chance to help shape the new model.“Last year we were locked into a car that ultimately I inherited,” he said. “This is a car that I’ve been able to be a part of developing on the simulator for the last 10 months, eight months and so like a bit of my DNA is within it, so I’m more connected to this one for sure.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton puts his new Ferrari to the test in Bahrain.Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersThe British driver was also clear that, despite the travails of 2025, he was committed to a long‑term project at Ferrari. “My belief in the team is still absolutely the same. I understand the faith in this team and what they’re capable of and that’s why I joined the team.“I knew it wasn’t going to be an overnight thing where we’d have success immediately, that’s why I signed a longer deal, because I knew it was a process and I feel like we’ve also learned a huge amount from last year as a team.”The FIA, the sport’s governing body, will attempt to end the row over Mercedes’s controversial use of a loophole in the regulations involving the compression ratio of their engine. It is believed Mercedes have stolen a march on their rivals by exploiting a higher ratio than the 16:1 mandated when the engine is running because it is measured when “cold”, or at ambient temperatures.The other engine manufacturers have been aggrieved at what they see as an unfair advantage, if one that is still within the letter of the regulations. After a meeting of the power unit advisory committee, the FIA has allowed a proposal that as of 1 August – after 13 of the season’s 24 races – the rules would be changed so that the compression ratio would also be measured at a representative operating temperature of 130°C. The vote on the proposal will be decided in the next 10 days and requires a super-majority of five of the seven on the committee, which consists of the FIA, F1 and the five manufacturers, Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull, Audi and Honda.George Russell topped the timesheets for Mercedes on the firstday of the final test, from McLaren’s Oscar Piastri and Ferrari’s Leclerc. The session concluded with a test of a new starting procedure the FIA is evaluating because of concerns that cars at the back of the grid would not have time to reach the necessary revs to bring the turbo up to speed before the lights go out. An additional hold of five seconds was trialled before the usual start sequence began and all the cars did get off the line successfully.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Lewis HamiltonFerrariMercedes GPFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Only Alysa Liu of the United States was able to break the Japanese hold on the top spots, scoring 76.59 to come in ahead of fourth-placed Mone Choba (74.00).There has never been a clean podium sweep in Olympic women’s figure skating, but Nakai, Sakamoto and Chiba will fancy their chances at making history for their skating-mad nation entering Thursday’s free skate, when the medals will be doled out.Ilia Malinin writes about ‘inevitable crash’ after Olympic figure skating shockRead moreThe 17-year-old Nakai, the youngest of the 29 skaters in the field, laid down the early marker from the top of the second-to-last group, landed the three-and-a-half-revolution jump to open her program to La Strada by Nino Rosa and racking up points with a triple lutz-triple toeloop combo followed by a triple loop. Her score improbably held up through the next 11 skaters.“I feel like I’m dreaming,” Nakai said. “I just tried to stay in my skate, and have a good time for the rest of the skate. “The Americans push me with their difficult jumps, including the triple axel. But at the same time, they’re all very nice people, so I just want to enjoy my time with them on the ice.”Sakamoto, who backed up her 2022 Olympic bronze medal with three consecutive world titles, delivered an elegant performance to Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman’s Time To Say Goodbye, earning high marks for her triple lutz and a double axel but lost points on a slightly under-roated triple lutz and triple flip-triple toe combo.“I made small, tiny mistakes, but I did it well,” Sakamoto said. “In the first half, I was a little bit anxious, but as the music went on I got very comfortable and was able to really enjoy my performance. Although it was a little bit lower than the score I did in the team event, this will be a good step to the free skate.”Liu, the 20-year-old who won last year’s world championship aftercoming back from a two-year retirementprompted by burnout, earned her season-best score with a near-perfect routine set to Promise by Laufey and Dan Wilson to remain squarely in the podium hunt. Were she to win a medal of any color on Thursday, she would become the first American woman to reach the Olympic podium in this event since Sasha Cohen won silver in 2006.View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu is in the hunt for medals after Tuesday’s skate.Photograph: Claudio Furlan/LaPresse/Shutterstock“Whether I beat them or not is not my goal,” Liu said of her Japanese rivals. “My goal is just to do my programs and share my story and I don’t need to be over or under anyone to do that.”Her American teammates, who entered this contest with high hopes of medal contention, didn’t fare as well.Skating immediately after Liu kicked off the final group, 18-year-old Isabeau Levito was docked a level on her step sequence and finished eighth with 70.84 points. Later, Amber Glenn’s skate to Madonna’s Like a Prayer – which had prompted a video message of encouragement from the singer – started off well enough with the only other triple axel of the night, sending the building into delirious roars. But the 26-year-old Texan and three-time US champion was left in tears after a popped triple loop cost her seven points, derailing her program and dropping her to 13th place with 67.39.“I don’t know what happened,” Glenn told her coach as she left the ice. “I had it.”Adeliia Petrosian, the three-time Russian champion who entered these Olympics as an individual neutral athlete, went off in the first group due to a lack of international competition experience as a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Her clean skate to a Michael Jackson medley – including They Don’t Care About Us at the climax – was good for fifth with a personal-best score of 72.89, leaving her within striking distance of the medals.“At first I was worried, not about my skate, but about my [emotional] state. This was the most important start of my life,” Petrosian said. “I’m feeling really calm, and I hope this will help me with my free skate because this [short program] already helped me today.”The 18-year-old from Moscow, who is coached bythe controversial Eteri Tutberidze, attempted none of the quadruple jumps nor the triple axel which are in her arsenal, but remained coy when asked whether she’d attempt them in Thursday’s free skate.“I would like to keep this a secret because I never tell about my program,” she said.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsJapan Olympic teamFigure skatingAmber GlennUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Clubs are already planning how to exploit itStarting next year, MLS will align itself with big European leagues and become a summer-to-spring operation. Executives see the change as an opportunityJeff RueterWed 18 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 10.50 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleFew constants have endured from MLS’s 1996 debut to now. It’s still an operational soccer league, for one thing. There’s the name itself, although its initial logo was shelved in 2015 for its current shield-and-kickstand. Eight of the 10 teams that launched the league remain involved, though each one has changed their name, crest, or both over time.Another rare constant will soon fade into the rearview: the league’s schedule. MLS has run spring-to-fall/winter since its launch, more specifically from late February to early December in recent years. Preseason kicks off at the start of each new year, three weeks or so after the previous season’s championship bout. It’s a pretty well-ironed routine, even as ancillary competitions like the Leagues Cup and Club World Cup shuffle the middle bits each year.Starting next year, MLS will be a summer-to-spring operation. Just like the big leagues in England, Spain and Germany; but no longer like the big leagues in Norway and South Korea and, well, the rest of US soccer. It helps associate MLS with the competitive company it wants to keep, and should further firm its foothold in the global transfer market.As a result, the next 18 months could feel bizarrely compartmentalized for those who began following the league long before Lionel Messi took his talents to South Beach. That won’t weigh on the players and coaches when the 2026 season kicks off on 21 February, who will stress, as usual, that “the most important game is the next one”.For the league’s chief soccer officers, who may most directly benefit from the schedule shift, this is just another part of the job. Their jobs often operate in multi-transfer window waves, needing to project how any immediate business may impact their subsequent maneuvers. For Corey Wray, appointed bySt Louis Cityas their sporting director this past November, the schedule change is just another consideration.“It’s not a massive thing of importance when it comes to how I’m building it out,” Wray told the Guardian. “I would say you have to be mindful of these things. We take guidance from the league in terms of our contracting process, and they can provide us with some clarity on how it could work for the rules. But outside of that, I’m looking to create ultimate flexibility in the roster for the next couple of windows.”Throughout our conversations, Wray – along with Mike Jacobs, in his ninth year with Nashville SC, and Khaled El-Ahmad, in his third with Minnesota United – referred tothe impending “sprint season,”the widely adopted colloquial term for next spring’s bridge between the 2026 and 2027-28 seasons.Why James Rodríguez signed in Minnesota amid a federal occupationRead moreOne framed the sprint season as something of a spiritual successor to theMLS is Back Tournament, a stand-alone competition held during the Covid-19 summer of 2020. While players and coaches should be mercifully free of a Floridian bubble this time around, the sprint season – which will last from February to May 2027 and consist of 14 regular-season games followed by playoffs – should be judged accordingly: very entertaining, but unrepresentative of MLS’smodus operandi.Nonetheless, those will be league games and players need contracts. This winter’s free agency window saw very few one-year deals, with one-and-a-half year deals being the norm that offers more stability than usual without forcing a club to commit for long beyond their ideal timeline.“On the players’ side, I think it’s actually pretty good,” Wray said. “Typically, there are arguments: ‘Hey, we want to give you a one-year [deal]’, and then the players always want two years. So I think it does side with them pretty well, where they get split in the middle and get a year and a half in those situations.”Squad-level signings, likeNashville’s additions of Shak Mohammed and Isaiah LeFlore, often treat the spring of 2027 as an option year to execute or void like any other. Their other free-agent signing was arguably the biggest of any player who moved within MLS’s ranks, as the club brought in two-time MLS All-Star Cristian Espinoza after seven excellent seasons in San Jose. At age 30, the Argentinian winger joined a side that had a successful 2025, winning the club’s first major trophy (the US Open Cup) and setting club records for wins in a year, but came up short against Inter Miami in the first round of the playoffs.After longtime club captain Walker Zimmerman’s contract ended, Jacobs’ aim was to get a player who could quickly integrate into the core of the roster and help the team challenge for additional hardware. It’s the type of signing that required ample foresight and planning, given MLS’s multitude of roster rules and mechanisms.“When it comes to things like contract length of the current players you have, and also about the salary cap and how you’re utilizing that andGAM (general allocation money)for us, we want optionality,” Jacobs said. “Let’s have the flexibility so when the right guy presents itself, we can strike. The reality was, when someone like Cristian was available, and we knew he was the right guy, we went for a full-court press trying to acquire him.”“GAM” (with a hard G) has been used by MLS for over a decade to help teams add talent while being rules-compliant. Each team gets $3.28m of the stuff from MLS each year, and can add more through trades and competition achievements (good and bad alike; this is American sports, after all).As of late January, no team has accumulated more GAM than Minnesota, with $7.26m on-hand to use as it works to buck a two-year trend of quarter-final playoff exits. It isn’t an act of stockpiling like your neighborhood doomsdayer. Part of shrewd planning is ensuring greater flexibility, both before the calendar flips and thereafter.“Having money in the bank is always better than not having any,” El-Ahmad said, “There’s clubs I think have done [squad planning] really well, like Seattle. Not only do they win titles, they are competitive over and over and over again. You have other teams that might win one year, then they drop off. I want Minnesota to be a consistent team that is competitive. It’s a strategic decision to always make sure that we have flexibility.”GAM tallies may bloat across the league as sporting directors ready for the calendar flip. The most common usages for GAM are either trading it within the league in lieu of a transfer fee (though those are now more prevalent after a rule change last winter) or “buying down” a player’s salary budget charge to keep cap compliant.It’s one of many considerations that goes into every move, including experience-defined squad slots, international spots, and those peskydiscovery rights. For the Loons, having those funds is invaluable to remain competitive in both the league and the market.“The one thing I want is to have the flexibility to improve in every window,” El-Ahmad said. “Sometimes we will, sometimes we might not because we didn’t think it was worth it [at the market’s rate]. But I at least want to have the choice and control. We looked at several domestic players, but honestly, sometimes it seems to be easier to go abroad and do deals than internally [within MLS], because the price is more expensive because they know the league, because they have the green card or the domestic status.”Historically, Nashville have been among the most bullish MLS teams on domestic talent. Each offseason would see Jacobs’ staff agree to part withas many as four international slotsto recoup GAM and invest it into the squad.That trend varies by year, as does the trading value of international slots. Still, it’s another way Nashville can benefit from committing to a clear approach depending on factors in their control and beyond. Despite the “only in MLS” nature of GAM, it has helped raise the league’s competitive level. Time and the almighty market will determine whether the calendar change will do the same, and to what extent.“Every club’s different about how they want to build their roster,” Jacobs said. “Like in a free market, I think everyone should be able to pick their own model of how to build their team. For us, we want to have players who are prime age, because athletically, they can do certain things and also where they fit the whole ecosystem of their potential market value, having someone who’s prime age rather than someone who’s past their prime.“We have been able to acquire players from top leagues and top countries in their prime age. I do think the U22 initiativehas also helped to incentivize clubs to acquire players within those age groups. I also do think the success of some of these guys do make it easier for people to look and say, well, it’s not a retirement league. It’s not a league for players who are 35 and up, on their last paycheck. It’s gonna be an aspirational league.”For Nashville, their aspirations meant bringing Espinoza in as a designated player was worth the knock-on effects that are both projectable and unexpected. It justified offering the 30-year-old a deal thatcould run through the 2029-30 seasonrather than follow the league’s modern trend of identifying young players who can be developed and sold for profit.Market gains are great, but trophies look better in a boardroom display. Every move forces teams to weigh potential returns on the field and on the balance sheet alike before committing definitively. That much won’t change when the league’s calendar flips.“For us, we want to have players who can become stars, but become stars on our team,” Jacobs said. “We want to have players who are prime age, and reach their potential with us. Depending on what their aspirations are, whether it’s to stay in our club and our league long-term and help us be successful, or it’s to go somewhere else and pursue opportunities somewhere else and make more money, we want to help. We want to be aspirational as a club.”Explore more on these topicsMLSMinnesota UnitedNashville SCSt Louis CityUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Long before half-time it was fully apparent that he had rather understated things.Had this been a boxing match it would surely have been stopped by the 20th minute. Qarabag were utterly overwhelmed by the pace of their guests, and that of Anthony Gordon in particular. Gordon scored four times, boosting his tally in theChampions Leaguethis season to 10 goals.Qarabag 1-6 Newcastle United: Champions League playoff – liveRead moreIt all ensured that the 1,998 Newcastle fans who arrived on the banks of the Caspian Sea on a series of indirect flights via, among other cities, Istanbul and Warsaw, saw their endurance rewarded by the most convincing of performances from Eddie Howe’s team.“That’s as good as we’ve played in a long time,” the Newcastle manager said. “It’s a great day for us.”Howe has faced multiple problems in recent weeks but his players found this flying visit to Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, and its Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium as restorative as a week’s spa break in the sun.How Newcastle must wish more opponents attempted to play out from the back as ineptly as their Eurasian hosts. Not to mention surrender so supinely in the face of their aggressively physical, high-intensity press.Qarabag have beaten Benfica, Eintracht Frankfurt and Copenhagen in the Champions League this season but they simply folded as Newcastle sprinted away with the first leg of this playoff for a place in the last 16.The 2,529 miles Howe’s squad had travelled to Azerbaijan represented the longest away trip made by an English team in the Champions League. Not that they showed any sign of jet lag following their six‑hour flight from Tyneside.Quick GuideChampions League roundup: Bodø/Glimt stun InterShowBodø/GlimtaddedInterto the list of elite sides they have beaten this season, with a 3-1 playoff first leg victory putting them within touching distance of the last 16 of the Champions League.The Norwegian side had already beaten Manchester City and Atlético Madrid and the runaway Serie A leaders suffered the same fate as Jens Petter Hauge and Kasper Høgh (pictured) struck in four second-half minutes after Francesco Esposito had cancelled out Sondre Brunstad Fet’s opener for the hosts.Bayer Leverkusenalso have one foot in the next round after striker Patrik Schick scored twice in the second half as they beatOlympiakosaway from home in their play-off round first leg.However,Atlético Madridwere left to rue squandering a two-goal lead in nine second-half minutes before conceding an 89th-minute equaliser to Christos Tzolis to draw 3-3 atClub Brugge.Diego Simeone’s side have now conceded 15 goals in seven Champions League matches after Raphael Onyedika and Nicolò Tresoldi levelled up the tie on the hour after Julián Alvarez’s penalty, his 12th goal in 18 Champions League games, and Ademola Lookman had given them a comfortable lead.Joel Ordóñez’s own goal looked to have handed Atlético a lifeline but their lead lasted only 10 minutes.PA MediaPhotograph: Chris Brunskill/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The game had barely begun before Dan Burn unleashed his inner Beckenbauer and, having stepped elegantly out of defence, supplied Gordon with a beautifully weighted pass.The England winger, deployed at centre-forward with Nick Woltemade behind him in the No 10 role, needed no invitation to lash home his seventh Champions League goal of the season.View image in fullscreenJacob Murphy celebrates after scoring Newcastle’s sixth goal.Photograph: Giorgi Arjevanidze/AFP/Getty ImagesBurn’s defensive partner, Malick Thiaw, swiftly scored the second. When Kieran Trippier’s clever corner routine bamboozled Qarabag, Thiaw headed beyond Mateusz Kochalski.By now Gordon’s blistering acceleration was petrifying Gurbanov’s side but he relied on accuracy to score again from the penalty spot after Matteus Silva handled in the area. His hat-trick was completed when he dispossessed Kevin Medina before rounding Kochalski.Then, after Kochalski brought him down in the area, Gordon scored another penalty that provoked a heated row with Trippier, who wanted Woltemade to take it.Significantly, Gurbanov’s goalkeeper played well, proving largely responsible for keeping the score in single figures.Nick Pope had been a spectator until the moment, early in the second half, when he was arguably beaten rather too easily by Elvin Cafarquliyev’s low, hard, and just onside shot. Newcastle’s defence momentarily lost concentration and, as Qarabag fans celebrated wildly, Howe looked briefly irked.Gurbanov had switched to a back five and a deeper Qarabag looked considerably more resilient. Admittedly their cause was aided by a raft of visiting substitutions – including Gordon’s withdrawal – as visiting thoughts began turning to the Premier League engagement on Saturday night at Manchester City, where the absence of the injured Bruno Guimarães may be rather more keenly felt.Back in Baku, Jacob Murphy scored Newcastle’s sixth after cutting in from the right and watching his curling left foot, long-range, shot deflect past Kochalski.“The tie isn’t over,” Howe said. “But we are in a great position.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNewcastle UnitedQarabagEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The visitors tested Renée Slegers’s side when Sára Pusztai cancelled out Alessia Russo’s goal but a penalty from Mariona Caldentey and second from Russo secured the win, earning them a comfortable 7-1 aggregate score.This was a disjointed performance from the hosts but it will have done little to dampen the high spirits in north London.Arsenal are a team full of confidence right now and this was their sixth win in a row. Slegers’s squad have proved a lot over the last few weeks, both to themselves and those on the outside, as they near the end of a taxing period of games.Since returning from the winter break, they have won seven of their nine fixtures (losing just one) and featured in five different competitions. They have liftedthe inaugural Champions Cupand now secured progression to the last eight of the Women’s Champions League. It has been a month that will have tested them to their limits but one that will have given them belief that they can challenge on multiple fronts.Arsenal v Leuven: Women’s Champions League – liveRead moreSlegers and her players will have learned a lot about themselves. They have played brilliantly at times and proven their mettle at others; sometimes accused of not having the stomach for a fight, they have shown that they can dig in and find ways to win. This resilience has been key over a five-week stretch that has seen them play every three or four days, adapt to rotation in the squad and deal with the contrasting styles of football that their opponents have brought to the table.“We’ve learned that we have so many players in good form and so many who can perform for us in different roles as well,” Slegers said. “One example is Victoria Pelova who played in the 6 at the start of this game and finished on the right. Then the whole sum of its parts becomes really good. That’s the standout for me.”View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo shows her emotion after scoring the opener.Photograph: Molly Darlington/UEFA/Getty ImagesThey were always expected to come through this playoff unscathed. The mismatch in resources and experience between the current holders and the plucky newcomers was clear to see from the outset, particularly since they had already beaten them comfortably in the league phaseback in December.Quick GuideManchester United's Sandberg sidelined by knee injuryShowManchester United will be without the left-back Anna Sandberg for anything between four and eight weeks, the United head coach Marc Skinner has revealed, before the second leg of their Women's Champions League knockout playoff tie against Atlético Madrid on Thursday.The Sweden international has been in excellent form this season but a knee injury means she would be very likely to miss the quarter-finals against Bayern Munich, if Manchester United were to progress past Atlético. United lead 3-0 from the first leg.\"There's a little bit of a tidy up that needs to be done around her meniscus,\" said Skinner, who is hoping that Sandberg will return for the last \"three or four games\" of the season, adding: \"She will be around four to six to eight weeks, that's the timeframe we've been given. Best is four, middle is six. Obviously worst case is eight.\"We're hopeful we can get it to six [weeks]. But we won't take any risks. She's a young player so we'll make sure she's rehabbed effectively.\"Jayde Riviere and Fridolina Rolfö are also doubts for the visit of the Spanish side, while the England midfielder Ella Toone is \"doing really well\" but remains sidelined with a hip injury. Skinner said the club are aiming to welcome Toone back in time for March's local derby against the Women's Super League leaders Manchester City.Tom GarryPhotograph: Poppy Townson/Manchester UnitedWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That is perhaps the one flaw of this reimagined Champions League – with just 18 teams featuring in the league phase, the probability is that the eight teams who have to go through the playoffs will have to meet for a second time. It led to a less enticing set of games than there perhaps could have been for the two English sides involved.This tie was practically overafter the away legbut the signs of complacency that crept in on this occasion will have frustrated Slegers. Despite Russo’s early goal putting the host ahead, Leuven challenged a disjointed Arsenal defence and found a deserved equaliser through Pusztai.The context for Arsenal’s issues on this occasion were key. The conditions in Borehamwood were atrocious. The incessant rainfall made for a very heavy pitch. Things improved after the break as Arsenal regained the lead thanks to a quintessential penalty conversion from Caldentey.It took the sting out of Leuven’s tail and Russo added another as the game came to a close.Half of the defensive unit was changed with Lotte Wubben-Moy and Smilla Holmberg coming in and there was a lack of communication which perhaps explained why they were being caught out by the pace of the Leuven attackers.It saw the Gunners cruise through a hotly anticipated encounter against their London rivals.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueArsenal WomenLeuven WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Benfica manager was criticised strongly by the anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out for referencing the Real Madrid forward’s goal celebration when talking about the incident.Vinícius’s allegation that he was racially abused on Tuesday by Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni duringMadrid’s Champions League playoff winin Lisbon prompted Uefa to appoint an ethics and disciplinary inspector to investigate. Benfica said they would collaborate with the investigation but reiterated their support for Prestianni, who they said was “victim” of a “smear campaign”.Vinícius Júnior takes aim at racist ‘cowards’ after Benfica’s defeat by Real MadridRead moreThe game was delayed for 10 minutes, with Madrid’s players initially prepared to walk off, after Prestianni said something to Vinícius while covering his mouth with his shirt. Kylian Mbappé has publicly accused Prestianni of calling Vinícius a monkey five times. Prestianni has denied racist abuse. The Argentinian could face a 10-match ban if charged and found guilty byUefa.Mourinho appeared to criticise Vinícius for his celebration – which he described as “stupid” – after scoring the only goal. The Portuguese manager said to Amazon Prime: “I told him: ‘When you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back.’ They [Vinícius and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don’t believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.”Mourinho then appeared to comment on previous incidents in which Vinícius has been subject to racist abuse. “There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,” he said. “A stadium where Vinícius plays, something happens, always.”Kick It Out responded by saying: “When anyone reports discrimination in football, or anywhere, the first priority is that they are listened to and feel supported. Focusing on Vinícius Jr’s goal celebration or the history of the club, instead of acknowledging the report, is a form of gaslighting.“This approach not only harms the individual affected but also sends the wrong message to others around the world who may have experienced similar situations. Leaders in football have a crucial role in setting standards and moments like these call for responsible leadership that reinforces respect, inclusion and accountability.”The former Netherlands midfielder Clarence Seedorf also criticised Mourinho: “He’s saying it’s OK when Vinícius provokes you … and I think that is very wrong.”Because the referee did not hear what was said and could not include it in his report, Uefa’s inspector must attempt to reach a conclusion as to what happened. That is disputed and demonstrating the facts to a level of certainty that satisfies the committee and complies with “applicable law” is not simple.View image in fullscreenVinícius Junior with Gianluca Prestianni. Uefa said it would ‘investigate allegations of discriminatory behaviour’.Photograph: Soccrates Images/Getty ImagesVinícius did not speak after the game but posted a message on Instagram that said: “Racists are above all cowards [who] need to put their shirts over their mouth to demonstrate how weak they are.”When the Brazilian celebrated his goal in the corner, someBenficasupporters threw bottles at him and footage showed at least one fan performing a monkey gesture. The Portuguese authority responsible for combating football‑related violence (APCVD) is to investigate the Prestianni case and reported incidents of racist gestures and noises from Benfica fans.After Prestianni had confronted Vinícius while covering his mouth, Vinícius ran to the referee, with footage appearing to show him reporting the word “mono” (monkey). Mbappé could then be seen repeatedly accusing Prestianni of being a racist.“Vini says the boy said ‘monkey’ with his shirt like this,” Aurélien Tchouaméni told reporters, while gesturing as if to cover his mouth. “Then the boy said that he didn’t say anything, that he saidmaricon[poof,sic] or something, whatever. In the end we spoke as a team and Vini said we have to keep playing.”Prestianni denied using racist language, writing on Instagram: “I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults at Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard. I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received fromReal Madridplayers.”In a post on X, Benfica attached Prestianni’s message, and declared themselves “together by your side”. The club also posted a video of the moment in which Vinícius went to the referee, claiming: “As the images demonstrate, given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they are saying they heard.”Real Madrid are studying footage and audio clips. Uefa’s inspector will do the same and also gather evidence from those involved, including Vinícius and Prestianni.Benfica said they would “collaborate fully” with the investigation. “The club reiterates, clearly and unequivocally, its historic and unwavering commitment to defending the values of equality and inclusion at a club where Eusebio is the greatest symbol,” a statement said.“Benfica reiterate their unwavering support to the version of events put forward by Gianluca Prestianni, whose behaviour within the club has always been guided by a respect for opponents, institutions and the principles that define Benfica’s identity. The club deplores the smear campaign of which the player has been a victim.”In a post on X, Mbappé encouraged Vinícius to keep on dancing, insisting: “We will never let them tell us what to do.”Explore more on these topicsFootballKick It OutJosé MourinhoVinícius JúniorBenficaReal MadridUefanewsShareReuse this content"

O’Neill, 73, is in hissecond stint in chargeof Celtic this season and a third overall having managed the club from 2000 until 2005.Fifa’s plan for expanded 48-team Club World Cup will not be blocked by UefaRead more“When I came here in the first spell my biggest worry was not ruining anything from 20-odd years ago,” O’Neill said. “If you couldn’t win a game you’d be considered too old. It turns out it shouldn’t have been as big a concern in my head as it was. Of course you like showing you can still win, you’d be telling lies otherwise.“I did get some calls from the older managers, it would be unfair to say who. It would be too strong to say I’m flying the flag but it was like them saying: ‘We can still do it.’”O’Neill joins the likes of Alex Ferguson, Brian Clough, Jürgen Klopp and José Mourinho on the League Managers Association’s 1,000-game roll of honour. O’Neill was in typically entertaining form when recalling the kickstart to his managerial career, which came at Wycombe from 1990.“I did an interview at Bradford City once,” he said. “It was January 1987, they had just sacked Trevor Cherry. I think 10 were interviewed for the job, all had better credentials than me because they had been managers but I was the only one asked back. Only an Irishman can get down to the last one and fail it.“I didn’t get the Wycombe job first time round, I lost out in an interview. I remember it clearly. I went down for an interview on the Sunday morning and they ushered me out pretty quickly. No, haven’t got the credentials.”The more pressing matter relates to facing a Stuttgart side who sit fourth in the Bundesliga and are therefore the heavy favourites to progress to the last 16 of the Europa League from their two-leg playoff. O’Neill dismissed the sense of Europe providing an inconvenience as Celtic engage in atense Scottish Premiership fight.“If you can compete here with them, then it surely must give you confidence as they are a fine team,” theCelticmanager said before Thursday’s first leg. “While we are here, let’s go for it. If they show their Bundesliga form these will be difficult nights for us, but I want us to be concerned with ourselves rather than what the opposition might do.”Sebastian Hoeness, Stuttgart’s head coach, said he is wary of the Scottish champions. “Celtic have individual class and they’ve strengthened again in the winter,” he said . “We need to be ice-cold and efficient. I can still remember the atmosphere here from visiting a few years ago. We’re certain it is going to be fantastic.”Explore more on these topicsCelticMartin O'NeillStuttgartnewsShareReuse this content"

For Pereira, the Kadikoy district of Istanbul represents familiar territory, having lived in the city across two enjoyable but trophyless spells here as a manager, most recently in 2021.Vítor Pereira has no fears about Marinakis ‘fire’ as paths cross again at ForestRead morePereira knows the difficulty of the challenge in Turkey and the players have been well versed by their fourth head coach of the season. On a crisp evening, barring the bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic that trailed Forest’s police escort to the ground from Sabiha Gokcen airport, south-east of the city, for an hour or two it all felt rather serene compared with the febrile atmosphere that will greet them on Thursday in theirEuropa Leagueplayoff first leg.Then there is the chaos that has stalked Forest’s season since they qualified for Europe for the first time since 1995-96. Their journey in this competition provides a snapshot of the story: Nuno Espírito Santo expressing his excitement at facing Porto after the initial draw was made last August, a game which laterproved Sean Dyche’s first in chargein October; the early promise under Ange Postecoglouat Real Betis; Dyche’s last win in the job,a 4-0 rout of Ferencvaros. Now it is over to Pereira to quieten the noise.Has Pereira told his players how to cope with the racket raining down from the stands? “Just to try and block it out as much as you can,” the Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White says.“It’s going to be loud, but all we can do is focus on ourselves. I don’t think you can really prepare for an atmosphere, you just have to focus on your game, the team and try to focus on what you can do to help the team as much as possible.”Pereira believes the key thing is courage and is adamant that he can instil it within a squad that have won three of their past 13 matches in all competitions and none of their past three. Last time outthey failed to beat Wolves, the Premier League’s bottom club, 35 fruitless shots ultimately prompting Forest’s fiercely ambitious owner, Evangelos Marinakis, to sack Dyche.View image in fullscreenMorgan Gibbs-White said: ‘I think as players you get used to change. It is important for us as players to stick together in these moments.’Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesPereira rescued Wolves last season and he is confident of delivering a similar bounce at Forest. “From the first day you can start to give this energy to them, to pass this energy to them,” the new head coach says.“I believe that a team absorbs a lot of the personality of the coach or manager. We need to think about the game as an opportunity to show our qualities to prove ourselves and at the end of the game be proud of what we did and what we showed.”Pereira has had only three training sessions with the squad, including one on arrival in Istanbul, and while he acknowledged it is impossible to load his players with information in such a short window, he is confident his early message has landed. Gibbs-White says the early signs under the Portuguese have been positive. “I think all of the players including myself and the staff are all really excited,” the 26-year-old says.“I think as players you get used to change, because some players come and go, managers come and go. It is important for us as players to stick together in these moments. Since the new manager has come in it has been really exciting, he’s been really clear about what he wants us to do.”Fenerbahce appear in rude health under Domenico Tedesco, the former Belgium and RB Leipzig head coach who took charge last September. A lot of that is to do with the squad at his disposal, which includes Ederson, Marco Asensio, Nélson Semedo and, as of this month, N’Golo Kanté, who joined after two and a half years in the Saudi Pro League. Fenerbahce are unbeaten in the Super Lig, second and gunning for a 29th league title, and their only home defeats this season wereby Aston Villa in Januaryand cross-city rivals Besiktas, based across the Bosphorus, in the Turkish Cup a month earlier.Pereira got to a Turkish Cup final himself with Fenerbahce in 2016, when Galatasaray triumphed. It explains why the 57-year-old was in demand before heading on to the training pitches, a queue of local journalists asking him for selfies. “It is a pleasure to be here, an honour, I have very great memories of the stadium, the supporters, the people, the club,” he says.“I’m very happy to be here again and I hope we can enjoy the game. I’m expecting a game with quality, a lot of talent inside the pitch, with two teams that want to play in a good way and with quality – and a fantastic atmosphere, for sure.”Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestFenerbahceEuropa LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a related development, last week Real ended their five‑year legal battle with Uefa bywithdrawing formally from the European Super League. They appear ready to fall in line with the global football establishment led by Infantino, Ceferin and Nasser al-Khelaifi, the Paris Saint‑Germain president who chairs European Football Clubs.The Guardianrevealed before the Club World Cupin the US last summer that Fifa was open to expanding the tournament from 32 teams, primarily to guarantee the participation of more of the biggest European clubs after Barcelona, Liverpool and Manchester United failed to qualify.Infantino then said in a speech at the general assembly of European Football Clubs in Rome last October that expansion was on the agenda, sayingFifawas working “to see how we can make this event bigger, even better, even more impactful”.Uefa’s opposition was a potentially significant obstacle, but another remains with Fifa subject to legal action from the lobby group European Leagues that has been taken to the European Commission. That relates to the international match calendar, including decisions concerning the Club World Cup.While some at Uefa remain concerned that the huge financial rewards of the Club World Cup will have a destabilising effect on European football, an expansion to 48 clubs is regarded as less disruptive than making it a biennial event.Although the fine detail has yet to be agreed, European clubs would be among the main beneficiaries of the expansion, with the number of Uefa qualifiers likely to increase from 12 last year to 16 in 2029. Chelsea won £85m from the competition’s £774m prize pot forwinning it last yearand adding more European teams would have implications for the competitive balance of the Champions League.Uefa’s position is the latest sign of improved relations with Fifa, which reached a nadir when Ceferin and a group of European delegates including the Football Association chair, Debbie Hewitt, staged a walkout at Fifa congress in Paraguay last May in protest at the late arrival of Infantino, who had been on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East involving Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman. With Ceferin and Infantino likely to seek re-election for fourth terms next year, sources close to both men have indicated that a period of calm is in both their interests.Spain and Morocco are favourites to host the next Club World Cup, which will take place in the summer of 2029, before their co‑hosting of the 2030 World Cup.Uefa declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsClub World CupUefaFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was given a three-year extension by Caf’s president, Patrice Motsepe, which ran out on 15 October 2025.“As per the statutes, he is occupying the seat illegally right now,” Sobha said. “I don’t think that the SG is in any legal position to make decisions, to sign a document … I’m pleading with the president to rectify this position … We need to respect the statutes … When it comes to this issue, I think that it is clear.“This decision [that Mosengo-Omba must vacate his position] needs to be taken, to make sure that we can get, very soon, a full-fledged and legitimate general secretary. Right now, most FA presidents in Africa agree that Mr Mosengo is out of mandate.”When Motsepe was questioned about Mosengo-Omba after last Friday’s executive committee meeting in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the South African billionaire said: “Retirement is governed by our rules and regulations. We deal with those things not just in accordance with legality, but also with governance. We will take the best decision as Caf, concerning employees.”Sobha said: “Patrice Motsepe is a very good person; that’s my personal opinion. But it happens that things are not going in the right direction. Some issues need to be fixed.”Mosengo-Omba was absent from last Friday’s meeting because of an urgent family matter in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “Had he been there, I would have voiced it out, to let everyone know, including the president, that I don’t agree that Mr Mosengo should be sitting there,” the Mauritian said.Sobha, re-elected to the Caf exco in March last year, also apologised to Morocco for “a great injustice that has been done to the people of Morocco and their national team” in last month’sAfrica Cup of Nations finalin Rabat. Morocco lost 1-0 after a disputed penalty prompted Senegal to abandon the field, before play resumed 15 minutes later.View image in fullscreenMorocco’s players were ‘robbed’ in January’s Afcon final, according to Samir Sobha.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images“I want to plead with the Moroccan FA to forgive us for the injustice done to them … The rules have not been respected, as they should have been in this match … They were robbed. It’s clear that after the Senegalese team left the field, all the players should have been sanctioned with a yellow card.“I’m not saying we should not give the trophy to the Senegalese team. What has happened has happened already. We can’t change it … But we should put our ego aside and agree that an injustice has been done to the Moroccan national team. Having gone through the competition rules, I’m sure my position is right.”Explore more on these topicsFootballnewsShareReuse this content"

A 94th-minute equaliser cost the Premier League leaders two points, having allowed their rock-bottom opponents back into the game, as their title credentials were further questioned.Arsenal are five points clear of Manchester City at the top of the table but have played a game more. The Gunners looked on their way to victory after goals from Bukayo Saka and Piero Hincapié, only to be pegged back by Hugo Bueno and Tom Edozie.Arsenal suffer new blow in title race after late equaliser boosts WolvesRead moreArteta said: “Extremely disappointed, obviously, with the result, with the way the game ended, but we have to blame ourselves.“I think the performance in the second half didn’t show anything close to the standards that are required in this league to win, and with the margins that I think should have existed today, especially in the manner that we played the first half. Any hit, any bullet, take it, because we didn’t perform at the level that is required.”Arsenal will be looking to recover on Sunday in the north London derby at Tottenham, after a run of two wins in sevenPremier Leaguematches. Arteta said: “I think we need to go through the pain and you need to go through that looking in the mirror and understanding what the game requires now and the next action is on Sunday.”Edozie had been training with the Wolves first team for only a few weeks under Rob Edwards but the 19-year-old academy graduate scored the late equaliser less than 10 minutes into his Premier League debut.“We’re still learning about him as well,” Edwards said. “He’s been training with us over this last week or two. We just had a feeling. Sometimes you have a feeling and then that gut has proved right. As he was coming on, I just put my arm round him and said: ‘This could be your moment, go and take it.’ His family will remember that for a long, long time.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetaWolverhampton WanderersPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Curling is one of the very few sports left being contested at theWinter Olympicsin which the British fancy their chances, and Team GB’s hopes of getting anywhere near their medal target will turn on the curl of the stones in the next few days.‘The whole spirit of curling is dead’: meltdown on the ice as ruckus rumbles onRead moreHang on a minute lads, anyone got a bright idea? “Play better,” the British skip Bruce Mouat told his team. The Brits had three matches between them on Wednesday. It started just before nine in the morning with the first instalment of a double bill against USA – the women, then the men playing them – and was finished just before nine in the evening, with the conclusion of the women’s match against Japan.Team GBneeded to win all three of them, and they did, in 12 hours of excruciating slow‑mo sport, as tense as the seat of a skip’s pants as they slide down the ice to deliver the hammer.There were some extraordinary moments in among it, the best of them Becky Morrison’s 15th, and very final stone, of the 10th end against USA. Morrison’s team were trailing 7-6, USA had the hammer and a stone sitting flush on the button. There was only one possible shot Morrison could play to save the day, an improbable hit-and-roll which ricocheted off a stone sitting way out to the left, shot across the ice and knocked the USA stone off and stopped dead. It was a two-point swing, and the stunned USA team were still talking about it hours later. Minnesota Fats couldn’t have worked the angles any better.“It’s up there with the best stones I’ve ever thrown, for sure, especially considering the situation,” Morrison said. “One of the best stones I’ve ever seen,” her teammate Sophie Sinclair said. Their third, Jen Dodds, said: “What a way to finish the game. I’ve got a bit of adrenaline going, because it was so amazing to watch. That is a very high tariff shot. You’re aiming at a third of the stone, and it’s way out there on a line you don’t really play often, in the 10th end of an Olympic Games, to keep your chances alive.”View image in fullscreenGrant Hardie (left) and Bruce Mouat after the British men kept their hopes alive with victory against USA.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAAnd the fun was only just beginning. The British men beat USA 9-2 after just six ends. The problem was they don’t just need to win; they need the Norwegian and Italian teams to lose, too. Whenever Mouat and his teammates weren’t focused entirely on their own game, they had both eyes on what was happening on rinks either side. It was like the final day of the Premier League, only they were playing all the games in the same stadium.When Britain were two up against USA, Norway were trailing the Swiss by the same margin, but Italy were leading Canada by three. Then when the British were leading by six, Canada had come back to one‑down in their match against Italy, but all of a sudden the Norwegians had equalised with Switzerland. Somehow at the end of it all, everything fell the right way. Canada came back to beat Italy 8-3, and the Swiss pulled ahead again to beat Norway 10-4. Now, the British have to spend Thursday morning watching while Norway play Canada, and Italy play Switzerland.As long as one of Norway or Italy lose, GB will go through. And if you followed that here’s a Rubik’s Cube for you to do. “I’ll be literally refreshing my phone every 20 seconds,” said Hammy McMillan, who will be following it from the athletes’ village.The British women will be back at the rink. They beat Japan 9-3 in the evening, and now need to defeat Italy on Friday afternoon. Mouat, crawling ever so slowly towards the back of that wobbling bus, says only: “I’m actually oddly calm. I feel like things are going to go our way.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBCurlingWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sadowski-Synnott went all out to land a score of 87.48 but was pipped by Fukada, who took gold with 87.83 points.Her compatriot Kokomo Murase, who beat Sadowski-Synnott to top spot in the big air event last week, collected bronze with 85.80. Only 24, Sadowski-Synnott has become the most decorated snowboarder in Olympic Winter Games history, with five medals – one gold, three silver and a bronze – which was astonishing news for the Kiwi.“Someone told me that after I got given this medal. I couldn’t have even believed that that was a possibility when I was a kid, so it’s pretty special,” she said. “Coming into these Olympics, there’s been a lot of expectation, but most of it has really been from myself because I’m a perfectionist. I have really high standards of myself.“The last two years hasn’t really been easy with an ankle injury and then some bone-bruising coming into this season, so I’m pretty grateful to be standing here today with another Olympic medal.”High-flying freestyle skierDanielle Scott finally clinched an Olympic medalon her fourth Games attempt, the Australian aerials star bagging silver behind defending champion Xu Mengtao in Livigno.And in the women’s slalom, Madi Hoffman achieved Australia’s best Olympic result since Zali Steggall won bronze way back in 1998.

With the exception, it turns out, of Princess Anne who was involved in a case of mistaken identity during the Calcutta Cup pre-match formalitiesat Murrayfield last Saturday.Clearly unaware Marler had retired from rugby 15 months ago, the Princess Royal stopped for a chat with her new favourite prop while being introduced to the England team in her role as patron of Scottish Rugby. She even confided how amusing she had found him on Celebrity Traitors, which would have been fine had the player in front of her been Marler rather than another bearded English front-rower, Joe Heyes.Pollock promotion reflects England’s need to banish Murrayfield blues | Robert KitsonRead more“She thought I was Joe Marler which was … quite upsetting,” said Heyes. “She said: ‘You’re awfully funny on TV.’” To his credit, the 26-year-old Leicester tighthead – “I was a bit starstruck to start with” – did his best to avoid a diplomatic incident. “Who am I to correct her? I didn’t really know what to say. I almost went with it.”The princess has been patron of Scottish Rugby since 1986 and her daughter Zara is married to Mike Tindall, an England World Cup winner. She is not the first person, however, to mix up Marler and Heyes.View image in fullscreenThe England bearded prop Joe Heyes, not Joe Marler.Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport/Getty Images“I’ve had all sorts about me looking like Joe Marler, but not from a royal,” said Heyes, who was winning his 19th cap for England. The Leicester forward, however, stressed that last Saturday’s encounter had still been a special one. “I do like it when you get to meet the patron of whatever union you’re playing against. It’s a very cool moment.”Marler, 35, who won 95 caps for England before retiring from rugby in November 2024, has become an increasingly familiar public face sinceappearing on the BBC’s Celebrity Traitors. A slightly incongruous contestant in the castle alongside Stephen Fry, Alan Carr and Jonathan Ross, he reached the final round before being voted out.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unionThe TraitorsnewsShareReuse this content"

You may even get sweaty in them at the gym.But an investigation into headphones has found every single pair tested contained substances hazardous to human health, including chemicals that can cause cancer, neurodevelopmental problems and the feminisation of males.Even products by market-leading brands such as Bose, Panasonic, Samsung and Sennheiser were found to contain harmful chemicals in the formulation of the plastics from which they are made.Campaigners condemned “a market-wide failure” as they called for broad bans on whole classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in consumer goods and greater transparency from manufacturers about what is in their products.“These chemicals are not just additives; they may be migrating from the headphones into our body,” said Karolína Brabcová, chemical expert at Arnika, part of the ToxFree LIFE for All project, a partnership of central European civil society groups that carried out the research.“Daily use – especially during exercise when heat and sweat are present – accelerates this migration directly to the skin.“Although there is no immediate health risk, the long-term exposures – especially for vulnerable groups like teenagers – is of great concern. There is no ‘safe’ level for endocrine disruptors that mimic our natural hormones.”Around the world, there is increasing concern over the potential impacts of contaminating ecosystems, animals and humans with synthetic chemicals, and fears they are linked to the global rise in rates of cancer, obesity and infertility.Many chemicals that have become ubiquitous, such as bisphenols, phthalates and poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (Pfas) have subsequentlybeen discoveredto have drastic biological effects. Despite that, many continue to be used in the manufacture of consumer goods, with little public awareness of what they are and what they might be doing to people.Researchers say that while individual doses from particular sources may be low, a “cocktail effect” of daily, multi-source exposure nevertheless poses potentially severe long-term risks to health.Campaigners from the ToxFree project said they decided to investigate the presence of such chemicals in headphones because the devices had “transitioned from occasional accessories to essential tools”, worn by users for long periods.Researchers bought 81 pairs of in-ear and over-ear headphones, either on the market in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Austria, or from the online marketplaces Shein and Temu, and took them for laboratory analysis, testing for a range of harmful chemicals.“Hazardous substances were detected in every product tested,” they said.Bisphenol A (BPA) appeared in 98% of samples, and its substitute, bisphenol S (BPS), was found in more than three-quarters. Synthetic chemicals used to stiffen plastic, BPA and BPS mimic the action of oestrogen inside organisms, causing a range of adverse effects including the feminisation of males, early onset puberty in girls, and cancer. Previous studies have shown that bisphenols can migrate from synthetic materials into sweat, and that they can be absorbed through the skin.“Given the prolonged skin contact associated with headphone use, dermal exposure represents a relevant pathway, and it is reasonable to assume that similar migration of BPA and its substitutes may occur from headphone components directly to the user’s skin,” the researchers said.Also found in the headphones tested were phthalates, potent reproductive toxins that can impair fertility; chlorinated paraffins, which have been linked to liver and kidney damage; and brominated and organophosphate flame retardants, which have similar endocrine disrupting properties to bisphenols. Most were, however, found in only trace quantities.The headphones investigation is the third undertaken by the ToxFree project. Previous investigations found bisphenol A, a known hormone disruptor, inbaby dummies, including some labelled BPA-free, and that one in three pairs of women’s underpantscontained toxic chemicals.Bose, Panasonic, Samsung and Sennheiser did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsHeadphonesHealthCancerNeurosciencenewsShareReuse this content"

They lunged and backflipped (landing on their knees), they spun around and jumped. Not one fell over.The display was impressive, but prompted some to wonder: if robots can now dance and perform martial arts, what else can they do?Experts have mixed opinions, with some saying the robots had limitations and that the display should be viewed through a lens of state propaganda.TikTok creator ByteDance vows to curb AI video tool after Disney threatRead moreDeveloped by several Chinese robotics firms, the robots performed a range of intricate stunts, including kung fu, comedy sketches and choreographed dance moves alongside human performers.Clipscirculatingonline quickly drew comparisons with last year’s lunar new year broadcast, which also featured dancing robots but with noticeably simpler movements.View image in fullscreenThe performance showed China’s push to develop more advanced robots powered by improved AI capabilities.Photograph: CCTV Video News Agency/YoutubeKyle Chan, an expert in China’s technology development at Brookings Institution, a policy organisation in Washington DC, said Beijing uses these public robot performances to “dazzle domestic and international audiences with China’s technological prowess”.“Unlike AI models or industrial equipment, humanoid robots are highly visible examples of China’s technological leadership that general audiences can see on their phones or televisions,” he said.Pointing to intensifying competition in the tech space between China and the US, Chan added: “While China and the US are neck-and-neck on AI, humanoid robots are an area where China can claim to be ahead of the US, particularly in terms of scaling up production.”Georg Stieler, the head of robotics and automation at the global technology consulting firm Stieler Technology and Marketing, also emphasised the symbolism of China’s prime time broadcast.“What distinguishes the gala from comparable events elsewhere is the directness of the pipeline from industrial policy to prime-time spectacle,” Stieler said in a statement.Comparing this year’s performances with last year’s – when viewers saw “fundamentally a single choreographic mode” with limited motions including walking, twisting and kicking – Stieler said one key signal of China’s robot progress is “the ability to run large numbers of near-identical humanoids in synchronised motion with stable gaits and consistent joint behaviour”.But Stieler also noted: “Stage performance does not equate to industrial robustness, yet.” He said what the robots did was the result of being trained for a routine “hundreds or thousands of times – you could not just tell them to change direction or do something completely different”.“These dance motions involve very little environmental perception and are essentially imitation learning plus a balance-keeping controller. That has little bearing on reliability in unstructured environments, a prerequisite for factory-grade deployment. Also the progress in dexterity is not as fast as in locomotion,” he added.The unveiling of China’s latest generation of robots underscores the country’s broader technological ambitions.By the end of 2024,Chinahad registered 451,700 smart robotics companies, with a total capital of 6.44tn yuan (approximately $932.16bn), according tostate data. Major government projects such as Made in China 2025 and the 14th Five-Year Plan, have made robotics and AI key Beijing priorities.Morgan Stanley projects that China’s humanoid sales will more than double to 28,000 units in 2026; and Elon Musk has said he expects his biggest competitor to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its flagship humanoid Optimus. “People outside China underestimate China, but China is an ass-kicker next level,” Musk said last month.Marina Zhang, a technology professor at the University of Technology Sydney, said that such a visible showcase likely hints at a new phase in China’s manufacturing masterplan, “where robotics becomes a linchpin in the shift from low-cost assembly to high-end, smart manufacturing”.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsChinaRobotsAI (artificial intelligence)Asia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But without power, workers are unlikely to share the gainsSupported byAbout this contentRobert ReichWed 18 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 08.01 ESTShareThe front-page headline in a recent Washington Post was breathless:“These companies say AI is key to their four-day workweeks.” The subhead was euphoric: “Some companies are giving workers back more time asartificial intelligencetakes over more tasks.”As thePostexplained: “more companies may move toward a shortened workweek, severalexecutives and researchers predict, as workers, especially those in younger generations, continue to push for better work-life balance.”Hurray! There’s utopia at the end of the AI rainbow! A better work-life balance!You may have come across similar articles inFortune magazineand the New York Times. The AI spin brigade is in full force.Business leaders are rhapsodizing about how AI will free their employees to take more time off. Zoom’s Eric Yuan told theTimesthat “A.I. can make all of our lives better, why do we need to work for five days a week? Every company will support three days, four days a week. I think this ultimately frees up everyone’s time.”Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase,saysadvancing technology could push the workweek down to just three and a half days. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates openly wonders whether atwo-dayworkweek could be the future.Elon Muskpushes the ideato the extreme (as he does everything else): “In less than 20 years – but maybe even as little as 10 or 15 years – the advancements in AI and robotics will bring us to the point where working is optional.” Even better: “There will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money,”saysMusk. “There will be universal high income.”All of this is pure rubbish. Even if AI produces big productivity gains – which is still an open question (anMIT studylast year found that “despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, 95% of organizations are getting zero return”) – it’s far from clear that workers will see much, if any, of the benefits.If productivity rises, as it’s supposed to do when the workplace becomes immersed in AI, each worker will generate more value, by definition. And supposedly with more value, we’re all better off.Worker productivity has been rising for years, yet the median wage has barely risen, when adjusted for inflation.Here’s the truth: the four-day workweek will most likely come with four days’ worth of pay. The three-day workweek, with three days’ worth. And so on.So, as AI takes over their current work, most workers will probably get poorer or have to take additional jobs to maintain their current pay.In his 1930 essayEconomic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,the great British economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that in a century, “the discovery of means of economizing the use of labour” would outpace our ability to “find new uses for labor”. In other words, less work.Keynes was sure that by 2030 the “standard of life” in Europe and the United States would be so improved by technology that no one would worry about making money. Productivity gains would create an age of abundance.In fact, by 2030, he predicted, our biggest problem would be how to use all our leisure time:“For the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem – how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.”We’re still five years away from Keynes’s magic year, but at the rate we’re going, his prediction seems wildly wrong.Rather than creating an age of abundance in which most people no longer have to worry about money, new technologies have contributed to a two-tiered society comprising a few with extraordinary wealth and a vast number of people barely making it.AI is likely to further widen inequality.Imagine a small box – call it an iEverything – capable of producing for you everything you could possibly desire. It’s a modern-day Aladdin’s lamp. You simply tell it what you want and – presto! –the item or service suddenly appears.Sounds wonderful until you realize that no one will be able to buy the iEverything because no one will have any means of earning money, since the iEverything will do everything.This is obviously fanciful, but the dilemma is very real. Productivity gains are great, but the too-little-discussed question is how they will be distributed.The distribution issue can’t be ignored. When more can be done by fewer people, who gets paid what? It comes down to who has the power.Unless workers have the power to demand a share in the productivity gains, profits will go to an ever-smaller circle of owners – leaving the rest of us with less money to buy what can be produced.If the five-day workweek with five days of pay shrinks to four days with four days of pay, and then to three, and to two, and perhaps one, AI will supplant most people’s work and drive down our take-home pay. We may see a dazzling array of products and services spawned by AI, but few of us will be able to buy them.But this isn’t necessarily our fate. If AI does deliver big productivity gains, how can average working people get a share of those gains? They can get a share if they have the bargaining power to get it.It seems doubtful that labor unions will provide that power. Forty years ago, over a third of the private-sector workforce was unionized. Now, it’s only 6% – not much power there.Which leaves politics. Will average working people gain the political muscle to demand a share of AI’s productivity gains?That depends on whether one of our two dominant political parties will demand and enact laws that distribute those gains more fairly (think wealth taxes financing childcare, elder care, and healthcare, for example).If not, maybe a third party emerges – a workers’ party – dedicated to this?In the meantime, don’t fall for the breathless rubbish about AI allowing employers to “free up” employees’ time.The real question is whether AI’s productivity gains, if it delivers, are shared with workers. And the truth is employers won’t share those gains unless they’re forced to.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

As a technology reviewer, these products were crucial for her work.When she eventually found the cause, she had to laugh. It wasn’t a sticky-fingered neighbour or a rogue delivery driver causing her to miss parcels but her smart doorbell – the very thing she’d hoped would prevent missed deliveries, and part of exactly the range of internet-connected devices she was meant to be reviewing.“It’s pretty funny,” says Bailey, 33, who goes by the handle @ellyawesome on TikTok, where she has more than 1.1 million followers. She had been loving her Google Nest doorbell up until then. She could see who was at the front door from upstairs and speak to delivery people through her phone while she was out.View image in fullscreenTechnology reviewer Elly Bailey prefers a hybrid setup: ‘I’m an old-school millennial who’s very happy to put my washing on myself’But it had one obvious flaw: “When someone presses this doorbell, all it does is send a notification to my phone.” She says this feature is “great” when she’s out but without a telltale chime she was missing deliveries while at home and away from her phone. She complained about this to her followers in a clip that has been liked more than 1,400 times.“The crazy irony is the doorbell itself does make a little ding-dong sound when you press the doorbell button but it’s only loud enough for the person at the door to hear it,” she says.‘Alexa, what do you know about us?’ What I discovered when I asked Amazon to tell me everything my family’s smart speaker had heardRead moreBailey is far from alone in her scepticism around smart home technology – many adoptees have realised the devices designed to make life easier regularly achieve the opposite. Stories of people being locked out of their homes by faulty smart locks, woken up by pets activating cameras on the driveway and being left in the dark by broken smart lights are rife on social media and product review websites.“Technology is brilliant … until it isn’t,” says Georgina Wilson, an architect in Sydney who learned this the hard way when her husband pressure-hosed the front of the house and accidentally watered their smart keypad unit. The incident hasn’t changed her mind on the convenience of a smart lock but it did result in an expensive emergency locksmith callout – and quickly forced her to put a backup plan in place: keys in a hidden lockbox, with copies distributed to family members and neighbours.View image in fullscreenSmart locks can present concerns for renters as well, as they may allow landlords to keep tabs on their tenants’ every move.Photograph: Nico De Pasquale Photography/Getty ImagesShe says some of her clients have had similar, or worse, experiences. “We’ve seen clients unable to flush toilets, lock front doors, or exit garages during power outages.”Since smart home technology uptake spiked during Covid lockdowns, Daniel Vasilevski, an electrician in Sydney, says he has seen many smart tech horror stories. One client in Maroubra got locked out of their house for two days. Others have ended up with no working lights. Subscription complaints are also rife, with even some relatively simple devices such as smart doorbells and thermostats requiring monthly fees. Vasilevski estimates 15 to 20% of his callouts these days are for problems with smart tech – some are simple repair jobs, while others want their smart systems demolished altogether.There can be a more sinister side, too. Experts say smart homes are prime targets for cybercriminals.More than 120,000 smart home cameras were hackedin South Korea last year and the Australian Signals Directoraterecently warnedthat Chinese hackers are exploiting people’s home routers and smart devices.View image in fullscreenWhen something goes wrong, it’s not just the tech that’s a problem but finding someone to fix it, since many electricians find smart home repair jobs too much of a hassle.Photograph: d3sign/Getty ImagesWhile cases of spying fridges and doorbells being hacked are still rare, Emily Holyoake, a cyber and home-security expert based in Canberra, says technology facilitated domestic abuse is a significant issue.“The scariest things I’ve heard are about loss of privacy, where ex-partners have still had access to their partner’s home and made changes either locking them out, letting themselves in or watching their every move,” she says.Renters, too, have privacy concerns, as smart locks can allow landlords to keep tabs on their every move.Julie Provenzano, a real estate broker with 83,000 TikTok followers, believes it might be smarter to stick with an analogue home. She recently told fans she was “apped-out”. “Hi-tech doesn’t necessarily mean easier … It leaves people in a hostage situation with IT departments,” she said.View image in fullscreenWhile you don’t have to eschew the Internet of Things entirely, the key is to be intentional about the technology you’re putting in your home, one expert says.Photograph: mrs/Getty ImagesVasilevski’s clients have faced similar issues. When something goes wrong, it’s not just the tech that’s a problem but finding someone to fix it. Many locksmiths are not trained to work with sophisticated, connected devices. He says electricians will sometimes turn away smart home repair jobs because of how faffy and time-consuming they can be to troubleshoot. “It isn’t worth the hassle, most of the time,” he says. This is particularly true with lower-end smart tech suppliers who offer little in the way of after-sale support.In an era of frictionless digital experiences, there’s something magical about obsolete technology | Tansy GardamRead moreGaby Albutros, a project manager at Sydney firm RSE Home Automation, says that when brands shut down or devices are discontinued, as was the case withBelkin’s Wemo smart home range in January, customers can be left high and dry. “The only option when they go wrong is to have them ripped out.”Curtains and blinds seem to be among the few smart-control devices that experts in the industry agree upon. Provenzano says they are one of the only smart devices she endorses and Vasilevski agrees, saying he wouldn’t install smart tech in his home because of the issues he sees at work, but that “smart control curtains are pretty reliable because they only get used twice a day”.View image in fullscreen‘Always ask: who has access to my data and where is it stored?’: cyber and home-security expert Emily Holyoake suggests smart-home adopters check their security settings and privacy regularly.Photograph: Maskot/Getty ImagesWhile Holyoake doesn’t suggest eschewing the Internet of Things entirely, she says the key is to be intentional about the technology you’re putting in your home. In her household, she uses smart security cameras, lighting, a robot vacuum and even a digital whiteboard – all things she says make family life easier, especially with neurodivergent kids.Mindful of the risks, she suggests smart-home adopters make time to check their security settings once a month. “Make sure only the people you know and trust have access, always make sure you change the default password, check for security and software updates, and always ask: who has access to my data and where is it stored? Do I need a subscription to access my own data? Can I still access devices if the internet goes out?”Bailey might be a likely champion for all things smart but even she prefers a hybrid setup. She has been offered everything from smart lights to smart washing machines as part of her job, so she could have the world’s most connected home if she wanted to, but aside from the smart doorbell – which she has kept because she still thinks the benefits outweigh the drawbacks – she’s chosen to keep most parts of her home “consciously dumb”.“Ultimately I’m an old-school millennial who’s very happy to put my washing on myself,” she says. “I think that keepsmesmart, to be honest.”Explore more on these topicsSmart homesAustralian lifestyleHomesInteriorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A “finger princess” is the person in the group chat who asks questions that they could easily answer themselves.Oh, I knowexactlywho that is.Yes, everyone knows at least one: “What time are we meeting tonight?” “What’s the best way to get there?” “Am I bringing the pasta salad?”Why don’t they just scroll up through earlier messages? Or Google it?Well, that’s the question. It’s just as much effort for you to find the info as it is for them.So they’re just being lazy?They might not think so, but the name jokes that they’re too precious to lift a finger to make a simple search.Where did it come from?Korea, originally – “finger princess” is a direct translation of “ping-peu”.It’s not only women, surely?No, you can also be a “finger prince”.Verymodern. So who do we have to thank for bringing this to our attention?It was shared by aKorean slang accounton Instagram, then picked up by digital media sites likeSelfandSlate.What do they have to say about it?Well, Self says it’s a “friendship red flag”.Ah, another one of those. Sure, it’s annoying, but is it really all that bad?The odd question, of course not, but if it’s a pattern, it may suggest a sense of entitlement. “They’re used to others doing things for them,” a counsellor told Self.They only asked for the address to the restaurant!Yes, but if it takes you just as long to look it up as it does them, then they’re outsourcing emotional labour, you see.What if they want advice, or a personal recommendation?That’s different. This is about adults who wilfully refuse to take initiative.Has anyone bravely owned up to being one of these deadweight friends?Yes. An Australian bloggerconfessed to being one, and described to her group chat for help with a power outage as a “humbling reality check”: “I am a walking, talking red flag.”In fairness, that sounds like itmightbe a job for a qualified electrician.Well, you could argue that this whole issue stems from the immediacy of digital communication, making it easy to fire off texts without thinking. Instead of finger-pointing at our finger-princess friends, we could probably all stand to be a bit more mindful of what we’re asking of others.Exactly!

Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.Meanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioningIndiaas the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.Modi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raisedserious concernsabout India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”View image in fullscreenA visitor looks at a Jio intelligence bot on display at Bharat Mandapam, one of the venues for the AI Impact Summit in Delhi.Photograph: Bhawika Chhabra/ReutersView image in fullscreenDelhi commuters walk past a hoarding advertising the summit.Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty ImagesSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.Indian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.If a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.India’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”Safety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi at the inauguration of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in Delhi on 16 February.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”One of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”But the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.Companies such asGoogleare focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”Google’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)IndiaNarendra ModiComputingSouth and central AsiaGoogleOpenAInewsShareReuse this content"

It’s what we turn to in times of strife, when spirits are flagging, or to start our day. And when a visitor calls, one of the first things we do is put the kettle on.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While many small appliances have evolved beyond their original form, the kettle’s basic principles remain largely unchanged. Water goes in and heats up until a thermostat switches it off; the water then pours out, and we enjoy a cuppa. However, the technology that goes into a kettle has been slowly improving: better insulation to keep water hotter for longer and reduce reboils; different temperature settings to suit every drink from green tea to herbal brews; and more features such as filters and concealed elements to keep scale out of our cups.When your existing kettle makes its last brew and must be taken to the big recycling centre in the sky, it pays to check out what’s on offer to replace it. The next one you buy may make more of a difference to your day than you might think.At a glanceBest kettle overall:Bosch Sky kettle£79.99 at AmazonBest budget kettle:Kenwood Ripple kettle£39 at John LewisThe forever kettle:Dualit Classic kettle£149.99 at John LewisThe fastest-boiling kettle:Ninja Perfect Temperature kettle£79.99 at NinjaBest quiet kettle:Zwilling Enfinigy Pro kettle£124.95 at Harts Of SturBest budget variable temperature kettle:Lakeland Digital double-walled kettle£44.99 at LakelandWhy you should trust meWhen a friend heard I was writing this, she asked me, “Aren’t all kettles the same? They all boil water, don’t they?” And while she’s right about the second part, it took me at least 15 minutes to explain why she was wrong about the first. I’ve been testing kettles for years, and they vary greatly – in design, weight, ease of maintenance, ease of use and build quality. Some will last for decades while others will barely make it past the basic guarantee period. In short, yes, all kettles boil water – but they are far from being all the same.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach kettle was hooked up to a power meter to assess electricity consumption.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianAs you can imagine, I boiled a lot of water. Litres upon litres of the stuff. Enough to turn my kitchen into the steamiest hammam and clear my pores of blackheads I’ve had since I was a teenager.But testing wasn’t just about making gallons of tea and having a deep skin cleanse on the cheap. I also brought a lot of gadgets to the party: a power meter to assess electricity use for each kettle when boiling exactly one litre of water from cold; a timer to measure how long that took; and a probe thermometer to gauge how long it took for the kettle to click off once it had reached boiling point.Fancy a cuppa? My epic kettle showdown – and what I learnedRead moreExternal temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer and the highest reading noted, while maximum noise levels were recorded with the Decibel X app. After boiling, water temperature was checked at the 30-minute, one- and two-hour points to see how much it had cooled.I tested 13 kettles in total. Those we tested but haven’t included areCurrys Essentials C17JKW17 jug kettle, which is a snip at £6.99 but lacks durability, and theRussell Hobbs 23840 lightweight travel kettle, which is probably one of the best travel models you can buy at £15, but took almost six minutes to boil its 850ml.The ones that made the cut were selected on the basis of good energy efficiency or low minimum fill, plus ease of use or maintenance. Value for money has also been considered, as have longer guarantees and durable build quality that should translate into a lengthy lifespan for the appliance. All samples have been returned to their supplier or donated toCaterham Round Tableto raise funds for local causes and charity projects.The best kettles in 2026View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest kettle overall:Bosch Sky kettleBoschSky kettlefrom£79.99£79.99 at John Lewis£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe lower temperatures are ideal for green tea drinkersWhat we don’t loveIt’s not the priciest here but it’s still an investment buyPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£79.99 at John Lewis£79.99 at AmazonOffering variable temperatures and a double-walled stainless-steel housing, the 3kW Sky is a brilliant blend of robust form and function. It boasts a low minimum boil (300ml), a keep-warm setting and touch controls.Why we love itI found it difficult to select a best kettle from so many that performed well, but the Bosch Sky clinched it because it’s such a good all-rounder that will suit most people. It pours well, has a button that’s within easy reach of the handle so it’s simple to open the lid without touching it, and it’s insulated so the exterior doesn’t become too hot to touch. From a design perspective, it has a more industrial feel than many others – no frippery here – but not too modern that it wouldn’t fit into most kitchens. Its display is thoughtfully designed, easy to keep clean and lights up as it heats.The exterior doesn’t get too hot (up to 40C), and while it wasn’t the fastest to boil in testing, it was only seconds behind the Dualit below. It clicked off at boiling point, and the water was still a toasty 78C 30 minutes later. At the hour point, it was 66C, and two hours 52C, meaning you’ll spend less time and energy reboiling.It’s a shame that …its premium look ends at the handle, which seems cheap and plasticky next to the sleek aesthetic of the rest of it.Time to boil one litre:2mins 22secsMinimum fill:300mlPower use:0.112kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximumnoise recorded:59dBTemperature settings:70C, 75C, 80C, 85C, 90C, 95C, 100C, keep warmWarranty:two yearsBoschSky kettlefrom£79.99£79.99 at John Lewis£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThe lower temperatures are ideal for green tea drinkersWhat we don’t loveIt’s not the priciest here but it’s still an investment buyBest budget kettle:Kenwood Ripple kettleKenwoodRipple kettlefrom£39£39 at John Lewis£39 at AmazonWhat we loveThe single cup marking makes it great for a solo householdWhat we don’t loveIts base is light but also feels flimsyPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£39 at John Lewis£39 at AmazonAvailable in four “ocean-inspired” shades – eggshell blue, storm blue, pure white and midnight black – Kenwood’s Ripple kettle has a subtle design that belies its affordable price tag. It’s practical, too: there’s a 3kW element, a wide pouring spout to prevent drips, and two water windows showing cups on one side and litres on the other (making it left-hander friendly).Why we love itMore affordable kettles tend to demand a higher minimum fill – usually 500ml – but the Ripple enables those on a budget to boil a single cup (200ml), providing excellent energy economy. There’s even a plastic marker inside for one and two cups and max, so you don’t need to watch the water window as you’re filling. It’s lightweight at 950g without feeling flimsy, has a pull-off lid for easier filling, and it boiled quickly in testing, retaining its heat well for the first 30 minutes (72C) and hour (60C).It’s a shame that …the lightweight plastic body meant that the external temperature was very hot after boiling (80C). Its two-hour temperature (44C) was also much cooler than the one-hour point, meaning more energy is needed to reboil.Time to boil:2mins 30secsMinimum fill:200mlPower use:0.118kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:57dBTemperature settings:100CWarranty:one yearKenwoodRipple kettlefrom£39£39 at John Lewis£39 at AmazonWhat we loveThe single cup marking makes it great for a solo householdWhat we don’t loveIts base is light but also feels flimsyThe forever kettle:Dualit Classic kettleDualitClassic kettlefrom£129£129 at Hughes£149.99 at John LewisWhat we loveLong-life appliances are a win for your pocket and the planetWhat we don’t loveThe matching toaster is UK-made but the kettle isn’tPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£129 at Hughes£149.99 at John LewisAlthough it comes with a higher initial outlay, Dualit’s Classic kettle is more of a “buy right, buy once” appliance. It’s as robust as they come, with a durable stainless-steel body, hinged lid, anti-wobble feet and non-drip spout. But it’s the repairable nature of this kettle that makes it an eco-friendly buy. The 3kW element is replaceable, so a pro can swap it for a new one or repair it if it wears out, meaning you may never need to buy a new kettle again.Why we love itRepairability aside, the Dualit Classic kettle also makes it easy to boil only as much water as you need, with a low minimum fill (250ml) and dual water windows indicating cups and litres via multiple markings. There’s no button to raise the lid, meaning one less thing to go wrong; instead, it has a heatproof plastic handle. It was also the fastest boiling of all the kettles tested and clicked off bang on boiling point.It’s a shame that …the exterior gets hot after boiling – our sample reached 71C. It also lacked a choice of temperatures and a keep-warm function, despite the higher price.Time to boil one litre:2mins 15secsMinimum fill:250mlPower use:0.114kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:57dBTemperature settings:100CWarranty:one yearDualitClassic kettlefrom£129£129 at Hughes£149.99 at John LewisWhat we loveLong-life appliances are a win for your pocket and the planetWhat we don’t loveThe matching toaster is UK-made but the kettle isn’tThe fastest-boiling kettle:Ninja Perfect Temperature kettleNinjaPerfect Temperature kettlefrom£79.99£79.99 at Ninja£79.99 at ArgosWhat we loveSpeedy boiling means no waiting around for your waterWhat we don’t loveThere’s only three colours: black, silver or dark bluePhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£79.99 at Ninja£79.99 at ArgosAs you’d expect from Ninja, this kettle has features galore, right down to the same familiar beep all Ninja appliances use when you turn them on. However, most notable is its “hold temp”, which keeps your water at a selected temperature for up to half an hour – great for the easily distracted and busy households alike.Why we love itOut of all the kettles tested, this was the fastest, boiling its litre in just over two minutes with its 3kW element. Also in its favour is a 250ml minimum fill, although this is only shown on the inside of the kettle, not the outside. Both cups and litres are denoted in multiple increments on its water window, so there’s little chance of boiling more than you need. The six different temperatures each has its own button, meaning no need to scroll until you reach your desired heat. The only place it came unstuck was a lack of insulation. Heat was retained for the first 30 minutes (72C) and hour (58C), but its two-hour temperature was 43C.It’s a shame that …the exterior becomes very hot: the meter registered a temperature of 97C just before boiling. Plus, it took a couple of seconds to click off once 100C had been reached.Time to boil:2mins 7secsPower usage:0.102kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesNoise:55dBTemperature settings:60C, 70C, 80C, 90C, 95C, 100C, hold tempWarranty:two yearsNinjaPerfect Temperature kettlefrom£79.99£79.99 at Ninja£79.99 at ArgosWhat we loveSpeedy boiling means no waiting around for your waterWhat we don’t loveThere’s only three colours: black, silver or dark blueBest quiet kettle:Zwilling Enfinigy Pro kettleZwillingEnfinigy Pro kettlefrom£124.95£124.95 at Harts Of Stur£143 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s rare to find a lifetime warranty on a kettleWhat we don’t loveYou can’t just boil a single cuppaPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£124.95 at Harts Of Stur£143 at AmazonTaking variable temperature kettles to new heights, the Enfinigy Pro kettle doesn’t just feature different temperatures for your tea and a keep warm option, it also boasts a baby bottle sterilisation setting. Add in the wipe-clean touchscreen, fast boiling and insulated dual-wall body to maintain the water’s heat, and it makes a bettergift for new parentsthan all the nappy cakes in the world.Why we love itWhile the 500ml minimum fill is higher than many, I liked the robust feel and sleek look of this kettle, with its cup and litre measurements marked neatly inside the jug. I also appreciated the clear display and choice of temperatures, as well as the reassuring lifetime warranty. It was easily the quietest when boiling and didn’t grow hot on the exterior, reaching a cool-touch 31C. Heat retention was brilliant: after 30 minutes, the water was still 81C, dropping to only 71C after an hour and 57C after two.It’s a shame that …it’s a seriously slow boiler, due to its 1.85kW element, and it continued to boil for three seconds after reaching 100C.Time to boil:4mins 7secsMinimum fill:500mlPower use:0.121kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:43dBTemperature settings:40C, 60C, 70C, 80C, 93C, 100C, keep warmWarranty:lifetimeZwillingEnfinigy Pro kettlefrom£124.95£124.95 at Harts Of Stur£143 at AmazonWhat we loveIt’s rare to find a lifetime warranty on a kettleWhat we don’t loveYou can’t just boil a single cuppaBest budget variable temperature kettle:Lakeland Digital double-walled kettleLakelandDigital double-walled kettlefrom£44.99£44.99 at Lakeland£44.99 at AmazonWhat we love5C increments give greater temperature choiceWhat we don’t loveThe markings are inside, making accurate filling trickyPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£44.99 at Lakeland£44.99 at AmazonLakeland’s Digital double-walled kettle proves you don’t have to splash the cash for a well-insulated, variable temperature kettle – or one with a decent warranty length. With a powerful 3kW element, a wide choice of temperatures and a keep-warm setting, plus easy controls, it’s hard to ask for more at this price.Why we love itWhat impressed me most about this kettle, aside from its choice of 13 temperatures, was its large, clear display. It’s easy to read from afar, and the temperature is easy to set with plus and minus buttons. The kettle looks and feels premium for the price, with its measurements all marked on the interior.The double-walled construction served it well: the exterior reached only 27C, while the water was still 78C after 30 minutes, dropping to 67C after an hour and 53C after two. However, it did take a couple of seconds to click off after boiling.It’s a shame that …this kettle’s lid catch isn’t as well engineered as the rest of it: its flimsy feel makes me worry that it may not go the distance.Time to boil:2mins 30secsMinimum fill:500mlPower use:0.112kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWhMatching toaster?YesMaximum noise recorded:57dBTemperature settings:40C, 45C, 50C, 55C, 60C, 65C, 70C, 75C, 80C, 85C, 90C, 95C, 100C, keep warmWarranty:three yearsLakelandDigital double-walled kettlefrom£44.99£44.99 at Lakeland£44.99 at AmazonWhat we love5C increments give greater temperature choiceWhat we don’t loveThe markings are inside, making accurate filling trickyThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Used the least energy of those tested’: the Swan Alexa smart kettle.Swan Alexa smart kettleSwanAlexa smart kettlefrom£79.99£80 at AO£79.99 at AmazonWhat we loveLooks seriously hi-tech on the worktopWhat we don’t loveThe kettle is robust but the handle feels cheapPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£80 at AO£79.99 at AmazonBest for:energy efficiencyThis wifi-connected kettle won’t be for everyone, but it might appeal to those who, hands full with kids or shopping, would like Alexa to put on the kettle for them.

It’s well insulated too, with the exterior only reaching 32C after boiling and the water still registering a balmy 57C after two hours.It didn’t make the final cut because …its 1.8kW element meant it was slow to boil, and it took about six seconds to click off after reaching boiling point.

However, there’s no getting away from the fact that it’s one of the priciest while not offering much more than the others. The good stuff: it’s stylish, has excellent build quality and a 3kW element that boiled very fast. It also clicked off as soon as it reached 100C, and has a base that allows the cable to emerge from anywhere it pleases. There’s an extensive choice of colours, too, plus a soft-rise lid for minimal splashes.It didn’t make the final cut because …minimum fill appears to be 500ml, although it’s not marked as such, and the external temperature reached a sizzling 99C after boiling. Heat retention was decent at first – 70C after 30 minutes – but after two hours, it had reduced to a tepid 41C, meaning more energy is required for a reboil.Time to boil one litre:2mins 17secs;minimum fill:500ml;power use:0.114kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWh;matching toaster?Yes;maximum noise recorded:60dB;temperature settings:100C;warranty:two yearsSmeg50s-style kettlefrom£128£128 at John Lewis£149.95 at SmegWhat we loveFeels robust while oozing styleWhat we don’t loveA high minimum fill means you’ll always be boiling for twoTower Scandi kettleTowerScandi kettlefrom£27.46£27.46 at Wayfair£29.99 at TowerWhat we loveA bargain price frees up more money for luxe tea and coffeeWhat we don’t loveLooks lovely but feels a bit plastickyPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£27.46 at Wayfair£29.99 at TowerBest for:an affordable luxury kettleIf the price of the two stylish kettles above has you wincing, fear not: you can bag an attractive kettle for less than £30. Enter Tower’s Scandi kettle, available in black or two shades of matt grey, all of which have faux wood and chrome-effect detailing. There’s good stuff besides the design, too: it’s lightweight (940g), has a speedy boiling 3kW element, and water windows on both sides that are marked with cups and litres.It didn’t make the final cut because …the minimum fill is 500ml, and it took six seconds to click off after reaching 100C. It’s also not very well insulated: the exterior reached 84C after boiling, and while the water temperature was 72C 30 minutes after boiling, it registered at only 44C two hours later.Time to boil one litre:2mins 21secs;minimum fill:500ml;power use:0.117kWh = 3p at 27.69p per kWh;matching toaster?Yes;maximum noise recorded:59dB;temperature settings:100C;warranty:one yearTowerScandi kettlefrom£27.46£27.46 at Wayfair£29.99 at TowerWhat we loveA bargain price frees up more money for luxe tea and coffeeWhat we don’t loveLooks lovely but feels a bit plastickyWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenWhat key features should I look out for?How you use your kettle will probably dictate which functions you’ll find the most useful, but generally, any feature that helps to save energy is valuable. For example, kettles that are dual-walled help to trap heat inside, so the water stays warmer for longer while the outside stays cool to the touch.Those with low minimum fills enable you to boil just enough water for a single cup, so you don’t waste energy heating more than you need. Some kettles also have a keep-warm function that stops the water cooling below a certain temperature, which is ideal for those who become distracted after boiling or drink consecutive cuppas. It’s a good idea to check for safety features too, such as an auto shut-off to prevent it from boiling dry if there’s not enough water.Other features are more “nice to haves”: variable temperature models enable you to choose water heated to lower temperatures than boiling, such as 70C or 80C, for other types of tea or for filling a hot-water bottle. Concealed elements, which are easier to keep scale-free, and removable, washable limescale filters will be useful for those who live in hard-water areas. Then there’s connectivity. While wifi-enabled and voice-controlled kettles can feel a little gimmicky, they can be a gift for busy parents who usually have their hands full.Are rapid-boiling kettles faster than normal ones?Rapid-boil kettles don’t have a strict industry definition, so while a rapid-boil kettle should boil water quickly, it may not differ much from one that’s not labelled as such.A more reliable indicator of how fast a kettle will boil is its power rating: this is listed either in watts (eg 3,000W) or kilowatts (eg 2.2kW). The higher the number, the more power its element can use to heat water quickly. However, this isn’t the whole story: boiling times can also be quicker in double-walled kettles (as they lose less heat to their surroundings) and those with concealed or flat elements (which provide more surface area to heat the water than a coil).How to descale your kettleLimescale reduces your kettle’s efficiency, costing you more to boil each time, and shortening the appliance’s lifespan. Descale it monthly, especially if you live in a hard-water area. Standing water encourages the buildup of limescale, so try not to leave water in the kettle after use.While you can buy descaler in the supermarket, a lower-cost and more eco-friendly option is to combine a weak food-safe acid, such as white vinegar or lemon juice, with water. Fill the kettle three-quarters with either water and the juice of one lemon or equal parts water and vinegar. Let it soak for an hour, then boil the kettle (once for vinegar, three times for lemon). Once it’s cooled, rinse thoroughly. If your kettle has a removable filter, take it out and rinse it under running water at the same time.For more:The best toasters for toast, bagels and crumpetsThe best frying pans for every kind of cookKitchen gadgets top chefs can’t live withoutRachel Ogden has worked as a consumer journalist for decades, becoming an expert unboxer before it was a thing, although she’s much lessadept at repacking.

The idea of plummeting down a hill on anything but a plastic sledge is totally alien to me. And yet, my wife and I have been gripped by the Winter Olympics, especially the snowboarding and freestyle skiing events. And I think I know why. Those events are really channelling the look and feel of the wintery sports sims I’ve always loved – especially those that arrived during a golden period in the mid-1990s.This was the era in which snowboarding was exploding in popularity, especially among twentysomethings with disposable incomes and no responsibilities – which coincidentally was the games industry’s target market at the time. Perhaps the first title to take advantage of this trend was Namco’s 1996 arcade game Alpine Surfer, which challenged players to stand on a snowboard-shaped controller and swoop as quickly as possible down a mountainside – it was one of the most physically exhausting coin-ops I ever played. Later that year came the self-consciously hip PlayStation sim Cool Boarders, and then in 1998, my absolute favourite, 1080°Snowboardingon the N64, with it’s intuitive analog controls and incredibly authentic sound effects of boards cutting through deep, crisp snow.What I think is bringing these classics back to mind is the highly immersive presentation of the events at Milano Cortina. Most obviously, there’s the innovative use of first-person view drone cameras, which provide live chase-cam footage from behind and slightly above the competitors. Watching the snowboard cross events, in which four competitors race against each other over steep, ramped courses, now looks and feels almost exactly like playing the Race mode in 1080° Snowboarding, which was viewed from a similar angle and pitted players against AI-controlled boarders. In both experiences, you’re right there among the riders, pushing and jostling for the perfect racing line.View image in fullscreenClose to the action … a snowboard race at the Milano Cortina games.Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the use of stroboscopic analysis and 360-degree replay systemsthat together let broadcasters freeze, zoom in on and slow-mo very specific moments, also mimics the highly elaborate replays that modern 3D sports sims revel in. A decade ago, sports channels such as ESPN started to pull inspiration from the Fifa Football games by using CGI to enliven replays and on-screen stats, bringing viewers closer to the action and helping them understand the skills and tactics on show. Could the Olympic Broadcasting Services be breaking out their retro consoles for similar inspiration?The BBC is also channelling – perhaps unknowingly – this era of video games in its Olympic commentary. For the freestyle events, the corporation is using ex-competitor Tim Warwood and veteran extreme sports presenter Ed Leigh. The duo has brought a huge amount of technical knowledge to the events, but also a sense of relaxed, playful fandom, recalling the wildly enthusiastic in-game commentary used in the Cool Boarders and SSX titles, where experienced voiceover actors such as Mark Hildreth (Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots) and Mel McMurrin (Twisted Metal), yelled all the 90s boarder slang they could muster. SSX even featured famed beatboxer Rahzel bringing his range of sound effects to the mix. Those games recognised pro snowboarding not just as a sport but as a culture, like skateboarding, with its own music, language and fashion sensibilities – and the Milano Cortina games are reflecting that.View image in fullscreenSmooth … 1080° Snowboarding.Photograph: MobyGames/NintendoIn 1999, Activision released Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, the series that truly cemented the relationship between street/extreme sports and video games – but the snowboarding titles got there first, and it has been curiously emotional to find their analogue in the Milano Cortina coverage. After watching Huw Nightingale and Charlotte Bankestake the goldin the snowboard cross event on Sunday evening, I dug out 1080° Snowboarding and gave it a shot. Although the graphics are dated, it still has that lovely feel of smooth movement through deep snow, the camera lurking just behind the boarders as they zigzag down the narrow slopes. Games borrow from sport and viceversa, and this symbiotic relationship has no doubt proved profitable for both. But it can also create unexpected moments of magic and nostalgia – and that has certainly been the case at Milano Cortina, even for those of us who have never stood on a snowboard, let alone at the peak of a frosty mountain run.What to playView image in fullscreenHuge-toothed violence … Dino Crisis 1.Photograph: CapcomReleased in the shadow of the Resident Evil series, Capcom’s dinosaur horror adventures share a lot of similarities with their zombie stablemates: groups of spec-ops soldiers placed in remote locations with minimal ammo only to be attacked by a variety of dangerous monsters. Now, bothDino Crisis 1 and 2have been rereleased on Steam allowing veterans and newcomers to discover and reassess these overlooked classics.Director Shinji Mikami, who also created Resident Evil, refers to them as “panic horror” games in contrast to the slower-paced “survival horror” of the Resi titles. Taking cues from Jurassic Park, you’re are continually stalked and ambushed by giant reptiles in wild moments of huge-toothed violence, but there are periods of tension too. Of the two, I prefer the original which more closely resembles Mikami’s Resident Evil titles. The sequel produced by another Resident Evil veteran Kobayashi Hiroyuki dials up the action and bloody intensity. The rereleases update the visuals but don’t mess too much with the formula. I’m hoping they will foreshadow a long-awaited reboot for the series.Available on:PCEstimated playtime:15-20 hours eachWhat to readView image in fullscreenHideki Sato managed to bring the excitement of arcade games into people’s homes.Photograph: Justin Towell/AlamyOn Sunday,the news brokethat Sega’s hardware mastermindHideki Satohas died.

In Super Nintendo, I explore how this singular developer shaped the modern video game industry – and why its games have meant so much to so many. Drawing on interviews with its leading creators and lifelong fans, this is more than a nostalgia trip: it’s a story about why play matters, and what Nintendo can teach us about ourselves.

I dusted them down and miraculously they’re still working. Now I’d really like to maintain them properly – but how do I do that?”As the owner of about 20 vintage gaming systems, from a Prinztronic Tournament TV Game (one of the many Pong-style consoles released in the late 1970s) to a Sega Pico (a garish green electronic reading toy for children), maintenance is a constant obsession of mine. Your main concerns are environmental – you need to keep the machines at about 18C and no more than 50% humidity. I have a dehumidifier that comes on automatically when the number creeps up to 51. Wipe them regularly with a decent microfibre cloth that removes and retains dust, or use a small vacuum cleaner attachment to suck dust from the grills and other vulnerable places. Also, give your consoles plenty of room for ventilation when switched on – don’t stack them on top of each other, or put them in cubby holes.If you put them back into storage, I’d advise airtight plastic containers, with a silica gel pack or two to take care of any moisture (these will need to be replaced – I do it quarterly). Sadly, there’s always a chance that an internal component will fail at some point – your SNES is likely to be over 30 years old, after all. If you’re not ready to let go, there are a growing number of vintage console restorers online.

Nonetheless, here it is: a feature film in the Berlin competition from screenwriter Angelo Tijssens and director Anke Blondé, handsomely produced and shot, and impeccably acted. But it’s also weirdly parochial, leaving you with the sense that it has not reached beyond its immediate concerns; and it’s not clear as to why, exactly, we need a fictionalised crisis from the 90s inspired by areal-life financial fraud scandal.Well, perhaps the point is that very smallness and sadness: a pathetic tale of the first, almost-forgotten dotcom bust, which holds an omen for our AI-obsessed present. Arieh Worthalter and Jan Hammenecker play Geert and Luc, two balding guys who, in the late 90s, are Belgium’s pinup boys of tech innovation. Their startup company has gone public and made them both very rich, and all their local friends, family and businesses have plunged every cent of their savings into shares. Geert and Luc are now poised to turn the mud of Flanders into a European Silicon Valley.There is some droll comedy as the two host a dynamic corporate presentation in which, to gasps from the assembled suit-wearing attendees, they unveil what in 2026 looks like hilariously clunky voice-to-text hardware. Steve Jobs these guys ain’t. But in the audience is investigative journalist Aaron (Anthony Welsh), who confronts them with the awful truth: for years they have been fabricating profits to boost their share price, secure lucrative government grants and, on some unconscious level, bolster their own ridiculous egos. His story will break on Monday, leaving them and their investors penniless, and with Geert and Luc facing a prison sentence.The film follows the calvary of their empty Sunday before the police arrive, as they scramble around individually for a way out, burning and shredding bales of documents, with Luc suspecting that Geert is going to sell him down the river. Both have secret stashes of cash. Geert, a gay man, is in a casual relationship with his driver-assistant Kenneth (Thibaud Dooms) who, however, has no place in Geert’s new scheme: jetting off that very day to a South American country with no extradition arrangements with Belgium. Geert pays a last visit to his sister, who runs a bakery and doesn’t know she faces ruin because of her investment in his worthless firm, but he can’t warn her to sell for fear of providing evidence of insider trading.Animol review – gritty young offenders drama challenges conventional machismoRead moreLuc has family: a dad in a care home to whom he pays one final, poignant visit to ask if the old man is “proud of him”, plus a wife who tolerates him and an estranged grownup daughter who does not. His final emotional breakdown-slash-epiphany comes when his BMW gets stuck in a muddy field and he staggers out into the rain and gazes at a couple of cows, who gaze incuriously back. Is this the brutal, unglamorous truth? His dreams of a glitzy future here mocked by the reality of an economy which was for centuries suitable only for agriculture? Do these cows embody a primitive innocence which he can only see now?The “dust” of the title is that dust into which all of these vain dreams of riches will crumble. Maybe “mud” would have served just as well.Dust screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmBerlin film festivalFestivalsBerlin film festival 2026BelgiumPeriod and historical filmsEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Remind you of anyone?Wed 18 Feb 2026 10.13 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 10.25 ESTShareDid British petrochemicals billionaire and Manchester United’s controlling minority owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, really mean itwhen he proclaimedto Sky News that “the UK is being colonized by immigrants”?Is Ratcliffe simply a gutter racist or actually making a cynical political play that may redound to his benefit down the line when Britain faces downyet another period of political upheavalas the country’s old factions continue to fracture? There’s reasonabledebate to be had there.There’s also a good point about whether even engaging with this sordid rhetoric puts an unfair onus on immigrants by forcing them to tout their contributions and accomplishments – andit, too, has been made. You may even ask the question of whether prefixing someone with a royally conferred honorific in recognition of all their good work insuperheating the planetmakes them feel untouchable.As far as soccer is concerned, however, the outcome of any of these discussions sort of doesn’t matter. Neither does Ratcliffe’s half-hearted walk-back of his comments in that actually-not-really-walking-it-back kind of way, doing the semantic I’m-sorry-if-you-were-offended non-apology. Nor does theswift backlash, or Manchester Uniteddistancingthemselves from the words of the man ostensibly running the club.Because the upshot is the same. The sport has taken another long stride towards total Trumpism. And perhaps its journey to that fetid place is now complete.David Squires on … Jim Ratcliffe’s comments and his need for some home truthsRead moreRatcliffe has been in the public eye more than long enough to know that, when he speaks, he not only represents himself but also his pollution empire and the privatized public good, United, that has wound up in his care. He has offered Bad Takes before, frombacking Brexittopromisingthat Ruben Amorim would serve out his three-year contract as United manager, and understands how they will be received. Still, he felt free to make his comments on immigrants before a TV camera and an audience of millions anyway.Set aside, for a moment, that a member of the English elite has an opinion on colonialism, and the fact that United’s senior men’s team alone currently counts 19 players from outside the UK. Ratcliffe plainly thinks that there are no longer any limits to what can be uttered out in the open without getting expelled from polite society, or indeed damaging the brand of one of the world’s most popular soccer clubs.In that sense, the sport remains in lockstep with our overclouded zeitgeist.Just an inch or so beneath its veneer of beauty, soccer is an odious sport. It has historically turned a blind eye to all manner of abuses. It will take money from anyone at all. It will make money in any way it can. Clubs embraced NFTs when everyone involved should have known they were a fad. Whatever brings in the money required to win games.The paranoid style has coursed through the sport for decades, but it’s been dialed up recently with Real Madrid TVgoing full tinfoil hat, while fans of every club appear to see any decision going against their teamas a global conspiracy. To the list of sins already containing grifts and intrigues and swindles we can add performative political incorrectness. Because that barrier has been broken through now, no matter the intentions or merits behind Ratcliffe’s words.US actions in Venezuela put the 2026 World Cup in disgraceful company | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreSound like any recent political movement you may have heard of?If soccer’s tribalism made its slow creep towards this toxicity somewhat inevitable, it was knowingly led there by its putative leader, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, and hisembrace of Donald Trump. Infantino’s kowtowing to Trump aligned soccer with the US president’s combativeness and scheming and nihilism from the top down. The generous view is that Infantino debased himself in the interests of pulling off a successful and maximally lucrative World Cup in North America in 2026, the better to safeguard his organization and the sport it stewards. But the outcome is all the same. And this trend will not be readily reversed.The thing that is likely to long outlast Trump’s hateful political career is the blanket permission he bestowed on people to let their asshole flags fly. The effects of this unspoken edict are readily discernible throughout everyday American life in the erosion of its common courtesies. People are a little meaner, a little angrier, displaying a kind of road rage that spills out of them long after they leave their cars.Whereas much of the soccer industry once took care to stay out of the politics of the day, hewing instead to more long-term values, many of the sport’s prominent figures have abandoned their studious apolitical stance. What was once ostensibly a gentleman’s game is now animated in no small part by grievance and wariness. The people in it feel less and less constrained in their behavior and speech, from the player verbally abusing the referee all the way up to the billionaire co-owner heaving up his anti-immigrant views for everyone to hear.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

These deaths are measurable, documented and ongoing. Concluding otherwise is just playing pretend. Studies explain the mechanics, but lived experience supplies the truth. The people who suffer the consequences see the fire rising and water closing in. They need their government’s help.Despite that, the president of the United States stood at a microphone last Thursday andabdicated his duty to them. “It has nothing to do with public health,”he claimedabout the climate crisis while announcing that the federal government wouldrepeal the Environmental Protection Agency’s “endangerment finding”, a determination that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare. “This is all a scam, a giant scam.”What he was lying about is a truth the federal government – even under his first administration – has embraced for nearly two decades. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the “endangerment finding” in 2009. Drawing upon extensive scientific evidence, the EPA concluded that emissions driving the climate crisis contribute to extreme heat, intensified storms, rising sea levels, wildfires and degraded air quality, all of which carry direct consequences for human life and safety.The endangerment finding was not rhetorical flourish. It was the legal keystone of modern US climate regulation, the scientific and administrative determination that enabled the federal government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. It formed the basis for emissions standards governing vehicles, power plants and industry.Erase that finding, and you do more than undermine the Clean Air Act and the regulatory framework it supports. The move dismantles the authority that made those protections possible in the first place. In the process, the president is withdrawing official recognition of a danger millions of Americans are already living through.This is on brand. Trump is wont to redefine documented facts, definitions and knowledge until it bears no resemblance to reality. When confronted with his own electoral defeat, he reframes it asfraudanduses government powerto buttress that con.When addressing racism, he and his acolytes falsely and exclusively reframe it as discrimination against white Americans. The Trump White House doesn’t so much contest facts as it attempts to erase them.Now, confronted with a warming planet, the Trump administration is risking something even moreconsequential: redefining and exacerbating an existing danger to his constituents. Across the country, people are confronting the climate crisis not as a projection but as past and present conditions – living on top oftoxic fracking sites,smoke-choked skiesandstrained power grids.The climate crisis is not a forecast. It is an incident report. It long ago moved beyond the theoretical, and its harms do not fall evenly.Black Americans, for example, are more likely to live near polluting infrastructure and suffer disproportionate exposure to toxic air. They experience higher rates of premature death tied to pollution-related illness. Environmental justice advocates warn that dismantling the endangerment finding removes one of the federal government’s last legal shields against these harms – leaving frontline communities more exposed as climate risks intensify.That vulnerability extends beyond chronic pollution exposure to acute disaster impact.The Eaton fire in California– which destroyed more than 16,000 structures – underscores how climate-intensified catastrophes often fall hardest on communities with the least infrastructure, insurance coverage and political leverage to recover.There is also a strategic irony embedded in Trump’s latest retreat. In refusing to fight the climate crisis, the administration risks undermining the nationalist politics it claims to champion.The climate crisis does not stop at national borders. Drought, crop failure and rising seas arealready displacing populations abroad, fuelingmigration flowswealthier nations struggle to absorb. Weakening climate mitigation while simultaneously hardening borders ignores the causal chain connecting the two – a posture that risks intensifying the very displacement pressures it claims to resist.Racism may color Trump’s politics, but it is probably not the sole driver here. The economic incentives are clear: erasing the finding would benefit polluters and the oligarchs behind them. The administration’s retreat from climate responsibility is hardly passive. As it works to erase the scientific finding that allows the federal government to regulate greenhouse gases, it is simultaneouslydirecting the Pentagon to purchase coal-fired power– using federal muscle to sustain the very industry fueling planetary warming. It is one thing to deny a crisis. It is another to help finance it.What Trump’s decision most clearly reflects, however, is a governing pattern the president has exhibited for years: distancing himself from responsibility for the harm he commits, even when the consequences are measurable and grave.Recognition of danger undergirds our laws, enabling enforcement and creating the possibility of accountability. In the absence of findings like the EPA’s 2009 report, the government’s response to climate harm would rest largely on moral duty rather than enforceable obligation – a posturefar more vulnerable to political discretion. Without formal recognition of danger, citizens and states lose one of their strongest legal footholds for compelling federal action when disaster strikes.Should this erasure stand upafter the inevitable court challenges, the government’s declared obligation to confront those realities with the full weight of its authority would disappear. The harm would not disappear, however. The only thing that changes is the terrain on which citizens can demand protection. The fires still burn. The heat still kills. The floods still come.When someone like Trump rescinds the recognition of a documented danger already harming the people he’s charged with serving, it is not a mere change of policy. The president is refusing to do his job.Jamil Smith is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsClimate crisisPollutionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Now the defining word of our era has lost its meaningOliver EagletonIn the 2010s it described an insurgent rhetorical style; in the 2020s it is inadequate to account for the wildly diverging fates of the left and rightWed 18 Feb 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 15.31 ESTShare“Populism” may well have been the defining word of the previous decade: a shorthand for the insurgent parties that came to prominence in the 2010s, challenging the dominance of the liberal centre. But no sooner had it become the main rubric for discussing both the far left and far right than commentators began to question its validity: worrying that it wastoo vague, or toopejorative, orfuellingthe forces to which it referred.Now, with the fortunes of the two political poles heading in different directions – the right gaining ground across the west while much of the left struggles to rebound from serial defeats – the notion that this word could encompass such different players seems even less plausible. For a lucid account of these forces, we might have to shift our focus elsewhere: finding terms that can explain their unequal balance of power, so that we can in turn find the proper remedy.The difficulty of separating the real nature of populism from the fraught discourse that surrounds it is telling, because among the only confident claims we can make about the populist phenomenon is that it places an enormous stress on language. Indelible slogans, silver-tongued leaders, a direct address to “the people”: these were common elements in the otherwise disparate range of electoral projects that surged after the great recession of 2007-2009, rejecting bromides about “unity” and “consensus” for the hard semantic distinction between “us” and “them”.For all the problems with the populist label, it was at least able to capture this highly rhetorical mode of politics, which took root at a time when most political expression was confined to the realm of words rather than deeds: Twitter (now X) fulminations and dinner-table rows as opposed to strikes and street fights. If populism was to some extent an empty signifier, it reflected a political culture that had been emptied out – with the decline of mass parties, trade unions and other voluntary associations leaving few channels for activism. The erosion of these structures forced outsider politicians to find other means to advance. Rather than building such popular bases, they relied on soundbites to monopolise the attention economy and turn out disenchanted voters.But while “populism” was a useful summation of these electoral strategies, it was less able to delineate what such leaders hoped to do once they were in government. In the US, for example,Bernie Sanderswas clear that his aim as president would be to harness the state to reactivate the labour movement and disempower the corporate sector. The cabal around Donald Trump also has a considered plan to reorient state policy by centralising authority in the executive and weaponising it against racialised groups. Although populism may have been the means, the ends were more extensive. By thinking of Sanders and Trump solely in terms of their campaign methods, commentators sidestepped a more thorough analysis of their governing projects: radical social democracy or hardline neo-nationalism.Over the past decade, one of these projects has continued to accrue power – not only in the US, but also in Italy, Finland, Slovakia, Hungary, Britain, France and elsewhere – while the other has mostly been marginalised. It turned out that when the left and right battled on the terrain of discourse, with politics often reduced to a series of sales pitches, the odds were in favour of the right, not least because a partisan media was willing to diffuse its message. The upshot is that Sanders’s social democracy remains merely an idea, while Trumpian neo-nationalism is increasingly a reality.Given this development, the limits of the populist paradigm have become even more clear. The primary feature of our politics is no longer underdog candidates using this toolkit to capture the state; it is the left trying to reconstitute itself after the failure of that enterprise, while much of the right consolidates its success. Socialists have realised that populism, as a political practice, is not strong enough to resist an onslaught from the most powerful institutions in society: state ministries, centrist parties, legacy papers, the business lobby, the courts. Reactionaries, meanwhile, have learned that they can win elections on a populist platform, but they are still working out exactly what relationship to cultivate with these institutions. Post-populists on both sides are defined by how they approach such fortresses of the elite: not only in their rhetoric, but in their actions.Here the options are twofold. They can either compromise at risk of being assimilated, or mount a direct challenge at risk of being overwhelmed. In Spain, the current leader of the left, Yolanda Díaz, has taken the first path: trying to strike deals with the centre left and big business, yet repeatedly realising thelimits of her leverage. In France, by contrast, Jean-Luc Mélenchon has preserved his party’s political independence andrefusedto make any concessions that would threaten it, but this has so far left him tooisolatedto outpace his opponents.We can see a similar bifurcation out at the other end of the spectrum. Whereas leaders such as Italy’s Giorgia Meloni have pursued rapprochement with the traditional power bloc,backtrackingon their riskier policies, ones including Trump have adopted a more pugnacious strategy:assailingthe state bureaucracy,ignoringthe judiciary and oftenoverridingthe demands of business. Both left and right must decide between bargaining with traditional elites or attempting to bulldoze them.Once again, though, the odds are highly uneven. Just as the right finds it easier to win elections through populist messaging, it is also more able to navigate this choice between conciliation and confrontation. The reason is obvious. Socialists have a programme that would upend the present social order, while neo-nationalists are concerned with entrenching its hierarchies. One group wants to destroy the neoliberal consensus, the other to deepen its asymmetries of class, race and gender. The institutions that superintend this system will therefore put up greater resistance to the left than to the right. They may block some of the latter’s most destabilising actions – such as trying to steal elections – but they understand that there is no fundamental misalignment of their interests. So regardless of whether neo-nationalists are more peaceable or aggressive, gradualist or accelerationist, they can use these power centres to drive their project forward: a luxury that progressives lack.“Populism” cannot illuminate these trends – not just because the term is too broad or loaded, but because it was more relevant to a specific period in which upstarts tried to break the electoral dominance of the centre by using various language games: the many against the few, insiders against outsiders. While these discourses haven’t gone away, their importance is diminished in a world where that dominance has now been shattered, and where the contest between left and right populism has been decided in favour of the right. A better approach to our present moment would be to study how both forces are trying, from very different starting points, to make their way in the institutional landscape of neoliberalism: the left seemingly thwarted whether it chooses compromise or conflict, the right able to march onward by either means. It will be extraordinarily difficult to overturn this situation. We must start by grasping the substance of contemporary politics, not simply its style.Oliver Eagleton is managing editor at Phenomenal WorldExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionDonald TrumpGiorgia MelonicommentShareReuse this content"

I’m not as careful as I should be, but I try to buy things advertised as being discounted, or on special. But after following a recent case before the federal court, I’ll be checking my old receipts before accepting such claims. In particular, I’ll be avoiding “Down Down” promotions. On the evidence before the court, such promotions are routinely used as a way of implementing priceincreases.The facts of the case are simple and apparently uncontested. One example is particularly striking. Over a period of nearly a year, Coles offered a 1.2kg loaf of Nature’s Gift wet dog food for $4. Then, for seven days, the price rose by 50% to $6. On the eighth day the price was set at $4.50, more than customers had been paying for all but seven of the previous 303 days, with Coles labelling the product “Down Down”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe only unusual feature of this path to higher prices was the short duration of the large increase. According to Coles’ lawyers, the more common pattern was to raise the price for six to 12 weeks, then partially reverse the increase and advertise “Down Down”. As the evidence regarding deals with Arnott’s makes clear, this strategy is planned in advance as a way of raising prices without upsetting consumers. In their defence, Coles claimed that Woolworths’ “Prices Dropped” program (the subject of a separate ACCC case) was even worse.More broadly the defence was that consumers were incapable of understanding the many complexities of pricing decisions. But most of us are capable of understanding the idea that taking prices two steps up then moving them one step down still leaves them higher. Whatever the outcome of the court case, it’s hard to believe that Coles will be able to get away with “Down, Down” promotions in future, even if they are genuinely reducing prices.Coles tells court its Down Down promotions were ‘fair dinkum’ and did not mislead shoppersRead moreIn the long run, then, it seems as if this kind of sharp practice should be self-defeating. The banks, for example, have spent years trying to shake off the bad reputation they built up for hidden fees and charges in the years leading up to the financial services royal commission.Woolworths and Coles are big companies that plan to stay around for a long time. Could not one or both of them commit to a policy of truthful advertising and stand by it long enough to establish a reputation that customers could trust?This hasn’t happened – with supermarkets, or telecoms, or banks or anywhere else, at least in the absence of comprehensive public shaming driven by government action. But why not?One explanation, apparent from the evidence in the Coles case, is that no one wants to be the first to move. Given the short-term pressure that decision-makers are under, it’s easy to imagine that any proposal of this kind will be put in the too-hard basket and left there.Another possibility is that distrust is so widespread that no single company can break the pattern. The era of neoliberalism has certainly strengthened this distrust. There was a time when used car dealers were famously untrustworthy but financial institutions were pillars of probity. Today, when buying a second-hand car, the biggest risk is not that the speedo will be wound back but that you will be sold a loan with deceptively high interest. In this context, you just assume everyone is lying.Coles offered ‘utterly misleading’ discounts ACCC argues in federal court caseRead moreThe final, gloomy, hypothesis is that Coles’ lawyers are right, and that we are proving the wisdom of HL Mencken’s observation that “No one in this world, so far as I know … has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people” (put more succinctly by PT Barnum as “there’s a sucker born every minute”).Perhaps we are simply incapable of resisting an apparent bargain, even when we know there’s bound to be a catch. For years, we all fell for the illusion of items priced at $9.99 or similar, rather than the honest price of $10. Partly because of the digital economy, this particular trick seems to have faded away.But the same digital economy has far nastier tricks in mind for us. The trickery of “Down Down” seems childish compared to the wonders of personalised pricing, where sellers set a price specifically aimed at being the maximum you are willing to pay, and precisely when you are primed to buy. The only solution, it appears, is to build your own AI agents, to trick the company algorithm into seeing you as a desirable customer.John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s school of economicsExplore more on these topicsColesOpinionBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

Still, there is fun in seeing the world as it wasWed 18 Feb 2026 11.05 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 15.30 ESTShareThere’s a funny moment towards the end ofThe Tony Blair Story, Channel 4’s three-part documentary about the former prime minister, in which Blair is asked to introspect about his own personality. For the previous three hours or so we have enjoyed a series of talking heads picking over his premiership. Now he breaks the fourth wall and, with something like incredulity, says what’s the point of asking him to identify his own weaknesses when all he’ll give is a “politician’s answer”. Reminded he’s no longer a politician, Blair replies as honestly as at any point in the encounter: “You’re always a politician.”It is one of the more satisfying exchanges in Michael Waldman’s series, which, depending on your view, is either a futile exercise in confirming one’s existing prejudices about Blair, or more than three hours of great telly. I’m inclined towards the latter, partly for the enjoyment it offers of being yanked back to the memory of all those old horribles. Nothing dates quicker than an out of office politician and it’s a particular nostalgia that’s triggered by footage of Robin Cook at John Smith’s funeral, or Max Hastings describing Blair’s henchmen as “absolutely ruthless bastards”, or Jack Straw being interviewed in a black velvet jacket like something from Death on the Nile.View image in fullscreenTony Blair addresses the nation for the first time as prime minister alongside his wife Cherie.Photograph: PA/AlamyAnd if there’s nothing new to discover, the remembrance of old battles still satisfies. I was amused by Jonathan Powell’s recollection of Mo Mowlam telling him, in relation to Blair’s success in Northern Ireland, that “Tony succeeded because he thought he was fucking Jesus.” After Kosovo, says Robert Harris, Blair “thought he could walk on water” – diagnosing Blair’s Jesus complex runs like a motif through the show. So, too, does the accusation that Blair’s EQ always outstripped his IQ, often made by people who may themselves not be the brains of Britain. Here’s Jeremy Corbyn, look, whose assessment of Blair as “a man in denial” – not an unfair judgment – would be more authoritative if it didn’t come from someone so apparently incapable of internalising lessons from his own clanging defeats. Blair, he says, got himself into a “messianic trench” over Iraq, which is certainly a trench I’d like to see.View image in fullscreenTony Blair, John Prescott and Gordon Brown at Labour party conference in Blackpool, 1998.Photograph: Don McPhee/The GuardianIf Waldman doesn’t relitigate Iraq in any meaningful way, that leaves the voyeuristic family stuff. Look at baby Leo, now a strapping 25-year-old, and two of his three siblings, Kathryn and Euan, saying sensible things about their dad. Cherie comes across as a real force, talking with a don’t-give-a-monkeys-any-more honesty. Asked whether she felt sorry forGordon Brownwhen Blair snatched the leadership, she looks frankly astounded, as well she might. Cherie, per her own account, pushed her husband to get behind a different successor when Brown’s turn finally came around, underscoring a persistent unwillingness on the part of observers to process the vicious reality of political rivalry.Similarly delusional on the part of Blair’s critics: the perennial question of money, about which this country remains wilfully babyish, affecting to be shocked – shocked! – that someone with the ambition for high office might be interested in spending more than 300 quid on a suit or making more money than an entry level banker. (See Jacinda Ardern’s current presence on the world’s speaker circuit, and who can blame her.)Other stuff: Bill Clinton clearly sympathetic to Blair’s divided loyalties between the US and Europe in the run-up to Iraq, and choosing his words very carefully. Pushed on whether he thinks Blair made a mistake going to war, Clinton concedes of his old friend that “he was in a pickle”. Blair, meanwhile, presents his decision to support George W Bush not as poodledom, but pragmatism. Britain, he implies, is a small country with a middle-sized economy deluded about its own place in the world; of course he threw in his lot with the US.View image in fullscreenTony Blair and Bill Clinton at a Nato summit in Paris in May 1997.Photograph: Charles Platiau/ReutersThe irony of this assessment is that, of course, the thing Blair ends up being most credibly accused of is his own delusional overreach. Possibly that delusion persists. Prodded by Waldman, Blair avers that, in his role as head of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, he may have more power now than he did as prime minister. That he hasbeen announced, alongside Jared Kushner, as part of the transitional authority to oversee post-conflict Gaza makes one think: “Hasn’t the region suffered enough?”And so it wasn’t for Blair himself that I came away feeling nostalgic; shots of theGallagher brothers at Downing Streetin the late 90s remain embarrassing. I did, however, feel nostalgic for an era of political optimism that is impossible to find anywhere today; an era during which the country’s spirits matched the energy of a leader habitually captured by cameras boarding a plane by sprinting up the stairs at full speed.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTony BlairOpinionTelevisionLabourGordon BrowncommentShareReuse this content"

Not only have workers seen their purchasing power decline, but the RBA’s decision toraise interest rateshas once again punished them for inflation that was not their fault.Before I go any further, excuse me while I go to the calendar and mark off yet another three months without a wage breakout. It’s a ritual I have been able to do my entire working life.There hasn’t been a wage breakout since I was in primary school but do not worry – the RBA is still on the watch, ever on alert to raise interest rates in an effort to increase unemployment and lower wage growth.‘It matters if you have a parent with an expensive house’: how Australia’s great wealth transfer threatens faith in the fair goRead moreEarlier this month the RBA raised interest rates because, as theminutes of the board meetingstated, “wages growth had also slowed only gradually, and unit labour costs growth remained high, supporting the view that the labour market remained a little tight”.What this means is they believe too few people are unemployed (the labour market is tight) and, as a result, employers are having to keep offering better wages in order to entice people to work for them. This, they believe, is causing inflation to go up.In response they increased interest rates in the hope that people will spend less, employers will cut back on staff and hours and as a result not feel like they need to raise wages.The RBA never misses an opportunity to blame wages for inflation because it really is the only reason to raise interest rates.So it is a tad unnerving to discover that thelatest wage growth figuresshowed that wages in 2025 rose just 3.4% – below the annual inflation rate of 3.8% and even below the 3.6% level of the old quarterly CPI:If the graph does not display click hereIt meant that for the first time in more than two years the annual growth of real wages (ie taking into account inflation) went backwards:If the graph does not display click hereIt is axiomatic that if prices are rising faster than wages then wages cannot be the reason prices are rising.David Richardson, my colleague at the Australia Institute, has used the forecasts in the RBA’s latest monetary police statement to show that the central bank itself knows wage growth is not fuelling higher inflation.Richardson has taken into account wage growth and inflation forecast, as well as productivity growth and the share of the total economy made up of wages. This enabled him to then calculate what is causing inflation.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIt essentially boils down to two groups: wages and non-wages. The latter category includes mostly company profits and small business income.Three years ago, this type of analysis found that profits were the main cause of inflation through 2021 and 2022. These latest figures show that “profit-push” inflation is back.The recent inflation jump and the expected increases to come this year are not being caused by wages growth. The RBA’s own figures suggest the impact of wages on inflation is actually going to go down. Instead, we need to look elsewhere – at profits:If the graph does not display click hereThe RBA also knows this.In its Februarystatementit noted that “strong demand enabled retailers to increase prices by more than might be expected given changes in the prices of imported consumer goods”. That is a polite way of saying companies raised their prices purely to increase their profits.And guess what inflation measures? Yep, the rise in prices!Oddly there was no mention of this in the minutes of the RBA board meeting that decided to raise rates.In a totally unrelated note, this weekJB Hi-Fi announceda 7.1% lift in net profit for the half year, and last weekthe Commonwealth Bank announcedit made a half-yearly profit of $5.45bn – up 7%.It’s always fun when profits can grow faster than inflation but apparently they are all good because profits come from thin air and have nothing to do with prices (or increased interest rates).We now are at the position that the value of average real wages is the same as it was 15 years ago and just over 4% lower than it was in March 2021:If the graph does not display click hereWorse still, the Reserve Bank forecast that real wages will be essentially flat for the next two years.That would be bad enough but, given the RBA itself is actively working to prevent wages growing faster than inflation, you can forgive workers for feeling the economy is rigged against them.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and chief economist at the Australia InstituteExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsReserve Bank of AustraliaInflationcommentShareReuse this content"

We must end this obsession with ‘hot takes’Roger Mosey is a former head of BBC TV NewsWed 18 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 11.18 ESTShareAlmost everybody, including Keir Starmer, can see thatthe Peter Mandelson affairprovoked a genuine political crisis. The media were right to make it headline news. But it also shows the febrile atmosphere in which politicians and the media conspire to turn every incident into an issue of confidence in leadership, and we are becoming a country where it is impossible to focus on the long term. Hyped-up hot takes are far more loved in Westminster than bringing the nation the sustained change that it needs.There is nothing new in the obsession with political process. I was guilty of it myself when I was editor of the Today programme duringJohn Major’s attempt to ratify the Maastricht treaty in the 1990s. We gleefully put on air rebels and loyalists as the government battled for survival, and our listeners had a far better briefing on the meltdown within the Conservative party than they did on what was in the treaty. This was part of a pattern in which, for decades, EU affairs were seen through a British party prism rather than explaining what was going on in Europe.I’ve seen the BBC flat out on the canvas before. Brave journalism is the best way to hit back | Roger MoseyRead moreBut it has got worse. Our attention spans have become shorter, and the arrival of social media has intensified the fury in the national debate. For politicians and journalists alike, a viral post – the punchier the better – represents a good day in the office. You no longer need to wait to be invited on to Radio 4’sWorld at Oneto make your case against your leader, because a few words on X during a boring train journey can change the news agenda in an instant. It would be stretching it to say that this is responsible for the rapid turnover of ministers and prime ministers – the global financial crisis and Brexit have had rather more of an effect – but the media environment hasn’t helped at all.A former senior editor puts it like this: “Most of the media today can’t bear to look at what’s actually wrong with Britain because that’s policy and needs work that they can’t be bothered to do. In any case, why worry when the next sugar-rush of personality or quasi-inquest politics will be along in a minute?”And yet this downward spiral – this doom loop of politics and the media – is not inevitable. If there is a rationale for public service media, and also for organisations attempting good journalism, it is that they should be able to stand aside from the noise and hysteria and focus on what really matters. Too often they don’t. One of the classic vignettes was Rishi Sunak being asked by the BBC’s political editor in a news conference after a 2023 G7 summit in Japan, not about the world economy or climate change, but abouta speeding offence by Suella Braverman. Sunak’s response – “Did you have any questions about the summit?” – was portrayed as evidence of his tetchiness.View image in fullscreenRishi Sunak attends a press conference following the G7 leaders’ summit in Hiroshima, Japan, 21 May 2023.Photograph: Issei Kato/APIn the current government, everything is seen through a prism of Starmer’s survival, and initiatives by ministers – home secretary Shabana Mahmood’scrackdown on immigration, for example – invariably see the focus being placed on their own supposed leadership ambitions.There is not an overall bias in favour of one or other party, but there is unquestionably a bias in favour of increasing dissent and generating stories for 24-hour news outlets. Kemi Badenoch has been repeatedly asked why she’s not doing better in the polls, when the evidence of the past is that it takes many years to recover from a landslide defeat. Every Sunday on the political shows, there is a drumbeat about Labour’s bad polling, when we are still more than three years away from a general election. It is becoming standard, rather than the exception, to assume that a leader might have to quit midterm if things don’t improve as quickly as journalists think they should.Memories are short, too. The Today programmewent full-on emotional last weekin challenging a government minister about why Starmer, as a father, had approved the appointment of Mandelson as ambassador to the US given his friendship with a child sex offender. But at the time of the hiring, vanishingly few of the fathers in journalism seem to have raised this point, despite everything they already knew about Mandelson.This is not arguing for politicians to be given a soft ride. I’m in favour of giving them a harder time, which would happen if they and journalists were given space to think. The process stories of the Westminster bubble generate energy-sapping interviews, in which politicians parrot the lines they have given by their party. I would much rather hear the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, on her planned reforms to special educational needs and disabilities (Send), or the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, on dealing with the US. All the more so because the last election campaign barely touched on the more intractable issues and was consumed instead by frothing aboutSunak’s attendance record at D-dayand the allegedbetting scandal in Downing Street.Labour won the election on a policy-light platform that was designed to be resistant to attacks by the media; and, predictably, it turned out that they didn’t have enough thought-through policies and nor could they claim a mandate for them. Welfare reform is the prime example.We cannot change the nature of politicians who like to play the political game, and nor can we put the malign social media genie back in its bottle. But we can, still, do better than this. “Sensationalist” is a word used by a broadcasting colleague to describe recent coverage.

And the moral: focus on what matters and stop making stupid mistakesWed 18 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 06.37 ESTShareWhat were they thinking?Labourinherited the worst of everything, including prisons beyond breaking point, court backlogs as bad as NHS waiting lists, children cast into exceptional destitution, the National Grid unable to cope with demand, reservoirs unbuilt while sewage poured into rivers, high debt, no money and deep public distrust in politics. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves were honest about what they found.So what on earth can have seized them, within months of taking over, to decide this was a good time for a gigantic English council re-disorganisation? Angela Rayner, who was in charge of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government at the time,kicked it offin December 2024. But why, when councils are near-bankrupt and crippled by the ballooning costs of social care and provision for children withspecial educational needs and disabilities?Steve Reed,the local government secretary,boasted to council leadersthis week that it will “deliver the most ambitious reforms of local government in a generation”. But what for? Local government reform wasn’t in the manifesto. Until it was legally challenged – because the reorganisation would have delayed local elections in 30 places in England–it barely featured on the political horizon because it had no political purpose. Few peopleknow much about what responsibilities fall to different layers of local authority and national government – which is why mayors are a good idea, putting an identifiable person in charge. Few peoplebother to vote: average council election turnout in 2024 was30.8%, not much changed over recent decades. There was scant political mileage in this, butgreat organisational risk.The shake-up merges districts into county councils, creating unitary authorities in some areas, with neighbouring councils merging in others. Given the country’s present cynical anti-politics state of mind, voters might suspect this is some kind of crafty gerrymander that will favour Labour. Not at all. On the contrary, scores of towns and cities with a distinct political identity, many with universities, which usually vote Labour, Liberal Democrat or Green, will be swallowed up into large surrounding counties that traditionally vote blue. Oxford, Cambridge, Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter, Reading and many more will disappear as civic entities, losing their identities as they are melded into counties of opposing politics. No wonder neither theTories nor Reform put up objections to the plan itself.Voters like councillors more than MPs – so why is Labour wasting time destroying local democracy? | Polly ToynbeeRead moreHow did this happen? The suspicion is that the idea came from another of those dusty files sitting around on civil service shelves and wasbrought forward to an innocent new government as a fresh idea temptingly promising “efficiency” and “savings”. The NHS goes through such a process with almost every new health minister – just look what George Osborne was sold by the Treasury in his earlyomnishambles budget of “good ideas”, such as the pasty and the static caravan tax.Bigger can always be made to sound more effective, but there is rarely good evidence for that. Most organisations can be presented as untidy, but tidying them up usually makes things worse. The vast cost of the reorganisation itself is rarely computed, including the time wasted for hundreds of thousands of employees as they areforced to reapply for old jobs under new brass plates.Goodness knows what evidence Rayner and the rest were shown to persuade them to create this huge turbulence. There is no evidence that unitary councils do any better than areas with both district and county councils, according to Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics. He tells me: “There’s no evidence that Hampshire, with its district councils, is better or worse governed than, say, Buckinghamshire or other unitaries.”The House of Commons libraryresearch is also inconclusive: “It is not clear from available evidence whether unitary councils save money compared with a two-tier system,” says Travers.Perhaps what tempted Labour was a chance to pander to anti-politician public sentiment. Rayner’s original white paper laying out the proposal in 2024 boasted that it will mean “fewer [local] politicians”. That is a blunder that runs against the spirit ofdevolution, localism and reviving neighbourhoods. In a fragile democracy in which so few participate, withbarely 2% of the electoratebelonging to one of the three main parties, the valiant foot-soldiers of democracy are those willing to be councillors or to run local parties and create the actions that bind local communities together. MPs rely on their councillors, and their local parties all but collapse when they lose too many of them.The government’s newPride in Placestrategy will rely on councillors. But this council plan, as it boasts, means there will be many fewer. Travers says we alreadyhave many fewer elected representatives than most similar countries and our councillors have been vanishing fast, “from 75,000 in 1965, to only 11,000 that will be left after this”. Each councillor will be under far greater pressure, withfewer of them to represent larger councils ofhalf a million people. Reed has been boasting about a figure of 5,000 fewer councillors than there are currently, but he ignores the fact that people tend to like them. Polls reaching far back have always shown thatvoters trust their councillorstwice as much as they trust Westminster politicians.Another U-turn could stop this now, at least for most councils that have yet to begin their great upheaval. But that might bring even worse chaos. There is a lesson here for all governments: royal commissions are a good idea when considering major technical change. There was no need to dive into this when there was no public demand, no lobbying or any interest in local reorganisation – and plenty of time to explore it first.What makes this so perverse is that local government does urgently need reform of the appalling council tax system and a review of all property taxes. Councils desperately need reform of social care, which isbringing them to a state of near collapse: where is the promisednational care service? Instead, we have a “tidying up” that has finally exploded into a row about delayed elections. The government was not cheating when it let councils decide whether to hold an election for councillors who might be in post for just a year in mutating councils, but it was easy for Reform and the Tories to make it look that way.This has all the hallmarks of a great distraction, a displacement activity from theimpossibly difficult and intractable problems the government faces.The elections bill published last weekhas a great void at its centre where electoral reform should have been. Fiddling with the borders and electorates of councils looks almost like a toy version. Labour knows all too well that leaving in place the electoral system that allowed the party to win a mammoth majority on a slender vote is holding open the door to Reform to do the same. It may make little difference to the cataclysm Labour expects in May, but it gave Nigel Farage a needless fillip to claim a win for democracy by challenging delayed council elections, and winning.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistGuardian Newsroom: Can Labour come back from the brink?On Monday 30 April, ahead of the May elections, join Gaby Hinsliff, Zoe Williams, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr as they discuss how much threat Labour faces from both the Green party and Reform, and whether Keir Starmer can survive as party leaderBook ticketshereor atguardian.liveExplore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025OpinionLocal governmentLabourAngela RaynerSteve ReedReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Now, as the One Nation leader proves, hateful, demonstrably wrong things can be said without qualificationGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastWed 18 Feb 2026 00.07 ESTShareThere is hate speech and then there is hate speech. It depends a lot on who does the speaking.Chanting “from the river to the sea” with a crowd could lead tocriminal charges in Queensland, while down the road Pauline Hanson can say there are “no good Muslims” and berewarded with headlines, airtime and rising support.What is the more hateful? A political slogan with a contested meaning? Or a personal statement that makes your neighbour feel nervous, their kids fearful and encourages nutters to make death threats or indulge in “freedom restricting harassment” online or in person?At the Bondi vigil, Pauline and Barnaby turned tragedy into opportunism. It is inexcusable | Julianne SchultzRead moreMany Australians who happen to be born into Muslim or Jewish families and once considered their faith a private matter, have experienced the personal consequences of hate speech – from slights and abusive language to physical threats – mosques, synagogues and schools guarded yet still graffitied, cars torched, pig’s heads left at their doors, jobs lost, opportunities denied.It has left many feeling that their place in this proudly multicultural country is “conditional”, able to be withdrawn at a moment no matter what they do, depending on how well they play the game.Speech, unlike action, is by its nature more nuanced. Often what you hear does not just depend on the words spoken, but the superstructure of meaning you bring to what you hear.But there is some speech that isn’t open to interpretation. Pauline Hanson’smealy-mouthed apology for offending Muslimsis a prime example.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailFor years the radical right has been pushing the limits of acceptable speech in pluralistic, diverse democracies. They were motivated by a desire to hold on to power, by undermining women, refugees, gays, first peoples, immigrants – those who might present a challenge to the prevailing established order which had served them so well for so long.I am old enough to remember being perplexed by the campaign against what was called “political correctness”. In the 1990s it seemed to be about targeting those who preferred to use respectful inclusive language, especially when talking with and about those with less power. But for years opinion columns were filled with vitriol from those who no longer felt constrained by what was once simply politeness –do unto others as you would have them do unto you,as most religions teach.Over the following decades the constraints of tolerance and politeness broke; sensational outrageous claims became the new normal, hot button issues that drew a heated reaction demonstrated to the shrinking mainstream media that they were still in the game, and then online anonymity and the like button changed the terrain. The boundaries were broken and hate speech was out in the open, not confined to crude handwritten notes dropped in letterboxes or loud drunken talk in pubs and sports stadiums.In the process, the moderating attachment to pluralism and tolerance as a virtue were weakened, absolutes became the norm, nuance disappeared and, thanks to social media, the mob could enjoy inflicting life-changing trauma.Now hateful, demonstrably wrong things can be said without qualification, threat of legal action or contradiction, by the most powerful people in the world.For them it’s a bit of sport – like chucking chips at seagulls and watching them fight. A distraction, even an entertainment. But for vulnerable people – those targeted by the hateful words, and those angry, aggrieved folk looking for permission to do and say hideous things out loud – there are dire personal consequences.Pauline Hanson has been at the epicentre of this fringe movement in Australia for decades – now thanks to the US president effectively normalising this world view she and her ragtag bunch have moved to the mainstream.Nothing seems to have been learned. If power is the aim, pandering to the mob, rather than challenging it is the preferred response by those with power.In some ways it was not surprising that the person who spoke most powerfully against Pauline Hanson’s latest attention-seeking outburst was not the prime minister, but herfellow Queensland senator, Matt Canavan.For him and his Liberal National party colleagues, One Nation is an existential threat – as it has always been. The memory of how they were wiped out in the 1998Queenslandelection has not been forgotten.By sheer instinct Hanson perfected the dark art of turning economic disadvantage into a political tool, by tapping into fear and envy. As prime minister, John Howard aided her cause when he defended her right to say what we would now describe as hateful things. Elements of the Liberal party have, as Angus Taylor is now exploring with his unqualified descriptions of good and bad migrants, demonstrated time and again a willingness to encourage division based on ethnicity.In this he is adapting the Howard approach. The long-serving prime minister, who is now regarded as an unimpeachable party hero, madeAboriginalandAsianpeople political targets when he judged it opportune.It is worth remembering that the gateway drug for Hanson’s poison to enter the national bloodstream was to target Aboriginal people in her hometown of Ipswich. Well before she moved her focus to people of Asian or Middle Eastern heritage, First Peoples were in her sights. Forget that they were the most impoverished people in the state, people who had only been allowed to vote and move off missions and reserves a couple of decades earlier. They were, Hanson baited her audience, getting too much.The economic dimension was always underestimated in the national commentary about One Nation’s supporters. It was easier to point to red-neck racism, rather than acknowledge that more needed to be done for the struggling folk in a town that had rapidly deindustrialised. Labor governments in Queensland later took the lesson and invested in the city – so that its demographics and economics now are quite different. But inequality has not been solved, it has just changed shape, and with it the search for someone to blame.Liberal senator Andrew McLachlanput it wellon Four Corners this week, talking about the growing support for Advance which found its power by organising the hate-fuelled case against the voice referendum and its plea for meaningful recognition of Australia’s First Peoples. He said that by politicising “mass migration”, the rightwing lobby group’s aim was to foster anxiety and turn that into fear. Fear is their business model, he said.When Australia federated 125 years ago, the slogan declared “Ours is not a federation of fear”. It’s still a worthy ambition, but it means “wise and solemn” people and those on Tik Tok must call out the fearmongers before they take hold.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumOpinionIslamophobiaAustralian politicsPauline HansonOne NationCoalitionQueenslandcommentShareReuse this content"

What’s transpired has been less a course correction and more a series of sharp, haphazard turns: appointing its first ever female leader, walking away from net zero, reopening tensions with the Nationals, purging said female leader, and now pivoting towards One Nation voters with ahardline stance on immigration. If there’s a single unifying theme, it’s chaos.Angus Taylor has declared his new shadow ministry will improve living standards and“protect” Australia’s way of life. But if you look at thevoting trendsfrom the last federal election, the Liberal party remains deeply out of step with modern Australia. And the Coalition is not doing well to mend relations with women and younger voters.Angus Taylor says his new frontbench will take the fight to Labor, but his biggest battle is to save the Liberal partyRead moreLet’s start with age. TheAustralian Election Studyrevealed a continued decline in support for the two major parties, with the Coalition suffering the brunt of that shift, securing just 32% of first‑preference votes overall. Among voters under 40, that figure fell to 23%. And among millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) it was just 21%, down from 38% less than a decade earlier.This matters because millennials and gen Z are a growing voter block who now make up 42% of the electorate.What is especially confronting for theLiberal partyis that these cohorts are not ageing into conservatism. Millennials are now in their 30s and 40s, navigating mortgages, childcare costs and insecure work. If ever there were a moment for a centre‑right party to reconnect, this would be it. Instead, Coalition support among millennials has fallen steadily across four elections. In 2025, Labor won 64% of the two‑party preferred vote among those voters.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe data on gen Z (born after 1996) tells a similar story. While their support for the Coalition (28%) is marginally higher than millennials’, it remains well below the national average. Labor won gen Z by an extraordinary 67–33 two‑party margin, the strongest of any generation. These voters are not driven by nostalgia or culture wars. They are economically anxious, socially progressive and acutely focused on cost of living and housing. Immigration‑heavy messaging does not map neatly on to their lived experience of multicultural Australia.Then there is gender. Australia has now firmly shifted from the traditional to the modern gender gap in voting. In 2025, 37% of men voted for the Coalition, compared with just 28% of women – a nine‑point gap that has widened steadily over the past decade. Over the past 12 years alone, women’s support for the Coalition has fallen by 19 percentage points.Against this backdrop, leadership decisions take on symbolic weight. The removal of Sussan Ley reinforces perceptions that many women already hold – that it’s a party of men. After the election, 56% of Labor MPs and senators were women, compared with just 31% in the Coalition. That could decline further after theFarrer byelection. Leadership spills and factional purges that disproportionately remove senior women risk amplifying distrust, particularly among younger educated female voters who are already drifting away.To be clear, voters are not primarily motivated by personalities. Policy still matters most. In 2025, 56% of voters said policy issues were theirmain considerationfollowed by parties as a whole (21%), local candidates (12%) and party leaders (11%). Immigration was a concern – about 6% named it their top issue – but it remains a second‑tier issue electorally, concentrated largely among Coalition and minor‑party voters. For the majority, cost of living absolutely dominated. Two‑thirds of voters named an economic issue as their top concern, and this pressure was felt most acutely among younger voters and renters. Ananalysisof the 2022 election shows that among cost‑of‑living‑focused voters under 45, women were heavily over-represented (70%), reflecting the gendered impact of housing costs, insecure work and unequal caring responsibilities.Here lies the Coalition’s most serious problem: its longstanding advantage on economic management has collapsed. For the first time since the Australian Election Study began in 1987, Labor waspreferredover the Coalition on nine out of 10 policy areas in 2025, including cost of living, housing and even taxation. For a centre‑right party, this is an existential blow.How a hardline ‘Trump-style’ Liberal immigration policy to ban migrants from Gaza and Somalia was developedRead moreThe party has turned to immigration politics to address economic grievances and stemleakageto One Nation. But if migration becomes the organising narrative of economic renewal, it risks functioning as a proxy for frustration and does little to answerharder questionsabout productivity, skills, infrastructure and long‑term growth.If the Liberal party wants to survive into the future it must build an economic narrative that offers hope rather than grievance: one that is different to Labor and one that does not shadow One Nation.Moving further to the right might give it a boost in the polls, but it is likely to be damaging in the long termby shrinking its base and pushing women and young voters further out of reach.Dr Intifar Chowdhury is a youth researcher and a lecturer in government at Flinders UniversityExplore more on these topicsLiberal partyOpinionAustralian politicsAngus TaylorcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a wonder anyone ever gets any actual work done. “I’m tired,” says Amy Madigan, grinning crookedly on a video call. It’s noon in Los Angeles but the living room curtains behind her are shut tight. I worry she may have just pulled an all-nighter.The last time Madigan was nominated was in 1985. She played Gene Hackman’s brittle daughter in a blue-collar drama called Twice in a Lifetime (the title now feels apt). Awards season, she points out, was shorter and sweeter back then. “Now it’s a big unruly beast.‘We want to speak to Amy!’I’ve been doing this since November. Do you not think people are sick of talking about us and seeing our faces? Haven’t you people seen enough?”We were hoping to start rebuilding our house in February or March – but it’s going to take yearsMadigan is now 75, which makes her the plucky veteran in this year’s best supporting actress race; the sentimental outsider, although there’s nothing remotely cosy about her. She is shortlisted for her role in Zach Cregger’s Weapons, a gripping small-town horror movie that plays out in segments, like a set of witness statements. Madigan crops up – first teasingly, then electrifyingly – as the nightmarish Aunt Gladys, the scariest child-catcher this side of Robert Helpmann in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Feeding off the young and conjuring adults into zombies, Gladys has round specs, clownish makeup and a brutal orange wig – and Cregger’s film has her tottering around town talking 19 to the dozen. The woman is laughable and pitiable right up until the moment when she’s not.View image in fullscreen‘It’s crazy how people are responding to her’ … as Aunt Gladys in Weapons.Photograph: Warner BrosThose pulled drapes are unnerving. Madigan’s home looks so impersonal, like a bolthole or a safe house. That’s probably because it is, she explains. She’s in a rental she shares with the actorEd Harris, her husband and longtime creative collaborator. The couple’s real house burned down in the wildfires last year. So that’s her other full-time job, sorting permits with the city. “We were hoping to start rebuilding in February or March, but that’s not going to happen. It’s going to take years.”Cregger has credited Madigan with “saving” his movie. At the very least, she gives it a big injection of blood. And in the months since its release last August, Aunt Gladys has permeated the culture and become a TikTok sensation, beloved of costumed trick-or-treaters and professional drag acts alike. The actor steers clear of social media but is well aware of the fuss. “PeoplelikeGladys. They want to hang out with Gladys.” Stumped pause, crooked grin. “Which I find kind of interesting.”Gladys’s appeal, sad to say, is not quite universal. I watched Weapons with my 11-year-old son and it scared him to bits. He refused to go to bed afterwards, thought Aunt Gladys might be lurking. That’s my fault as a parent but it is also hers, just a little. “Wow. Well, I’m sorry for doing that to him,” she says. “But I’m also taking it as a compliment.”It’s a funny thing, horror. It somehow hits harder than more respectable genres. “Horror operates on an emotional level,” explains Madigan. “People want it and need it. They like to view it from afar. I grew up with all the genius black-and-white ones. Nosferatu, The Bride of Frankenstein, right up to Bette Davis in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? That scared the hell out of me, though it’s maybe more gothic than horror. But it’s all based on the old fairytales. Someone stealing the children – that’s been around since ad infinitum.”Gladys feeds on children, draining their energy to stay alive. Maybe Madigan, for her part, is now feeding on Gladys. For the past 10 years, her career has been on subsistence rations, with smaller parts in smaller films. So Weapons has been a godsend, if not quite a magic bullet. She is keen to keep things in perspective. “Friends are like, ‘Oh, the scripts must be flying into your mailbox.’ And I’m like, ‘No.’ But I’m more on the radar, more in the conversation, which is nice. It’s like Gladys showed up, made an impact and reminded the world I’m still here.”How bad did it get? Did she ever think about quitting? “Sure. How could you not? Those thoughts invade, especially when you have a fallow time, and I’ve certainly had those during these past few years. Then you have a down day and think, ‘Will I ever get a job again? Maybe I’ve retired and haven’t really told myself yet.’” She pulls a face. “The business is brutal. It just is. But the reality is that I still love doing it.”Evidence suggests she has always been a scrapper, a survivor, regarded as too tough and too caustic for mainstream Hollywood tastes. “Freckled, plain but winning,” wrote the critic Stanley Kauffmann of her first screen performance – she played a pregnant convict in 1982’s Love Child – with the implication that every subsequent triumph would come in the face of steep odds. So she made hay on the margins, playing John Candy’s girlfriend in Uncle Buck and Kevin Costner’s wife in Field of Dreams before picking up a Golden Globe for her starring role in Roe vs Wade, the 1989 abortion rights legal drama.View image in fullscreenBrittle daughter ... Madigan’s earlier Oscar-nominated turn in Twice in a Lifetime.Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Bud Yorkin Productions/AllstarFor a spell, she and Harris were an indie-film power couple, working off the same page, with their careers in parallel. Then his work-rate kept motoring – with roles in the likes of The Truman Show, Darren Aronofsky’s Mother! and Top Gun: Maverick – while hers began to trail off. Plus ça change. There’s an inbuilt sexism, she says, to the whole casting process. “But Ed knows the business as well as I do. So he’s good on all that. We met working together. We’ve done many films together. So we’re used to having each other’s backs.”I’ve been meaning to ask about their appearance at the 1999 Oscars, when the directorElia Kazanwas presented with an honorary award by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Madigan and Harris have collaborated on 11 films altogether, but that night was surely their most high-profile joint performance, as they watched the presentation silent, stony-faced and unclapping. Kazan was the great leftist film-maker of postwar US cinema, the man behind Viva Zapata!, On the Waterfront and A Face in the Crowd. But in 1952, he broke ranks and spilled names in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. It was a dark time; lives were ruined. And Kazan, Madigan feels, played a role in all that.“My dad was a journalist,” she says by way of explanation. “He was also the political liaison officer for the supreme court in Illinois. So I grew up politically minded. My dad covered the McCarthy hearings and it affected him greatly, to the point where he couldn’t really talk about it. So there was no way I was going to join in the applause. Maybe I don’t have that twist in my head where I think, ‘Oh, let’s forgive and forget.’ No, I don’t forget those kind of things. I don’t wish for that person to fall down a sewer – well, sometimes I do – but I don’t have to participate. And I thought it was shameful of the Academy to honour him in that way.”View image in fullscreen‘There was no way I was going to join in the applause’ ... protesting with husband Ed Harris at the 1999 Oscars.Photograph: Oscars YouTubeBesides, her refusal wasn’t a comment on Kazan’s work – it was a judgment on his actions. “That’s right,” she says. “Although I don’t really agree with the idea that you can separate the two. There are certain lines you don’t cross.”The trouble, of course, is that history repeats itself. Lines that are crossed tend to be crossed again. Just look at the political landscape today, she says. The near-daily assault on the first amendment; the footage of people shot dead in the street. She is furious about Trump and despairs at the state of the country. When their house burned down, she and Harris briefly discussed getting out altogether. “It feels awful – politically speaking – to be living in the US now. So of course the subject comes up in conversation. But I’m still proud to be an American. I believe in my fellow man. And you can feel something happening in southern California. People are terrified but they are also angry. They’re resisting, fighting back. So I’m guardedly hopeful.”It is a strange time to have another date at theOscars, she knows. She has no idea if she’ll win, the whole thing is a mystery. All the same, the nomination feels like a nice thing to have happened, especially after a 40-year gap. She’s viewing it as a belated reward for decades of hard graft, or even – dare one say it – as an honorary award of her own. “And that’s an unusual feeling,” she says. “That’s going to take some getting used to. I mean, it’s crazy how people are responding to Gladys. But I have to accept that they’re also responding to me.”Explore more on these topicsFilmOscarsHorror filmsAwards and prizesEd HarrisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

They’ve hardly been idle since: two tours, two films, a 40-date residencyat the Las Vegas Sphere, nearly three hours of stripped-down re-recordings of old material on Songs of Surrender, plus Bono’s autobiography, which spawned a solo tour, a stint on Broadway andanotherfilm. An impressive workload by any standards.Still, you could take the gap between original albums – the longest in U2’s history – as evidence of a problem that’s bedevilled the band for nearly 20 years: where doU2fit into the current musical landscape?The obvious answer is to acquiesce to the “heritage rock” label, rest on the laurels of their back catalogue and rake it in touring the hits. Clearly that doesn’t appeal, as evidenced by Bono and The Edge explaining that a 2017 tour playing 1987’s The Joshua Tree in full was not about nostalgia. So what else? They’ve tried everything, from reaffirming their experimental credentials onNo Line on the Horizonto trying to play 21st-century pop at its own game – AutoTune on the vocals, hitmaker Ryan Tedder in the producer’s chair, a mooted but unrealised collaboration with David Guetta, a doomed attempt to engage with the era’s new means of distribution in theirdisastrous hook-up with Apple– without ever really recapturing the success or the spirit of their late 80s/early 90s imperial phase.Which brings us to Days of Ash, not a taster for their forthcoming album but, like Bruce Springsteen’s recent Streets of Minnesota, an attempt to reanimate the protest-song-as-quickfire-response spirit of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s 1970 single Ohio. It’s an idea that you might have expected would have occurred to more people of late. If CSNY could get Ohio in the US chart within weeks ofthe Kent State shootingsit commemorated – in 1970, when getting a single in the charts involved actually pressing records, distributing them to stores and servicing radio stations – then there seems no reason why artists can’t put the faster processes of the streaming era to use in that way: there’s something faintly depressing about the fact that it’s currently the province of old lags such as Springsteen and U2. Three of the EP’s five songs – there’s also a brief poetry-plus-ambient-instrumental interlude – commemorate recent deaths in conflicts and protests: those of nonviolent Palestinian activist Awad Hathaleen, 16-year-old Iranian protester Sarina Esmailzadeh, and, most recently, the shooting of Renee Nicole Good on 7 January.The latter informs the EP’s lead track, American Obituary, on which U2 sound more righteously angry than they have in years, both in the lyrics, which have a confrontational man-the-barricades tone seldom heard in U2’s work since the era of War – “America will rise against the people of the lie … the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power” – and musically: a stew of distorted guitar, growling bass and siren-invoking electronics.On subsequent tracks the music shifts into less aggressive mode – more acoustic guitars, less of The Edge in full flight, a noticeably hazier ambience – and the lyrics take on a more familiar note of consolation and optimism: biblical imagery, distinctly Bono-esque aphorisms (“the future, as everyone knows, is where we’re gonna be spending the rest of our life”). But a genuine urgency remains, no doubt linked to the EP’s relatively quick turnaround. It’s in stark contrast to the mass of second-guessing, re-recording and abandoned projects that have marked U2’s last couple of decades; denying themselves the opportunity to overthink things seems to have sharpened U2 up. There’s a crispness to The Tears of Things’ assault on fascism and religious fundamentalism t felt noticeably absent from patches of their recent oeuvre. “When people go around talking to God it always ends in tears,” Bono sings.It doesn’t all work. Their Ed Sheeran collaboration, Yours Eternally, is less jarring than some of the lunges for contemporaneity in U2’s 21st-century catalogue, but the problem is that the sound of Sheeran’s voice and guitar has become immediately recognisable thanks to its omnipresence over the last 15 years, which means that his guest appearance swamps the song by default.You’d also hesitate to herald the EP as evidence of a new approach, not least because Bono has announced the music on their forthcoming album is nothing like this, more a “carnival vibe”. But what you can safely say is that U2’s aforementioned imperial phase was fuelled by an almost religious zeal, a firm sense of purpose and a belief in the power of music to effect change – the stuff that their hipper post-punk contemporaries found risibly uncool – and that zeal, purpose and belief has been recaptured here.Explore more on these topicsU2Pop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

A man is riding through the desert on a road near Marrakech that is still partly under construction. He rides a Peugeot 103 motorcycle and carries 21 satellite dishes – each pointing in a different direction. But the person driving the motorbike is so overstimulated, he cannot choose which way to go – and ends up going nowhere.It is part of a wider multidisciplinary project, Paraboles, that is an inquiry into Moroccan people’s identity, our imagination and the way we see the world. It can feel to Moroccans – and those in other postcolonial countries – that their minds have been colonised as well as their land.I grew up in Rabat, in a diplomatic family. My grandpa had a key role in the French Protectorate (1912-56). I attended a French school where everything we learned was European. Back then there were not many good universities inMorocco, and we always knew we would go to study abroad. I lived in Paris for 10 years, and it made me realise a lot of things about Morocco that I didn’t see when I was living there.I invented an imaginary republic with its own language – and I thought it needed transportationWhen I returned and started looking around my country, I saw satellite dishes everywhere. These objects crystallised something about this past century, and I decided to use the satellite to create a whole fiction, a Hertzian Republic – named after the hertz, the unit of frequency of radio waves. In this republic, people in exile go in search of a better future, but that hope is a mirage.The project includes texts, installations and a short film in which we see people going on a pilgrimage to places they have seen on their screens. I also created goat-skin passports – goat skin is a material with a special significance in nomadic cultures in Morocco. The passport closes when the material is cold and opens when it’s hot. I even invented a language related to the 72-megahertz waves sent from satellites in Morocco, with 72 corresponding letters: my own sacred book with its own code. And I thought I should also create transportation for my imaginary republic.The Peugeot 103 motorcycle is iconic in Morocco. In the 1990s, it became a symbol of modern Morocco and social mobility. I decided to use one from that decade, which is when my fictional narrative takes place, and I transformed it with the satellite dishes. This image and this project were a way to remind us of the things we forget to see; how we don’t always want to see what’s happening in the present.I returned to Morocco a year ago. The country is moving so fast – it’s inspiring. It is a fascinating place. It is very unified, although some people in the north might speak Spanish but not a word of French, and we speak different dialects of Amazigh and Darija. The cultures are so different but at the same time, we feel close to each other, we feel like a nation. Language is a big part of my questioning as an artist: the way words carry concepts and make us think differently. In Darija, you never miss a train – the train leaves you behind. When you’re ill, it’s the cold that hit you.My truth is in between two cultures: French and Moroccan. The questions that most interest me stem from this. How we shape ourselves with our beliefs, and what gives us a sense of direction in life. It is one of the most mystical things about being human.Hiba Baddou’s CVPhotograph: Léo GeoffrionBorn:Rabat, MoroccoHigh point:The Dakar Biennale in 2024 and winning the Saatchi Art for Change prize in the same year was a major moment of recognition; it made me believe this work could go wider and speak to people of different cultures.

Here’s a guide to the wild new mediumStuart HeritageWed 18 Feb 2026 09.36 ESTLast modified on Wed 18 Feb 2026 13.11 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleIf you haven’t heard of vertical dramas, chances are you will soon. These quick, grabby series – usually split into minute-long episodes – have risen unstoppably over the past couple of years, and now Hollywood is taking an interest.Last year, the former Showtime executive Jana Winograde announced MicroCo, a studio devoted to vertical drama, and claimed that she was shocked by the amount of top-tier talent that has approached her. Two months before, former Miramax boss Bill Block launched GammaTime, which promises original microdramas by CSI creator Anthony E Zuiker.“Every single Hollywood studio you can think of is involved or trialling,” says vertical drama consultant Jen Cooper. “For actors in America, 90% of the jobs on [major casting platform] Actor’s Access are verticals.” Indeed, in a stagnating entertainment market, verticals are one of the few places of real growth – last year Deadline reported that revenues in the sector are up 8,000% year-on-year.People pay more attention to verticals because they’re not also on WhatsApp at the same timeVertical dramas get their name from the fact they’re filmed in 9:16 format: they are taller than they are wide, making them perfect for smartphone viewing. They’re typically shot fast, in around a week, by small crews and actors who are expected to nail their performances in a couple of takes. And, because their job is to keep you watching (ideally to the point where you start paying for them, more on which later), they have a tendency to crack along at an incredible pace. Imagine a film that pivots from cliffhanger to cliffhanger every 90 seconds and you get the idea.“They have obviously mastered the clickbait and the hooks that get you past the paywall,” says Cooper. “But the reason it’s gone so big is that it’s serving a massively underserved audience, which is women who read romance novels. You might watch them and think, ‘This is not The Godfather – this is bizarre,’ but then you look at romance novels and you’re like, ‘Ah, right, OK.’ It’s serving all that audience that couldn’t find anything anywhere else. And it meets people where they are, which is on their phone. People pay more attention to verticals because they’re not also on WhatsApp at the same time.”But are they any good? If you download a vertical app, such as the Chinese-owned ReelShort or DramaBox, you’ll find yourself overwhelmed with berserk titles such as (and I promise these are real) My Sister Is the Warlord Queen and Ms CEO’s Baby Daddy Is the Merchant of Death. Everyone in these films is a billionaire. Most people are horny. It’s like being lost at sea watching them.This being so, I ask Cooper to supply me with some verticals that show where the industry is right now. Here’s what she suggests …Breaking the IceReelShort“This went supernova and brought in a lot of new watchers, especially in areas like Indonesia and the Philippines,” says Cooper. And, since it’s about a sexy ice hockey star, it’s worth pointing out that it predatesHeated Rivalry. Breaking the Ice is the story of an up-and-coming player who leaves his childhood sweetheart behind, not knowing that she is pregnant, before returning eight years later.It is absolutely bananas. Within the first minute, the female lead discovers she’s pregnant, then gets slapped by her boyfriend’s mother, who offers her thousands of dollars to break up with him. In the second minute, she’s called a “crazy bipolar bitch” for kissing someone else. Halfway through, a kidnapping is initiated and resolved in the space of about 45 seconds. There are countless one-punch fights, to a wildly overblown musical score. It’s frantic, tonally all over the place and makes almost no sense. The precision with which Breaking the Ice can weaponise a low attention span is frightening. It is also stupidly entertaining.However, as soon as there’s a shower scene, the paywall kicks in. This might be where people get turned off. To keep watching, you have to amass coins, as you would in a mobile game. You can do this by watching an advert (usually for Temu) every couple of minutes, or by buying 1,000 coins for £4.49. You could also buy a subscription to the app, which costs about £200 a year. This is more expensive than either a standard Netflix subscription or the licence fee, but Cooper says that for many viewers, verticals are “a fan thing. If they were into live music, or sport, or buying wool for their knitting, they’d be spending the same amount.”How to Tame a Silver FoxReelShortBuoyed up by my unexpected enjoyment of Breaking the Ice, I try this, described by Cooper as an age-gap romance that has gone viral on TikTok. It is, by all accounts, slightly harder to enjoy.How to Tame a Silver Fox is a slightly grim love story about a girl falling for her dad’s friend. The main issue I have is that her dad’s friend is an absolute cluster-bomb of red flags. He drives a sports car. He carries a gun. He wears a leather jacket and has a teddy boy haircut. His shirt, which is perpetually half undone and soaking wet, keeps getting taken off and put back on with no real logic. He keeps saying things (to his friend’s daughter, remember) like “You’re a beautiful woman but I’m too much for you, kid,” and “You had better not test me or I’ll break you.” Worst of all, he isn’t actually a silver fox, just a brown-haired man who seems to have Pepé Le Pewed himself with talcum powder. Not my cup of tea in the slightest, but there’s a good chance I’m not the target audience here.Television in titbits: the rise of the billion-dollar microdrama industryRead moreAmerican Sniper: The Last RoundReelShortCooper describes this one as “a big hit near the end of the year, and part of the attempt to bring in a male audience”. Which is great, because I am a man. This one should be a slam dunk.Except it isn’t, because the more I watch American Sniper: The Last Round, the more I become convinced that nobody in the vertical drama industry has ever met a man. Within the first five seconds, someone gets shot in the head. We meet a guy with the nickname the King of Guns, which we know because they call him the King of Guns approximately once every 30 seconds. Every scene is accompanied by music that sounds as if it was pirated from a pickup truck commercial. Also, very importantly, this has nothing to do withClint Eastwood’s film American Sniper. That was about Chris Kyle, a decorated Navy Seal sniper eventually murdered at a shooting range. This is about the King of Guns, a guy who leaves his military post to work at a shooting range, then shoots a load of baddies. It is profoundly dumb, like the sort of thing you’d watch drunk at 2am.Spark Me TenderlyMy DramaCooper calls this one “Fifty Shades of Grey rubbish, but a massive hit”, which is accurate. The success of Spark Me Tenderly comes from a blanket social media push full of TikTok videos that make it look like pornography. It is not that, but it is extremely Fifty Shadesy. A young woman gets a job with a handsome pervert who makes her sign a BDSM contract. There’s a brief battle of wills and some fully clothed heavy petting, and (spoiler alert) it ends with the pervert setting his kink aside because he’s fallen in love, and the woman getting really into BDSM. A bit like Grease, then, without the flying car. Absolute tosh, but there is an enormous audience who would lap this up.In Other Words, I Love YouDramaBox“This is one of my all-time favourite verticals,” says Cooper, and I’m inclined to agree. This is a YA story about a poor American scholarship student who gets sent to a posh British school and butts heads with an arrogant British guy, and it feels the direction verticals should probably start heading if they want to shake off their clickbaity reputation.For a start, the young and largely British cast do extremely well with the material, which isn’t always the case with verticals. Second, the bizarre need to send the plot spinning off in a silly new direction has been flattened out, so it feels like an actual film rather than a procession of interstitial YouTube ads. Early on, there is a long scene where the characters critique the work of William Golding. This is a vertical that knows and trusts its audience, which a lot of these things seem petrified to do. As a result we’re left with something lightweight, but extremely well made. Now that actual film-makers are getting involved with the medium, this will be the benchmark against which all other verticals are measured. A joy.Game of ChoiceTallflixDescribed by Cooper as “one of the most ambitious verticals,” this is an action drama in the mould of Squid Game. And by that I mean that it is exactly Squid Game, squeezed into a couple of hours and done on the cheap. However, by verticals standards it represents a huge leap forward. There are stunts and action scenes, and the story relies more on internal drama than ridiculous cliffhangers. It is gripping, and the perfect demonstration of a medium desperate to break out and become mainstream. When you’re all watching vertical dramas by the end of the year, it’ll be in part thanks to this.This article was amended on 18 February 2026 to state that 90% of all adverts for acting jobs on the casting platform Actor’s Access are currently for vertical dramas. A previous version said this applied to all acting jobs.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSmartphonesMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is about the nature of intimacy between the two; and about the moment this becomes a problem for the grownup children with a conflicting sense of their own responsibilities.Queen at Sea is directed by indie US film-maker Lance Hammer, absent sincehis 2008 Sundance winner, Ballast. This is an almighty comeback, a lacerating movie bearing comparison withMichael Haneke’s AmourorGaspar Noé’s Vortex. It concludes with a heartbreakingly ironic and enigmatic final sequence refusing the traditional final cadence; a diptych of love, contrasting the pleasures and expectations of intimacy across the generations.The setting is a gloomy and wintry London, with porridge-grey cloud cover.Juliette Binocheplays Amanda, a recently divorced academic. She has taken a sabbatical with her teen daughter, Sara (Florence Hunt), to be closer to her elderly mother, Leslie (Calder-Marshall) – who has dementia – and her stepfather, Martin (Courtenay).One dull weekday morning, she looks in on Martin and Leslie, catching them having sex, with a mask of incomprehension on her mother’s face. Furiously, she accuses him of raping Leslie. The shock and disgust clearly stem at one level from the fact that he is her stepfather, not her father; and also because they have already received the GP’s advice that Leslie can no longer give meaningful consent.Yet Martin has done his own research on the internet contradicting this, claiming that marital sex comforts dementia patients just as much as all the other things that are done for them without meaningful consent: food, shelter, medical care. Crucially, it comforts the carer, too. He loves his wife and this is a vital way to keep this alive.Ballast – reviewRead moreIcily livid, Amanda calls the police, which sets in train events that she almost instantly regrets. Martin is prevented from seeing Leslie, who is terrified by the rape exam and whimperingly baffled as to why her husband is not there. The only way to suspend the legal action is for Leslie to go into a care home, which has long been Amanda’s demand. This is furiously resisted by Martin, who now sees all this as a malicious, dishonest way of forcing the situation on them both – it’s a care home, or it’s the cops – and a permanent stain on his character whatever the outcome. Meanwhile, Sara is developing a relationship with a boy at her new London school that her mother knows nothing about.The story moves from one agonisingly difficult and ambiguous situation to the next – each a terrifying point of no return, each the awful occasion of things seen and said that can’t be unseen or unsaid. Is Amanda right to take the view that she has – or has she, in some crucial way, mishandled things? Is Martin an abuser of the most sinister and hateful kind, or misunderstood? Is the care home itself such a bad place? Even the crisis that this entails, connected to the unmentionable truths about older people’s sexuality and propensity to abuse, doesn’t exactly solve the question. Everything that happens, each station of the cross, each unbearable ordeal, is just a function of the overall situation, which can only be managed up to a point.The crux of the film is a four-way conversation between a social worker, Amanda, Martin and Leslie. This involves Martin’s tearful, passionate declaration of love for his wife and best friend; a virtual reaffirmation of vows, which Leslie poignantly returns. Has dementia made her affirmation valueless?

He had an understanding of people’s darkness, fears and flaws – and their shiny bits as well. He described me as “a Protestant church-mouse, sex-mad Brownie”. I felt seen! His theory was everyone has a clown. For example,David Mitchell, who I worked with on Back, has an angry clown. When David is cross and he rants, it’s hilarious. Without Philippe, I don’t think I could have done Cass in Back, Deb inSuch Brave Girlsor Muriel inWoman in Mind, because he gave me permission to be an idiot. I can take the piss out of myself and it doesn’t hurt.The only moment I ever saw Philippe break into a smile at anything I did was when I was dressed top to toe in leather, hitting everyone with a stick and doing Lady Macbeth in a German accent. I don’t know what that says about my clown: she’s a very confused dominatrix. I think my clown is probably an idiot.Philippe Gaulier had a huge impact on theatre – but his ‘embrace the ridiculous’ lesson is one for us allRead more‘You had to keep him entertained’Rachel WeiszMost memorable to me were Philippe’s bouffon workshops. We played a game where he was the “king” and you were the clowns or court jesters – think naughty minions – who had to entertain him. You had to be mischievous, unruly and test the boundaries of foolery. But mostly you had to keep him entertained and interested, otherwise you were expelled from this imaginary court. You didn’t want to bore the king or be banished for going too far. He was one of the great teachers and it was one of the greatest lessons. I think of this and him often and I feel very lucky to have been taught by him.View image in fullscreenDamien Warren-Smith’s Garry Starr: Classic Penguins.Illustration: Garry Starr‘I failed and failed and failed’Damien Warren-Smith (AKA Garry Starr)I’d moved to the UK from Australia and I found myself in ensembles doing classical plays where I was the butt of the joke for being uncultured. People were constantly referring to me as a convict. When I discovered clown, I realised not only does it not matter if people don’t take me seriously, it is an incredible feeling to embrace it and say, “Whatever you find ridiculous about me, I give you permission to laugh at that.”Going to ÉcolePhilippe Gaulierwas tough. I failed and failed and failed. I can still remember the first time I really made him laugh. Two clowns were doing a scene that was going really badly and I stepped on as Monsieur Loyal, the boss clown, and started clapping and saying, “I told you they were great, didn’t I?” Philippe chuckled and pointed at me: “He’s such a bastard!”You will be your funniest, you will come alive, you will be your most beautiful in your moment of failure. It is not the doing that makes you funny, it is seeing how you feel about the shit thing you have just done.Garry Starris a high-status character and an idiot. The reason people are so willing to get up in my shows is that I’m the butt of the joke. I fail, but I’m so happy to fail. People who say they would never get up on stage are all of a sudden volunteering to do horrific things.‘Philippe said: You! Kick him up the arse!’Simon MunneryIn the workshops, everyone seemed to have a moment when they were hilarious. We were coming towards the end and he asked who hadn’t had a moment. It was me and a Swiss juggler.He was a big, tall, muscular bloke and not in any way funny. He started talking and Philippe pointed to someone and said, “You! Kick him up the arse!” It was like being tortured. He clearly didn’t enjoy it. “You! Kick him on the cheek!” He was fiddling with this bloke’s performance, in front of him, live. He tried various things until he said, “OK, speak loudly!”The Swiss bloke started shouting and it was hilarious. All 25 of us wept with laughter. It was genuine: he was so angry at the position he’d been put in. Later, I told him it was funny and it wasn’t what he wanted to know. He wanted to be in control.Then Philippe got me to talk and he tried the same things. Nothing was working. Then he said, “OK, talk, but don’t make any sound.” And I had a moment. It was hilarious. I couldn’t put a foot wrong. It was like walking along a thick tightrope. I sat down and I could see then why the Swiss bloke was so upset. It was the pain of people laughing at you.View image in fullscreenSally Phillips: ‘This kind of play has been a foundation of my professional career.’Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImage‘The ghost of the game was there’Sally PhillipsYou could apply his method to anything. I did Shakespeare, Chekhov and Greek tragedy with him. He got Romeo and Juliet kissing each other on the nose after every line, then he took the kiss out. It was so nice because there was an echo of the nose kiss, the ghost of the game was there.In Smack the Pony, I’d had this idea about a woman who stacks the entire supermarketwith Toilet Duckand then the boss comes in and says, “Why’ve you done that?” I was thinking the gag would be that every time the camera changed angle, you’d see another aisle of Toilet Duck. Then I remembered Gaulier and thought: Ah! The funniest thing would be not knowing. It’s about how your humanity is visible when you don’t know what you’re doing. And it’s completely gripping watching that. It was a girl who’d stopped concentrating and she didn’t have a good answer. It was much better than having a reason.His teaching has fed into my experience of parenting my son with Down’s syndrome. Olly never has a fail, he is always 100% alive and he is not boring. You’re anti-productivity, anti all these masks, the world isn’t about A-levels and you’re being in the moment. I’ve found a language to speak with Olly because this kind of play has been a foundation of my professional career.‘I had never seen somebody speak in such a polarising, hilarious way’Zach Zucker (AKA Jack Tucker)I was a very unfunny 19-year-old student, working at the UCB theater in Los Angeles. My manager used to work for Sacha Baron Cohen’s company and told me there was an intern spot there and, by the way, Sacha’s clown teacher is coming to LA. I went to this workshop and I had never seen somebody speak to people in such a polarising, hilarious way. I got the job with Sacha and, six months in, I told him I wanted to go to Gaulier. Sacha said, “Go!”I was only supposed to go for six months but, three weeks in, I saw my second-year counterparts do a vaudeville scene that blew my mind. I signed up for the whole two years that night. My company,Stamptown, is named after Étampes, where the clown school is based, and our logo is the castle from the town.People’s stories tend to be, “Philippe told me I was terrible and it was very embarrassing.” But first and foremost, the guy was a clown. He loved to laugh more than anything.View image in fullscreenEmily Woof in Revolver at the Edinburgh fringe in 2025.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian‘You didn’t hold back’Emily WoofI loved some of the other things he taught, especially melodrama and bouffon. Doing melodrama, we used to do this exercise where you would sit at a table, drinking a glass of wine in a stew of melancholy. There would be music playing. Then you’d suddenly slam the table, look up to the gods and go, “Not that music!”In melodrama, he wanted you to play to the gods, to the poor people who couldn’t afford the other seats in the theatre. It was about unleashing a generosity of spirit, you didn’t hold back. You had a lift in the head and in the voice. His way of playing it was generous and embodied. It was a real discipline. If you didn’t hit it, you couldn’t get away with it because it’s too crazy, too big. You had to be absolutely true.Bouffon is almost the opposite of clown: you’re an outsider who comes in to mock the bourgeoisie. You’re the one that’s got the upper hand. You come on stage with an edge and I took that edge into my own work. In clown you love the audience, but bouffon is a much more twisted form.‘Slowly, you realised how to engage with the audience’Hamish McCollThe word everyone dreaded was “suivant” (next) which really meant “get off”. You would go up and open your mouth and get “suivant”. You would come away mystified. “What did I do? I just opened my mouth!” Slowly, you realised what it was, which was how to engage with the audience in that moment.As a director, you’re constantly looking for the work to be present, true, alive and dynamic. His short threshold for things not working – and he was tyrannical – stayed with me. “Pour faire rire le public,” he would say. “It’s to make the audience laugh.” Are they engaged? Are they with you? If they’re not, “suivant!”View image in fullscreen‘You didn’t want to bore the king’ … Philippe Gaulier‘It’s about what’s happening in that moment’Cal McCrystalHe told you not to bring ideas in with you because it was like filling your arms with suitcases. When you come in, you see this wonderful suitcase on the floor but you can’t pick it up because your arms are full. The performance has got to be about what’s happening in that moment.My whole career leads back to Philippe. Even when I’m working at English National Opera, I say, “This feeling of pleasure, mischief and connection with the audience is not a layer that you put on top of the show: it is the show.”Philippe once said you should come in with the pleasure of your four-year-old son who thinks it’s a good idea to come down stairs naked when you’ve got guests. The child who doesn’t know why it’s wrong but really wants to do it: that is mischief.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreClownsPhilippe GaulierComedyLouise BrealeyRachel WeiszfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a Warner Bros civil war epic, the kind of production where the scale alone made you feel small. I was playing a low-ranking Confederate aide-de-camp to General Stonewall Jackson. I was young, unsure of myself, and painfully aware of exactly where I stood in the hierarchy of things.That morning, they placed him on the horse.He sat tall and still in the saddle, dressed as Robert E Lee – grey coat, grey beard, grey sky above him – and he didn’t seem like an actor in costume. He seemed as if he had stepped out of the earth itself. He was Lee, and more than that, he was Duvall –a distant relative of Lee, too, which somehow made it all feel inevitable. He carried the weight of history effortlessly.View image in fullscreenRobert Duvall as General Robert E Lee, right, with Stephen Lang as Lt Gen Thomas ‘Stonewall’ Jackson in Gods and Generals, 2003.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarI remember standing there in my uniform, the wool damp and heavy on my shoulders, and feeling terrified. Not of him, but of disappointing the truth in the scene. He had a way of making you aware of truth without ever saying a word. We worked the entire day in that mud. Horses breathing. Cannons in the distance. Extras shifting in formation. And then it was over.I retreated to my honey wagon – a sliver of a room somehow called a trailer. It was barely wide enough to turn around in, but to me it was a palace. I was just grateful to be there. I peeled off my boots, my socks damp and stiff, and began to change back into myself.I tried to hide my shock. The idea that he had noticed me at all was overwhelmingThere was a knock at the door. I opened it to find Bobby’s assistant. He said, simply: “Mr Duvall would like to know if you’d join him for dinner.”I tried to hide my shock. Duvall was legendary for calling out actors when they weren’t being truthful. He had no patience for falseness. He protected the work fiercely. The idea that he had noticed me at all was overwhelming.Of course I said yes.We met at a quiet restaurant not far from where we were staying. He was already seated when I arrived, relaxed, unassuming, almost invisible despite being one of the greatest actors alive. He looked at me for a moment and said, in that soft, unmistakable voice: “You’re a nice actor. You didn’t push the emotion.”The scene was ultimately cut from the film. But that moment was not.View image in fullscreenDuvall directing on location for The Apostle in 1996.Photograph: Butcher’s Run Films/AllstarHe didn’t elaborate. He didn’t need to. In those few words, he gave me something no one else ever had: permission. Permission to trust stillness. To trust restraint. To trust myself.That dinner began a friendship that would shape the rest of my life. At the time, my acting career was unremarkable. I wasn’t getting the parts I wanted. I was drifting, quietly losing faith in the path I’d chosen. Bobby saw that before I ever said it aloud. He told me I should write. He had done it himself withThe Apostle, released in 1997 and one of the most personal films ever made. He understood that sometimes you have to create the thing you’re meant to inhabit.View image in fullscreenDuvall and Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart, Scott Cooper’s directorial debut feature, which was produced by Duvall.Photograph: Album/AlamySo I began writing. That screenplay becameCrazy Heart. It was deeply influenced by his performance in Tender Mercies – that gentle, heartbreaking portrayal of a man worn down by his own life, searching for grace in the quiet corners. It remains one of the most truthful performances ever captured on film.Bobby was the first person to read the script. He called me shortly after. “You’re going to direct it,” he said. Not a question. A statement. “I’ll produce it. Who do you want to play Bad Blake?”I told him I had written it forJeff Bridges, whom I didn’t know. And that I wanted T Bone Burnett to produce the music. I didn’t know him, either.A year later, Jeff Bridges finally read the script. The rest became part of my life’s storyBobby said, “Then write them letters.” Passionate letters. Honest letters. So I did.A year later, Jeff finally read the script. The rest became part of my life’s story. But it began with Bobby’s belief. To call him a mentor is inadequate. He was as close to a father as I’ve ever known. He didn’t have children, and I think, in some quiet way, we found something in each other that filled a space in both of us.We spoke nearly every day. Sometimes several times a day. We talked about Virginia – his beloved state, and mine. We talked about film endlessly. Coppola.Grosbard. Ford. Then Ray. Loach. Leigh.The Dardennes. International cinema we both loved, where truth was allowed to breathe.View image in fullscreenDuvall and Scott Cooper backstage at the Independent Spirit awards in Los Angeles in 2010.Photograph: Jeff Vespa/WireImageOne afternoon at his home in Virginia, he took me into his library – a quiet room filled with books, scripts, and the accumulated life of a man devoted entirely to the work. He led me to a corner where two handwritten notes were framed side by side on the wall.One was from Gene Kelly, praising Bobby’s performance inLonesome Dove. It ended with a gentle tease: “PS What, no tango?” Bobby smiled when I read it. Tango had become one of the great passions of his later life, something he shared with Luciana, his beloved Argentinian wife. He spoke about tango the way he spoke about acting – not as performance, but as truth. As listening.The other note was from Marlon Brando. Brando praised Bobby as one of the greatest screen actors that ever lived, and ended with words that felt at once deeply personal and universal: “In the meantime, take care of yourself, direct another movie, and stop looking for Tangerine. She doesn’t exist.”View image in fullscreenDuvall and Tommy Lee Jones in 1989’s Lonesome Dove.Photograph: Columbia/Sportsphoto/AllstarBobby never explained what Brando meant. He didn’t have to. He wasn’t showing me those letters to impress me. He was sharing something quieter – a reminder that even the greatest artists carry doubt, longing and the lifelong search for truth.That search defined him.Regarding acting and directing actors, he would say: “Don’t rehearse your actors and never have a goal in mind. Start at zero and let the scene take you somewhere unexpected. If you’ve done your work, it will take you where you’re supposed to go.”He believed that completely. He lived that way as an actor. You see it in The Godfather, in the quiet intelligence of Tom Hagen –consigliereto the Corleone crime family – the stillness behind the eyes. You see it in Apocalypse Now, in Kilgore’s terrifying calm. You see it in Tender Mercies, in every pause, every breath. And perhaps most of all, in his beloved Gus McCrae in Lonesome Dove. He never showed you emotion. He allowed you to discover it.He never performed. He simply existed.View image in fullscreenFrom left, front, Harry Melling, Cooper and Duvall, on set for The Pale Blue Eye in 2022.Photograph: Scott Garfield/Everett Collection/AlamyMy wife, Jocelyne, and I were married on his Virginia estate, land viewed by George Washington himself in 1746. At that house and mine, we talked about everything. Sports. Politics. He was an old-school Republican. I was a liberal Democrat. But we listened to each other. Really listened. There was no performance in those conversations, either. Just curiosity. Respect. But it was film that bound us most deeply.For more than two decades, Bobby was a steady presence in my life. He saw something in me before I had earned it. He protected that fragile early belief when it mattered most.Years later, I had the privilege of directing him, alongsideChristian Bale, in The Pale Blue Eye, in the winter of 2021-22. Watching him work again, after everything we had shared, felt like time folding in on itself. He was older, quieter, but the truth in him had only deepened. He needed less than ever. A glance. A breath. And everything was there.Robert Duvall: a life in picturesRead moreJust recently, we had spoken about another role – a blind man in a story about a wounded civil war soldier making his way home through enemy territory, like Odysseus finding his way back to Ithaca. Bobby understood that man immediately. He knew his weariness. His dignity. His grace. It was a role he was meant to play. One we never got to make.Robert Duvall’s legacy is secure. He is one of the greatest actors who ever lived. His work will endure as long as cinema itself endures. But that isn’t what I will miss most.I will miss his voice on the phone.His laughter.The way he made me feel that the work mattered, and that I mattered, too. I will miss my friend.I will miss Bobby D.Explore more on these topicsFilmRobert DuvallFilm industryJeff BridgesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Certainly not one who more or less defines our idea of the profession as it exists today, is widely considered to be its greatest practitioner and has been dead for more than 70 years.But as part of its new retrospective, theMuseum of the Liberation of Parishas produced a short but remarkable candid film ofRobert Capaon the job. He is largely unaware he is being filmed and the cameramen mostly do not know they are filming him.View image in fullscreenA street scene in Paris, 25 August 1944, shot by Robert Capa.Photograph: Robert Capa/International Center of Photography/Magnum PhotosThe researchers started with the 30 contact sheets – 24 rolls of film, about 500 photographs – the Hungarian-born photographer took on 25 and 26 August 1944, when the French capital was freed from four gruelling years of German occupation.Life, the multimillion-selling US magazine, published six of them in a 15-page spread entitledParisIs Free Again that would further cement the fame of the man Britain’s Picture Post had already dubbed “the greatest war photographer in the world”.In a process that took several months, the museum’s team first worked out precisely where Capa was when he took each one of those photos. Then they checked them against every frame of reams of US army footage filmed in the same spots.View image in fullscreenFrom Capa’s first published story: Leon Trotsky lectures Danish students in Copenhagen in 1932.Photograph: Robert Capa/International Center of Photography/Magnum PhotosThe result, said Sylvie Zaidman, the museum director, was startling. “He’s there,” she said. “We found him. We can see him, with the Free French in the suburbs and De Gaulle on the Champs-Élysées. Dodging bullets on the rue Saint-Dominique.”Above all, Zaidman said, the footage shows Capa working, his three cameras – two Contaxes, a larger-format Rolleiflex – around his neck, over two chaotic days in which up to 1,000 Frenchrésistantsdied: sprinting, crouching, mingling, spinning to shoot.“He invented a style, fashioned our whole perception of war photography,” Zaidman said. “Immediate, unposed, immersed in action. He said: ‘If your photographs aren’t good enough, you’re not close enough.’ And here we see him actually doing it.”The liberation of Paris was personal for Capa. Born Endre Friedmann in Budapest in 1913, he had arrived in the French capital in 1933 after a brief spell in Berlin. It was, he said, “a magnificent city” where he discovered “love, good wine and fine cuisine”.View image in fullscreenCapa in a Paris cafe in 1952.Photograph: Courtesy Ruth Orkin/Collection Capa/ Magnum PhotosIt was in Paris that he gave himself his new name, realising, as a Jewish exile and a vocal anti-fascist, that finding work would not necessarily be easy. “If he invented a photographic style,” Zaidman said, “he also invented, little by little, a character.”That character is now our image of the war photographer, she said. “American, typically. Intrepid, if not reckless – taking crazy risks for the one big shot. Hard drinking, poker playing, womanising, cynical. That was Capa. But it was fabricated.”Besides the film, the exhibition charts – in photos, magazines, articles, cameras and other objects – the photographer’s transition from youthful, anti-authoritarian interwar Hungarian émigré to globally feted US war photographer.It includes Capa’s first published photos, of Leon Trotsky in Copenhagen in 1932. In Paris his Montparnasse circle included fellow photographers-in-exile André Kertész, Gisèle Freund, David Szymin (Chim) and one Frenchman, Henri Cartier-Bresson.View image in fullscreenCrowds running for shelter as the air-raid alarm sounds, shot by Robert Capa in Bilbao, Spain, in May 1937.Photograph: Robert Capa/International Center of Photography/Magnum PhotosCapa published pictures of the leftwing Front Populaire in sympathetic magazines, aided by a girlfriend, Gerta Pohorylle, who worked for a photo agency and, as Gerda Taro, would accompany him to Spain – where she died, crushed by a tank, in 1937.Taro and Capa had arrived in Barcelona days after the start of the Spanish civil war, in late July 1936, his early shots already imbued with a humanity that meant he captured soldiers under fire with as much force as tearful children caught in an air raid.His break came that September, when Capa’s most celebrated shot was published in Vu magazine.Despite controversyover its location and the identity of its subject, The Falling Soldier remains one of the most astonishing war photographs of all time.Lovers and fighters: Robert Capa’s best second world war photographyRead moreLife and Picture Post began taking his work. He left for New York in 1939, but by 1941 was in London, then Africa and Sicily for the Allied landings. The 11 out-of-focus shots he grabbed from the slaughter of Omaha beach on D-day are terrifying.After the war, Capa co-founded the Magnum photo agency, had an affair with Ingrid Bergman, and mainly shot celebrities and fashion for Life, from Hollywood to the south of France. He was killed in 1954, in Vietnam, by stepping on a landmine.View image in fullscreenUS troops arrive at Omaha Beach during the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944, photographed by Robert Capa.Photograph: Robert Capa/International Center of Photography/Magnum PhotosDecades after Capa’s death, the exhibition’s 15-minutes film reveals his loping form, digitally highlighted, haring towards the heart of the action; taking cover as shots get too close; jumping on to a Free French scout car; mixing with the half-fearful, half-jubilant crowd.On just one occasion he slips out of role. After a fierce exchange of fire between German troops and the Free French fighters in the rue de Bourgogne, Capa followed the victors to the Palais Bourbon, home of the French parliament.There, US film footage clearly shows him first photographing a uniformed Nazi officer, clutching a white cloth, approaching and speaking to the German soldiers still inside – then setting his camera aside and helping talk them into surrender.Capa, said Zaidman, “photographed not war but the actors and the victims of war. Like him, his pictures had to speak.” The exhibition, she said, seeks to place his iconic images in “their personal and historical context. A tighter focus, you might say.”Robert Capa: War Photographer opens on 18 February at the Musée de la Libération de Paris and runs until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsCultureRobert CapaPhotographySecond world warParisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a statement today, the pair said: “George’s storytelling is Shakespearean in its scale and its themes: dynastic struggle, ambition, rebellion, madness, prophecy, ill-fated love. From the beginning, Shakespeare’s histories and tragedies have been our primary reference for the ambition of this production, so the RSC feels like a natural home.”Tamara Harvey and Daniel Evans, the RSC’s co-artistic directors since 2023, said the new play’s “epic cycle of warring families sits in a continuum with Shakespeare’s history cycles”. They added that the play will explore “the true nature of authority through the lens of young people grappling with inherited identities”.View image in fullscreenCharles Dance is one of several former RSC actors to appear in the TV series Game of Thrones.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyMartin, who will serve as executive producer, has already visited the company’s headquarters in Stratford and is said to have greatly enjoyed his trip to the armoury department. “I never imagined that it would be anything other than a book,” he said of the novel A Game of Thrones, which was published in 1996 and began a series with the collective title A Song of Ice and Fire. “It was a place for my imagination to exist without limits,” he continued. “To my great surprise, it was adapted for a [TV] series, and viewers have been able to enter the world of my imagination through the medium of television. For my work to now be adapted for the stage is something I did not expect but welcome with great enthusiasm and excitement.”Produced by HBO, Game of Thrones ran for eight seasons from 2011-19 and has already inspired major prequels for television: House of the Dragon and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. The play takes place over a decade before the events of Game of Thrones and will feature familiar characters from the houses of Targaryen, Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Martell. A promotional synopsis states: “A long winter thaws in Harrenhal, and spring is promised. At a lavish banquet on the eve of a jousting tournament, lovers meet and revellers speculate about who will contend. But in the shadows, amid growing unease at the bloodthirsty actions of the realm’s merciless Mad King, dissenters from his inner circle anxiously advance a treasonous plot. Far away, the drums of battle sound.”View image in fullscreenA new chapter of the story … (l-r) Daniel Evans, Duncan Macmillan, George RR Martin, Tamara Harvey and Dominic Cooke.Photograph: Seamus Ryan, copyright RSCSeveral of the actors who starred in the TV series appeared with the RSC earlier in their careers, among them Julian Glover, Diana Rigg, Sean Bean, Charles Dance and Iain Glen. Casting and dates for the new play have not yet been announced; tickets will be available from April. It is to be staged in the RSC’s main auditorium, the Royal Shakespeare theatre, which seats just over 1,000 theatregoers.Some say theatres are staging too many adaptations of hit novels and TV series, but the RSC will be hoping to attract new audiences with such a franchise, much as it has with its triumphant version of the Studio Ghibli filmMy Neighbour Totoro, which opened at the Barbican in 2022 and has been running in the West End for a year. The company has recently been seeking toreduce its workforceand considering other savings to tackle a financial shortfall.Macmillan, whose plays includeLungs, and Cooke, who is about to take over as theAlmeida theatre’s new artistic director, said: “It will be thrilling for us to share this new play with audiences, both those that know and love George’s books and HBO’s series but also audiences who know nothing and want to come and experience something both beautifully intimate and truly epic.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Shakespeare CompanyGeorge RR MartinGame of ThronesDuncan MacmillannewsShareReuse this content"

One of his first roles was in Michael Cimino’s Heaven’s Gate and he then appeared in the Tom Hanks comedy The Man with One Red Shoe and action thriller F/X.In 1986, he worked with Mann on the Thomas Harris adaptation Manhunter, playing serial killer Francis Dolarhyde.“I was making a little bit from my acting, but I was really poor and desperate, and this is a real part,” Noonan later said in aninterview. “I proceeded then to turn it down about five times. I just wanted to get paid more than they were willing to pay me. They wanted to pay me like $35,000 to do this whole movie. That was money back in 1985, but I said: ‘I’m not doing it for under $100,000.’ My agent said, ‘You’re crazy.’ Somehow, they ended up giving me that amount of money.”Noonan would later reunite with Mann for 1995’s Heat.“Terribly sad about Tom Noonan passing,” Mannwroteon social media today.His credits also included RoboCop 2, Last Action Hero, The Astronaut’s Wife, The Pledge, The House of the Devil and Eight Legged Freaks. He also made two films with Charlie Kaufman: Synecdoche, New York and Anomalisa, where he voiced all of the supporting characters. Noonan’s last big-screen credit was the Todd Haynes fantasy Wonderstruck alongside Michelle Williams.On the small screen, Noonan appeared in shows including The X Files, The Leftovers, Damages and The Blacklist.“I’ve always been a very quiet person, and ironic, and subtle, and a lot of the parts that I get to play are these loudmouth maniacs who have something really wrong with them,”Noonan said in 1994.As well as What Happened Was …, Noonan also wrote a play called Wifey which he later turned into a movie called The Wife.Explore more on these topicsFilmnewsShareReuse this content"

Güell was the owner of a cement company with mines in the region and he needed somewhere to house the engineers, many of them British, who would help extract the coal for his factories.View image in fullscreenGaudí’s Park Güell in Barcelona.Photograph: MasterLu/Getty/iStockphotoIt has long been suspected that the chalet, now not in use, was the work of Gaudí but historians had not firmly established the architect. The building contains elements of Gaudí’s naturalistic style, evoking the forms of plants and animals that would later be expressed in works such as Park Güell and the Casa Batllò in Barcelona. The pointed arch structure also foreshadows Gaudí’s best-known work, theSagrada Famíliain Barcelona.View image in fullscreenGaudí died on 10 June 1926, at the age of 73, three days after being hit by a tram in Barcelona.Photograph: Heritage Images/GettySònia Hernández Almodóvar, the Catalan culture minister, said the attribution was the fruit of “rigorous research which is of enormous value for our heritage” and enriched Gaudí’s legacy on the centenary of his death.The analysis was carried out by the Catalan heritage department led by the chair of Gaudí studies, Galdric Santana Roma. “After much research we have concluded that the Xalet del Catllaràs is the work of Gaudí,” he said. “However, this attribution is strictly limited to the initial stages of the project as Gaudí didn’t supervise the work which didn’t follow faithfully the original design.”Santana said the process of certifying an architectural work is very different from that of a painting and the knowledge acquired in the study of the chalet will contribute to investigating other works attributed to Gaudí.Gaudí died on 10 June 1926, at the age of 73, three days after being hit by a tram in Barcelona, and numerous commemorative events and exhibitions are planned throughout the centenary year.View image in fullscreenThe central tower of Gaudí’s Sagrada Família in Barcelona will be completed in June.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/GettyThe installation in June of the final elements of the illuminated cross atop the central Jesus Christ tower of the Sagrada Família, more than 140 years after the project began in 1882, is likely to have the longest-lasting impact on the city’s skyline.Initially funded by repentant sinners and more recently by tourism, the completion of the tower will make it, at 172.5 metres, Barcelona’s tallest building. The Sagrada Família is already the world’s tallest church since part of its central tower was lifted into place in October.View image in fullscreenThe chalet in the Catllaràs mountains features pointed arches that Gaudí also used in the Sagrada Família.Photograph: Sergi Boixader/AlamyGaudí devoted the latter part of his life to the Sagrada Família, but little of it was completed in the architect’s lifetime, and work practically came to a halt at the outbreak of the Spanish civil war in 1936. The rise of mass tourism after the 1992 Olympic Games helped to make Barcelona a popular tourist destination and work on the church accelerated and moved into its final stages.Work on the Glory facade is expected to last another 10 years, and there remains the thorny issue of constructing the grand entrance stairway, in Gaudí’s original plan, that would now entail rehousing 10,000 people and demolishing about 3,000 apartments.Explore more on these topicsAntoni GaudíBarcelonaSpainEuropeArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

Nice work if you can get it, andGordon Ramsayhas got it. Being Gordon Ramsay, a six part –six part– documentary, follows the chef ’n’ TV personality as he embarks on his most ambitious venture yet. It’s “A huge undertaking”, “high risk, high reward”, a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and “one of my final stakes in the ground … If it fails, I’m fucked.” It is opening seven billion (five, but it feels like seven billion) restaurants on the top floors of 22 Bishopsgate at once. There is going to be a 60-seat rooftop garden place with retractable roof, a 250-seater Asian-inflected restaurant called Lucky Cat, a Bread Street Kitchen brasserie and a culinary school.But we begin with a family scene. The youngest of Ramsay’s six children with wife of 30 years, Tana, are having pancakes. Gordon thinks they are too thick. They’re American-style, not the crepes he thinks they should have. “Darling,” says Tana, not for the first time even that morning, you suspect, “Could you just give it a rest?”View image in fullscreenTilly Ramsay with dad Gordon.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe defining feature of Ramsay, of course, is that he cannot. No Michelin-starred chef can. They are not made that way. When he is with his children, he is fully with his children (“Megan’s 27, the twins Holly and Jack are 25, Matilda’s 23, Oscar’s six, Jessie James is 18 months. Did I miss any of them? Thank fuck for that”). Running and jumping and playing with the little ones, planning weddings and engagement parties and buying inaugural chef whites with the older ones – he is apparently inexhaustible and they, like Tana, clearly adore him, while also (in the elders’ case at least) having a firm handle on the man.The same – at least in this extended advert for the Ramsay brand – is essentially true at work. His chefs respect him because he’s walked the walk before, talking the talk, and they all strive to do their best, both for him and – as they are all cut from the same perfectionist cloth as Ramsay – justbecause.It is watching these people adhere to an abstract ideal – to the idea so unfashionable that it is rapidly becoming unfathomable – that everyone should work to the highest standard at all times because that is the right thing to do that saves Being Gordon Ramsay from being (as the man himself might put it) the absolute bollocks it could be. And then there’s just the simple pleasure of seeing them construct the most mouthwatering dishes you will ever, if you can afford it, eat – with a knowledge and skill that is almost as delicious to watch.View image in fullscreenRoom at the top … Ramsay surveys the view from his new premises.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixSix hours of the many dramas associated with getting five businesses up and running at the same time does feel like quite a lot – each of the premises needing to be designed and built from scratch and a retractable roof added to one. But it does at least allow for an appreciation of the attention to detail that must be paid to a successful launch. The menus and the tastings – you can’t make a rum baba too small or it won’t aerate properly – are only part of it. There are the pockets on the prototype aprons that must be removed because Ramsay knows wait staff naturally fill them with bits and pieces and soon look scruffy. There is the vetoing of leather seating being added to one restaurant’s design, taking up space that would cost them two covers, or £300, a night. There are a million other things and Ramsay is across them all. Does he have time to couch every decision in soft words? No. Is he needlessly rude? No and no. There’s a reason for everything he does, he gives it, he moves on. You need to have a good sense of self and plenty of confidence to deal with him, for sure, but if you don’t I am of the school of thought that says that is a you problem, not him. He is nonetheless a Marmite proposition, that’s for sure, and an entire sociology module could be written around him and people’s reactions to him.In the meantime, there’s this fluffy nonsense with occasional nuggets of insight. Enjoy or don’t. No offence, but Ramsay’s got better fucking things to worry about.Being Gordon Ramsay is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionGordon RamsayDocumentaryFactual TVBusiness TVFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

But before I tell you what it is, I had better tell you what it is not. On Morrison is not a biography. Except for scattered references, there is little here about Chloe Anthony Wofford’s birth and early life in Lorain, Ohio; her education at Howard and Cornell universities; her editorial work at Random House; or her phenomenal success as a novelist. Nor is this book for fans who turn to Toni Morrison for inspirational quotes or to scorepolitical points.Instead, On Morrison offers readers who can tell their Soaphead Church from their Schoolteacher something they have long hoped for: a rigorous appraisal of the work. Despite her enormous contribution to American letters, Morrison’s novels are still too often read for what they have to say about black life, rather than how they say it.Song of Solomonand Jazz are more likely to be found on African American studies syllabi than creative writing ones. In her introduction to On Morrison, Namwali Serpell identifies the reason: “She is difficult to read. She is difficult to teach.”Serpell, the author of two ambitious novels thatstraddle genres,generationsand continents, brings to the project of reading Morrison an understanding of what it means to be difficult, and to be called difficult. She does Morrison the respect of reading her seriously. Across the book’s 12 essays, she identifies and critiques narrative strategies, puzzles over craft choices, compares formal techniques across novels, and chases edits and revisions in the archives.This journey through Morrison’s oeuvre begins withThe Bluest Eye. To tell the story of Pecola, the little black girl who wishes she had blue eyes, Morrison broke the narrative into parts, each filtered through a different character’s perspective, forcing the reader to “piece together the myriad overdetermined forces that have obliterated this young girl”. Pecola suffers horrifying abuse at the hands of her father, who eventually rapes and impregnates her. The fragmented narrative “is an effort to create a specific reading experience – not passive pity or easy demonising, but active reassembly and self-interrogation – through a formal structure”.“The structure is the argument”, as Morrison often said. In Recitatif, the only short story she ever published, the narrative is built around five encounters between two women, Roberta and Twyla, over several decades. Early on, we learn that one of the women is white and the other black, but we are never told which is which. Morrison draws readers into a guessing game that demonstrates the arbitrariness of race and its dependence on contrast for it to acquire meaning. Serpell uncovers startling details in the archives. I did not know, for example, that Recitatif started out as a screenplay treatment for actors Marlo Thomas and Cicely Tyson.I felt guided by a writer who shares both my admiration of Morrison and my fear of lionisingCan the mystery of the women’s identity finally be solved, then? “Personally, I’ll never tell,” Serpell promises. Instead, she doggedly traces the transformation from treatment to story, finding more intriguing nuggets along the way. In June 1982, about the time the film was likely turned down, Morrison had just finished reading Nettie Jones’s Fish Tales, which is structured as a series of first-person vignettes that refrains from revealing characters’ races. A month later, Serpell writes, “Morrison submitted … a radical revision” of her story, this time with “an experiment in the removal of all racial codes”. It’s comforting to know that even geniuses take inspiration from others.Elsewhere, Serpell identifies the humour in Morrison’s work, especially in Song of Solomon. The protagonist, Milkman Dead, visits his paternal aunt Pilate Dead, prompting her to quip: “Ain’t but three Deads alive,” and Milkman to respond: “I’m a Dead! My mother’s a Dead!” Milkman embarks on an Odyssean quest to find out more about his great-grandfather, who escaped slavery by “flying” back to Africa. By grounding its narrative in folktales, Greek and African, the novel “syncretizes disparate traditions, both reinforcing the originary hybridity of archetypal tales and making them coincide and conflict in its mid-20th-century milieu”.One reason On Morrison was such a joy to read is that I felt guided by a writer who shares both my admiration and my fear of lionising. Serpell happens to be African and an immigrant, facts that I think attune her to the centrality of the black experience as well as the estrangement of peripheral characters. Morrison read widely, learning from African elders such as Camara Laye (for whose novel The Radiance of the King she wrote an introduction),Chinua Achebeand Bessie Head. By contrast, she could be incurious about Native American characters in her earlier novels, an oversight she addressed inA Mercy.At times Serpell’s tone slips from the ruthlessly observant “I” of the critic into the “we” of the professor guiding students through a thorny text (she teaches at Harvard). Though she agonises over panning the woman she calls “my elder”, she admits Morrison’s poetry is “not good” and pours deserved scorn on a messy post-9/11 essay that is unworthy of Morrison’s intellect.Yet such criticisms only reinforce the integrity of her analysis. With On Morrison, Serpell has managed to deliver a book that works on many levels: as a study of craft, as a critical appraisal, and as a tribute to an artist who was difficult in all the right ways.On Morrison by Namwali Serpell, is published by Chatto & Windus (£25).

A sequence of events, mostly beyond her control, leaves her stranded in an unfamiliar town. It’s dead quiet, except for a travelling circus camped on the outskirts. M checks into a hotel, ignores her phone and wanders around, reminiscing about books read, films watched, museums visited. Some of these recollections are grounded in fable; others are vividly realistic. Among the latter are memories of her childhood and youth, spent in a “country that no longer exists apart from on old maps and in history books”.M describes the country she comes from as a “beast” waging war against its neighbour. We can guess her meaning without turning to the author’s biographical note. Maria Stepanova – whose masterlyIn Memory of Memorycombined family memoir, essay and fiction – left her native Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We might also wonder how closely The Disappearing Act tracks her own life. But the novelist M is not here to discuss autofiction – she has more important things to reflect on.What was it like inside the beast? “She’d lived her whole life … doing nothing, or doing only what came naturally to her, and wanting to believe she had got away with it.” Was it wrong of her to enjoy her life there? She understands that “joy was the very thing the beast was bent on annihilating … and that it was important to keep it alive to spite the beast”, but that’s little consolation now that her former compatriots are killing others “with missiles, with fire from the sky, with bare hands”.She forces bread into her mouth, as if trying to convince herself that she is hungry and therefore still thereM’s relationship with the legacy of her one-time homeland – first and foremost, its language – is inevitably compromised. One of the stories she retells, the tale of a linguist whose tongue is cut out before he can use it, could be about herself. But the book’s laconic style, with distant echoes of poetry, skilfully conveyed by translator Sasha Dugdale, shows that M still has the power of telling.True to the novel’s title, M’s presence gradually diminishes, starting from her realisation that she is “cut off, a spare limb”. Watching young lovers, “she felt as if these things no longer affected her; the economy of erotic selection and exchange bore no relation to her current existence”. Served bread in a cafe, she leaves it on the plate before suddenly forcing it into her mouth, as if trying to convince herself that she is hungry and therefore still there. These transformations may be alarming, but when “her inner self … gradually quietened, becoming soft, childlike”, it brings a sense of freedom and possibility. Part of her longs to recreate the dream in which “she was on a train to the dacha, the years falling away from her as she travelled” until she was a small child again.Her mother once told her about a sign reading “There is no way out”: M considers her own exit strategy. Can she find a “novel way out of a hopeless situation”? With no set plan, she visits the circus and offers to help perform a magic act. It involves lying in a sarcophagus with her knees up to her chin, which she finds “boring and painful” though not hard. The owner of the circus asks her if she is a Jew, and M, happily discarding her “Russian novelist” identity, says yes.The world has labelled her a writer, yet she wants to be seen as herself – whatever that might be – and the circus promises a chance of that. She leaves most of her possessions behind and sets off to join the troupe. She’ll walk through the empty town; she’ll start again at the beginning. It’s not too late, is it?“There was so much guilt around M, and in her, that it was hard to breathe” – over the past four years, this sentiment has become familiar to many Russians opposing the war in Ukraine. Authors such asMikhail Shishkinhave spoken about collective guilt in their nonfiction; a “common enough motif”, as M says of yet another remembered story. Wherever her escapade brings her next, she is proof that it takes a novelist with poetic imagination to capture the nature of the beast.The Disappearing Act by Maria Stepanova, translated by Sasha Dugdale, is published by Fitzcarraldo (£12.99).

We have IP (beloved Ealing comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets), a Black List script (originally titled Rothchild back in 2014), a man-of-the-moment lead (the ubiquitous Glen Powell), a woman-of-the-moment co-star (the equally ubiquitous Margaret Qualley), an of-the-moment trend (eat the rich), an indie company turned merch-able brand (A24) and a film-maker who recently broke out with a buzzed-about debut (Emily the Criminal’s John Patton Ford). If ChatGPT were to create an AI service for studio execs, this would be an obvious green light.Crime 101 review – bracing tale of master thief lifts a trick or two from Michael MannRead moreBut when dragged into the real world, of discernment and taste, it’s a package that brings up a string of concerning questions. Can Powell pull off burgeoning murderous psychopath? Is it time to stop relying on the Black List as a taste test for quality? Has eat the rich fatigue set in? And, most importantly, why on earth would one try to remake a close-to-perfect classic?At the end of 110 minutes, I can provide the answers: no, yes, 100% and I really have no idea.I had plenty of thinking time at least, given how utterly tepid the whole thing is, an experience akin to watching someone try to light a match when the entire box is wet. Ford wants this to be snappy and stylish, and while it certainly has the feel of prestige pop (apart from Cape Town making for an unconvincing New York stand-in), there’s no spark here, no breath that hasn’t been stolen from elsewhere.The 1949 original, one of the most deliciously black-hearted comedies ever made, is both very much of its time (including the jarring usage of a racist nursery rhyme) and timeless in its plotting. The story, of an unfairly cast out man killing his way up the family tree to get his inheritance, remains as darkly alluring as it ever was, a captivating game of push-pull as our protagonist descends from a place of sympathy to a position of monstrosity. Reports had suggested the redo was “inspired” by the original but this is a clearcut remake, many of the beats remaining almost identical, just effortfully pulled into a new era.Louis is now Becket, whose mother rejected her wealthy family’s insistent suggestion of an abortion after she found herself young, unmarried and pregnant. She’s pushed out of their cushioned luxury (all the way to New Jersey) to become a struggling single mother but when she dies years later, Becket becomes a young orphan, forced into the foster system. Yet more years later, unhappily toiling away as a low-paid retail worker, he hatches a plan to get what’s rightfully his.The route to the top of the food chain is similar but with some modern tweaks – the rowboat has become a yacht, the village photographer an insufferable Brooklyn artist, the reverend a flashy celeb-preacher – but the edges have all been smoothed. There’s nothing here that comes close to the sour nastiness of Louis’s glee over diphtheria killing twin infants in the infinitely icier original (plus the mother as a bonus) with Ford making Becket’s victims all more obviously awful and deserving of whatever violence comes their way (it’s perhaps wise that no one tried to repeat Alec Guinness’s astonishing gambit of taking on all eight victims, instead they’re played by actors including Topher Grace and a scene-devouring Ed Harris).Powell, with his exaggerated comic book attributes, plays the character like a Disney-fied Patrick Bateman, completely lacking in any real darkness, smooth rather than slippery, swapping acid for snark (his delivery is increasingly in danger of dipping into dreaded Ryan Reynolds territory). As his childhood friend turned adult foe, Qualley certainly has more bite (one can see her swiftly dispatching Powell in a knife fight) but there’s no chemistry and no serious stakes to his relationship with Jessica Henwick’s increasingly suspicious hipster.Ford is far too keen for us to side with Becket, portrayed as a man just trying to stay afloat in a sea filled with snakes, and so whatever interest we might have had in watching someone gleefully discover their psychopathic knack for murder is evaporated (Ford managed Aubrey Plaza’s criminal discovery far better in his previous film – in fact Plaza would have made a far more suitable lead here). Updating a story such as this, with the original set at the start of the 1900s, means that whatever tricks Louis might have used back then would mostly be impossible now, with DNA and security cameras, and Ford falls over himself trying to awkwardly explain things away, turning an elegant crime caper into something far clumsier. There’s also no real satire here either (moneyed folk are apparently bad, did you realise?) and at this stage of the rich-eating cycle, I just want it to be over. Forget a killing, Ford has made a real mess instead.How to Make a Killing is out in the US on 20 February, Australia on 5 March and the UK on 13 MarchExplore more on these topicsGlen PowellComedy filmsComedyMargaret QualleyEd HarrisThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was a natural and human-made disaster that left 20,000 dead and a further 164,000 displaced from the area, some with no prospect of return. The earthquake damaged the cooling systems that prevent meltdowns and caused three near-apocalyptic explosions, bringing the nation close to a catastrophe that would have threatened its very existence. Incredibly, the ultimate calamity was finally staved off by nothing more hi-tech than a committed fire brigade spraying thousands of tons of water on the exposed fuel rods.The film plunges us into the awful story moment-by-moment, accompanied by interviews with the chief players of the time – prominently nuclear plant employee Ikuo Izawa, a shift supervisor and de facto leader of the“Fukushima 50”(actually 69 people) who became legendary in Japan and beyond for their self-sacrificial courage, staying in a nightmarish reactor when everyone else had been evacuated.Perhaps we could have been given more context and less immediate drama, particularly more background about the plant’s dismal corporate owners, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, which had closed a nuclear plant in 2007 after an earthquake, with a resulting loss of profits. But to skimp on the drama might be obtuse, given the pure hair-raising shock of events. The archive footage of the tsunami spreading across the fields and farmland ofJapanis deeply disturbing; “nightmare” is a word casually used, but appropriate here.The Japanese soul had been uniquely traumatised by the nuclear issue in 1945 andFukushimawas the opening of an old wound; Barack Obama’s offers to help were received warily and the film hints that some of a certain age might have even suspected a kind of opportunistic emergency takeover, like the Douglas MacArthur rule that followed the war. There is something chillingly military in the company’s need for volunteers for a so-called “suicide squad” to vent the reactors to forestall a pressure buildup.And as far as comparisons with the Chornobyl disaster go, that involved a single reactor; Fukushima had six ready to blow. Before I watched this film, I assumed that Japan’s modern democracy would at least have meant more transparency than the sclerotic and malign Soviet apparatchiks. But maybe not. Tepco has still not released a full history of exactly what went wrong and what discussions took place at the time. And in any case, politicians were themselves dismally eager to cover themselves by tentatively blaming Tepco.The Fukushima towns frozen in time: nature has thrived since the nuclear disaster but what happens if humans return?Read moreThe most robust witness here is the New York Times’s Tokyo bureau chief Martin Fackler, who gives us a crisp account of the official chaos and bungling – and the fact that Tepco had already received a report indicating the Fukushima plant was vulnerable to an earthquake and did nothing. He is interesting on corporate obeisance to the “safety myth”, an industry article of faith which does not result in vigilant and innovative efforts to improve safety, but rather icy disapproval of anyone who questions existing safety provisions. Doing so was disloyalty to the industry and could damage your career.Perhaps inevitably, the larger questions are left open. Fossil fuels cause slow-motion catastrophe to the planet – in fact, not so slow – while nuclear fuel does not cause climate change, but could cause instant calamity. So is the answer simply what the industry says it is? More and better safety? Or can other renewables fill the gap? Either way, this is a gripping film.Fukushima is out in the UK and US from 20 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsFukushimaJapanJapan disasterNuclear powerAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nonetheless, here it is: a feature film in the Berlin competition from screenwriter Angelo Tijssens and director Anke Blondé, handsomely produced and shot, and impeccably acted. But it’s also weirdly parochial, leaving you with the sense that it has not reached beyond its immediate concerns; and it’s not clear as to why, exactly, we need a fictionalised crisis from the 90s inspired by areal-life financial fraud scandal.Well, perhaps the point is that very smallness and sadness: a pathetic tale of the first, almost-forgotten dotcom bust, which holds an omen for our AI-obsessed present. Arieh Worthalter and Jan Hammenecker play Geert and Luc, two balding guys who, in the late 90s, are Belgium’s pinup boys of tech innovation. Their startup company has gone public and made them both very rich, and all their local friends, family and businesses have plunged every cent of their savings into shares. Geert and Luc are now poised to turn the mud of Flanders into a European Silicon Valley.There is some droll comedy as the two host a dynamic corporate presentation in which, to gasps from the assembled suit-wearing attendees, they unveil what in 2026 looks like hilariously clunky voice-to-text hardware. Steve Jobs these guys ain’t. But in the audience is investigative journalist Aaron (Anthony Welsh), who confronts them with the awful truth: for years they have been fabricating profits to boost their share price, secure lucrative government grants and, on some unconscious level, bolster their own ridiculous egos. His story will break on Monday, leaving them and their investors penniless, and with Geert and Luc facing a prison sentence.The film follows the calvary of their empty Sunday before the police arrive, as they scramble around individually for a way out, burning and shredding bales of documents, with Luc suspecting that Geert is going to sell him down the river. Both have secret stashes of cash. Geert, a gay man, is in a casual relationship with his driver-assistant Kenneth (Thibaud Dooms) who, however, has no place in Geert’s new scheme: jetting off that very day to a South American country with no extradition arrangements with Belgium. Geert pays a last visit to his sister, who runs a bakery and doesn’t know she faces ruin because of her investment in his worthless firm, but he can’t warn her to sell for fear of providing evidence of insider trading.Animol review – gritty young offenders drama challenges conventional machismoRead moreLuc has family: a dad in a care home to whom he pays one final, poignant visit to ask if the old man is “proud of him”, plus a wife who tolerates him and an estranged grownup daughter who does not. His final emotional breakdown-slash-epiphany comes when his BMW gets stuck in a muddy field and he staggers out into the rain and gazes at a couple of cows, who gaze incuriously back. Is this the brutal, unglamorous truth? His dreams of a glitzy future here mocked by the reality of an economy which was for centuries suitable only for agriculture? Do these cows embody a primitive innocence which he can only see now?The “dust” of the title is that dust into which all of these vain dreams of riches will crumble. Maybe “mud” would have served just as well.Dust screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmBerlin film festivalFestivalsBerlin film festival 2026BelgiumPeriod and historical filmsEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps best known as T’Challa in Black Panther, he was also a writer – and this2005 playbears all the lost promise of his talents.It is an ambitious, sprawling, music-filled story of a Black woman, Azure (Selina Jones), mourning her fiance, Deep (Jayden Elijah), who has been killed by a police officer. Inspired by the 2000 death of a university student, Prince Jones, it splices the theme of police violence in the US with a Shakespearean plot of jealousy, injustice, revenge and grief.The last of these is explored through a powerful portrait of Azure’s eating disorder alongside the reactions of Deep’s friends Tone (Elijah Cook) and Roshad (Justice Ritchie). Jones is astounding in the intensity of her performance, in her character’s anguish and interludes of movement.View image in fullscreenIntense … Selina Jones as Azure.Photograph: Sam TaylorThe play is a rich blend of hip-hop, song and verse, the language Shakespearean, too, in its lyricism. It was partly inspired by Shakespeare’s poetry and features snippets of his writing (such as the “too too solid flesh” soliloquy from Hamlet). The central storyline on avenging (or otherwise) the unjust death of a loved one traces that of Hamlet itself.The details around Deep’s death are initially opaque and Boseman’s experimental narrative appears deliberately abstruse, jumping from modern-day America to tsarist Russia, Rasputin and the enactment of a caterpillar chrysalis transforming into a butterfly. There are also satirical riffs on TV culture (such as Jerry Springer) and consumerism by a chorus.Dynamically directed by Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu, this ensemble has a vital presence as they beatbox, rap, sing and dance, although they are another puzzle of the piece, dressed in space-age costumes at the beginning, later turned into the marching-band members of a fictional university that Deep attended. They are human or not, as required, becoming parts of a car or cooing pigeons.‘You are all the Black Panther’: the electric theatre of Chadwick BosemanRead moreThere are times when the narrative grows too arcane to follow, the various strands seeming disparate and diversionary. The play pulls out some shocking twists and is faster, smoother and less perplexing in the second half, when its puzzling parts come together.It is complicated in its non-naturalism, but that is no bad thing.

You’ll find it in the back aisle of a Co-op supermarket on Ecclesall Road.“Anyone noticed how nice the freezers sound in the eccy road co-op?”someone wrote on the Sheffield Reddit page in January. “It’s like all the fans have been carefully tuned to the calmest droning chord ever, it’s like being in an electrical gong bath.”Earlier this week, another Redditor shared a video of the freezers in all their aural glory, later earning a huge second audience when reposted to X. A debate ensued. Was it tuned to C# major? Could you hear the opening of Nothing Compares 2 U somewhere in the electronic hum? “I think it’s developed a slight discordant edge over the last couple of months,”one Reddit user wrote. “It’s ageing like fine wine.”View image in fullscreenTuned to C# major”? … the Ecclesall Road Co-op.Photograph: Alim KherajI was curious, and the Ecclesall Road shop is not too far from where I live. Armed with an iPhone, I went to see if I could capture the sound.Immediately, I was struck by how noisy the supermarket was. Alongside Co-op’s in-store radio, the fridges housing prepacked sandwiches and chilled fruit were giving off a low groan. I wondered if there could be an ambient classic hiding in every appliance, before I remembered the mechanical buzz that my own fridge makes throughout the day. That was not the calming drone I’d heard online.I headed to the back of the shop and to a cluster of three freezers. This was it. The sound they were making was an unbelievable symphonic hum. I stood entranced; it was like listening to an orchestra playing underwater. I whipped out my phone and recorded.Audio recording of the 'symphonic' fridges in a Sheffield supermarketGiven the discussion about the freezers online, I asked staff if they had noticed the noise. One lady behind the till seemed confused and said she hadn’t seen anyone else coming in to soak up the drone. Another staff member, manning the self-checkouts, was also miffed. “We’ve only noticed it today,” he said. “It’s like an orchestra.”There is a long history of musicians utilising found sounds and the noise of industry in their compositions. In the early 20th century, Italian futurist composer Luigi Russolo builtintonarumori– noise generators designed to mimic sounds including cities and transport. Russian composer Arseny Avraamov incorporated the sounds of a flotilla, cannon, locomotives, artillery regiments, sirens, foghorns and a choir in his 1922 composition Symphony of Sirens, the city of Baku becoming his orchestra.Later, in the mid-20th century, composers such as Pierre Schaeffer and Egypt’s Halim El-Dabh developed what became known as musique concrète, a form of composition that used field recordings as instruments. It’s a technique that would evolve into the sampling used in music today, but one many musicians still embrace: in 2018, Nottingham-based label KIKS/GFR releaseda compilation of field recordings of different fridges.View image in fullscreenField recordings as instruments … musique concrète composer Pierre Schaeffer.Photograph: INA/Getty ImagesThe noise of the freezers, however, was far more harmonic. I texted the recording to my boyfriend, an aficionado of ambient and experimental music. “It sounds more like a synthesised human voice,” he said in a voice note. “The obvious reference is Brian Eno’s Ambient 1: Music for Airports. On the second track, it’s all synthesised choral voices and they sound human but also unnervingly nonhuman.”He’s not wrong: there are similarities between Co-op’s freezers and Eno’s 2/1 in their particular haunting qualities. What it reminded me more of, though, was the noise emitted by electric cars; which, depending on the make and model, consist of everything from orchestral samples to recordings of the didgeridoo.But unlike Eno and the electric cars, the noise coming from the freezers, much like the music found in nature, exists without a compositional hand. It’s this, explains Dr Benjamin Tassie, an Ivor Novello-nominated composer based in Sheffield, that draws us to these sounds. “We go around the world blocking out sounds a lot of the time,” he says. “These sounds are unexpected. They jolt us out of ourselves and attune us to the world in a different way. The natural overtone series that exist in something like a drone or the squeak of a door have a harmoniousness to them.”​AI slop, begone! The viral musical virtuosos bringing brains and brilliance back to social mediaRead moreOn my way home, I decided to see if my local Co-op freezers were also musical. To my delight, I could hear a hum – one that, despite visiting the shop many times a week, I had never noticed. I thought of all the times I’d stalked the aisles, headphones jammed in my ears, and the sounds I might have missed.A Co-op spokesperson had this to say: “While we’re unable to confirm whether the freezers are rehearsing for their next orchestral recital, it’s good to hear our shoppers are enjoying the freezer section at Ecclesall Road Co-op.”Given the ongoing discussion online, and the number of posts by people saying they were going to take recording equipment down to the Co-op to capture the drone, the freezer song may well go on to become something bigger. (“Can someone with skills clean this up and make a 10-hour YouTube version?” read one Reddit request.)For me, though, the freezer’s symphony is a poignant reminder to acknowledge the surprising beauty in the world. As Tassie says: “Listening to the world around us as music can reframe and reimagine what it means to listen.” Surely, we could all do with more of that.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockExperimental musicElectronic musicSheffieldfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of her forthcoming album This Music May Contain Hope, she teases its contents from the off, with I Will Overcome. Raye is in a long fake fur coat, leather gloves and sunglasses, looking like the lead from a film noir with the song as its soundtrack: she begins with third-person narration but switches into singing as the character she’s created. When the curtain drops, it reveals a huge band that launches into the rousing and infectious funk stomp of Where Is My Husband!. Raye and her singers reappear in sparkling red dresses, creating an air of elegance and glamour reminiscent of old school Vegas, before thundering drums, brass and strings collide with the theatrical heft of a James Bond number. It’s a beginning so huge that it resembles a finale. “I’ve fully entered my dramatic era,” Raye declares.View image in fullscreenBig, bold, emphatic yet intimate … Raye.Photograph: Aaron Parsons Photography/The GuardianWhile the show is big, bold and emphatic, it’s also intimate. The stage turns into a little jazz club at one point where Raye delivers a playful cover of Fly Me to the Moon. There are several more mood shifts, too, from the neo-soul grooves of Suzanne, to the heartbreaking piano ballad of Ice Cream Man, about sexual violence.‘They are not manufactured’: how Brit school stars took over the GrammysRead moreThe nightclub segment – where a Raye sign gets turned into one that says rave – is fully dedicated to giddy release. She veers into house on You Don’t Know Me, then leans even further into euphoric dance on Prada. A new song, Joy, is a celebration of the emotion, fusing full-band disco and 1960s soul. It’s testament to Raye’s skills as a vocalist, and her formidable band, that she can switch gears so seamlessly, turning the vast arena from a whispered croon one moment into a Europop dance party the next.She delivers a knockout version of Escapism for an encore and the huge band roars one last time to shattering effect, very much establishing her dramatic era.Raye plays Co-Op Live, Manchester,18 February; thentouring UKuntil 2 MarchExplore more on these topicsRayePop and rockSoulDance musiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Angling his lean frame into the wind, he digs his plastic snow-shoes into a steep drift and pauses, scanning the white ridgeline. He’s looking formariolas– small cairns of rocks, fused by ice, that will indicate our onward trail. “The landscape changes every day so you have to learn how to read it afresh,” he says, setting off again. “At this time of year, nature is a true artist.”Manteigas locator mapI plod inelegantly in his wake, still clumsy in the frames clipped to my boots to keep me from sinking into the powder. At a quartzite outcrop rippled with rose and amber, we pause and drink in the view. Below us, cupped in the glacial scar of the Zêzere valley, is the terracotta-roofed town of Manteigas – founded in the 12th century and today the modest hub for tourism in the region. Ahead, on the horizon, João Pedro points out mainland Portugal’s highest peak, the 1,993-metre Torre, home to a small ski resort suited to beginners. “This region is full of surprises,” he grins.As head of activities for Casa das Penhas Douradas, a design-led hotel created in 2006 and inspired by Alpine lodges, João Pedro leads treks through the massif in all seasons. More than 100 miles of trails extend from the property, following old shepherd paths into pine forests, around lagoons and across barren passes stacked with huge granite boulders – the remnants of the last ice age, scattered like a giant’s abandoned toys. This is wild country – recognised in 2020 by Unesco as aglobal geoparkfor its remarkable biodiversity and geology – but the human story is equally rich.View image in fullscreenGuide João Pedro Sousa on one of the trails that follow old shepherd paths.Photograph: Amelia DugganThe hotel is a renovated 100-year-old sanatorium, its 17 birch-panelled rooms and suites gazing eastwards to the rising sun. All have vast sliding windows and doors to let in the curative mountain air during the milder months. Down the main corridor, leading from one log fire-warmed sitting room to another, a gallery of sepia photographs remembers the pioneering 1881 expedition by the Lisbon Geographic Society to this high plateau, looking for a place to treat the scourge of tuberculosis.This is wild country – recognised in 2020 by Unesco as a global geopark for its remarkable biodiversity and geology“The refined air, pure water and protein-rich diet here worked wonders for patients. For a period at the start of the 20th century, this was Portugal’s answer to the Swiss health resorts of St Moritz or Davos,” João Pedro tells me when we are back at the lodge, warming up with apple cake andcarquejamountain tea. The chalets peppering the surrounding slopes certainly look as if they have been plucked from northern Europe, with steep roofs, sunrooms and occasional fairytale flourishes, like finials or turrets. “Built from stone, not timber, though,” João Pedro clarifies. “The style is mixed with our Lusitanian mountain architecture.”For the rest of my stay, the Serra is a violently shaken snow globe, the whiteout preventing safe hiking and forcing a thorough exploration of the hotel instead. I shuffle between the indoor sauna and bath-temperature swimming pool; seek out the resident masseuse for a thoroughly undeserved sports massage; and indulge in a series of three-course meals where I sample the region’s famous Iberian pork – always tender and expertly sauced. Afternoons are seen out with a glass of port and a well-thumbed tome on mountaineering from the library, a lived-in space charmingly decorated with antique skiing paraphernalia. The pièce de résistance of the property? The Nordic-style wooden hot tub, which I book for a late-night soak after the storm subsides, the stars winking down at me through spindrift and steam.View image in fullscreenA lounge with a view in Casa das Penhas Douradas.Photograph: Luis PinheiroAs well as injecting some panache into the local tourism scene, I discover the founders of the hotel have been pivotal in saving a dying mountain craft: burel fabric, a thick, water-resistant weave made from bordaleira sheep’s wool and used for shepherds’ capes since the middle ages. “I fell in love with the local material when creating the upholstery for the hotel – it’s amazingly tough and versatile,” owner Isabel Costa tells me, as we tour her warehouse of whirring antique looms on the outskirts of Manteigas. “Nine textile mills had already gone out of business when this one closed – I knew we had to buy it.”As well as injecting some panache into the local tourism scene, I discover the founders of the hotel have been pivotal in saving a dying mountain craft: burel fabricIn 2010, the mill reopened as theBurel Factory, with a fresh directive: vibrant colours, modern designs and new applications as tactile wall art and furniture coverings, as well as fashion. Isabel was able to rehire experienced artisans, who in turn trained a new generation of craftspeople. I meet some of them in the Room of Light, where workers stand before great windows reeling bolts of cloth to check for skipped stitches. “Generations of Manteigas women have worked in this business,” seamstress Marta Neves tells me. “It’s delicate work, and with the quantity of bespoke commissions now coming in, every day is different.”View image in fullscreenThe hotel is decorated with antique skiing paraphernalia.Photograph: José VicenteOwing to the success of her initial projects, Isabel was able to expand further, opening the town’s first five-star hotel in 2018,Casa de São Lourenço, with a third property currently in the works. The fabric of local life has been rewoven in the process: with expanding job opportunities, young people are choosing to stay and build lives. The local school has even reopened. Today, burel shops sit on Lisbon and Porto’s most upmarket thoroughfares, popularising a native art form – and a destination – long overlooked. “It was my husband who first fell in love with Manteigas. The nature, the people – it’s like nowhere else in Portugal,” Isabel says.I stay on in the small town itself, checking intoCasa das Obras, a time-warp mansion that has been in the noble Ribeiro de Portugal family since its construction between 1770 and 1825, serving as a guesthouse for the past two decades. Here, history is palpable. Stern-looking ancestors of the current owner, Maria Amélia, look down from oil paintings lining the monumental stone staircase. Lower chambers include a tapestried billiards room and bar, while the upstairs breakfast room – a living museum of antiques, trinkets and heavy drapes – boasts original ceiling art. The bedrooms are underwhelming in comparison, but there’s a pretty garden blooming with camellias, and the location is unbeatably central.View image in fullscreenManteigas.Photograph: Tolo Balaguer/AlamyNot that there’s too much of Manteigas to explore. One twisting lane of commerce offers up a souvenir shop stacked with knitted socks and wool slippers; a bakery famous for creating the town’s signature sweet treat, the syrupypastel de feijoca; and a couple of delis selling wheels of creamy Serra de Estrela sheep’s cheese. The great treasure of the town is its looks, its cobbled streets and snow-dusted churches framed in all directions by dramatic valleys and forested peaks, all seemingly ripped from a storybook.Come summer, the community will be humming with hikers and adrenaline junkies – biking, paragliding, climbing and ATV buggy rides can all be organised here, with information at the little tourist office. But for now, during its coldest months, Manteigas insists on visitors slowing down – filling their lungs with crisp air, lining their stomachs with hearty cuisine and exploring scenic mountain trails when Mother Nature allows.The trip was supported byCasa das Penhas Douradas, where rooms startat€189B&B, including guided hikes and a tour of the Burel Factory.

Lemon curd is the original and a classic, but you can make curd with almost any fruit, as long as you add a little lemon juice for acidity. Each version is intense, indulgent and dreamy. So, please approach with caution: this spread is deeply moreish, in the best possible way.Any Fruit CurdWhen testing this recipe, I had some leftover frozen mango that had been accidentally defrosted on the counter, a sad golden kiwi and some wrinkled grapes, so I split the recipe and made three small batches of different curds.Banana curdis also a treat.Fruit curds set smoothly thanks to the magic combination of protein, fat and acid, which lowers the temperature that the egg proteins coagulate and helps everything thicken smoothly without scrambling. Fruits such as citrus, passion fruit, pineapple and rhubarb are naturally acidic, so they set easily on their own. Less sour fruits such as pears, apples, mangoes and peaches need a little help in the form of lemon juice to reach the same glossy texture.Curd recipes vary in calling for whole eggs, yolks only or a combination of both. All methods work fine. I recommend using whole eggs, unless you have a use for the whites or leftover yolks ready to go.Makes450mlPrep10 minCook10 min150g prepared fruit(eg cubes of passion fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, rhubarb, orange, lime, berries, pear, apple, mango, peach, etc)Juice of ¼ lemon(and zest if using an organic unwaxed lemon)100g runny honey, maple syrup or granulated sugar3medium eggsor 6 egg yolks (if leftover from another recipe)1 tbsp cornflour(optional, if making a pie filling)75g butter(I use salted but unsalted will do), cubedPut the cubes of fruit into a small saucepan with up to 80ml water – adding more for firm fruits (pineapple, rhubarb, pear, say) and less for watery ones, such as oranges, passion fruit or berries. Cover with a lid, bring to a simmer and cook gently for about five minutes, until soft. Set aside to cool.Blend the cooked fruit to make a smooth puree, then return it to a clean saucepan. Stir in the lemon juice and zest (if using).In a large bowl, whisk the honey (or maple syrup or sugar) with the eggs and cornflour (if using ). Whisk this into the fruit, then place the pan on a low to medium heat and cook slowly, stirring constantly with a spatula, scraping the sides and base, for five to 10 minutes or until the curd thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon or reaches 75C (167F) on a thermometer.Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, until glossy and smooth. Pass through a sieve and transfer into a sterilised jar. Cool, then chill in the fridge for up to two weeks.Explore more on these topicsFruitWaste notFoodFood wastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

For me, citrus isn’t just acidity: it’s a complex alternative to sugar and vinegar, with varieties that offer bitterness, floral tones, sweetness and sharpness in equal measure. With more than a hundred types of lemons, clementines and limes now available, I find it easiest to think of them in two groups: sour citrus and sweet citrus. Once you know which you’re working with, you can explore each variety’s complexity and decide how best to use it.Pork chop with citrus butter (pictured top)A well-seasoned pork chop needs little embellishment, but a punchy citrus butter brings lift and freshness, and cuts through the richness of the meat. For the butter, I use sour lemons for acidity, and balance that with the juice of sweet clementines to round things out.Prep10 minCook40 minServes2For the citrus butter150groom-temperature butter20g parsley leaves, finely chopped20g chives, finely chopped1 tspflaky sea salt40ml lemon juice, or other sour citrus juice30ml clementine juice, or other sweet citrus juiceFor the porkSalt and pepper1 large pork chop, or 2 small ones – the best quality you can get your hands onNeutral oil, for searingFirst make the citrus butter. Put everything in a bowl, whisk smooth, then taste and adjust the seasoning. It should have gentle sweetness and salinity, with a sharp, citrus finish. Cover and chill, or, if cooking straight away, keep at room temperature.Now for the pork. Heat the oven to 70C (50C fan)/140F/gas low. Put a frying pan on a medium-high heat until it’s very hot. Meanwhile, lightly season the chop on both sides. Add a little oil to the hot pan, then sear the chop for a minute on each side.Transfer the pork to a rack set over a tray, then transfer to the oven for 10 minutes. Do not wash out the pan: you want the fat and the caramelised bits in there. After 10 minutes, return the pork to the hot pan for a quick second sear on both sides, then return it to the rack and the oven for another 10 minutes: you’re aiming for a core temperature of 60C.Once the chop reaches temperature, give it a final sear in the same pan on the stovetop to crisp up the crust and raise the core to 63C.Thinly slice the chop, arrange the meat on two plates and serve with all the citrus butter melting over the top.Citrus curd, amaretti and pearView image in fullscreenMax Coen’s citrus curd with amaretti and pear.A light, balanced dessert that’s built around sharp citrus curd, amaretti and fresh pear for a play on texture and acidity that keeps the sweetness in check.Prep15 minCook40 minChill30 min+Serves4-6For the amaretti70g egg whites200g caster sugar200g ground almondsFor the citrus curd100ml fresh lemon juice, plus about 35ml extra to taste40g caster sugar100g whole eggs160g unsalted butterUp to60ml fresh clementine juice, or other sweet citrus juice (optional and to taste)For the cardamom chantilly1 tbsp icing sugar½ tsp ground cardamom100ml double creamA pinch of salt, pink ideallyTo finish2 fresh pears, cored and thinly sliced at the last minuteFirst make the curd. Put the lemon juice, sugar and eggs in a bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water, and whisk until the mix comes up to 80C. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, ensuring the mixture is well combined, then add the butter and whisk hard for 20 seconds, until very smooth and emulsified. Transfer to a bowl and taste – adjust with the extra lemon to taste, and if need be balance the acidity with a little sweet clementine juice. Divide the curd mix between four small serving glasses (those tiny French glass tumblers or similar), then put in the fridge to chill and set for 30 minutes.Now for the biscuits. Whip the egg whites until fluffy, then gradually whisk in 50g of the caster sugar until it’s dissolved and the mix forms soft peaks. In a second bowl, combine the ground almonds with the remaining 150g caster sugar, then gently fold in the whipped egg white mix to make a sticky dough.Lightly dampen your hands with water, then portion the dough into 15g balls – you should get about 20 in all – and arrange these on a greased and lined oven tray, spacing them apart to allow for expansion while baking.Heat the oven to 185C (165C fan)/360F/gas 4½, then bake the biscuits for 12-15 minutes, until crisp at the edges but still with a chewy centre. Transfer to a rack and leave to cool completely.Meanwhile, mix the icing sugar and cardamom in a small bowl. Whisk the cream, then gradually beat in the icing sugar mix until the cream forms soft peaks – take care not to overwhip, so it stays smooth and light. Season lightly with salt.To assemble, top each glass of set curd with a spoonful of the cardamom chantilly, then top first with two crumbled amaretti biscuits and then with six thin slices of fresh pear. Serve at once, or chill until ready to serve.Max Coen is chef/co-owner ofDorian, London W11Explore more on these topicsFoodFruitPorkMain courseDessertBiscuitsBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"
