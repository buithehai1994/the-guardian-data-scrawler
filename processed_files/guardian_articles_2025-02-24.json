Democrats branded the move a “disgrace”.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Macron saidEuropewas prepared to provide security guarantees to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire including peacekeepers, although they would not be sent to the frontline.UN general assembly backs resolution condemning Russia for Ukraine warRead moreTrump said he saw no objection to European troops being sent to Ukraine to serve as peacemakers, adding that he had raised the idea with Putin. “Yeah, he will accept it,” the US president said. “I’ve asked him that question.“Look, if we do this deal, he’s not looking for more war. He doesn’t mind. But I’ve specifically asked him that question. He has no problem with it.”Trump last weekbrandedthe Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a “dictator” and falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war, signalling a fundamental breach with Europe.At a joint press conference in the East Room, he told reporters. “It’s time to end this bloodletting and restore peace. We’ve had some great conversations, including withRussia… Our focus is on achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible and ultimately a permanent peace.”The US president claimed he had made more progress in the past month than was made in the previous three years. “I believe that Emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues,” he said. “Europe must take a central role in ensuring the long-term security of Ukraine.”Macron responded that he thought he and Trump had “made very substantive steps forward” in their discussion but stressed that peace “must not mean a surrender of Ukraine or ceasefire without guarantees”.Meanwhile, Putin on Monday also signalled that he was not opposed to Europe’s involvement in the talks. In a televised interview reported by Agence France-Presse, the Russian president said: “Not only European [countries] but other countries too have the right and can take part.”Trump and his team have been negotiating a minerals revenue-sharing agreement with Ukraine to recoup some of the money that the previous administration had sent to Kyiv to repel Russia.Earlier, in the Oval Office, Trump described the minerals deal as “very close” and said he might meet Zelenskyy soon to seal the agreement.“He may come in this week or next week to sign the agreement, which would be nice,” Trump said, adding that he would also be meeting Putin at some point.Zelenskyy last week rejected US demands for $500bn in mineral wealth from Ukraine to repay Washington for wartime aid, contending that the US had supplied nowhere near that sum so far and offered no specific security guarantees in the agreement.Asked if Ukraine should be willing to cede territory to Russia as part of a negotiated end to the conflict, Trump said: “We’ll see,” and noted that talks were just beginning.Macron became the first European leader to visit Trump since he regained power a month ago. He was at the White House for a morning session that lasted an hour and 45 minutes, including both leaders participating in a video conference with other G7 leaders about Ukraine.The pair projected cordiality but clashed when Trump made false claims about the funding of the war. He said: “Just so you understand, Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine. They’re getting their money back.”Macron leaned over to touch Trump’s arm and interjected: “No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60% of the total effort. It was like the US: loans, guarantees, grants. We have $230bn in frozen assets in Europe, Russian assets. But this is not collateral of a loan because it is not our belonging. So they are frozen.”Trump responded: “If you believe that, it’s OK with me. They get their money back, and we don’t. But now we do.”During the joint press conference, Trump said: “Before I came here there was no communication with Russia whatsoever. Russia was not answering calls … But when I got here one of the first calls I made was to President Putin and we were treated with great respect and they want to end this war, so that’s a big thing.He added: “I think it’s to the very much benefit of Russia to make a deal and to go on with leading Russia in a very positive way.”But Macron warned: “I think it’s super important to go to the peace. But my strong point was to say: ‘Let’s try to get something first which can be assessed, checked and verified.’”He added: “We want peace, but we don’t want an agreement that is weak.”In an interview with Fox News after his visit with Trump, Macron said a truce betweenUkraineand Russia “could be done in the weeks to come”. He also praised Zelenskyy’s leadership and said it was crucial for Trump to meet with the Ukrainian president.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, is to visit Trump later in the week, amid alarm in Europe over Trump’s hardening stance toward Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year-old conflict.That alarm deepened on Monday when the US voted against a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine and calling for the nation’s occupied territory to be returned. The UN general assembly passed the resolution by an overwhelming margin.Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator who co-led a bipartisan delegation to the recent Munich security conference, said: “This vote is a disgrace. Trump’s senseless betrayal of the alliances that have kept Americans safe since world war two and his fealty to the murderous aggressor Putin are a national security threat.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyUkraineEuropeEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpVladimir PutinRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Now more than ever, it holds true: We must put Ukraine in a position of strength.”In an apparent sideswipe at Donald Trump’s administration after it began talks with Russia last week about ending the war that excluded Ukraine and Europe, he added: “For a just peace, the attacked country must be part of peace negotiations.”Merz, a known transatlanticist – a proponent of a close relationship between the US and Europe – later said that “all the signals we are receiving from the United States indicate that interest in Europe is decreasing”.“If those who really do not just make ‘America first,’ but almost ‘America alone’ their motto prevail, then it will be difficult,” he told reporters. “But I remain hopeful that we will succeed in maintaining the transatlantic relationship.”For many years, Berlin had resisted calls from Paris to build up Europe’s defence capabilities, feeling secure under the protection of the nuclear-armed US.However, Merz has made clear he felt Europe’s largest economy was facing a new era. “In particular following the announcements from Washington in the past few weeks, it’s clear that we Europeans now need to very hurriedly become capable to act,” he said.Men were more likely to vote for the AfDHe also made reference to interference from the Trump administration in Germany’s election campaign, calling it unacceptable. Elon Musk, the president’s close ally, congratulated the AfD’s candidate for chancellor after the anti-Islam party’s strong performance in the election. On Monday Musk posted on X: “It is only a matter of time before AfD wins.”The AfD won about twice the vote share it garnered at the last election three years ago. But it will not be part of negotiations to form a coalition government because of the “firewall” that has historically existed between mainstream parties and the far right.A jubilant Alice Weidel, the AfD’s co-leader and candidate for chancellor, called her party’s performance “historic” and decried Merz’s refusal to enter into coalition with the AfD as a “democracy blockade”, arguing that millions of voters were in effect disfranchised by the decision.The AfD did particularly well in the former communist east, where it secured 43 out of 48 available seats after campaigning vigorously on an anti-Islam, anti-immigration platform, and backing the “remigration” of immigrants and German citizens deemed to have poorly integrated.On Monday Merz, whose CDU/CSU alliance won 28.5% of the vote, said: “We need to see that we solve the problems in Germany together so that we step for step, deprive this party of its breeding ground.” If that failed, he said, referring to the next election, “we’ll have very different problems”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The CDU leader provoked controversy in January by relying on AfD support to get a non-binding migration policy through parliament.His hardline migration policies are diametrically opposed to those of the SPD, and the parties – who together would have a small majority in the Bundestag – are likely to engage in stormy negotiations as they try to thrash out a grand coalition.Many Germans fear a re-run of the last GroKo, as they are known, led by Angela Merkel between 2018 and 2021, which critics accused of a lack of ambition and failing to tackle pressing challenges such as economic and bureaucratic reform, defence spending increases and an infrastructure overhaul.Younger German voters are turning to the Left and AfDSunday’s election was bruising for all the parties in the incumbent government. The SPD, Germany’s oldest political party, received its worst ever result, with 16% of the vote share. Scholz, who will remain as chancellor until Merz has formed a government, called the result “bitter”.The Greens garnered 11.6% of the vote, down three points from 2021. The market liberal FDP failed to reach the 5% threshold needed to get into parliament, as did the leftwing conservative Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW). The leftwing Linke party garnered 8.8%.Merz said he hoped to form a coalition by Easter in late April, stressing the urgency of the negotiations and saying: “The world is not waiting for us.”In his press conference, Merz also said he would ensure that the Israeli prime minister would be able to visit Germany without being apprehended, after a warrant was issued for his arrest by the international criminal court for alleged war crimes committed in Gaza.Merz called it “an absurd idea” that Benjamin Netanyahu should not visit Germany and said he had told Netanyahu as much by phone.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightOlaf ScholzEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Its headteacher, Maureen Murphy, said staff were “very shocked” to learn of the plan, but that there was no threat to the school.Prosper was apprehended by officers before he could carry out his plans, Bedfordshire police said. A loaded shotgun with more than 30 cartridges was found hidden in a bush after his arrest.Details of Prosper’s plot comes after it was revealed that the Southport killer,Axel Rudakubana, had also been suspected of planning to target a school.Prosper murdered his family in a “cold-blooded attack” with a shotgun he obtained without a licence, said Chris Derrick, a deputy chief crown prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service.Officers were called to the family’s flat in Leabank in Luton at 5.30am on 13 September 2024 after reports of gunfire. His mother, brother and sister were found dead from gunshot wounds to the head. The perpetrator and victims all lived in the same house.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Giselle Prosper, Juliana Falcon and Kyle Prosper.Photograph: Bedfordshire police/PADCI Sam Khanna, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said: “This was a truly tragic and shocking case in which three innocent members of the same family have been brutally killed by their son and brother.“No words can fully describe the tragedy their loved ones have experienced, and our thoughts continue to be with them at this difficult time. We are pleased that Prosper has pleaded guilty and will not put his family through the pain of a trial, and that he will soon face a significant jail sentence.“What was subsequently uncovered during our investigation left no doubt as to his intentions to carry out an attack at a school, but fortunately Prosper was apprehended before he could cause any further harm.”Speaking outside court, he added that discovering that Prosper had planned to attack a school “left our whole investigation team in shock and disbelief”.“We cannot ever begin to comprehend why someone would plan to kill innocent children and are so grateful to those arresting officers who helped prevent this from taking place.”Assistant chief constable John Murphy of Bedfordshire police said Prosper had intended to cause “maximum harm and distress” to the wider community. “We understand the deep shock this case will have on people within Luton and across the country,” he said.“We are working closely alongside Luton borough council to engage with schools in Luton to provide support, assistance and guidance to both schools and parents.”Hazel Simmons, the leader of Luton council, said the council would ask schools to review security measures.“The revelation that the perpetrator had plans to cause further harm in one of our schools is extremely shocking, distressing and upsetting, and we don’t underestimate the emotional difficulty this news will have on children, staff, parents and carers across our school community.“Our schools have robust systems in place to keep children safe, and security is constantly reviewed and monitored. Just recently we asked our schools to further review security and for increased vigilance following the incident in a school in Sheffield.“We will be asking schools to further review security measures in light of what came out in court today.”Det Supt Rob Hall, from the region’s major crime unit, previously said officers who arrived at the scene were “met with such awful circumstances”.Falcon was described as a “strong, loving mother,” who put others first, in a family tribute last September. The family said Kyle was “a kind and funny young man” and Giselle was “lovable with an infectious smile”.Last September, when Prosper first appeared in court, the public gallery was full of family members, many of whom were tearful and shook their heads during his short appearance in the dock.Prosper, whose sentencing will take place on 5 March, was remanded into custody.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The findings expose weaknesses in the Lords code of conduct and raise questions about whether the rules on lobbying and paid employment should be tightened in line with restrictions signed up to by MPs.The investigation sheds new light on the extent to which money flows into politics from those who hold peerages or go on to secure them, with more than £100m given to the three main parties over the last two decades, much of it by a small group of influential super-donors.Many members of the Lords make a valuable contribution to its main purpose of refining and scrutinising legislation. But their numbers have ballooned to 835 after a succession of prime ministers packed the house with donors and party loyalists. Labour has promised some changes, but there are calls for more ambitious reforms to an institution Keir Starmer has previously described as “indefensible”.Darren Hughes, the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: “The Lords should not be a political gated community filled with party donors, as well as friends and supporters of various prime ministers. These revelations again underscore the urgent need forLords reformso there is far greater transparency and accountability to guard against conflicts of interest, which risk further corroding the public’s already rock-bottom trust in politics.”Over the coming weeks, the Guardian will publish the Lords debate, a months-long investigation that has involved undercover reporting, and extensive analysis of parliamentary records, political donations and official documents.It will reveal details of how:Nearly 100 members of the Lords are paid to give political or policy advice by commercial firms.A Labour peer offered access to ministers during discussions to sponsor an event in parliament.A former minister has earned millions of pounds since entering the Lords by working for 30 companies.Multiple peers are being paid by foreign governments including repressive regimes.More than £1 in every £14 donated to political parties since 2001 came from those who have sat as peers in the last parliament.Starmer appears to be making slow progress on what many Labour supporters saw as a once-in-a-generation chance to overhaul the UK’s unelected second chamber.A quarter of a century after Tony Blair tried to reform the Lords bybanishing most hereditary peersin 1999, there had been hopes Starmer would use Labour’s return to government to cut the size of the house or replace it with a more representative chamber of the nations and regions,as proposed in a 2022 reviewby the former prime minister Gordon Brown.The plan was supposed to address concerns over a lack of equal representation in the Lords, where 69% of members are men. The Guardian’s analysis shows the median age of peers in the current parliament is 71 – four years older than the state pension age – and 51% were privately educated, compared with 6.5% of the population of England as a whole.At the time, Starmer endorsed Brown’s proposals,promising to transfer powerfrom Westminster to the British people. “I think the House of Lords is indefensible,” the then leader of the opposition said. “So we want to abolish the House of Lords and replace it with an elected chamber that has a really strong mission.”1:59Keir Starmer says House of Lords is 'indefensible' in 2022 interview – videoMinisters are in the process of removing the remaining 92 hereditary peers, amid opposition from many Conservative lords.However, further changes promised in the Labour manifesto – including an age limit of 80, reforming the appointments process, setting minimum levels of attendance, and a consultation on replacing the chamber – are yet to take shape and there are fears they will be kicked into the long grass.Asrevealed by the Guardianlast month, the government is looking at striking a deal across the Lords on cutting the size of the chamber without necessarily bringing in an age limit of 80.However, none of the proposed changes would tighten the rules on lobbying and paid employment.Peers receive expenses rather than a salary like MPs, and more often hold outside roles, without generally having to declare how much they are paid.After a 2021lobbying scandalexposed by the Guardian, MPs are nowbanned from working as parliamentary strategists or consultants and cannot advise on “public policy” and how parliament works in general. This was not extended to the Lords.Peers are not permitted to undertake “paid parliamentary advice or services”, meaning they cannot conduct, or advise on,lobbying or try to influence ministers, officials or parliamentarians on behalf of a company that pays them.However, a number of lords describe their jobs as advisers or consultants for companies, providing political or policy advice, which is permitted under the rules.View image in fullscreenMembers of the House of Lords during a state opening of parliament.Photograph: PA/AlamyOne peer, Charlotte Vere, a former Tory transport minister, decided against taking up a job as partner in a lobbying company, Stonehaven, after a public outcry this month. Stonehaven subsequently let go two other peers working for it as advisers.Gabe Winn, who runs the public affairs company Blakeney and has been speaking out against peers working for lobbying outfits, called for a “complete blanket ban” on peers being paid by lobbyists or as inhouse political advisers, regardless of how their role is described.“For me, the only answer is a complete blanket ban. Anyone who is a current policymaker in either house or in the civil service should not be able to take any money whatsoever from any agency or consultancy that lobbies on behalf of clients, or inhouse at any company where they’re asked to give advice on politics or policy,” Winn said. “The choice should be simple: make policies on behalf of the public or be paid by companies to influence them – never both.”The government is still on paper committed to overhauling the rules on appointments to reduce the number of peers selected through political patronage. Each year, party leaders nominate lists of candidates to be approved by the monarch. Many are chosen on the basis of previous service as MPs or in local government, or after making significant financial donations.Starmerappointed a string of alliesand former advisers to the House of Lords earlier this year, including his former chief of staff Sue Gray, the longtime Tony Blair staffer Anji Hunter, and the former TUC head Brendan Barber, in an effort to increase the number of Labour representatives and help get legislation through.With Reform UK riding high in the polls, there has been speculation that Nigel Farage’s party could seek to get some peers, especially if it wins further seats at the next election. The Green party, which has one fewer MP, has two peers on the red benches.Reform sources toldthe Mail on Sundaythis month that any deal or pact with the Conservatives at the next election could include an attempt to follow Donald Trump’s example of appointing high-profile figures – similar to Elon Musk in the US – to run government departments from the Lords.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debateLords reformLobbyingParty fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

He returned at around 4pm. At about 11.15am on Sunday, Scott left the hotel again.A colleague called Scott’s UK-registered phone number at around 6pm, but it was off. A missing person police report was filed on Sunday evening and a search began.Capital News in Kenya reportedthat detectives from the country’s Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said Scott was last seen at a club in the upmarket Westlands area of the city before he vanished.DCI believe Scott visited a bar in the area the day before his disappearance and that he returned to the venue on the day he disappeared to meet a friend, before taking a taxi to Pipeline, one of the city’s biggest slums, shortly after 7pm. Police believe Scott was held at a house in Pipeline, possibly while his abductors attempted to siphon money from his bank accounts.Scott’s professional profile says he joined Fico in 2014, from Experian UK. He is described as being responsible for global regulatory and compliance product management, based at the company’s London office. He studied at Woodmill high school in Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy technical college.Before the discovery of the body, Fico said they were working with local partners and authorities to investigate the matter.They added: “Our thoughts are with Campbell’s family and friends. Please respect his privacy and do not speculate about this situation. If anyone has information that may be helpful regarding his whereabouts, please contact local authorities or the Metropolitan police.”The Foreign Office was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsKenyaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The data reveals a series of features dipping towards the north – something Cardenas said indicated the beach grew out into the ocean. “In fact, it grew at least 1.3km north into the ocean.”Cardenas said the implications were exciting. “It’s a simple structure, but it tells you there had to be tides, there had to be waves, there had to be a nearby river supplying sediment, and all these things had to be active for some extended period of time,” he said.While the researchers noted that tilted features could arise from other types of activity, they say none of these explain the data. “We rule out volcanic, rivers, and wind-blown sand dunes. All of these are pretty commonly seen on Mars, but the structure just doesn’t fit any of them,” said Cardenas.He added that the discovery had implications for understanding the past habitability on Mars. “A beach is an interface between shallow water, air and land. It’s these sorts of environments where it’s thought life first came to be on Earth, and I think it would be a great place to send a follow-up mission looking for signs of past life,” he said.But while the Martian shoreline may have been sandy, the similarities to beaches on Earth are limited: not only would there have been a lack of palm trees and gulls but, Cardenas said, it would probably have been fairly chilly.“That said, I’d love to have seen it. Doing geology, reconstructing these ancient landscapes, it really is excellent daydream fuel,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAstronomyMarsSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

That is a good thing, because there is an amateur at the joystick of the world’s biggest aircraft.The flight simulator models trips by the Airlander 10, which is part airship, part aeroplane. If all goes to plan for its designer, Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV), two dozen will be built each year from 2030 at a factory in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.The virtual 98-metre aircraft noses its way into the air gently, responding gradually to adjustments to its heading about 300 metres (1,000 feet) over the city. This reporter is an old hand when it comes to crashing flight simulators, but the journey passes without incident, albeit with considerable help from one of the five people who has actually flown in the real thing.1:15Helium-filled aircraft Airlander 10 in flight – videoThoseflights astonished crowdswhen the prototype lifted off in Bedfordshire, an hour north of London, in 2016. Theprototype was retired in 2019, after gathering enough data on flying and –once, not fatally– crashing.HAV is now preparing to run the “scale up” gauntlet: going from an eye-catching first model to building a factory employing 1,200 people, and then making airships capable of transporting 10 tonnes of cargo, or up to 130 passengers, at up to 90mph.Tom Grundy, the HAV chief executive since 2019, says the Airlander can go “in between the two extremes” of fast but polluting and expensive planes, and cleaner, cheaper but much slower ferries. For short plane journeys run by regional airlines, the costs of operation using an Airlander “are at or below the cost of what they’re operating today” with smaller passenger planes, he says.View image in fullscreenThe prototype of the Airlander 10 aircraft, made by Hybrid Air Vehicles, flew on test flights in Bedfordshire between 2016 and 2019.Photograph: Darren Harbar/Hybrid Air VehiclesThe Airlander will not need miles of tarmac runway far from city centres, just a flat space about 200 metres across and a truck with a mooring mast.“It doesn’t have to be stuck to going between today’s airports,” Grundy says. “It can go into different places. And yet it’s faster than moving around the world over the surface. It’s faster than those ferry journeys. It can often be faster than a train journey, very often faster than a car journey. So providing this middle option.”The European regional airline Air Nostrum has said it will buy 20 tocarry passengers between Mediterraneanislands. The luxury tour company Grands Espaces wants the craft to take passengers on jaunts over the Arctic. HAV has also looked at replacing ferries in the Scottish Highlands and across the Irish Sea between Belfast and Liverpool.View image in fullscreenA digital mock-up of the interior of the Airlander 10. The design should mean more spacious seats for passengers.Photograph: Hybrid Air VehiclesUnlike normal planes, weight is the key concern rather than volume. That should mean much more spacious seats for passengers, while luxury tourists will each have double bedrooms. Freight shipping is even more promising, with many customers who would value quicker journeys for bulky loads than ships, but with less expensive fuel burned than planes.HAV is not the only company to spy a gap: France’s Flying Whales is hoping to build a dirigible for cargo only, while Lighter than Air Research (LTA) is focusing on humanitarian missions.They are all in the precarious startup phase. HAV has spent £140m since 2007, but the latest accounts showed just £400,000 cash on hand at the end of 2023. Other low-emission flight companies, including a clutch employing electric vertical take-off and landing,have run into difficulties recently. The German companies Lilium and Volocopter filed for bankruptcy in late 2024.1:42Interior of the Airlander 10 luxury cabin – videoYet HAV is aiming to spend a fraction of the cash of some aerospace rivals. It is seeking to raise £300m in equity funding, with the first chunk by the summer. (It is angling for part of the cash from the Labour government’s national wealth fund.) That money, plus deposits on orders worth a notional £1.5bn, should make the company cashflow positive, Grundy says.Grundy has brought several aircraft from design to flight in a career that includes fighter jet manufacturer BAE Systems and work on the Airbus A380, at73 metres another leviathan of the skies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company claims emissions will be 90% lower than a conventional plane. That could get to 100%, as it plans to switch from internal combustion engines to hydrogen fuel cells to power the Airlander’s four propellers.View image in fullscreenGuardian reporter Jasper Jolly examines the propellers of Airlander 10 aircraft prototype.Photograph: Jasper Jolly/The GuardianThe reason for the lower energy use is obvious – balloons float – but that provides only 60% of the lift, a “headstart against gravity”. The Airlander is also an aeroplane: the shape of the balloon – made from a composite of Kevlar and two other materials – makes it a giant wing. That also saves on expensive –and finite– helium.The Airlander started life as a project for the US Department of Defense, which wanted a surveillance aircraft. HAV says Airlanders will stay airborne for five days, making them 10 times cheaper than fixed-wing drones andeasier to control than spy balloons. The company has a deal with BAE Systems to handle sales to military customers. Grundy declined to comment when asked if BAE or another technology partner, France’s Dassault, could become investors.HAV’s designers came up with an innovative double-ellipsoid airframe that gives the wing shape without sagging when 10 tonnes hang in a gondola below it. The shape also provided its very unofficial nickname: the “flying bum”.“I think we’ve got more important things to do than be annoyed about that,” says Grundy when asked the inevitable. “To feel the warmth, the engagement, and sometimes the humour of how people responded to that, it actually was quite powerful for me.”View image in fullscreenA digital mock-up of the Airlander 10 above Stromness in Orkney. HAV has looked at replacing ferries in the Scottish Highlands.Photograph: Hybrid Air VehiclesThe flying bum could also get much bigger: HAV is already planing a 50-tonne, 120-metre version for freight customers that could carry wind turbine blades up remote hills. Eventually Grundy wants to make a 200-tonne version that would blow past the A380’s 84-tonne payload – and potentially open up the possibility of the world’s biggest aircraft crisscrossing the Pacific.The Hindenburg disaster in 1937, when the German airship’shydrogen balloon burst into flames over New Jersey, made lighter-than-air craft seem a thing of the past for a long time, but the sight of a 98-metre ship in the sky is also something out ofsci-fifuture. In real life, the Airlander (filled with non-flammable helium) wasenough to stop trafficwhenever the prototype flew.“I never thought I would be in the lighter-than-air space when I started my career,” Grundy says. “I think airships have been very, very hard to make practical. I’m attracted to what we’re doing here because it is practical. But once I got into it, you start to realise how many future visions that people have of the world include aircraft a bit like this.”Explore more on these topicsAerospace industryTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

Merz has set an Easter target for a deal.1.Voters are unsure about how Merz will leadMerz’s conservative alliance turned in its second poorest performance since the second world war, with just 29%. It was enough to soundly beat the AfD, however, which came in second on 21%. Together with the SPD on 16%, his coalition would have a wafer-thin majority of 328 seats in the 630-seat parliament.But compared with many of his predecessors, including the unpopular Scholz, Merz has failed to convince many voters he has the right stuff to govern Germany.A poll by the opinion research institute Infratest dimap showed thatonly 43% thought Merz was chancellor material, with just 35% approving of his work in politics to date. Scholz, by contrast, began his term in December 2021 with a 66% approval rating as he took over from the veteran leaderAngela Merkel, whom voters re-elected three times.Analysts put the gap down to Merz’smore sharp-tongued, divisive styleand hiscontroversial decision to seek support from the AfDin January on hardline immigration-curbing measures before parliament.Critics said he was shattering a taboo while Merz had called his stance on migration “uncompromising” – something that might not bode well for the coalition talks ahead.The far-left Die Linke, which wasthe most strident in condemning Merz’s risky gambit,pulled a surprising 8.8% – nearly twice their previous share.2.The divisions between east and west appear to be growing, not diminishing, 35 years after reunification.One look at the electoral map shows a Germany still divided.Map showing the division in voting between east and west GermanyThe ex-communist eastern states appear as a sea of blue representing direct mandates for the hard-right AfD, while the former West Germany is awash in CDU/CSU black dotted with flecks of red for the SPD and green for the ecologist Greens.In eastern states such as Saxony and Brandenburg, the AfD was able to strongly improve on its 2021 result to capture about one-third of the vote, with boosts of nearly 13 points and more than 14 points respectively.Map showing the change in vote share for AfD between 2021 and 2025 in different regionsIn both regions, the AfD chapters have been classified by domestic security authorities as extremist organisations seeking to undermine the constitutional order.Exit polls showed that across Germany, the party was able to poach support from across the political spectrum to achieve the strongest outcome for a far-right party since the Nazi period. The CDU/CSU was hit particularly hard, ceding more than 1 million voters across the country to the far right.3.Young voters continue to drift to the political fringesGermans under 35 have been expressing frustration with the mainstream parties at the ballot box for some time, capturing headlines during last June’s European elections whenthe AfD made big unexpected gains among first-time voters.Chart showing the popularity of the German parties among different age groupsCrime and immigration, street bullying, the soaring cost of housing and fears of military conscription if Germany goes to war are all issues driving younger Germans away from the centre.At this election, in the 25-34 age bracket, the AfD came out on top with 22%, ahead of CDU/CSU on 18%, and the Greens and the far-left Linke at 16% each.Chart showing the support for different parties among those aged 18 to 24The Linke, meanwhile, campaigned hard on a tax-the-rich message focused on fighting poverty and capping rents, which appealed to the youngest voters.The party, which also made effective use of social media platforms such as TikTok to ram home its anti-Merz message, won among the 18-24 set with 26% of the vote, ahead of the AfD at 21% and CDU/CSU on 13%.Map showing the change in vote share for Die Linke between 2021 and 2025 in different regionsGermans 70 and up were most likely to reject the AfD, which won just 10% in that cohort.In both the lagging east and the rust belts of the west, the AfD made particularly big strides among working-class voters – long seen as the Social Democrats’ key base. AfD support surged 17 points among workers to 38%, while the SPD haemorrhaged 14 points to land on just 12%.A gender divide was also clearly visible, with women more likely to support left-leaning parties and men drawn to the right. The AfD, for example, won 24% of men but only 17% of women, while the SPD and the Linke claimed 18% and 11% of women’s votes respectively, compared with 15% and 7% of men’s.Chart showing the gender split in votes for different partiesRural regions tended to go to the conservatives and the AfD while cities had the strongest support for the Greens and Die Linke, which won the most votes in the capital, Berlin.4.Most Germans reject the AfD but they do want action on migrationDespite its record showing, 70% of voters told Infratest dimap they don’t want to see the AfD in government. The figure was even higher – 74% – in a separate poll by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen.That said, on the party’s signature issue of curbing immigration, many Germans say they agree that the country’s border policy since Angela Merkel allowed in 1.3 million new arrivals a decade ago has been too lax.Although Merkel left office in 2021 and Merz has long sharply criticised her stance, 54% of voters still see their CDU/CSU as responsible for “why so many refugees and asylum seekers have come to Germany”, according to Infratest dimap.But while 64% of Germans say they back Merz’s tougher line on slowing irregular immigration, Merz’s overture to the far right to win backing for stricter border measures did nothing to boost his party beyond the 30% it consistently attracted in the polls.5.Ukraine matters more than Musk and VanceAnother high-profile development during the campaign was the vocal backing from the Tesla tycoon, Elon Musk, and later the US vice-president, JD Vance, for the AfD. However, their interference – branded as “brazen” by Merz – failed to move the needle on voters’ support.The party, having seen a boost from late 2023 thanks to concerns about crime, immigration and high energy costs, remained at about 20% throughout the campaign.Stark differences over Ukraine between the AfD’s candidate Alice Weidel, who called for lifting EU sanctions against Moscow and a resumption of Russian gas imports, and Merz, who staunchly backed Kyiv, appeared to play a bigger role.With support forUkraine in Trump’s Washington now called into question, Merz remained vocal throughout the campaign that Germany, Ukraine’s second-biggest weapons supplier after the US, must remain steadfast.He wrote on X on Monday that “more than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength”. He added that “for a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations”.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzOlaf ScholzAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropekey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

Where would a series like this begin? The formation of Hamas? The six-day war? Suez? 1948? 1917? Earlier?The producer of this film, Norma Percy, has taken a more modern approach. Percy’s strongest skill as a documentary-maker has always been her ability to secure access to the people who matter, such as Gerald Ford for 1994’s Watergate series and Slobodan Milošević for 1995’s The Death of Yugoslavia. Given that the authors of the Balfour declaration – a letter written by the British government in 1917 supporting the creation of a Jewish homeland – are all long dead, Percy has decided to venture back only two decades.Her chronicle opens on 19 August 2003, the day a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 23 Israelis on a bus in Jerusalem. The attack, along with Israel’s retaliatory missile strikes on Gaza, effectively froze the international community’s hopeful Roadmap for Peace plans and threw the future of the region into disarray. We pick up at a time of great tension.By its nature, Israel and the Palestinians is a sober, but compelling, watch. Percy presents a cast of powerful players from all sides who mostly want the same thing, but – thanks to a combination of political grandstanding, hubris and frustration – repeatedly snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.There is Israel’s former prime minister Ariel Sharon, who planned to give Gaza back to the Palestinians, but whose approach to diplomacy led to wide mistrust and fury (we are shown how he neglected to engage with Palestinian leaders or his own government’s rightwingers over his disengagement plan). There is Mahmoud Abbas, the former prime minister of the Palestinian National Authority who tried to run a free election, but, at the first sign that he might lose it, we are told, covertly asked Israel to help derail it. There is Ehud Olmert, the former Israeli prime minister and perhaps the figure who came closest to implementing a lasting two-state solution, complete with a shared Jerusalem; he found himself undone by corruption charges. This sort of thing happens time and time again – an uneasy peace is tentatively scratched out, only to collapse at the last moment.And then there is Benjamin Netanyahu. Episode one covers the five years to 2008, so his time on screen will grow in episodes two and three, but nevertheless he spends the first hour looming in the periphery. When Sharon announced his disengagement plan, footage shows that it was Netanyahu who jeered the loudest. When Olmert imploded, the documentary lays out that it was Netanyahu who stood to gain most. Next will come clashes with the White House, the UN and his own people. The road to 7 October, Percy suggests, is about to get much uglier.It is easy to look at this series with the benefit of hindsight. It presents us with the temptation to view every fork in the road with dismay, as if every wrong turn was diametrically opposed by a hypothetical decision that could have led to peace and prosperity; if only one person had thought things through a bit more thoroughly, or been more willing to compromise – even, in the case of Olmert, better at sharing his paper map with people – then the events of the last year and a half would have never come to pass. Clearly, things are too complicated for that to be true; the wounds are too deep and the strength of feeling too raw for anyone to simply finger-click things back into shape, no matter how much everyone wants that to happen.However, there is a heft to this series that you don’t see very often. By being able to streamline the subject, by talking to every side – an interview with Hamas’s then political leader,Ismail Haniyeh, conducted weeks before his death in July 2024, is to come – and by refusing to be led by emotion over fact, Percy has created something that deserves to be talked about in the same terms asThe World at War.That storied documentary series was made after the event, when the ink was dry and the picture was clearer. In her ability to make sense of a process that is still unfolding – and, thanks toDonald Trump’s plans for Gaza, may outlast us all – Percy deserves nothing but praise. This is vital work.Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7th October airs on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryIsrael-Gaza warPolitics TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

The satellite, active between 1963 and 1967, was the first in the US able to consistently produce high-resolution photographs.Map of Bali annotating the locations of UIuwatu, Canggu, Ubud and DenpasarMap of Bali annotating the locations of UIuwatu, Canggu, Ubud and DenpasarThe pre-digital films were collected midair by specially equipped aircraft near Hawaii and returned to earth for processing. The satellite typically orbited over Soviet territory and was designed to photograph Soviet missile silos and other targets.Decades on, the images also tell another story of development in south-east Asia, where tourism has reshaped the landscape and way of life.Gaveau said the timing of the images was important because Bali’s international airport opened only a few years later, in 1968, sparking the tourism boom that has seen the island become one of Asia’s most-visited destinations.Satellite image of Petitenget, Bali from 1965 compared to 2024Satellite image of Petitenget, Bali from 1965 compared to 2024Bali’s population has increased from about 2 million residents in the 1960s to more than 4 million today, according to Indonesia’s statistics bureau. About half a million tourists visit the island each month, government data shows, while a growing number of digital nomads also flock to the island.Bali’s provincial government is hoping to hit a record 6.5 million international tourists this year.Ida Bagus Aria Yoga Dharata, from the Bali environmental organisation Walhi, said the map would help withadvocating for environmental preservation in Bali.“People come here because of the culture … The Balinese are very connected to nature, to each other, to God, and there is no other place like this,” Dharata said.“If that is lost, then Bali is no different.”Satellite image of Kerobokan, Bali from 1965 compared to 2024Satellite image of Kerobokan, Bali from 1965 compared to 2024View image in fullscreenTerraced fields in Bali, 1967.Photograph: Ernst Haas/Getty ImagesChakra Widia, a Balinese conservationist said many farmers no longer saw agriculture as financially viable and were instead selling their land for villas and hotels.Areas such as Canggu, which were once lined with rice paddy fields, have in recent years been replaced by rows of boutiques and villas.View image in fullscreenFarming in Bali in the 1960s.Photograph: ClassicStock“Rice farming used to be the backbone,” said Widia. “But now it is tourism.”In October 2024, Balinese and national politicians proposed a two-year moratorium on new tourism-related developments, amid growing concerns about overtourism and environmental degradation.But the Bali governor, Wayan Koster, who was re-elected in January, said he would halt the proposed moratorium, instead promising stricter regulations.Satellite image of Canggu, Bali from 1965 compared to 2024Satellite image of Canggu, Bali from 1965 compared to 2024In his first term, between 2018 and 2023, Koster also introduced a 150,000 rupiah (A$15) Bali tourism tax levy, intended to fund better protection for Balinese culture and landscapes and for new infrastructure. Early figures showed poor collection rates, with just 35% of visitors paying the tax.Niluh Djelantik, a Bali regional parliamentarian, who is outspoken on the island’s challenges, described the changes as “devastating” but said she was not against development and tourism.Instead, she said, she wanted to see stricter enforcement of existing regulations, including foreigners working illegally and better usage of the tourist tax.“We are inviting the wrong kind of tourist, the kind who comes here and takes advantage of our systems,” she said.“I am not against tourism, but how we do it,” she said, “We need the right intention, to create happiness for Balinese people.”Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaBaliAsia PacificOvertourismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The dignified richness of her vocal was tempered by the subtly volcanic power she displayed on her reading of To Sir With Love off Lost Takes – a not-so-quiet fire that always resided within her.She grew up in awe of Mahalia Jackson but, doubting she’d ever match the gospel pioneer’s fearsome pipes, dedicated herself instead to piano. At 15, she won a scholarship to study piano at Howard University, where – after the singer she’d been booked to accompany at the annual freshman talent show got cold feet – she sang Henry Nemo’s wartime pop standard Don’t Take Your Love From Me and won the competition. Subsequently, she focused her studies on singing, becoming assistant conductor of the university choir and directing a production of Aida.While singing standards in Washington DC nightclubs after graduation, she enraptured pianist and singerLes McCann, who sent her to Atlantic’s studios. There, in a 10-hour marathon in early 1969, she recorded her debut album First Take, an uncompromising and ambitiously diverse collection comprising Leonard Cohen covers, soulful tunes penned by future collaborator Donny Hathaway and Ballad of the Sad Young Men, a powerful salute to gay men who lived their lives in secret. But it was her cover of Ewan MacColl’s folk standard The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face – an almost unbearably intimate, desolate recording, used brilliantly by Clint Eastwood in his 1971 directorial debut Play Misty for Me – that sent the album to the top of the charts, selling more than 2m copies and winning Flack the first of numerous Grammys.First Take set the tenor for albums of substance and character that were informed as much by her classical and gospel roots as the soul milieu she was marketed to, but still scored hits. Quiet Fire, released in 1971, returned her to her gospel roots, applying her dignified fervour to songs sacred and secular. The title track of Killing Me Softly, released in 1973, would prove her biggest, most enduring hit. Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway, an album of duets with the troubled soul auteur, released in 1972, showcased a lighter side to Flack’s signature sound, one she explored further on 1975’s effervescent Feel Like Makin’ Love, with the title track delivering her third chart-topping single.Flack was badly shaken when Hathaway took his own life in 1979, before they could complete a mooted second album of duets. A subsequent collaboration with Peabo Bryson sired Tonight I Celebrate My Love – its synths and dulcet crooning coining the insurgent adult contemporary genre that would dominate the decade, but the collaboration failed to match the lightning she’d captured with Hathaway. The bold statements of her earlier work gave way to Christmas albums, sets of Beatles covers and the theme tune to NBC sitcom Valerie; still, no one sang them quite like Roberta.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

But behind her, Flack had left a career that was like no other, which was exactly what she’d aimed for. “I didn’t try to be a soul singer, a jazz singer, a blues singer,” shetold the Guardian in 2020, looking back on a lifetime she’d spent honing her own voice. “My music is my expression of what I feel and believe in a moment.”Explore more on these topicsRoberta FlackPop and rockSoulcommentShareReuse this content"

It was the heartwarming feelgood ending that a muted London fashion week badly needed.View image in fullscreenLesley Manville and Jason Isaacs joined Naomi Campbell on the runway.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PASaltburn, the gleefully divisive 2023 film in which Grant also featured, was “what really tripped me out this season”,Burberrydesigner Daniel Lee said after the show. “Bohemian people who dressed in this really eccentric way for dinner and had crazy parties, the way the whole thing was super twisted.”The museum’s vaulted galleries were dressed for the night as a grandly dissolute country home. Actor Nicholas Hoult was seated next to a knight in full armour. Authentically lumpy sofas made up a front row for Skepta, Ian Wright and Damian Lewis.‘It was shocking to me’: Black female designers still underrepresented at London fashion weekRead moreDressing-gown coats and velvet smoking jackets in the collection tipped a hat to Grant’s Saltburn character. (The jodhpurs were perhaps a nod to that other recent hit of British class comedy,Rivals.)Burberryfell out of the FTSE 100 last September, a galling loss of face in an industry where image is everything. A turnaround plan implemented by chief executive Joshua Schulman is pivoting Burberry away from trends and towards establishing itself as a global luxury outerwear brand, doubling down on its trench coats, check scarves and umbrellas.The new positioning – think North Face, but for rich people – has gone down well with analysts. But while “back to basics” is a phrase that appeals to shareholders, it does not impress at fashion week. And in order to command high prices, Burberry needs status – and that means fancy catwalk shows.Grant recently starred in one of a series of Valentine’s Day-themed Burberry short films. These mini romcoms located the brand in a Richard Curtis-esque version of Britishness. Think photogenic pastel-hued London terraces, Kate Winslet and park picnics, scruffy dogs and Shakespeare quotes. If the tone of those films was of bumbling warmth, this show was Lee’s director’s cut, a vision of Burberry more dark romance than romcom.Lee also spoke backstage of how walks in rainy Yorkshire last autumn inspired the moody, saturated colour palette.Burberry loves to talk about the weather for two reasons. Firstly, Burberry sells coats. Secondly, talking about the weather is part of being British, and Burberry also sells Britishness. Outerwear featured strongly on the catwalk.Roksanda channels sculptor Phyllida Barlow at London fashion week showRead moreA range of styles – quilted jackets, parkas and pea coats as well as trenches – spoke to a drive to reach a wider customer base. The signature check cropped up on oversized scarves and leather gloves. Both Grant and Isaacs had been given umbrellas to carry, ensuring maximum publicity for this accessory.The luxury industry is jittery in the face of a spending slowdown and a new world order of tariffs, and the pace of designer turnover has picked up as panicked bosses, impatient to see results, burn through creative appointments at speed.There have been persistent rumours that Lee, who joined Burberry in 2022, may be replaced this year. Asked about his future, he said he loved the job. “It’s an honour,” he said. “Things are definitely improving, I think we are in a really positive place. There is a stronger sense of togetherness in the team now.”There are early signs that the worst of Burberry’s woes could be over. The share price has doubled since September, sales in the crucial pre-Christmas period were better than expected, and – at its current standing – Burberry would secure re-entry to the FTSE 100 during the next reshuffle in March.Explore more on these topicsFashionLondon fashion weekFashion weeksRichard E GrantBurberryBurberry groupRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

As he publishes a memoir, Holland talks about frisky stallions, today’s ‘over-sensitive’ era – and being huge in HungaryMon 24 Feb 2025 11.11 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 12.18 ESTShareTo the general showbiz warning about never acting with animals, Jeffrey Holland has a specific footnote to add about equine erections. While filming Hi-de-Hi!, the 1980s BBC sitcom set in a holiday camp, Holland one day found himself playing the front half of a pantomime horse, with co-star Su Pollard in the rear. The visual gag was that the rag nag ends up riding a real one. “So the horse had to be in the scene,” recalls Holland. “But it took rather an interest in the pantomime one and started sniffing around its hindquarters. Su said words to the effect of, ‘Oh, eck!’ and asked for help. But I’m afraid all I could say was, ‘You’d better brace yourself, Su. I’m going to eat some grass!’”A horseman on set diverted the randy stallion, but the incident triggered a flashback for Holland. A panto he once appeared in included a Coventry production with real horses. One would become aroused as soon as it walked on stage, forcing the director to place an actor with a large flag between it and the audience. “Apparently, it was responding to a perfume an actress was wearing,” Holland recalls – and being careful with scent around mounts is one of the many useful tips for younger performers contained in Holland’s new memoir, The First Rule ofComedy..!When my then wife saw me playing a serious resistance fighter, she said it was the funniest thing she’d ever seenThe title comes from the “professional” advice that Paul Shane, as campsite entertainment host Ted Bovis, would give to Holland, playing younger comedian Spike, in Hi-de-Hi! That show dominates the book, but Holland’s involvement in it was the result of sheer chance. In 1975, dismayed at not being cast in two plays at Chichester, the then 29-year-old went grumpily and reluctantly to audition for a London stage show of Dad’s Army. “I was furious when I arrived. But David Croft, the director, cast me and that was the day that changed my life. It’s better not to think about it having gone the other way, really. It’s terrifying.”View image in fullscreen‘Spike was written with me in mind’ … Holland at home in London.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianIn this theatrical spin-off from the Home Guard sitcom, Holland had “five or six costumes, and it was 78 steps from the stage to my dressing room so I was up and down them all night. I think that may have stuck in David’s mind: Jeff Holland likes silly costumes! So Spike, who was always appearing in outrageous get-ups, was written with me in mind.”Holland became a member of Croft’s TV repertory company. As well as Hi-de-Hi! he appeared in two other shows Croft co-wrote with Jimmy Perry (Dad’s Army, You Rang M’Lord?), one collaboration with Jeremy Lloyd (Are You Being Served?) and one with Richard Spendlove (Oh, Doctor Beeching!) He missed out on Croft and Lloyd’s ’Allo ’Allo! on TV but got the full set by appearing in a stage version.’Allo ’Allo! was a parody of Secret Army, a serious BBC drama set in occupied Belgium. It is thought that Holland is the only actor to have been in both franchises, although his first performance in Secret Army offered a clue to where his career was headed: “I played a French resistance fighter called Michel. Wearing a beret, doing comedy eye acting, I looked a complete tit. When my then wife saw it, she thought it was the funniest thing she’d ever seen. Maybe that’s why I’ve mainly done comedy.”Croft’s successes were, unusually for sitcoms, often set in the past, whether the second world war home front, the 1920s stately home of You Rang, M’Lord?, the 1950s holiday camp of Hi-de-Hi!, or the 1960s branch railway station of Oh, Doctor Beeching! This, Holland believes, was key: “David always said that if you set them in the past, they wouldn’t date. He also disliked doing Christmas specials because those could only be repeated once a year. That was his producer’s brain at work.“The knack David and his co-writers had is that they were wonderful at creating situations in which people who would otherwise never have met were forced to be together. Those businessmen in Dad’s Army would never have socialised but, under the umbrella of the Home Guard, they had to. And in Hi-de-Hi!, they were all failures who would have given anything not to be stuck with those other flops. Spike Dixon was desperate to be a comedian but had no hope whatsoever.”View image in fullscreenFavourite character … Holland with Su Pollard in You Rang M’Lord?Photograph: Radio Times/Getty ImagesCroft’s theories of comedy worked to the extent that, 37 years after its final episode aired, Hi-de-Hi! is still streaming on multiple platforms including ITVX, while Holland attends regular fan days in Harwich, where it was filmed. He also goes to Dad’s Army events in Thetford, Norfolk, although he only played the small part of a truck-driver who mud-splatters Captain Mainwaring. He is one of the last surviving actors from the show, so feels it is his duty to attend.“It’s extraordinary how the shows live on. At the last Hi-de-Hi! event, there was a six-year-old who knew all the episodes by heart and really loved Spike, who she wanted to meet. Her mum tactfully warned her that Spike would look very different today – which obviously I do! – but she didn’t seem to care. Her mum wasn’t even born when we made the show. I don’t think I’m recognisable now but, just the other day in the street, someone shouted out, ‘Hi-De-Hi Mr Holland!’”In fact, he’s Jeffrey Parkes, the name of the family into which he was born in 1946 in Walsall, the West Midlands still audible in his speech. As with many actors, he was forced to change his surname under Equity rules because a soundalike already had it. “I only use Holland in the business. I couldn’t bring myself to change my first name – though I know actors who have – because I’ve been Jeff all my life. Holland was my grandma’s maiden name and it’s suited me well.View image in fullscreenThe age of the train … in Oh, Doctor Beeching!Photograph: Bbc/AllstarHe has Parkes and Holland bank accounts, the latter for acting fees. He is from the generation that still get “residuals” (repeat fees) rather than “buyouts” (a single payment). A comedy rerun channel, That’s TV 2, shows You Rang M’Lord at 8pm every evening. Holland’s role as James Twelvetrees (“almost a straight role in a comedy”) is his favourite TV character and he was astonished to discover that “it’s shown in Hungary every day in either English or Hungarian. They just love it. It’s because they recognise that two-tier system, the unfairness of it, from having been under the communists for decades.”Another recent residual payment was £140 for a recent BBC Four repeat of the 1978 Thomas Hardy serial The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which he played a cart-driver. Holland rewatched not from vanity but morbid curiosity. When filming, he was still heavily stitched from a vasectomy the previous day, and a scene in which he jumps down from the cart sent shockwaves through his penis. “I still remember the pain. But, watching it, you really couldn’t tell. Which gives me a certain professional pride. I played through it.”He has generational regrets about the way he feels the profession has changed, finding many young stage actors inaudible: “They’re not taught voice projection like I was. The college I went to in Birmingham was known for vocal training. Young actors aren’t taught how to produce the voice from the diaphragm. I’ve sat in the third row of the stalls and not been able to hear what’s being said. You want to shout, ‘Speak up!’”His speech teacher would be pleased that, even at 78, his impression of an irritated theatregoer hits the back wall of the living room, threatening to tremble the Pointless Celebrities trophy that he recently won with Su Pollard.The fact that they think Hi-de-Hi! might offend is beyond me. But there you goAnd, having spent much of his career in the TV genre of “Mrs Slocombe’s pussy”, pantomime and Ray Cooney stage sex farces, Holland also regrets the contemporary crackdown on innuendo and sexual slapstick. He is careful to draw a distinction between sexualised behaviour in workplaces or in public – “that’s clearly wrong” – and the policing of lines in old shows: “David [Croft] and Jimmy [Perry] would turn in their graves. They put a trigger warning on Hi-de-Hi! on BritBox to say these are dated opinions and some people might be offended. The fact that they think Hi-de-Hi! might offend is beyond me. But there you go. People are just over-sensitive about everything now. They’re looking for trouble.”His memoir reveals that a “very big” publisher turned down The First Rule of Comedy..!, after initially expressing interest, because of rumours that Holland had worn blackface makeup in an edition of Are You Being Served? He is indignant about this: the character was white and what was then called a “hippy” with what was known at the time as an “afro” hairdo.Alan Bennett at 90: ‘What will people think? I don’t care any more’Read moreBut, although this isn’t mentioned in the book, Holland admits that he did once wear blackface. On ITV’s Russ Abbot’s Madhouse, he, Abbot, Les Dennis and Michael Barrymore played a soul quartet group called The Four Bottoms, a spoof of Motown quartet the Four Tops. “You couldn’t do it now,” he admits. But does he wish he hadn’t done it then? “No. Because in the 80s, it got no letters from anyone at all. It was the lyrics that were funny and to sing them we had to dress accordingly. That was then, this is now.”A longtime career ambition was a one-man show about comedian Stan Laurel, which he has performed four times at the Edinburgh festival and toured around the UK. In the book, though, Holland says he will be happy to be remembered as “that bloke from Hi-de-Hi!” But is that just memoir bravado? “No! I’ve never understood those actors – I could name them but I won’t – who become known for a series and, when it’s over, they don’t want to know any more. I’m thrilled to have played Spike in the success that Hi-de-Hi! was and still is.”He is excited to be published, although suffers the irritation of many modern autobiographers: “There are three other books on Amazon claiming to be the story of Jeffrey Holland. But it’s just internet shit.”On the retail site, “Lawrence Hardison” is offering 58 pages for £15.99, “Elliot Lewis” 44 pages for £15.50 and “Jack Astley” 93 pages for £14.99. Readers may suspect that a more honest nom de plume for the authors would have the initials AI.“We put up a tweet straight away with me holding the real book. The problem is it’s not actually illegal. Although we’re looking at taking action at the one who claims ‘Jeffrey Holland takes you through the highs and lows of his life’ because obviously I don’t.”True admirers should pay for the 256 pages of The First Rule of Comedy..!, in which you also get Su Pollard’s comment about sex workers to Prince Andrew.The First Rule of Comedy..! by Jeffrey Holland is available now,published by the History PressExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreComedyTelevisionTV comedyPanto seasonActinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

But with grandmothers, traditional ideas still hold swayAdrienne MateiMon 24 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 17.45 ESTShareConstance fills her days with music. The 77-year-old, who lives in London, studies and performs classical piano. To stay involved with her community, shevolunteerswith local arts projects, a community garden and an oral history initiative.After a career working as a mental health professional, what Constance wants from retirement is to continue engaging with causes and passions that matter to her. (Her name has been changed for her privacy.)“Most important to me is my commitment to building a fairer, more equal, and non-violent world where people care about the planet,” she says.But she’s noticed others projecting assumptions on to her – “expectations that every grandparent, grandmothers especially, should feel fulfilled [by] and dedicated to their grandchildren”, she says.Constance loves her three young grandchildren, but is not interested in moving closer to where they live, about two hours north of London. “I would not be willing to compromise if I felt that I was being asked to sacrifice my commitments in order to look after grandchildren, unless it was some kind of emergency,” she says. Her son would love to have her as a neighbor, but doesn’t pressure her, Constance says: “Actually, the pressure comes from the people around me.”‘Keeps me grateful’: how volunteering can help older adultsRead moreConstance’s friends, despite being what she describes as lifelong “hardcore feminists”, behave as though a grandmother “should want to spend every minute possible” with their grandchild. These friends judge each other if they choose independent travel over family holidays.“There’s almost a sense of competition for how many grandchildren you’ve got,” she says. “The more you’ve got, the better you are. I feel very ambivalent when I hear people say they can’t fathom the future without a grandchild,” or that they’re “dismayed” their children arechild-free, she says.The absence of grandchildren can elicit pity or confusion.“I do get sorrowful looks from friends, all of whom have dozens of grandchildren, whenever the subject of grandchildren comes up,” says Mary, a Sydney-based 73-year-old retiree who loves writing and theatre. “Some will comment how sad it is” that she doesn’t have any grandchildren, says Mary. She admits she might have liked “an opportunity to have a second chance of bringing up a child, with the hindsight of what I could and should have done better as a mother”.But she’s hardly hung up on not having grandchildren: “I absolutely love my obligation-free life.”The belief that mothers should focus solely on their children and spend little time on professional or personal interests is no longer the default. But when it comes to grandmothers, traditional ideas still hold sway.As a grandmother, observes Constance, “the old stereotypes rebound and you may find yourself … expected to prioritize grandchildren and sacrifice hobbies and interests, and cut short your day in order to be a carer for your grandchildren”.“We’re not just here to have children and bring up the next generation … Why do people feel like that’s all their life could consist of in their older years?” asks Constance. “I just know I don’t feel that way myself.”For women like Constance, pressure comes from the persistent idea that a woman’s value is tied to her role as a caretaker, which also minimizes the many other ways she contributes to society. According to age-old, gender-essentialist norms, women are first and foremost natural child-rearing enthusiasts.The expectation that childcare should define an older woman’s life is politically convenient. In the US, childcare programs have beenunderfundedfor decades, leaving many families, particularly those frommarginalized communitiesor raising children withdisabilities, without accessible, reliable support. This means parents have real childcare needs that are hard to meet. But grandparents “are expected to just be sort of doing nothing in the background”, ready to spring into action as an unpaid social safety net, observes Vanessa May, a professor of sociology and co-director of the Morgan Centre for Research into Everyday Lives at the University of Manchester.The expectation that childcare should define an older woman’s life is politically convenientIn a 2020podcast conversation, JD Vance agreed with host Eric Weinstein that the “whole purpose of the postmenopausal female” is to provide grandchild care, citing his own mother-in-law taking a sabbatical from her role as a biology professor at the University of California, San Diego, to help raise his kids.“Our individualistic society has always undervalued care labor, and the monumental amount of unpaid care labor that women have done historically has been undercompensated and overlooked,” Darby Saxbe, an associate professor of psychology and director of the University of Southern California’s Dornsife Center for the Changing Family,has said.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’This unpaid labor isn’t just a family matter; it’s an invisible pillar of modern economies. In the UK, for example, grandparentssaveparents more than $70bn annually in unpaid, sometimes physically demanding childcare – work that supports the country’s economic stability while remaining largely unrecognized.Assuming that an older woman has nothing meaningful in her life beyond family obligations “feels like a political tide going against the gains that women have made in terms of rights and equality – a clear effort to put women back in their box in the family, under men’s rule”, says May.When Rose heard Vance’s comments, the implication that older women don’t have anything to do apart from childcare struck the 68-year-old (her name has been changed for her privacy), a retired, Korean-Canadian finance professional with two grandchildren, as “insane”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She calls community involvement – primarily through board work with non-profits in areas including women’s leadership and empowerment – one of the most fulfilling aspects of her life, along with travel, spending time in nature and exploring new visual art forms like calligraphy.“Women do public service through their work. There’s plenty of women in politics and economic life, in the labor market,” notes May. Conversely, “if a man doesn’t have children or if he doesn’t have grandchildren, is he seen as somehow not contributing as he should be? Why is that?”The cultural conversation around grandchildren and a lack thereof often centers on older womenpressuringyounger women to have kids – petitioning for a family legacy or impatiently jonesing for little baby fingers and cheeks. Yet Constance and Mary’s experiences of peer judgment underscore how much older women also face and perpetuate tedious societal expectations and pressures about what their lives should look like.A growing number of adults are choosing to be child-free. The share of adults under 50 without children who say they are unlikely ever to have kids increased from 37% in 2018 to47% in 2023. More older adults may be ending up grandchild-free and potentially feeling like “an aberration within their social circles” as a result, says May.I don’t think people should feel guilty if they feel like they want some time and life of their own in retirementRoseBecause motherhood is seen as a pinnacle of womanhood in many circles, not having grandchildren can be regarded as a cause for pity, adds May, saying: “I think it’s partly to do with an idea that if you have brought your children up well, they will go on to fulfill their duty by having children.”Because generational expectations are changing, some older adults may struggle to make sense of their place, and worry that “the independent choices of their adult children are reflecting on their social status within their social groups”, says May.Today’s older parents “are like pioneers trying to figure out, how do you live into old age different from what you might have been expecting, or the people around you might be expecting for you?” says May.Adjusting to changing parenthood and care norms can be difficult. “People need to be able to express regret and what is not working for them and their lifestyle,” says Carol Merle-Fishman, a New York state-based integrative psychotherapist with a special interest in the transition to grandparenthood. That could mean someone wishing they had grandchildren, but it could also mean someone admitting that grandparenthood isn’t what they’d expected. The arrival of grandchildren can disrupt friendships as peers relocate to be closer to family, or a grandparent may not be physically or emotionally up for any more childcare after having raised their own kids.Women “don’t have a lot of permission to talk about which parts of parenting and raising children we don’t like”, says Merle-Fishman.The assumption that grandparenthood is a calling can be alienating for those with more ambivalent feelings. It’s as if, once a woman’s children are grown, the expectation simply resets: here’s another role to fill, another way to be useful, and those who don’t feel fulfilled by it or would rather spend their days doing something else must be off-track. But the women who feel ambivalent about grandmotherhood are not out of step – the assumption that a woman’s value is tied to the next generation of her family is.We’re not just here to have children and bring up the next generationConstanceIn sociologist Dr Orna Donath’s 2017 book Regretting Motherhood: A Study, a mother of three named Sky admits: “For my own sake, I hope that my children will not get married and have children. It scares me; I don’t want it in my life. If I have grandchildren, then I will be obligated and forced once again to do things that I don’t want to. […] It will only burden me.”If spending time with grandchildren “is where you derive 100% of your fulfillment and satisfaction, then go for it”, says Rose. “But on the other hand, I don’t think people should feel guilty if they feel like they want some time and life of their own in retirement.”“My wish for women is that we have times in our lives where we get to make our own decisions,” Eve Rodsky, author of the 2019 book Fair Play and gender-equality advocate, hassaid. “That societal expectations are not making our decisions for us, but that we really get to make our own decisions.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyGrandparents and grandparentingChildcareChildrenFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He had a thousand ideas – which is weird because he was probably the only one not doing cocaine’Interviews byHenry YatesMon 24 Feb 2025 10.26 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 13.03 ESTShareSteve Cradock, guitaristI came up with the Riverboat riff during a jam in 1994. It’s just three notes – a child could have written it, and maybe that’s the appeal. It’s not at all “muso” yet it’s very memorable. A favourite tune of mine isGreen Onionswhich is similarly basic but effective. The other thing the riff reminds me of is Ray Charles’s What’d I Say. To extend it, the chorus came from a demo that our bassist Damon Minchella had made. It’s basically the same set of chords as House of the Rising Sun.When it came to recording, we’d turn up at 11am, spend a couple of hours playing cards, then get stuck into it. We’d be drinking all day, smoking spliff, having a whale of a time. I used my gold Les Paul for the solo on that track. It’s exciting – but it’s really rough and ready! There are at least two huge mistakes, where I falter and fuck up, but I just carry on. It was a time when everything wasn’t scrutinised as much as it is in the studio today – it was rawer, a bit more like a live performance where you don’t get to change things. Which is a good job because otherwise I’d have had to go back and work out a proper solo.I think I could have sung it betterThe whole thing was instinctive – we only did a couple of takes. Then I did the octave guitar parts to make it sound even more like early Fleetwood Mac. To me, Riverboat sounds like an underground blues song. At the time, we used go to this great club in Birmingham called Sweat where we’d dance the night away. It reminds me of the instrumentals being played there. You would have Indian Vibes playing and the DJ would spin a Malcolm X speech over the top.It’s an anti-hit, really. It’s like a 6/8 blues waltz, and we kept thinking: “People aren’t gonna be able to dance to this.” But Chris Evans made it single of the week and when we did theTFI Fridaypilot, he said he wanted it as the walk-on music. We got on well with Chris. He was loud, gregarious – and brilliant. He had a thousand ideas, which is weird because he was probably the only one not doing cocaine.Apart from Jools Holland’s Later, TFI was probably the last TV show where you could watch three or four bands playing live every Friday night. I remember seeing Prince soundcheck in the studio one time, with Larry Graham fromSly and the Family Stoneon bass. That was quite a thing. We were all smoking spliffs in the studio and their security tried to throw us out of the building.That whole period was incredible. There was a movement. You could feel that young people were into guitar music, clothes – there was a common thread between it all. The drink, drugs and celebrities got on my nerves after a while. But I still love The Riverboat Song. Even though it’s a very repetitive riff, it doesn’t ever get boring to play.Simon Fowler, singerSteve’s riff seemed like something you just instinctively knew. It always reminded me of that playground taunt “nur-nur-nur-nur-nur”. Our drummer Oscar Harrison came up with that lolloping beat and I wrote the vocal melody. The lyric was inspired by the scene in Apocalypse Now when the boat comes under fire. There’s a war-like edge to the song.I’m a technophobe – I’ve never touched a computer in my life, so I wasn’t really interested in the production side of Riverboat. I would do the guide vocal, then me and Oscar would sod off upstairs and play table tennis all day. I think I could have sung it better. My lower register has got a lot better. But when we recorded it, we realised we had forged the sound ofOcean Colour Scene. Riverboat doesn’t sound like other songs from the Britpop era does it?View image in fullscreen‘That whole period was incredible’ … the band in 1996, when Riverboat was released.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesI knew it was very different, and that it had a killer hook. But I didn’t expect it to break the charts. Without Chris Evans, it never would have happened. We were driving to a gig when the phone went and it was Chris. He said: “Are you all sitting down?” I said: “Of course we’re sitting down, we’re in the fucking van.” He said: “It’s gone in at No 12 midweek.” We went on Top of the Pops. Then our album Moseley Shoals went to No 2 and stayed there for six months.How did I deal with the blokeyness of 90s culture as a gay man? Well, I’m quite a blokey person anyway. When the Sun outed me, Liam Gallagher walked straight up to me and kissed me on the lips. Mel B once asked me out at TFI Friday too. And Geri said: “He bats for the other team.”Swagger. That’s a good word for The Riverboat Song. It’s like: “We’re here and we’re in the moment.” That’s why we invariably open with it, and as soon as Steve plays the riff, you know the crowd are going to love it.Ocean Colour Scene are on tour27 March to 4 MayExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeOcean Colour ScenePop and rockIndieBritpopfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s hard for the people organising the awards, because there are now so many award ceremonies compressed into such a brief window that it’s difficult to stand out. It’s difficult for the people who are nominated for the awards, who either have to show up with a new and interesting acceptance speech every time, or settle into a sustained pattern of repeated failure. It’s hard for journalists, who have to cover the awards. It’s hard for readers, who have to keep reading about them.But nobody, nobody on Earth, had a worse awards season than Andrew Scott did in 2020. This is the year that he found himself nominated for outstanding actor in a comedy series at theScreen Actors Guild awards, for his role as the priest in Fleabag. It wasn’t bad because he was clearly the underdog, up against household names such as Michael Douglas, Alan Arkin, Bill Hader and Tony Shaloub. No, it was bad because he spent the ceremony passing a kidney stone.“I was beside Phoebe [Waller-Bridge], and Laura Dern had just won best supporting actress and we were standing up,” Scott told Variety on the red carpet of this year’s Sag awards. “I don’t know if anyone has ever experienced having a kidney stone before, but it sends you, the pain is so immediate.”Indeed, things got so bad that Scott had to leave during Dern’s speech, and found himself “in the back [of the room] … writhing around in agony”. Eventually he left the ceremony in an ambulance.The answer to the next question you have is both yes and no. Yes, the Sag awards were recorded on a permanently available video that year, but no you don’t see the moment where Andrew Scott’s entire world caved in on him. However, at least the video affords us a nice little play by play of the night.Fortunately for Andrew Scott, his category was the first to be announced that evening, just eight minutes after the ceremony began. In the video, he is afforded just two closeups. The first comes after his name is announced as a nominee. Is there a sense that he’s about to experience the worst pain of his life? Hard to say. Yes, he’s hunched and slightly pained-looking as the camera falls on him, but that could just as easily be nerves or embarrassment as much as it is large crystal scraping agonisingly down the interior of his ureter. Still, at the very least he affords a smile.The second closeup comes moments later, after he loses the award to Tony Shaloub. Here he looks both happy and magnanimous, as any good awards show loser would. In retrospect this is a missed opportunity. Not many people have the chance to immediately react to the loss of a coveted award by screaming in pain, breaking out into a flopsweat, vomiting on the floor and passing out. Had Scott done this, the whole world would have understood.Sag awards 2025: Timothée Chalamet, Demi Moore, Kieran Culkin and Zoe Saldaña win major categoriesRead moreFour minutes after that, Waller-Bridge wins an award for Fleabag. While the attention is rightly on her, the camera does show Scott hugging Waller-Bridge, then standing up and whooping. I am by no means an expert, but it does strike me as a whoop of excitement and not of searing pain.Nine minutes later, the entire cast of Fleabag finds itself up for best ensemble. Again, Scott is front and centre; still a little hunched but with no obvious signs of distress. When The Marvelous Mrs Maisel won, and Alex Borstein declared that she voted for Fleabag to win, we see Scott smiling once more, with no idea of what’s about to hit him.That would happen around three-and-a-half minutes later. Laura Dern’s award is announced next. By Scott’s timeline, then the moment Dern stood up to make her way to the stage is the moment when the stone hit. Moments later he’d be ushered backstage and, ultimately, driven to hospital in an ambulance. Fleabag makes just one more appearance in the ceremony, an hour later as Waller-Bridge presents an award, but ultimately that’s it.Obviously there are two ways of looking at the whole incident. The first is that it is a terrible thing to have to endure such gruesome pain on what should be one of the biggest nights of your career. The second is that, wow, Andrew Scott really timed that kidney stone to perfection. He stuck it out for just long enough to see his categories, and then got to completely miss out on the rest of the ceremony. The other attendees must have been so jealous as they saw him loaded into an ambulance, knowing that they had to endure another hour-and-a-half of interminable awards guff. He might not have won the award, but by having a perfect excuse to leave early, that kidney stone made Andrew Scott the real winner of the night.Explore more on these topicsFilmAndrew ScottAwards and prizesScreen Actors Guild awardsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The historic success of the far right in Germany’s federal election is a threat not only for all disadvantaged groups in this country – including women, immigrants, queer people, people of colour, Jewish people, disabled people – it is a threat to democracy that should concern everyone.Still, it is those groups that will be most affected by a mood shift that comes with the reality that one in five voters are in favour of a party whose co-leader, Alice Weidel,announcedlast night on live TV: “We will hunt them down!” Echoing a warningonce proclaimedby a former AfD co-chair in 2017, when the party first entered parliament, this was ostensibly a warning to other political parties, but her intentional wording of course provokes all of us who the AfD sees as opponents. And it doesn’t even cause a scandal any more. We know whothey areand what theyare up to. The question is: who else will join them in rhetoric and actions?On Sunday night, when the counting of the election results had just started, I stopped by an “election party for the plural democracy” in Berlin. The non-partisan event, billed as a “public screaming”, took place only a few metres away from the chancellery. Gathered under the umbrella of an anti-fascist consensus, artists, activists, journalists and academics came together in short panels to share their hopes and fears for the coming years, while the audience was having pizza and dancing to hip-hop band the Swag’s uplifting performances in between. It felt good to be among people who dressed up and left the house, instead of mourning at home. The victories of conservative and far-right parties had been widely expected, so we celebrated the small victories instead: the pro-business FDP and the anti-immigrant populist party BSW didn’t make it into parliament; the Left tripled its votes since polls from December, from 3% to almost 9%.The important conclusions of the night were: we have to organise and strengthen our resistance against the right-leaning majority, we have to spread this energy outsideBerlinand we have to watch out for each other and leave all bitterness arising from intra-left conflicts aside. The priority has to be to protect our civil and human rights. None of these strategies are new, of course, but it’s important to reassure each other again and again, especially after a night of results that felt like a turning point for progressive forces. And it certainly helps to do so under a giant disco ball.Alice Weidel had reason to be elated: the AfD can’t be ignored nowKatja HoyerGerman-British historian and author of Beyond the Wall: East Germany, 1949–1990Germany’s election could almost convince outside observers that consensus politics is alive and well in Berlin. There is aclear winner: the conservative CDU/CSU, whose leader, Friedrich Merz, looks set to be the next German chancellor. The incumbent, Olaf Scholz, conceded immediately and congratulated his challenger. There were no concerns of civil unrest nor suspicions of electoral fraud.But underneath the surface, deep cracks have appeared in Germany’s political landscape. After the second world war, theconservativesvowed that there must never be a successful party to the right of them. Now, it’s obvious that they’ve failed in that ambition. The anti-immigration AfD has doubled its support from 2021, coming second with about a fifth of the vote share.The AfD leader, Alice Weidel, was visibly elated. Understanding that this electoral breakthrough has made her party impossible to ignore, she told reporters: “We’re now firmly anchored as aVolkspartei” – or “people’s party”, a term once used exclusively for the CDU/CSU and Olaf Scholz’s SPD as the big beasts of German politics.Weidel didn’t hold back in demonstrating what will likely become the AfD’s strategy: breaking down the so-called firewall that’s keeping it out of power. All other parties have vowed never to work with the AfD. As Merz begins the difficult task of assembling a coalition that forces his centre-right party to turn to a centre-left coalition partner, Weidel reminds him that her door is open too, “so that the will of the people might be implemented”.She was alluding to Merz’s election promise to restrict irregular immigration, which is somethingpollssay the majority of Germans want. His likely coalition partner, the SPD, is very uneasy about that, not least because the AfD might vote with it, which many see as a breach of the firewall.Meanwhile, as the main opposition party, the AfD won’t have to dirty its hands with messy election results and compromise politics. It doesn’t have to find answers to complicated questions. All it has to do is point to conflict between Germany’s centrist parties in their quest for solutions, knowing a fifth of the German electorate lends a lot of weight to the battering ram hammering the firewall.If there are clear winners of Germany’s 2025 election, it’s the political fringes.80% voted for liberal democracy – Merz should govern for themCas MuddeStanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of GeorgiaIt was a typical western European election for the 21st century: the centrist parties scored historically bad results, the far right gained,and the party system fragmented further.Although the results showed aRechtsruck,a swing to the right, it was much smaller than expected – particularly in light of a campaign focused on immigration and the role of the far right, which is a combination that has proved to be the perfect breeding ground for recent far-right victories in western Europe, for example Sweden in 2022 and the Netherlands in 2023.True, a small majority of Germans did vote for anti-immigration parties, but all of them underperformed. The conservative CDU/CSU won the most seats but did not top 30%, its second-worst result in history; the far-right AfD came second nationally but, at just over 20%, fell short ofits performance in state electionsa few months ago. The left-conservativeBSWfailed to win enough seats to enter the Bundestag at all, despite a year of media hype about its prospects.Rather than declaring the minority that voted for the far right to be “the” German people, the centrist parties should accept and address the pluralism of Germany’s population. With a stagnating economy and a new global reality, the country needs a strong democratic government, as the chancellor-to-be, Friedrich Merz, noted in his conciliatory victory speech.His government should neither cater to the far right nor define itself in opposition to it. Rather, it should constitute a broad, grand coalition with the Social Democrats and the Greens, around a necessarily minimal but nevertheless positive agenda that situates Germany at the heart of a liberal democratic Europe. Like so many centrist campaigns before, the anti-immigrant campaigns of both centrist parties (CDU/CSU and SPD) did not win over any far-right voters. Nor did they inspire their core voters. To do that, they will need their own ideas and priorities, which means looking beyond immigration (which was only thethird most important issuefor voters, despite the disproportionate media and political attention) and a constructive focus on socioeconomic issues (the most important issue for CDU/CSU and SPD voters), as well as ensuring peace in an increasingly hostile world (the second biggest issue for SPD voters, fourth for CDU/CSU voters).In other words, they should govern for the 80% who voted for liberal democracy rather than for the 20% who voted against it.Merz is caught between conservatism and authoritarianism, at home and abroadMariam LauPolitical journalist with Die ZeitIn a somewhat sombre mood, Germany’s Christian Democrats celebrated their victory on Sunday night after a country in turmoil had, in huge numbers (an 83% turnout, unmatched since German reunification), gone to the polls. Even though their own score was underwhelming – the CDU/CSU had expected a solid third of the votes, and got only 28.5% – Friedrich Merz is set to fulfil a life-long dream: at the age of 69, after several failed attempts, he is expected to become chancellor of the Federal Republic.A business lawyer who has done quite well for himself during a decade outside professional politics, Merz has never actually governed. But even without that experience, the future chancellor knows what challenges he faces. The country, though still the world’s third-largest economy, is in the third year of recession. Political tensions have mounted, in particular after a succession of killings in public places in which the suspects were refugees or Islamists. The AfD, Germany’s far right, has now doubled its strength and will sit to Merz’s right in the German Bundestag with a mind-boggling 152 seats, reflecting the votes of about 20% of the electorate. The AfD, not the Social Democrats, came in second.Merz, a cultural conservative and a liberal in his economics, has often expressed his personal disgust vis-à-vis members of the AfD. He does not greet them, even when caught alone with one of their midst in an elevator. And yet the chancellor-to-be recently granted them an unnecessary triumph when bringing a motion into parliament concerning migration that would only be passed with the AfD’s consent.Merz’s CDU/CSU finds itself in a quandary: while the Social Democrats (whom he will have to govern in coalition with) paint him as a rightwing populist who is paving the way for the far right, the AfD recently yelled at him in the Bundestag: “We are the future, Herr Merz! Follow us if you still have any strength left.” Many in the CDU/CSU fear that this will be their last chance: “If the centre parties don’t manage to solve our country’s problems, the next elections will be lost,” Merz said at many campaign stops. “And the elections after that will be those of 2033. Imagine that.”But the central pitch of his campaign has been a global one. Merz, a staunch transatlanticist and pro-European, sees Germany at the forefront of the worldwide clash between democracies and authoritarians. It was a shock for him and his party to see how Elon Musk, the US president’s right-hand man and owner of the platform X, blatantly interfered with the elections in favour of the AfD, a party with many anti-American instincts. Merz openly vented his anger and annoyance at JD Vance’sMunich interventionin the same vein. It is this – the palpable and existential difference between conservatism and authoritarianism – that will mark his reign, one way or the other.Germany’s mainstream parties legitimised the far rightTarik Abou-ChadiGerman political scientist and professor of European politics at the University of OxfordIn many ways, it was a relatively normal election. With an incredibly unpopular government and a dire economic outlook, voters decided to support opposition parties instead of those that made up the previous coalition. All members of the outgoing coalition made up of the SPD, Greens and FDP lost votes – with bigger losses for the SPD and FDP than for the Greens. The conservative opposition CDU/CSU came out on top.However, even in this relatively normal election, some things stand out. Above all, the dramatic electoral success of the far-right AfD, which almost doubled its vote share and came out with more than 20% of the vote. The AfD has massively benefited from immigration being the dominant issue in the campaign. Over recent years, nearly all other parties have moved further to the right on immigration. As we know fromextensive researchon this phenomenon, such accommodation normalises and legitimises the far right.As in many other European countries, the behaviour of the mainstream left and mainstream right has strongly contributed to the success of the far right in Germany. Only a few weeks ago, the CDU/CSU tried to pass a law with the support of the AfD – a historic precedent in the Bundestag. This clearly did not help the CDU/CSU electorally. It lost close to a million voters to the AfD. But this strategy has moved the AfD from the fringes to the centre of German politics. While the AfD will very likely not be part of the next German government coalition, this election and the behaviour of other German parties have lifted them into a new position of power.The second remarkable result comes from the leftwing Die Linke. It had been written off as a dead party that was very likely not to make it into the Bundestag again after Sahra Wagenknecht broke away to form her own movement. However, the Linke strongly increased its support in the last weeks of the campaign. Many believe that the party managed to attract progressive voters who were alienated by the SPD and Greens, especially on migration and Gaza.While many progressives turned their backs on the SPD a long time ago, the Greens seemed like the natural home for these voters. However, as part of a government that pushed through draconian measures against asylum seekers, and running a campaign strongly focused on the centre, the Greens did not manage to gain these voters’ support. Their biggest losses were among younger voters – their former stronghold. Die Linke saw huge gains among these voters and it has also come out as the strongest party in Berlin.It should be a lesson for left and progressive parties in Europe that moving right can be a costly strategy, because progressive voters will look for a new home.Europe needs German leadership to save Nato and the EUPaul TaylorSenior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreAs Donald Trump rushes to carve up Ukraine with Vladimir Putin over the heads of the Ukrainians and Europeans, Europe urgently needs a stronger Germany to give its voice more weight. Berlin has been largely absent from diplomacy over the future of the EU and Nato, because its government was weak and divided long before it collapsed last year, and its economy is in the doldrums after two years of recession. With France also in political crisis, there is a power vacuum at the heart of Europe just when strong leadership is vital.Conservative Friedrich Merz, who will be the next chancellor after his party topped Sunday’s poll, is determined to provide that leadership. He sounds bolder and less cautious than the outgoing Social Democratic chancellor, Olaf Scholz. On Sunday night, Merz said his absolute priority would be “to strengthen Europe so that we can achieve step-by-step real independence from the US”, adding that it was not clear “whether we will still be able to talk about Nato in its current form” after Trump’s rapprochement with Russia. The lifelong Atlanticist has said Europe can no longer rely on American protection, and called for talks with the UK and France on sharing their nuclear deterrent with Germany and Europe.Yet it remains unclear how far Merz will be able to overcome Germans’ deep-seated aversion to all things military, boost defence spending substantially by loosening the country’s borrowing straitjacket, or agree to borrow jointly with European partners to procure key defence systems. Sunday’s result gives him a chance to form a two-party coalition with the Social Democrats. However, even with support from the Greens, he will not have the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament to reform the constitutional debt brake, unless he can win votes from the opposition hard-left Die Linke or the far-right AfD. It will take two months to form a new government, and, as Merz put it, “the world will not wait for us, but Europe is waiting for Germany”.To give the ailing EU a new impulse, the conservative leader has pledged to restore Germany’s strained relations with Paris and Warsaw, and to draw Britain into a security partnership with the main European powers. It will take skill to surmount tensions with France over German support for more EU free trade agreements, notably with South America, and with Poland over its longstanding demand for reparations for destruction dating back to the second world war.Germany’s voice will be crucial in shaping how far the EU pauses or slashes energy and environment regulations in its quest to restore economic competitiveness. German conservatives also lead the European Commission (Ursula von der Leyen) and the largest group in the European parliament (Manfred Weber of the European People’s party), so Merz is well placed to press his deregulation agenda. However, von der Leyen was the architect of the EU’s Green Deal legislation to fight climate breakdown, and she may resist a drastic rollback.The new chancellor faces daunting challenges in Europe, but his partners are yearning for a more proactive Germany.This was a bad result for progressives, but Merz lacks a strong mandateDominic SchwickertExecutive director of the independent thinktank Das Progressive ZentrumYes, the result is certainly not a good one for progressive forces. As in most industrialised countries, the population is massively dissatisfied with the current federal government. Furthermore, the centre-left alliance was far too often preoccupied with internal disputes even before its collapse in November. As a result, the conservative CDU/CSU and the far-right AfD have been stable leaders in the polls for more than a year. Progressive forces, meanwhile, find themselves in an unfamiliar position: instead of being in favour of change, the SPD and Greens are currently generally perceived as being in favour of extending the status quo – which the majority does not want.And yet: Friedrich Merz and his party do not have a strong mandate. Given the high level of dissatisfaction with the coalition government, the CDU/CSU cannot be satisfied with a meagre gain of four percentage points and the second-worst result in its history.Either way, Merz does not have much time to form a stable government – which is what is needed now, taking into account the global political situation. The CDU/CSU’s ideal scenario – only needing one partner and being able to choose from two – has not materialised. The CDU/CSU is dependent on the SPD.The good news: if a black-red coalition (CDU/CSU-SPD) is formed, Germany will have a stable, centrist government – with a strong Green party in the opposition. However, as a junior partner, the SPD would once again be faced with the difficult task of ensuring stability in the country through compromises with the CDU/CSU – and at the same time renewing itself. The Greens, who have lost the least among the coalition forces, are facing a crucial analysis: isRobert Habeck’s course, which has brought the Greens out of their niche as an ecological party, still the right one – or did it cost them more votes in the leftwing milieu than could be won in the centre? This question will determine the internal party discussion over the next few weeks.What is important for the next federal government in terms of its agenda? The top priority must be for Germany to expand its defence and security policy capabilities even more decisively and, in close coordination with Poland and France, to assume a leading role in a Europe that must defend itself against Russian imperialism and the anti-western course of the Trump administration. This requires an end to small-mindedness in fiscal policy: a reform of thedebt braketo enable urgently needed investment in German defence capabilities, competitiveness and infrastructure; anticipating the uncertain majority situation in the new parliament, such a programme should still be initiated under and together with the Scholz government. Finally, the new federal government must manage to bring the migration debate back to an objective level and find a face-saving solution for all parties involved; contrary to what Merz suggested during the election campaign, this can only be a European policy solution.This is precisely why the coalition negotiations must be finalised quickly – so that Germany does not continue to be gripped by its internal issues, but rather, in view of the changed global political situation, it ensures that Europe is self-confident and capable of acting in the battle of the great powers, and not shredded by it.Explore more on these topicsGermanyThe panelAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)Olaf ScholzEuropeFriedrich MerzcommentShareReuse this content"

But it is his duty to go there upholding British and European valuesMon 24 Feb 2025 12.44 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 13.12 ESTShareDay by day another vast hole opens up beneath what was once solid. The man who is on course to become Germany’s next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, once the most pro-US of leaders, has declared Nato in effect over. In his clear-eyed perception of Donald Trump’s first month, 80 years of shared transatlantic values have fallen into that crater. The US “doesn’t care about the fate of Europe one way or another” and Washington’s actions have been “no less drastic, dramatic, and ultimately no less brazen” than Moscow’s, he said. Now, Europe must defend itself.The moment smacks of that 1940 David Low cartoon of a British soldier standing on a rock in a stormy sea, shaking his fist as the Luftwaffe approach: “Very well, alone”. But this time we Europeans are alone. JD Vance, the US vice-president,declared war on European values and traditions; Europe’s liberal “enemies within” are more dangerous in his eyes than Russia or China. Those spell-breaking words told Europeans that the US can never be trusted again; at any time, Americans may vote for a leader who betrays old allies, sharing no affinity with Europe’s liberal democracies, international rights or laws. “The west” no longer exists as an entity bound by shared beliefs.Keir Starmer knows that every step he takes inside the White House on Thursday could set off some Trumpian explosive device. Emmanuel Macron will have already tested the ground (he arrived there today). The US president’s wild unpredictability, whether by design, delusion or distraction, is a weapon in itself, and a wary Starmer is war-gaming it with his advisers. That “bridge” of a “special relationship” remains in No 10’s official briefing lexicon, but by now it is wholly illusory.View image in fullscreenDavid Low’s June 1940 Evening Standard cartoon Very well, alone.Illustration: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyStarmer’s task is to salvage the best possible agreements on Ukraine, tariffs and defence without wavering on what once were mutual principles. He has his red lines, echoed across Europe: “No talks about Ukraine, without Ukraine”. No mafioso protection racket grabbing Ukraine’s mineral wealth to pay off bogus debts. Reuters reports that unless Volodymyr Zelenskyy payshalf a trillion dollars, the US will cut off Ukraine’s access to Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite communications network, crippling the country’s defences. In the face of such brutishness, Starmer is the right man: lawyerly, calm and diplomatic. He will not be riled into pointless verbal warfare. He brings Europe’s pledges to spend more, and possibly the hubristic offer of the UK’s new ambassador, Peter Mandelson, of a “new economic partnership” with the UK as a hub for US AI to “Make our economies great again”.But everyone can see that Trump’s “reset” with Vladimir Putin is irreconcilable with Nato. The alliance is dead if it fails to resist a Russian aggressor, a despot who murdersopposition politicians, commits unspeakablewar crimes, kidnaps thousands of Ukrainian children, with a declared intent to return Warsaw pact countries to its embrace. Trump is Russia’s greatest asset.Starmer will avoid verbal spats with a champion spitter. Be bold, comes the best advice from Merz, warning Europe’s leaders “not to come to Washington as a dwarf” or they“will be treated as one”. As Europe speedily circles the wagons, the UK finds its role will be vital, as Macron and Merz call for a joint nuclear shield to be provided by France and the UK, pivoting from US nuclear dependence. In a continent that is losing the security we relied on all our lives, trade disputes become a trivial quibble, Brexit an irrelevance. Merz is calling for Europe to come together in foreign, trade and security policy. Starmer ought to seize the chance, and abandon Labour’s fears of Brexiters.With its colossal majority, Labour has nothing to fear in rallying the country around joint European defence as a necessary patriotic cause, leaving the Tories and Reform confounded. The public that welcomed Ukrainians rejects Trump’s betrayal plans:21% of peoplestrongly support British soldiers being stationed in Ukraine as peacekeepers, and 37% of people “somewhat” support the idea. Only 21% are opposed to it. The idea of a European army would have been unthinkable during the Brexit referendum. Meanwhile, on trade, a majority of voters in every constituency thinks the government shouldprioritise tradewith the EU over the US, even in Clacton, Nigel Farage’s seat.Fifty-five per cent of Britonsnow say it was wrong to leave the EU, while just 11% call Brexit a success. There’s no need to reopen those old wounds. A Europe united against new perils seems likely to loosen its rigid single market rules on trade, given that Britain would be contributing so much in mutual defence. As Britain strives to spend up to 3% compared with Germany’s 1.5% defence spending, the doors to trade must surely open for the UK to regain some of the 4-5% of GDP it haslost since Brexit.View image in fullscreenHugh Grant and Billy Bob Thornton in Love Actually, 2003.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThe Brexiters now sound bizarrely out of tune. Last week, David Frost, who led the UK’s negotiations with the EU,frantically tweeted: “Labour are taking us back into the EU orbit by stealth and hoping you won’t notice till it’s too late. Don’t let them get away with it.” Yet those days are done. Instead, all of Europe and the UK need defence eurobonds for all to borrow. If the opposition attacks the chancellor for breaking a borrowing pledge, Labour need only point to the frightening new world where Elon Musk sends warm congratulations not to Germany’s new leader, but to the far-right AfD.There will be a White House press conference during Starmer’s visit, a dangerous opportunity for Trump to say unspeakable things while leaving Starmer dumbstruck. If he’s lost for words, he might remember those spoken by a particularly memorable British prime minister at a press conference with a US president in 2003. Hugh Grant, playing the prime minister in Love Actually,told the president, Billy Bob Thornton: “I fear that this has become a bad relationship; a relationship based on the president taking exactly what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to Britain. We may be a small country, but we’re a great one, too … And a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger. And the president should be prepared for that.”The real world is not scripted by Richard Curtis for happy endings. Poking presidents in public is not politic, and Starmer is likely tooffer Trump a carriage ride with King Charles. But he will have no trouble rousing voters to defend European and British values against Trumpism.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A nanosecond ago, however – as recently as Saturday – the idea that voters might go this far-right, in these kinds of numbers, for the first time since the second world war was terrifying. Some are calling this a victory over Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who vocally supported the AfD; others are calling it a victoryforthem.Nobody is puzzling much over the decline in support for Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic party – down 9%, almost equal to the AfD’s gains, although the numbers on switchers have yet to be crunched – because it was so long expected. The CDU/CSU alliance has won, with 28.5%, pretty much as the polls predicted. It’s an incredibly German story in its labyrinthine and laborious coalition possibilities, but it’s also a common story these days. The two main parties hand power to one another in a kind of disillusionment relay; the populist right gets a dispiritingly good show; the populist or eco left is less populist, less popular, and can pick a fight with itself in a paper bag, so it looks even smaller than it is.In all similar democracies, left and right are having versions of the same argument: does “electable” mean centrist or radical? Will voters return to a late-20th-century happy place and choose obediently between varieties of status-quo-ism? Or has the reckoning with the status quo – that it’s not static, but keeps getting worse – begun?It’s annoying how much faster the right got its act together. It chose its enemies and animated them with such vivacity and certitude that all there is left to divide it is who hates those enemies most.The left, meanwhile, is still at its most passionate hating other people on the left and still at its liveliest finding nuance and idiosyncrasy in each new election. But it would be helpful to acknowledge that this is the story of everywhere.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

To facilitate the move, the barrister not only had to be ennobled, but it required giving theboot to Emily Thornberry– a long-serving shadow cabinet member who’d held the post in opposition for several years – which came as a surprise.Friends of Hermer soon began to wonder how long he would last in post, as they suspected that the Labour government would not be radical enough to live up to his principles (particularly on Israel, the KC being a criticof its occupation of the Palestinian territories). And quitting would be low-stakes when an easy return to the day job awaits.What has emerged is the reverse. After weeks of media pressure, there are now rumours that Hermer could be sacked for being too forceful in making the government fit his principles.Critics outside the governmentaccuse the “lefty lawyer” of adopting an approach to the job that prioritises international law over national sovereignty. He is seen by them as imposing an out-of-touch liberal attitude on government decisions, characterised by his view of the British empireas “deeply racist”, and to come with unacceptable baggage. Their concerns range from substantive issues to more trivial ones, such asa recent story in the Telegraph, which highlighted how Hermer had to reduce his no win, no fee bonus in a 2006 case.‘Deeply unfair’: how attorney general became lightning rod for criticism of StarmerRead moreWhen I interviewed Hermer last month, he responded that if his critics “want to pick a fight with the government because it says international law is important”, then “that’s a fight I’d quite look forward to”. “Bring it on,” he said.The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, has claimed the AG’s former client list throws upconflicts of interest– such as Gerry Adams, who could get compensation if the Legacy Act (which offers immunity to Troubles-era crimes in Northern Ireland) is repealed. The rebuttal is simple: Hermer follows the same process as his predecessors. Wherever conflicts arise, such matters will be directed to the solicitor general instead.Those close to Hermer admit that specific briefings are tricky to counter. Law officer convention means the matters on which he has or has not advised the government cannot be revealed. His team believes publishing a list of broad topics from which he would recuse himself, as some have suggested, would make the job too difficult.Mounting criticism from inside the tent is more concerning. This centres on two accusations: that Hermer is a block on the government’s agenda, and that he lacks the political nous needed for the job. The former in particular is strongly denied by Hermer’s allies, who say the idea he would shy away from challenging legal battles is absurd considering that he has fought many “unwinnable” cases during his career.“To criticise him is to kill the messenger,” says former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve. Hermer’s unhappy colleagues claim he is an obstacle to achieving their policy goals, but allies argue that the AG is simply imparting home truths, and his critics within the government need to accept the tough love.Born in south Wales but now resident in north London,Hermer, 56, is a cheerful man who, sources say, always picks up the phone or rings back when advice is sought. His political background is typical of the averageLabourMP under Starmer: Hermer joined Labour aged 16 and opposed Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership because he thought it made the party unelectable and due to the antisemitism crisis. Why, then, is such an inoffensive character getting people’s backs up?Hermer and Starmer have been friends since meeting on Hermer’s first day at Doughty Street Chambers in 1996. But being the prime minister’s oldest friend in the cabinet has not protected Hermer from criticism. On the contrary, it seems his proximity to the prime minister is provoking internal attacks.The AG is hindered by not having spent the last 15 years sitting in the tearoom with the MPs who now make up the cabinet. There is also a sense that his role has been given greater significance in Starmer’s government – a reaction to the risky approach of recent Conservative administrations to lawfulness – and that this roving brief may be causing resentment. One theory is that Hermer sits on an usually high number of cabinet committees, so he is delivering blunt advice more directly than predecessors, who might have done it more often via government lawyers.The assertion that he lacks politics – one that has been levelled at Starmer many times – is a key part of the internal dispute. It is true that Hermer still doesnot see himself as a politician. And, crucially, he believes his role relies on “the ability to provide independent, impartial advice that is not tainted by day-to-day political considerations”. Is Hermer’s job to give advice, which ministers can choose to follow or not? Or is it to ensure his advice aligns with ministers’ policy priorities?“I think they’re shocked he gives such stark advice,” one senior aide says of ministers who oppose Hermer. “People need to be a bit more robust. The advice is only advice. If you want to take the political risk, that’s up to you.”Others counter that an attorney general’s analysis of a legal problem is not only an opinion but the law, and ministers must follow the advice or resign, which means Hermer is there to understand the politics, too.Perhaps Hermer does lack political nous, but it looks like this is precisely the character Starmer was hoping would fill the role. Often, the true frustration of Hermer’s critics appears to actually be with the PM, with the attorney general a convenient proxy. “All the things people don’t like about Keir are being directed at Richard because he’s not the boss,” says one friend. As long as doubts linger over Starmer’s ability to combine delivery with a strong political narrative, Hermer is vulnerable.Sienna Rodgers is deputy editor of the House magazineExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Their devastation over a doomed anglerfishEmma BeddingtonThe death of one of the sea’s uglier creatures has led to an outpouring online. What is it about this unfortunate creature that has evoked such big feelings?Mon 24 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTShareHere’s an unexpected addition to our 2025 bingo card: young women across the internet have been devastated by the demise of a nightmarish fanged fish. A black seadevil anglerfish (unflatteringlydescribedby one marine biologist as “pretty much evolved to be a giant head”), usually a deep-sea dweller, was recentlycaught on cameraswimming close to the surface by a shark research group near Tenerife. Sadly, apparently sick or injured, it died.This, however, was only the start of the anglerfish’s journey in the hearts and TikToks of young women. The fish’s story has triggered an outpouring of emotion. The narrative they have adopted is that the tiny anglerfish, who lived her life in darkness, wanted to feel the“sun on her face”, so swam alone through the vast ocean to do that before expiring. There have beentattoos, poetry andoceans of tears. “If you have a girlfriend right now, do yourself a favour and go ask her how she’s feeling about the anglerfish,” wroteone TikTok user. “There is a 98% chance she has already bawled her eyes out about it.”What catharsis is this creature providing? Yes, she was small and female, but males are even smaller – a tenth of the size. I wonder whether anglerfish parasitism (the teeny males are absorbed into females’ bodies, serving solely to provide sperm as needed) might appeal at a time when women’s reproductive autonomy is existentially threatened, but not only is that a massive stretch, but this particular species isnon-parasitic. So that leaves me with lots of young, especially American, women really not being OK right now. A doomed creature swimming through a hostile environment evoking big feelings? Understandable.I’m almost certainly reading too much into it. Weepy animal stories are irresistible to me, even if the animal isn’t – I hope the anglerfish would have forgiven me for saying – conventionally cute. It’s nice to see a bit more fellow feeling for fish, anyway: the recent revelation that bream candistinguish between individualsbased on their wetsuits justconfirmsthat fish are complex, cool, clever and fascinating.

Those who can’t see it won’t have a say in reshaping the worldNesrine MalikThe sooner the US’s former friends realise the old global order is over, the sooner they can organise to regain power and agency – the only language Trump understandsMon 24 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 09.13 ESTShareAresonant phrase during Donald Trump’s first administration was the advice to take him “seriously, but not literally”. It was a singularly detrimental expression,widely quoted by politiciansand the media. Its adoption fit with the position many felt most comfortable taking: Trump was bad, but he wasn’t smart. He wasn’t intentional. He wasn’t calculated and deliberate. He sounded off, but rarely followed up with action. He was in essence a misfiring weapon that could do serious damage, but mostly by accident.The residue ofthat approach still persists, even in analysis that describes Trump’s first executive orders as a campaign of “shock and awe”, as if it were just a matter of signalling rather than executing. Or that his plan for Gaza is to be taken –you guessed it – seriously, not literally. When that was suggested to Democratic senator Andy Kim,he lost it. “I understand people are bending over backwards to try to mitigate some of the fallout from these statements that are made,” he told Politico. But Trump is “the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in the world … if I can’t take the words of the president of the United States to actually mean something, rather than needing some type of oracle to be able to explain, I just don’t know what to think about when it comes to our national security.”Part of the problem is that people are reluctant to imbue Trump with any sort of coherence. But a Trump doctrine is emerging, most sharply in foreign policy. It has clear features, contours and a sort of unified theory of conflict. First, it is transactional, particularly when it comes to warfare in which the US is playing a role. Nothing has a history or any objective sense of right and wrong. Time starts with Trump, and his role is to end things, ideally while securing some bonus for the US.That upside is the second feature of the Trump doctrine: financialisation, or the reduction of politics to how much things cost, what is the return and how it can be maximised. Trump sees conflicts and financial assistance that have not produced anything tangible for the US. From the Gaza war, some sort of real estate deal can be salvaged. InUkraine, a proposalfor almost four times the value of US assistanceso far in mineralsis like the stripping of a distressed company by a new investment manager trying to recoup the funds disbursed by predecessors.Donald Trump is remaking the world. But he really won’t like the result | Nesrine MalikRead moreThe third feature is the junking of any notions of “soft power” – something that is seen as expensive, with questionable benefits that are abstract and unquantifiable. Soft power might even be a myth altogether, a fiction that flattered previously gullible regimes, giving them some sense of control while others fed off the US’s resources. In Gaza orUkraine, the US was going through the motions of action without a definitive breakthrough. Where others saw soft power, Trump sees quagmires.The features of this approach may change, and they might be shortsighted and deleterious to the US’s security. And they may not entirely come from Trump himself, but rather the intersection of different political strands of the configuration of interests that support and advise him. Channelled through Trump, the doctrine takes on the hallmarks of his character – rambling, narcissistic, ignorant. However, none of this should be confused with a lack of underlying consistency and resolve to follow through.This leaves other leaders, particularly inEurope, in a place where their historical arrangements and understandings when it comes to US compact have been wiped out. European countries are now simply junior nations who can either dispense with their cancelled notions of the importance of rebuffing Vladimir Putin, join Trump in bringing an end to the war on his terms, or pick up the pieces themselves when the US withdraws its support.The ensuing anger and language of “appeasement” and “capitulation” feels like a misreading of what is happening, an echo of a time when it was universally agreed upon that aggressive enemies are to be stood up to, and anything else is a moral defeat and sign of weakness. But Trump is functioning in a different value system, one where these notions don’t even apply or have different definitions.As Europeans seethe, Trump’s plan for Ukraine is being worked out not only away from Europe in Washington, but in the Middle East, at new centres of middleman power that have always been transactional. They themselves are in the throes of redefining their relationship with the US, and have no illusions about the world that is emerging. Sergei Lavrovmet with Marco Rubioin Riyadh and Volodymyr Zelenskyyflew to the regionpreparing for Gulf-mediated peace talks in Abu Dhabi. Those whose relationships with the US have been hard-edged, about mutual self-interest rather than shared values, and have always had to manage the US to greater or lesser extents, seem best positioned now to not freeze in moral horror.For the rest, for the country’s more intimate friends and family, those who shared America’s values and security liabilities, the regime change is a bitter pill to swallow. It is likely that there can be no persuasion, negotiation or hope of a “transatlantic bridge”, as Keir Starmer has been described, a figure that can act as an intermediary between the US and Europe and head off rupture. PerhapsStarmer can appealto Trump’s ego? Or “tread a diplomatic line”, or convince him that giving in to Putinmakes him look weak? All that assumes some measure of impulsiveness on Trump’s part that can be reined in (and by a prime minister not exactly known for his pyrotechnic charm), and also that Trump even shares similar notions of “judgment of history” or the same understanding of “weakness”. There is no small, but still shared, middle ground.There are now two options for the US’s former close friends and security partners: shed everything, dispense with notions of European solidarity, fast-forward the end of the postwar order, and make peace with defence vulnerability and political subordination. Or embark on a colossalpower-mappingexercise. This entails rapid, closely coordinated action on a political, bureaucratic and military level to either replace the US, or at least demonstrate that they constitute a bloc that has some power, agency and agility – and challenge Trump in the only language he understands.It is tempting to think that Trump doesn’t mean it, or needs to be managed and cajoled because all that underlies his actions is recklessness. Or that there is a way to reconcile what are now in essence two incompatible conceptions of the global order. Who wants to wake up every day and reckon with the end of the world as they know it? But it is so. And the sooner political leaders come to terms with the fact that roads back to the old way are closed, the more likely it is that this new world will not be fashioned entirely on Trump’s terms.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationKeir StarmerEuropeUS politicsUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

Then he comes back for moreMon 24 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 10.36 ESTShareIhave a friend, an American author, who writes about war. Over the past decades, he has been to South Sudan, Rwanda, Congo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza and other conflict zones. In the case ofUkraine, he said one thing stood out: here it was obvious who was the aggressor and who was the victim. Alongside Bosnia, Ukraine’s resistance to Russia remains, in his opinion, one of two truly just wars.After three years of fighting a just war against Putin’s aggression, we are now facing, with Donald Trump, an unjust peace. Ukraine will lose lands and will not receive compensation for its losses. War crimes will go unpunished and Ukrainians will not be provided with the security guarantees needed to protect them from future Russian attack.It is not a new scenario. Think of the Russian-Georgian war of 2008. Russia attacked neighbouring Georgia, yet the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy, whose country held the presidency of the European Council, did his best toappeaseRussia,forcing Georgia into a humiliating peace.Russia’s war on Georgiahad another, lesser-known consequence. AfterRussia’s victory, Vladimir Putin subsequently adopted plans for a full-scale war against Ukraine. The weak western response to Russia’s aggression in Georgia gave Putin reason to believe that it would react similarly in the case of Ukraine. Just as his war against Georgia was largely a reaction to itspro-western revolutionof 2003, Ukraine was to be “punished” for the 2004 Orange revolution that threatened to move Ukraine out of Russia’s orbit. Putin’s plan leaked and its details appeared in a2009 newspaper articlewritten by two leading Ukrainian security experts. But at the time it was considered so fantastical that few people credited it.In any case, Ukraine was spared whatever fate Putin had in mind for it in 2010, when the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych came to power. In 2013, Yanukovych surprisingly supported Ukraine’s journey towards European integration. But in a sudden volte face, when it came to signing a historic association agreement with the EU that year,he pulled the plug. This abrupt change of heart came after a meeting with Putin. There was speculation that Putin coerced Yanukovych by threatening to launch his war on Ukraine if the country continued its westward movement. Yanukovych’s unilateral refusal to sign the EU agreement triggered anew wave of proteststhat began in Kyiv in November 2013 – and eventually became known as theEuromaidan revolution.The standoff dragged on for months, and by early 2014 it became clear that a Russian invasion was only a matter of time. I am telling this from my own experience: during the Euromaidan, I worked at an ad hoc thinktank, and we were informed about Putin’s plans. We knew we had only until the end of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Immediately after it ended, theannexation of Crimeabegan. According to the thinking in the Kremlin, this was supposed to initiate a “Russian spring” – an uprising of the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine against Kyiv. It failed to materialise. The majority of Ukrainians, regardless of what language they spoke, did not want to let war into their homes.Instead of a civil war in Ukraine, Putin got a low-intensity war in Donbas that he could not win. Still, he knew how to wait. Those who know Putin well say the philosophy he lives by is similar to that of judo – a sport he has practised since his youth. In judo, you stay close to your opponent and wear them down until they give up. Despite the failure to achieve his goals in 2014, Putin abandoned nothing. The full-scale invasion of 2022 confirms this.More than once, Putin and his spin doctors have insisted that Russia is not at war with Ukraine, but with the west in Ukraine. He sees Ukraine as an artificial nation, created by the west to subvert Russia’s power. Independent Ukraine is guilty by the very fact of its existence. Truce is possible in such a war but not peace – just as there could be no peace in the war between Rome and Carthage.However, a truce would resolve very little if anything. And for Ukraine it would bring an additional risk. From the beginning of the war, Ukrainians have been demanding a just and lasting peace. Now, instead, they will get a shaky and unfair truce.The discrepancy between high expectations and humiliating reality is one of the most reliable indicators of a pre-revolutionary crisis. Unlike 2004 and 2014, a new revolution could be led by people who have returned from the front and feel betrayed by their own government. The resulting civil conflict would give Putin the perfect opportunity to invade Ukraine again – this time under the pretext of establishing political stability.In February 2022, Putin’s objective was to capture Kyivin three days. What he failed to do then, Trump may help him to achieve within the next three years or even sooner. And then, the whole world is before him. Experts say he will be ready to attack the west within thenext three to five years.Many in the west are ignoring his long-term ambitions now, just as they ignored them in 2008. But if history has anything to teach us, one of its lessons is this: you cannot appease an aggressor who is thinking long-term. Ukrainians learned this the hard way. Prior to the full-scale invasion of 2022, we were warned about the war but we didn’t want to believe it. It is probably human nature to mobilise only once a threat becomes real.I would love to be wrong, but my historian’s gut tells me that in February 2022 the world entered a decade of war. The saying “if you want peace, prepare for war” remains as relevant after three years of war in Ukraine as it has been for 2,000 years.Yaroslav Hrytsak is a historian and professor at the Ukrainian Catholic University in LvivExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVladimir PutinRussiaEuropeGeorgiaTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

He will also need to forge broad alliances at home to see off the far rightMon 24 Feb 2025 13.55 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 17.47 ESTShareFriedrich Merz, the leader of Germany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union party (CDU), has a reputation for being blunt. On Sunday evening, as it became clear that the CDU hadwonthe snap election triggered by the outgoing Social Democrat chancellor, Olaf Scholz, he did not disappoint. “For me,” said Mr Merz in a post-election television debate, “the absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA.”As recently as a fortnight ago, such a statement from a German chancellor-elect would have been inconceivable. But these are new and extraordinary times. A convincedtransatlanticist, Mr Merz has previously played down the dangers to western unity posed by Donald Trump. But crude electioneering on behalf of the extreme right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) by the US president’soutriders, and the sidelining of Europe and Kyiv from negotiations over the future of Ukraine, have forced a handbrake turn.For the European Union, as it seeks tostrengthenits strategic autonomy in a new and challenging era, that is good news. For Ukraine, in desperate need of robust support from a united Europe, Mr Merz’s steadfastbackingalso offers cause for hope. Newly assertive leadership from the EU’s most powerful member state will be key in a tangibly more menacing global context.Domestically, reasons for optimism are thinner on the ground. As Mr Merzacknowledgedon Monday, the weekend’s poll revealed a dangerously polarised country – one in which the centre is historically weak while the far right continues to surge, particularly in theeast. On a very high turnout, the AfD doubled its voteto 21%. The combined score of the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), was 29% – its second lowest since 1949. The Social Democrat party (SPD) endured its worst postwar result, reduced to third place and a miserable 16%.Mr Merz has pledged to maintain the firewall excluding the far right from power, and the makeup of the new Bundestag points to a two-party coalition with the SPD. That could lead to a welcome tempering of CDUeffortsto ape AfD stances on immigration policy. Rather than prolonging unsuccessful attempts to crowd out the far right, it would be in Germany’s interests for Mr Merz to move in the other direction on the economy.The CDU leader made his reputation in the 1990s as a small-state free marketeer in the Ronald Reagan mould. Yet as chancellor he will inherit a moribund economy in dire need of huge government investment, at a time when the pressure to raise defence spending is also acute. Thebusiness modelthat depended on cheap Russian energy and Chinese demand for exports has collapsed. Fixing it may require pushing forconstitutional reformto allow the state to borrow and spend more – anathema to many in Mr Merz’s party.One in five German voters opted on Sunday for a party thatsupportsthe forced repatriation of migrants and has been associated with neo-Nazi dog-whistling. Ominously, the AfD picked up substantial support among the young as well as non-graduates. Beyond the firewall, the AfD leader, Alice Weidel, can position herself as leader of a Trumpian government-in-waiting. The next administration must attempt to restore trust in Germany’s postwar tradition of consensus-building and moderation. The stakes could scarcely be higher.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now is the time for a rethinkMon 24 Feb 2025 13.54 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 17.49 ESTShareIt’s a seductive promise: let our computers scrape the internet for ideas, images, forms of words, stories, music, jokes … and our industry will make your country rich. For a UK government desperate foreconomic growth, the demands of tech companies for copyright laws to be relaxed – in order that their artificial intelligence (AI) systems can access as much online content as possible without having to pay or seek permission – have been hard to resist. The US and China are the global leaders of this new tech race. But the UK has a chance to compete that ministers are desperate not to miss.To AI businesses,copyrightis an irritant. Three years ago, it appeared that their lobbyists were on the verge of getting their way when a government agency, the Intellectual Property Office, recommended an exemption for data mining. This would grant bots free rein and – so the argument went – provide an incentive for tech companies to invest in the UK.The proposal was not taken up. Unfortunately, it was not killed off either. And theconsultationregarding AI and copyright law being run by the current government, which concludes on Tuesday, is framed in terms that are far too favourable to big tech.Currently, the law is very clear. The makers of works of art, and other products of human creativity, including journalism, have for centuries been entitled to protection from copyists. Drawing a line between influence and imitation is not always straightforward, and can lead to interesting court cases. But the principle that original material cannot be ripped off and that creative people have rights over their work is widely understood and accepted.It is not surprising that big tech decided these rules did not apply to AI. Breaking things is, famously, part of the Silicon Valley ethos. Already, AI firms have absorbed a vast amount of material that they ought to have been obliged to pay for. There are parallels with the way that US social media companies built advertising-funded businesses that were heavily reliant on content, including news, that was paid for by others. Once again, regulators as well as other industries arestruggling to keep up. But it is individual artists, writers and musicians, and smaller creative and media organisations and businesses, who are most in danger of being left behind.It is easy to see why ministers are attracted by big tech’s boundless self-belief. Who doesn’t hope that new technology will help to solve some of the world’s many problems? ButJD Vance, the US vice-president, was wrong to criticise European governments for being “too self-conscious, too risk-averse”, at the AI summit held in  Paris earlier this month. It is concerning that the UK, like the US, refused to sign a declaration committed to safety and sustainability.Thankfully, artists including Paul McCartney andElton Johnhave stepped up to make the case against big tech anti-regulation – and in favour of the continued protection ofhuman artistry. In the House of Lords, an amendment to the government’s data bill, asserting that licences to copyrighted material must be actively sought rather than taken for granted, was accepted. Ministers who have had their heads turned by the promise of new data centres and a seat at the AI table should reconsider their priorities and obligations. Big tech should have no more rights over the work of others than anybody else.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

First, finding an alternative to the use of prison-based remand; second, keeping non-violent criminals in a restrictive regime outside prison; third, serious study into recidivism, and finally, improving the literacy of those entering prison for the first time.For 20 years I was responsible for education provision in the five Lancashire prisons. It took me several years to persuade governors to include literacy tests in their initial assessment of new prisoners. The initial result showed that 35% of prisoners failed the literacy test, while among the adult population in general it was about 7%.This was a wake-up call, but unfortunately the prison regime was not sufficiently flexible to try to eliminate the problem. Today, we might have to add English as a second language. Questions to the justice minister might include: what is the literacy level of the current prison intake? How many prisoners are tested on leaving prison to check if their literacy level has improved?David SelbyDerby“A far less kneejerk approach to custodial sentencing, particularly in relation to more minor offences, would ease the intolerable pressure on the prison estate,” says your editorial. I agree. What about this? Any offence that merits up to 12 months’ custody should be served as a community order. Address the offending behaviour by making sure that the essentials are kept – or put – in place: accommodation, employment, treatment and relevant activities. We know that reoffending rates are lower if the pitch is between custody of up to 12 months or a community order.A community order can be made for up to three years, meaning longer-term protection for victims can be provided, such as exclusion zones, electronic tagging and curfews. Repeatedly breaking the order or committing further offences must result in the prison sentence. Prison needs to be at the end of the road, and not at the start. Rehabilitation is well worth the investment.Janet CarterRetired barrister, LeedsWhen will the government learn the lessons from its own experts? For a generation, the causal relationship between offending and social determinants have been at the core of work commissioned by theHome Officeand Ministry of Justice. This has had a negligible impact on policy. It is shameful that politicians and inspectorates failed to raise these issues, instead kowtowing to management by objective – the objective to be tougher on crime. This led to the unjustifiable increase in offenders recalled to prison for administrative reasons that had nothing to do with the level of risk.The one glimmer of hope was integrated offender management, which brought together justice and social welfare organisations. Only those hellbent on reoffending were sanctioned. This initiative was left to local areas to implement, and, despite good results, was discontinued when budgets were cut to fund the misguided privatisation of probation.Maybe Mr Gauke will recommend that dealing with crime is too important and complex a problem to be left to the justice system.Rob WakefieldRetired director ofoffendermanagementDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

The order that Barrot refers to is an intricate web of international agreements and cooperative practices set in place since the second world war. The United States has claimed leadership of this order, and did contribute to its creation. Sadly, however, the US has undermined this order from the beginning and, under the Trump administration, openly seeks to destroy it.Humanity created this order in response to painfully acquired lessons about power. We know that a competitive, “power-over” approach to world affairs creates instability and inflicts great suffering. Moreover, in a world of nuclear weapons, new technologies and ecological stresses, continued pursuit of power-over poses an existential threat to human civilisation. By contrast, the rules-based order calls for a collaborative, “power-with” approach. Using that approach, we can build global human security and nurture Earth’s interdependent life-support systems, allowing us to thrive for generations to come.Today, the advocates of power-over can appear immensely strong. They command large armies, economies and governance structures. Yet, the future they offer will inevitably lead to human suffering and degradation. To conceal this ugliness, they resort to deceit, coercion and the distortion of facts. They foster fear, anger and hate. By contrast, the advocates of power-with offer a future based on shared values and goals that would appeal to the great majority of humanity.Foreign minister Barrot offers us a pathway toward a world of power-with. The pathway begins by upholding the existing rules-based international order.Francecould provide a great service by working with other nations, and civil society globally, to build alliances that make the pathway a reality.Paula Gutlove and Gordon ThompsonInstitute for Resource and Security Studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USJean-Noël Barrot states: “In France, our moral compass is not guided by north or south, but by justice. We do not avert our eyes from any crisis or violation of international law ... Because France does not use double standards.” This statement caused me and a number of colleagues who work in international law to raise eyebrows. While I do agree with Jean-Noël Barrot that respect for international law is the source of division among states, and that double standards are a problem, it must be noted that France is part of the problem.To give just one example, when the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin, the president of a country that has not ratified the ICC’s Rome statute, France maintained that he should not enjoy immunity from arrest and that ICC member states have an obligation to transfer him to The Hague should he visit their territory, and was thereforecriticalwhen Mongolia failed to do so in September 2024.Barely two months later, in November 2024, when the ICC issued an arrest warrant against Benjamin Netanyahu, who is the head of government of a country that has not ratified the Rome statue, Francearguedthat he would enjoy immunity from arrest should he travel to France. The facts between the two are the same, and yet France proposes that the same rules should not apply. For many who work in international criminal justice and who want to see progress in this area of international law, this came as ahuge disappointment.While it is no secret that this area of international law is highly political, such double standards do not help achieve the goals of global justice and ending impunity for the commission of core crimes. Rather, they only feed criticisms that international criminal justice is a tool used by the powerful and their allies against the weak, and further add to global fragmentation.Dr Alexandra HoferAssistant professor in public international law, Utrecht University, NetherlandsExplore more on these topicsFranceEuropeInternational criminal courtBenjamin NetanyahuVladimir PutinlettersShareReuse this content"

The Premier League is rich, but there’s no jeopardy and no real sense of excellence, at least not on the pitchMon 24 Feb 2025 15.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareLadies and gentlemen we have now reached our cruising altitude. The pilot will be putting his feet up and drinking tiny cans of Sprite from here to the middle of May. Sit back, zone out. Stick on a bad film with Seth Rogen in it. You can even watch the football if you like. Just don’t expect much to happen for the next three months.So much for that excitingly bumpy, turbulence-fuelled Premier League season, all perky upstarts, crumbling certainties and unexpected shifts of altitude, which really did seem to be shaping up just a few short weeks ago. As of game weekend 26 andArsenal’s defeat against West Ham, followed byLiverpool strolling through Manchester City, the league has reached a stage of premature entropy.Let them eat fruit: Manchester United close staff canteen in latest cost-cuttingRead moreIt is incorrect to suggest that the title race is over. Or rather, it’s only half correct. The title race is over, barring some kind of black swan collapse, Arne Slot deciding this is the perfect moment to reel out his Jazz Odyssey tactics phase. But lots of other things are over, too. In fact, pretty much the whole shebang.We know who is going to win the league. We know who is going to get relegated (another note of dulling certainty: the same three teams who came up). We know who’s going to come second.Manchester Citywill surely also end up in the top four, with midweek football now safely off the schedule.Jeopardy, then. What have we got? Five teams going for two (probably) Champions League places. You can almost hear the broadcasters changing tack already. Come feast on that Big Fifth Place Energy. Welcome to Lower Court Judgment Day. Mid-Tier Repeat or Revenge. Almost-Super Almost‑Showdown Sunday. It is, just as a reminder, still February.Looking down the table one thing does stand out. Why aren’t these teams better? It is necessary to be vigilant here, to resist the temptation to decide everyone is In Crisis, everyone is bad, everyone is a failure because they’re not the best. The In-Crisis klaxon is like the service buzzer in a chain hamburger restaurant. It flashes when it’s your turn. And we will get to everyone in the end.But still, something isn’t quite right. ThePremier Leaguecontains six of the 10 richest clubs in the world, or indeedevergiven the constant rise in riches. And yet the question remains. Who is good here? Who is thrumming with rude health? Who is building a dynasty from the bottom up? Who is reinventing the tactical blueprint?View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola in despair on the touchline as Liverpool’s defeat of his Manchester City team all but confirmed the title will be heading for Anfield.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APWe’ve gotLiverpool. We have an encouragingly ambitious tier between third and eighth place. But we also haven’t had a proper three- or four-pronged title race for years. Very few teams out there seem happy or well placed on their journey. The league is rich. The league is the greatest show on earth. But there is also no real sense of excellence here, of fresh competitive peaks being crested, at least not on the pitch. Why has this happened? And is it ever going to stop?There is one obvious answer. The Premier League is a competition invented by money, for the benefit of money, and for the future dissemination of money as yet unguessed at. And money does not in itself make you good at football.What is a good team in professional sport? Something built out of hard choices, struggle, time, chemistry. Make one of these and you will naturally make money too. It becomes a virtuous cycle. But there is a sense in the league right now that nobody really remembers how to do this, or has the time; or even that it no longer really matters, such are the benefits of just being grandly so-so.Football teams are product. That argument has been won. Really good, coherent, captivating football teams are something else. And while capitalism is very good at generating volume and revenue, the things it isn’t so good at making include painstaking, high-quality objects of beauty.The obvious example is the current version ofChelsea. On a register of performance versus money spent there is a fair argument this is the most inept example of team building ever conceived. Treat your team like a talent-grooming fund. Build a portfolio of players while demonstrating only the most basic grasp of what talent looks like, or how capricious and brittle it is. This is what you end up with, the Band Aid chorus line trying to make an album.It is a grotesque model – but one that is at least a logical extension of the league it represents. Too much flux, too many choices, too little in the way of extreme, ruthless competence. The same scattergun commercial hunger has transformed Manchester United into the sporting equivalent of a nuclear plant accident. Scroll down the league and short-termism and poor, flighty choices are the norm.The response to the failure of short-term team-building has been the trend for “philosophy coaches”, jobbing Euro-dudes with a vision and a promise of some kind of quick-fix, self-levelling team‑substance. Give me five years of Alex Ferguson creating a culture, but do it in three months. But even this is hampered by greed. Trying to introduce new systems and patterns midseason because you have no off-season, just tours and revenue-raising exercises. This is like trying to learn French on the way to the exam.Leicester City thought it was a good idea to appoint Ruud van Nistelrooy, who has spent the past two months mooning about like a sad dying vampire in a mid-90s romantic fantasy film. West Ham have spent too long not seeming to know what they want to look like, or how to make people feel good, thrashing about in search of “identity”, stasis, calm pockets of air.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

David Moyes can staunch the pain.The new stadium represents hope. But nobody really knows for sure.It seems obvious one part ofLiverpool’s success this seasonis born out of simple stability, the merits of just not changing much, recognising what is already good.Arsenal will be castigated for failing to buy a No 9when they couldn’t find the right one for the right price. This is poor management of a squad. But it is at least an attempt to do the right thing, to maintain control, to build rather than snatch at a finished, functioning team.It seems clear that there is a relationship between the lack of really high-functioning teams and the general poverty of Premier League ownership and administration. Perhaps it isn’t such a mystery so few footballing chief executives have any kind of profile outside the industry. Football-facing tycoons seem to be their own class, too. AsGraham Potter once said of the Chelsea ownership: “They must be clever people, they’re billionaires.”View image in fullscreenArsenal stumbled against West Ham, and are berated for not signing a No 9, but at least they have attempted to build a team under Mikael Arteta.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesIs this true? Clever billionaires tend to be the ones you’ve never heard of. Whereas at times you get the feeling English football is just incredibly lucky to have lived through the years of endlessly booming broadcast rights, the tide that raises all ships. You can accidentally set fire to the sails, tear down the rigging. The product will protect you.At least, it has up to now. It is no secret the Premier League’s success has been toxic for aspects of the rest of the football world, ripping out talent and expertise, diminishing other leagues. The sense that the domestic league could also sabotage itself, disrupt its own competitive edge, is easily ignored by those who stand to benefit from its financial rewards in the short term.The way to preserve that core product is obvious enough: more, not less, regulation. The PSR regime may be unpopular with those who wish to hurl money at the wall, or distort the free market by harnessing the subsidies of a nation-state. But the rules have also given us the best of the league right now, that raft of peppy, well‑run clubs such as Bournemouth and Brighton who have managed to combine expertise and income into a coherent whole.More of the same would be one way of throwing a lightning bolt through a stagnant league. A cap on salaries, even more rigorous transfer spending rules, incentives to build and produce a team rather than conjure one out of the fire, with the aim always of invigorating competitive balance. Which is, after all, the one thing you need to keep people interested.For now the Premier League does seem to have found an unexpected solution to fixture overload, player fatigue and the dilution of the spectacle. Too many games? Just end the season as a contest in February and play out three months of semi-exhibition stuff. It should at the very least keep everyone fresh for the Super League.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolChelseaManchester CityFinancescommentShareReuse this content"

Non-playing staff there will be offered soup and bread.The news emerged before an all-staff meeting at Old Trafford’s Manchester Suite on Monday when, the Guardian understands, the club’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, confirmed the closure of the staff canteen and other key decisions, including confirmation that there will be more redundancies. No questions were taken at the briefing.Manchester United staff warned they could be sacked if they leak informationRead moreWhile he did not inform the hundreds of staff how many of them would lose their jobs, Berrada apologised for saying in September there would be no more cuts after Ratcliffe’s initial round of about 250. Afterwards employees received an email, just after 3pm, informing them the number of redundancies will be “150-200”. There are 900 members of staff.The staff canteen at Old Trafford, which usually opens from 11.30am to 1.30pm, is expected to be shut at the end of the week. Employees currently gain entry via a pass that allows free hot meals and tea and coffee, with some soft drinks charged for.Instead of lunch, free fruit will be available for those working at the stadium. Casual match-day employees will continue to receive a packed lunch. The club believe £1m will be saved by ending free lunches.On Monday afternoon, United announced a “transformation plan” that was outlined in a statement. “The transformation plan aims to return the club to profitability after five consecutive years of losses since 2019,” it said. “This will create a more solid financial platform from which the club can invest in men’s and women’s football success and improved infrastructure.“As part of these measures, the club anticipates that approximately 150-200 jobs may be made redundant, subject to a consultation process with employees.”Berrada added: “We deeply regret the impact on those affected colleagues. However, these hard choices are necessary to put the club back on a stable financial footing. We have lost money for the past five consecutive years. This cannot continue. Our two main priorities as a club are delivering success on the pitch for our fans and improving our facilities. We cannot invest in these objectives if we are continuously losing money.”At the meeting, Berrada referred to other club models that have leaner workforces and are successful on the pitch. Those also in attendance included Roger Bell, the chief financial officer, Annie Hale, the human resources director, and Collette Roche, the chief operating officer. When speaking Bell displayed a chart showing the club’s losses over recent years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England’s Test captain has chosen to focus on his fitness and his duties with the red ball, and Moeen has decided to retire from county cricket so he can grasp the opportunities offered by global franchise leagues.The competition has brought only bad luck to Stokes, who in five appearances has scored just 14 runs at an average of 3.50 and sustained one serious hamstring injury,while playing for Northern Superchargerslast August. That pulled muscle kept him out of all cricket for two months and, after a recurrence while playing for England in New Zealand late last year, he required surgery from which he is recovering.He also decided to skip the Indian Premier League this year to “look after my body”. When announcing that decision last November, he said: “It’s about looking at what I’ve got ahead and making the decision that I think is right for me to be able to prolong my career as long as possible.”Joe Root backs ‘brilliant leader’ Jos Buttler as England face crucial gameRead moreThe Hundred this year starts the day after England’s five-Test series against India concludes at the Oval, with the first fixture for the Superchargers – for whom Stokes still hopes to play in future seasons – coming against Welsh Fire at Headingley a further two days later. England’s Test side will by then be shifting focus to an Ashes series that starts in Australia in November.With memories fresh of his battle to return from his hamstring injury in time for England’s Test series in Pakistan last October – he eventually missed the first of their three games there and said that in his desire to recover “I did physically drain and ruin myself” – the 33-year-old has opted to build some space into his schedule.Moeen’s decision deprives Birmingham Phoenix of a local cricketing hero and the man who has captained them in all but two of their 32 Hundred games across four seasons. The 37-year-old has not ruled out returning to the team next year, but meanwhile he will take on a player-coach role at Warwickshire for the T20 Blast; while promising to make himself available for their group games, he will be involved only as a coach should they qualify for the quarter-finals in September.“This is a big decision for me and not one I’ve taken lightly,” Moeen said. “I’m still passionate about the game and want to play as much as I can. I still love playing. I still have passion for the game and I love being in a team environment. I also enjoy talking to players about cricket, the tactics, and I think that’ll help me move smoothly into coaching after my playing days are over.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He even joked that the only “great thing” the EU has done is to mandate that bottle tops should not be detachable.Uefa weighs up scrapping extra time for Champions League knockout roundsRead moreSpeakingto Delo, a newspaper from his home country of Slovenia, Ceferin began by praising his new expandedChampions Leagueformat, which he described as “perfect”. But he soon moved on to politics, and his perception that Europe is “losing out in every way” because of regulation and what he sees as moral grandstanding.“We should unite, but I don’t know if that is possible,” Ceferin says. “We should open up and stop regulating the market so much. No one, not even China, should be our enemy – and it isn’t – we should treat everyone as partners. We preach to others how they should behave, but we have a problem doing exactly that ourselves.“We are all fed up with political correctness. Here in the western world, freedom of speech no longer exists. You can no longer say what you think. On one hand, there are the rightwing populists who have a simple rhetoric – migrants are taking your jobs and engaging in crime, LGBT propaganda will make families nonexistent, they will destroy your children, and so on.“This is such simplistic populist rhetoric that anyone can understand it. On the other hand, almost all western mainstream politics (it is neither left- nor rightwing) and most of the mainstream media are addressing people from the intellectual and arrogant high ground.”Ceferin argued that, because “no one can say what they think any more, except standup comedians”, the counter-argument to rightwing populism is not being made. “Nobody talks to the people, nobody explains to them that people can love each other regardless of their sexual orientation, nobody explains to them that some people are uncomfortable in their own bodies, that migrants do indeed commit crimes, too, but they are punished like everyone else. Mainstream politics should ask itself what it is doing wrong to make all this happen. You cannot say to people to not talk about it any more.”He was also critical of “mainstream politics, especially by the left wing” in causingUefato abandon plans to reintroduce Russian teams to European youth competitions two years ago. “The media started attacking Uefa and everyone backed off, saying: ‘We would support the idea, but the governments won’t let us.’ In reality, they did not let the children socialise. Politics generates hatred and intolerance out of self-interest, while speaking out against it.”European leaders gathered on Monday in Kyiv to mark three years of thefull-scale invasion of Ukraineand passed a motion in the UN condemning Russian aggression.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also rejected reports that the Champions League final will be staged eventually in the US after a media rights deal with the US agency Relevent. “They have not discussed moving the Champions League finals to another continent,” he said. “I probably would have known if we had negotiated it.”As for the Champions League, in which 36 teams have competed in a single league stage this season, Ceferin declared himself pleased. “I only heard positive responses. I estimate that 99% of people are now satisfied with the renewed Champions League. The competition is even more unpredictable than before, nobody knew until the very last moment whether they would qualify. It’s a perfect success, and the Champions League ratings are excellent.”Explore more on these topicsUefaFootball politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Only in May will we know that answer for sure, but the scale of the celebrations from those associated with Leeds here perhaps told you everything you need to know.The popular song aimed in Leeds’ direction when things are going wrong is to decry that Daniel Farke’s side are falling apart. But here, when it mattered most, this team showed that they are anything but one that capitulates in the crucial moments.Sheffield United v Leeds United: Championship – liveRead moreIt looks increasingly like this club and their manager will again be a Premier League side next season. Last week, they dug deep at Elland Road to score twice late on andoverturn a losing position against Sunderland. That was monumental, but this was on another level and has ramifications for the whole promotion race, not just Leeds.Having fallen behind after a horrendous error from Illan Meslier, who somehow palmed the ball into his own goal, Leeds were arguably fortunate not to be further in arrears after being dominated by aSheffield Unitedside who, at that point, were heading top and about to end Leeds’ 15-game unbeaten league run.But having ridden out a storm, Leeds delivered when they needed to for the second Monday night in succession. If you had offered them a draw when Junior Firpo equalised with 18 minutes left, and a two-point lead at the top, maybe a Leeds team of years gone by would have taken it. But not this side, who are built to go to the very end.Ao Tanaka turned home a Joe Rothwell corner as injury time approached before Joël Piroe’s long-range strike turned the promotion picture on its head. Just 18 minutes earlier, Sheffield United were going top, and Leeds had just a four-point cushion to third-placed Burnley. Now, that gap is seven, and the Blades are only two clear of Scott Parker’s side. It was a seismic evening.View image in fullscreenTyrese Campbell (23) looks on as Illan Meslier somehow manages to palm his header over the line after it had hit a post.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA“It’s a priceless three points,” Farke said. “It was the worst possible start, but the reaction they showed was outstanding. We want to make sure we keep winning points and end in the best possible position. I’m very proud of the boys.”The one blot on the night: the news that their captain, Ethan Ampadu, will require knee surgery after missing this game.While Farke, his staff and his players were able to bask in the celebrations with the travelling Leeds support at full time, the mood was markedly different for Chris Wilder. His team fully deserved to lead when Meslier produced a horrific piece of goalkeeping, turning the ball in after Tyrese Campbell had headed against the right-hand post from barely a foot out.They could, and perhaps should, have gone further ahead. And you did wonder whether their profligacy would come back to haunt them against this Leeds side. That emphatically proved to be the case and with a trip to Burnley still to come, Sheffield United may now have to seal their own Premier League return the hard way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We had to produce a top performance and we just fell a little bit short.”Farke, who was serving a touchline ban following his third yellow card of the season, saw his substitutes be instrumental in transforming this pulsating Yorkshire derby, spearheaded by Rothwell’s introduction in the 58th minute. The 30-year-old changed the outcome of the game and added real energy to Leeds’ midfield. He was involved in the equaliser too, as Dan James’s cross was met by a superb header from Firpo.And as the final minutes approached, only one side looked like winning. It was a stark contrast to most of the first half, with the hosts well on top, but after Michael Cooper produced a wonderful save to deny Willy Gnonto, he was powerless to prevent Tanaka from heading home at the far post after Rothwell’s corner had been knocked down by Firpo.Leeds then sealed matters as Piroe brilliantly struck from long range to spark wild scenes. It was Farke’s German counterpart, Jürgen Klopp, who coined the term mentality monsters to describe his great Liverpool side. It is a characteristic you can put against a team who look increasingly certain to be heading back to the Premier League next season.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Crisis? What crisis? It was not so long ago that the Rugby Football Union was wringing its hands at the dearth of tightheads across the country but quietly, under the radar, Stuart has emerged as England’s most consistent, reliable performer.During Steve Borthwick’s first Six Nations in charge two years ago, he lamented that England were “not good at anything” and raised particular concern over the scrum, an area in which they had ranked last of all tier-one nations over the previous 12 months. Fast-forward to now and, under the tutelage of Tom Harrison, England’s scrum has developed into both a solid platform and a weapon they can employ to impressive effect.RFU adds extra England Test and leaves Borthwick without warm-weather campRead moreOn Saturday, Stuart was perhaps England’s best player, leading the rearguard action even when he lost a boot for a lengthy defensive set and as part of a scrum that put the squeeze on Scotland. “It has been a big step forward for us,” Stuart says.“Over the past few years we’d get penalties here and there but we’d also give away … you’d maybe finish a game that’s four penalties to five, you’d want to get 3-0, that’s a better stat, being clean in Test rugby.“You come into England camp, there are only going to be a certain amount of people who play. The scrum is going to be one of the most combative places and it’s really competitive but you have to know that you’re training for everyone to get better, not trying to pop someone out the top or collapse it.“Sometimes you’re going to get drilled in the scrum but you’ve got to take your medicine rather than collapse it for the good of the team. It’s been about training clean, I think we got payoff from that in November; being really clean, applying pressure and being more dominant on our own ball.”Stuart has 48 caps and barring injury will bring up his half-century when England conclude their campaign against Wales. Do not be surprised if his 51st Test appearance comes on theBritish & Irish Lionstour of Australia – Andy Farrell, the Lions head coach, will have been impressed by what he has seen lately. Stuart made his debut in the 2020 Six Nations, and his first start later that year. But for much of his Test career he was behind Kyle Sinckler or Dan Cole, and the previous time England won the Calcutta Cup,at Murrayfield in 2020, he was an unused replacement.“That was my firstSix Nationsand the storm,” the 28-year-old prop says. “My mum and girlfriend were not happy. They came up, I didn’t come off the bench and then we get on a plane but they were stuck in Edinburgh because of the storm. They have refused to go back up since.”View image in fullscreenWill Stuart of Bath and England: ‘I just do my job well, consistently well, and keep my head below the parapet where you can’t get shot.’Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersStuart has appeared as a replacement 26 times but started England’s past nine Tests, a permanent fixture in a rock-solid scrum and perhaps the best compliment he could be paid is that Borthwick no longer feels the need to keep the 37-year-old Cole on call. Stuart is now among the first names on the teamsheet, backed up by Joe Heyes, while the 20-year-old Asher Opoku-Fordjour of Sale continues to learn his trade as part of the wider squad. Gloucester’s Afo Fasogbon and Billy Sela have been earmarked for bright futures too, but for now Stuart is England’s cornerstone, performing admirably until that golden generation matures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Obviously no one is really going to care if I’m throwing 30‑metre skip passes if I’m getting drilled in the scrum. So I just do my job well, consistently well, and keep my head below the parapet where you can’t get shot.”It is worth pointing out that Stuart did come up with a fine looping pass in the buildup to an Ollie Sleightholme tryagainst Japan in the autumnbut it is doing his day job well that most pleases him.It helps that at Bath, Stuart is one of three Test tightheads along with South Africa’s Thomas du Toit – who plays both sides of the scrum – and Wales’s Archie Griffin while Sela is waiting in the wings. “I’d say, because every day I’m scrummaging against Beno [Obano] or Thomas at loosehead and they’re world class, they’re so hard to scrummage against so I’ve had to get better while being there,” Stuart says. “Our tighthead group is unbelievable, we’ve got so many good lads, it’s a great group to be part of.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Liverpool had drawn four of their previous eight games which had created an opening. Had Arsenal beaten West Ham and Liverpool lost at Manchester City this weekend, the title would have been in Arsenal’s hands, at least to the extent that they would have won it if they had won every game they had remaining this season, including away at Liverpool. But, afterArsenal limped to a 1-0 defeat, Liverpool produced their best performance in weeksto win 2-0. Thegap is 11 pointsand, even though Arsenal have a game in hand, it’s very hard to imagine either Liverpool dropping sufficient points or Arsenal winning enough for that to be overturned.Arteta described himself as “very, very angry” after his side’s defeat, admitting they were “nowhere near the levels that we have to hit to have the opportunity to win the Premier League”. But there’s been an element of that all season. This was only Arsenal’s third league defeat of the campaign, but there has been something distinctly underwhelming about them. Too many points have been frittered too cheaply. Too often they have failed to grasp chances. And too often ill-discipline has let them down.Myles Lewis-Skelly’s red card on Saturday was the fifthArsenalhave collected this season. That’s not a sign, as a significant proportion of Arsenal’s support would insist, of referees being against them but of their players repeatedly committing needless offences. Sure, other teams have got away with kicking the ball away, but the best way not to get a second yellow card for kicking the ball away is a) not to get a first yellow card; and b) not to kick the ball away. Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard were both dismissed for the most pointless offence and in both games, at home to Brighton and away at Manchester City, wins became draws.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreWilliam Saliba was sent off as they lost 2-0 at Bournemouth. Although Lewis-Skelly’s red at Wolves was overturned – generously, frankly, given he kicked Matt Doherty several feet from the ball – he was sent off again on Saturday, denying a goalscoring opportunity with a crude lunge on Mohammed Kudus. That’s 10 points gone in games Arsenal finished with 10 men: 10 extra points would have Arsenal a point behindLiverpoolwith a game in hand.Where Arsenal have been unfortunate is with injuries: to lose Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus simultaneously would be extremely hard for any squad to deal with. Could they perhaps have brought in a striker last summer rather than bolstering their midfield and backline? Certainly the loan signing of Raheem Sterling hasn’t worked.But it’s also true that Arsenal are not a side that handles adversity well. They get down on themselves, lose faith too easily. When Martin Odegaard was injured earlier in the season, there was a sense that in the absence of their highly gifted captain, they no longer believed great things were possible. Again and again this season, there has been a sense of acquiescence in disappointment: not only on Saturday, but also in the defeat at Bournemouth, in the draws to home to Everton and Aston Villa and away to Fulham and Brighton.They lack a certain edge, the capacity to get the job done even in unfavourable circumstance, the hardness of champions. Liverpool, by contrast, have that quality in abundance. There haven’t been many games this season when they have obliterated their opponents, only a handful of indelible performances, but they are the masters of doing enough, playing within themselves, getting over the line. And they have, in Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk, the best attacking player and the best defensive player in the league, which really does help.Sunday was a consummate performance. The statistics may show that Liverpool had only 34% possession and only eight chances to City’s 16 (Liverpool won the xG 0.7-0.6) but once Salah had put them ahead from a well-worked corner after 14 minutes, a win for Arne Slot’s team seemed inevitable. It was their seventh 2-0 league win of the season; a margin that typifies their ability to win comfortably without overextending themselves, the scoreline of champions.Even if Arsenal can somehow find an inner resolve and rally to win every Premier League game until the end of the season – although their focus will surely now shift to the Champions League – they could only get to 89 points. That means 26 points from their final 11 games guarantees the title for Liverpool. Realistically, they are not likely to need anywhere near that figure and should have their 20th championship, pulling them level with Manchester United, wrapped up long before they play Arsenal at Anfield in May.On this dayView image in fullscreenWilliam Garbutt first came to Genoa to work on the docks.Photograph: Luca Reina Mafaraci/Getty Images/iStockphotoWilliam Garbutt was one of the great pioneers of football, his story typical of those early 20th-century British men who set off for Europe full of fine intentions only to find politics and history overwhelming them. Garbutt was born in Hazel Grove near Stockport in 1883 and played as an outside right for Reading, Woolwich Arsenal and Blackburn Rovers. Aged 29, he went to Genoa to work in the docks, but soon found himself appointed as the first manager in Italian football, leading the team to the northern championship in 1913. When war was declared, he was sent to the front in France.He returned to Genoa and, introducing such progressive ideas as structured warm-ups, hot showers and signing players from other clubs, led them to back-to-back national titles in 1923 and 1924. He left the club in 1927 and worked for Roma, Napoli, Athletic of Bilbao and Milan before rejoining Genoa in 1937. When the second world war broke out, he fled, and was separated from his daughter. His wife died in an Allied air raid and, although he was later reunited with his daughter, the sense was that he never quite recovered. He returned to the UK in 1951 and died in Leamington Spa on 24 February 1964.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

The 2024 edition,released last month, was no exception: the likes of three-time World Surf League champion John John Florence, surf star Kelly Slater and US prodigy Caity Simmers all made the cut.But for those watching closely, it was another name that stood out in the 24-wave edit. Featuring not once but twice was Milla Brown, a 17-year-old from the northern beaches of Sydney. Brown has not yet graduated high school but her name is suddenly in illustrious company.View image in fullscreenBrown says she has been surfing since the age of two.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianSpeaking to Guardian Australia, Brown is quick to downplay the achievement. “It’s definitely been a goal of mine to get a bit more recognised, for the past year now,” she says. “But I don’t know, I just went on a couple trips hoping to get some good waves, and I ended up getting some really good waves.”Despite Brown’s modesty, the clips were all the more noteworthy for demonstrating her prowess in two areas at the frontier of women’s professional surfing. A decade ago, it was unusual to see airs being attempted in women’s competition; now an emerging generation are matching their male counterparts in aerial ability. And, until recently, women’s events were rarely held at heavy, barrelling waves – the women’s WSL competed at Pipeline, in Hawaii,for the first time in 2020, and returned to Tahiti a season later after a near two-decade hiatus.“It’s pretty cool, because it’s starting to become a pretty normal thing now for girls to be doing big airs and getting big tubes,” Brown says. “It’s super cool that WSL is backing that by putting the girls out at Teahupo’o [in Tahiti] and Cloudbreak [in Fiji], so they can prove to everyone that it is possible for girls to do it too.”View image in fullscreenBrown won a high-profile, invite-only competition at a remote break in Micronesia last week.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianTogether with Simmers, who won her first WSL crown last year, the Australian prodigy Sierra Kerr and Canada’s Erin Brooks, who is making her WSL debut this season, Brown is part of an exciting new generation of female surfing talent (the quartet are all under 20). “I definitely get pushed a lot by girls like Sierra Kerr and Caty Simmers and stuff,” Brown says. “It’s definitely cool to be leading that charge alongside some amazing female surfers.”Brown, who is also a talented skateboarder, having spent a brief stint with Australia’s Olympic development squad, has been surfing since she was two. Or, as she put it more bluntly in the opening toher breakthrough edit, “straight outta the fucking womb”. Brown’s father surfed and her older sister started surfing. “I didn’t want her to be doing something that I wasn’t,” she says.View image in fullscreenBrown signs an autograph for a young girl during her photoshoot.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianCompeting in under-12 and under-14 events, Brown found herself coming up short. “I was just getting smoked by everyone else,” she says. Then, a few years ago, she won an under-16 competition. Soon, she was state champion for her age. Last year Brown won the national under-18 title.Stephanie Gilmore extends break from World Surf League to ‘focus on healing’Read moreShe has begun to try her hand at the difficult qualification pathway to the WSL – competing in a handful of third-tier, qualifying series events. But the Australian insists she is in no hurry to reach surfing’s top table. “Definitely this year I’m going to focus on free surfing, putting out a good film, getting good clips,” she says. “The year after, I guess I’ll see what I’m thinking of doing – whether I want to try [to] qualify for the tour or not.” Last week it was announced that Brown had won a high-profile, invite-only competition, National Selection Surf, at a remote break in Micronesia.While some elite surfers have always opted to shun the competitive pathway, it has become increasingly normalised for surfers to earn a living without the pressure of the WSL calendar. “It’s definitely possible just to free surf, even forever – you don’t have to do the tour thing,” Brown says. “You can make a living out of that and get way better waves than anyone on tour.” Not that the teenager is ruling out a tilt at the WSL. “I definitely enjoy the competitive side,” she adds.View image in fullscreen‘I reckon definitely just let your surfing do the talking.’Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianBrown comes of age at a time of rapid advancement towards gender equality in surfing. In 2019 the WSL introduced equal prize money and in 2022 the governing body consolidated the men’s and women’s tours into an integrated competition. The world’s best now compete in the same location, in the same window, at every competition.

It’s driven major eyeballs on women’s surfing, which is pretty cool.”Remembering Kevin Brennan: teenage master of Bondi’s waves but a drug-fuelled disaster on landRead moreSurfing has long harboureda misogynist undertone; women’s competitive surfing was overlooked and underfunded for decades, with female surfers valued for their looks rather than their tube-riding. In an interview with Stab last year, Brown made a pointed comment about the industry’s past and lingering present. “No, I don’t post on TikTok,”she said. “I can’t deal with the dancing chicks and guys thinking they’re really hot, doing all the selfie stuff.”She tells Guardian Australia: “I reckon definitely just let your surfing do the talking. Not that long ago, women’s surfing contracts would be mainly for modelling and bikinis. Of course if you want to do that, it’s completely fine. But now you have a choice. Now people are just getting sponsored for the surfing, which is super cool to see.”That evolution is in large part thanks to decades of campaigning by pioneering female surfers. Brown is quick to pay tribute to those who came before her. “I’m super grateful for those that turned women’s surfing into the sport it is today,” she says. “Back then equal prize money didn’t feel realistic, but [those pioneers] worked super hard for girls’ surfing. People like that are pretty special; they’re the reason why girls surfing is a thing today.”View image in fullscreenBrown still juggles school with her surfing exploits.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianWith her aerial ability and fearless tube-riding, Brown seems destined for big things – whether or not she pursues a career in the WSL. She has a more immediate priority, though; at 17, Brown has a year and a half of high school remaining. She is home-schooled, which the teenager says makes it easier to juggle (Brown has spent her summer holidays surfing in Micronesia). “It’s still hard, to do school and surf at the same time,” she admits.A tilt at the WSL, gender equality in surfing, high school exams – Brown has a lot on her mind. But the teenager says that, when she finds herself inside a cavernous barrel, she only has one thought: “Don’t fall.”Explore more on these topicsSurfingAustralia sportinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Although they represent only a third of that group, they were the focus of 84% of such conservation projects and received 86% of the funding.Meanwhile mammals such as rodents, bats, kangaroos and wallabies remained severely underfunded, despite being considered endangered.View image in fullscreenAmphibians collected less than 2.8% of funding for vertebrates.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“Nearly 94% of species identified as threatened, and thus at direct risk of extinction, received no support,” said Benoit Guénard, the lead author of the study. “Protecting this neglected majority, which plays a myriad of roles in ecosystems and represents unique evolutionary strategies, is fundamental if our common goal is to preserve biodiversity.”Alice Hughes, a coordinating lead author of the research, said: “The sad reality is that our perception of ‘what is threatened’ is often limited, and so a few large mammal species may receive more funding than the near-12,000 species of reptile combined.”“Not only does this limit our ability to implement protective measures, but it closes opportunities to researchers. I have lost count of the number of times collaborators have switched taxa [organism populations] purely because theirs was difficult to fund. This leads to a chicken and egg situation – some of the groups with the highest rates of recent extinction, like freshwater snails, have the most outdated assessments.”View image in fullscreenFungi and algae received less than 0.2% of conservation funding.Photograph: Shaiith/Getty ImagesThe study, led by Guénard and colleagues at the University of Hong Kong, analysed 14,566 conservation projects spanning a 25-year period between 1992 and 2016.A comparison of the amount of funding per species was drawn against each species’ status in the International Union forConservationof Nature’s red list of threatened species, which gives an assessment on animal extinction risk levels.“We are in the midst of a global species extinction crisis,” said research author Bayden Russell. “The number of threatened species is increasing at an unprecedented rate across a wide range of groups and regions globally.”A ‘recipe for extinction’: can the US’s envied nature protections survive Trump and his ‘God squad’?Read more“We need to change how we think about conservation funding. The community needs to be educated about the value of biodiversity and protecting species that are under threat, not just those that we have an affinity to.”The research highlighted a larger funding imbalance than had previously been identified, and found that despite their importance to ecosystems, the bias against invertebrates could be up to 40% higher than previously reported.The majority of all projects (57%) and funding (53%) also protected single species, instead of focusing on multiple creatures.“Governments, in particular those which represent the main pool of funding, need to follow a more rigorous and scientifically-driven approach in conservation funding,” said Guénard. “Further global cooperation to study and protect species-rich groups, as well as share information on conservation investments, is also urgently needed.”Invertebrate of the year 2025The Guardian is asking readers to nominate species for the second annual invertebrate of the year competition.Read more about it and make your suggestions hereor by via the form below.Send us your nominated speciesYou can tell us which species you would like to nominate by filling in the form below.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Instead, the conservative lead candidateFriedrich Merzposted on social media that it would be led by “someone who understands that economic policy is more than being a representative for heat pumps”.Climate action barely featured on the campaign trail before Germany’s federal elections on Sunday – except when right-leaning parties used it to swipe at the Greens. Merz’s jab was at the tamer end of attacks aimed at the Green party candidate, Robert Habeck, the economy and climate minister who pushed through an unpopular law to promote clean heating, but is a sign of how far the political conversation around climate action has shifted.Centre-right and far-right politicians have accused the Greens of turning Germany into an “eco-dictatorship” for policies that limit the burning of fossil fuels or require the public to change their behaviour. In a fiery speech the day before the election, Merz said he would do politics “for the majority who can think straight, and who also have all their marbles … and not for any green and leftwing nutcases”. Merz later said he was referring specifically to anti-rightwing protesters.Greens’ vote share by constituencyIt is a far cry from the 2021 election, in which all parties bar the far-right AfD were keen to brandish their climate credentials by committing to cleaning up Germany’s economy by the middle of the century and keeping the planet from heating 1.5C (2.7F) above preindustrial levels.By some measures, the Greens have survived a shift in German climate discourse that climate activists call a “witch-hunt”. They had a smaller drop in vote share than their former coalition partners, the market-liberal FDP and the centre-left SPD, despite years of political bashing and a decrease in public interest in climate action. They also lost fewer votes on Sunday than they did at the European elections last year, falling slightly from 15% to 12%.Yet the result, which is likely to leave the Greens excluded from a future coalition, is further evidence that the green wave that sweptEuropea few years ago was an outlier, rather than the new normal. Greens have been kicked out of government in Austria, Belgium and Ireland in recent months, echoing a recent trend of incumbents of all political stripes being punished at the polls. In Germany, young voters in particular abandoned the party in large numbers for the resurgent Die Linke (the Left), which won 1.2 million voters from the Greens and SPD.Greens vote change 2025 vs 2021On some counts, Die Linke’s climate policy is more ambitious than that of the Greens. The party wants Germany to reach climate neutrality by 2035 – in line with demands from activists such as Fridays for Future – and it emphasises the need for fairness in the energy transition. Snap analyses suggest its unexpected success was driven by targeting young progressives and running a highly successful social media campaign.“The Left focused on a progressive campaign centred around their core issues like rising rents and the high cost of living,” said Jessica Haak, a political scientist at the University of Hamburg. “This has also contributed to their relatively strong performance in urban centres, where the Greens typically receive substantial support.“In contrast, the Greens adopted a more moderate, centrist stance – especially regarding migration issues – which has sparked internal criticism, particularly from the party’s left wing.”Although climate played only a minor role in voting decisions, the outcome looks likely to slow the speed of Germany’s energy transition. The AfD, which surged into second place with 21% of the vote, openly denies the climate crisis. It has railed against other parties for following a “Left-Green” ideological agenda and its co-leader, Alice Weidel, recently described wind turbines as “windmills of shame”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They have attacked the Greens heavily for efforts to phase out gas boilers and combustion engine cars, or reduce pollution on farms, and blamed them for the country’s economic struggles.At a meeting in Berlin last month, the German conservatives drove a push from the centre-right European People’s party to rip up green finance laws and water down farming rules as part of their opposition to “excessive regulation and bureaucracy”.The push to weaken climate and energy policy in the name of competitiveness could run afoul of Europe’s efforts to increase its independence from Russia, China and – as Merz said in an election debate on Sunday – the US.Manon Dufour, head of the Brussels branch of climate thinktank E3G, said climate action would be a “core pillar” of any credible security and resilience strategy. She said: “Germany can act as an engine for Europe, helping forge a path towards security and resilience. It can also act as a brake, bringing it to a standstill.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzGreen politicsClimate crisisEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

The company previously hinted on a call with analysts that it could drop the targets. It missed its 2024 target of $40.9bn in underlying profits.At an investor day in London on Wednesday, the company is likely to announce plans to divest assets and cut other low-carbon investments to reduce debt and increase returns, under mounting pressure from shareholders.BP’s shares have fared worse than rivals in recent years and investors have become concerned about the 120-year-old company’s direction. The stock has lost almost a quarter of its market value in the past two years.Two weeks ago, Auchincloss promised to“fundamentally reset” BP’s strategyas it reported a sharp slump in 2024 profits to $8.9bn, from $14bn the year before.This came only days after Elliott Management, a prominent activist investor,reportedly built up a sizeable stakeof about 5% of BP’s shares.The New York-based hedge fund is expected to use its influence as a leading shareholder to demand sweeping changes, including a boardroom cull and a potential breakup of the company.The company has already scaled back its target to reduce oil and gas output – set by Auchincloss’s predecessor Bernard Looney – by the end of the decade. In 2020, the last time it presented a comprehensive strategy update, it aimed for a 40% reduction, but changed this to a 25% reduction in 2023, and is expected to reduce it further on Wednesday.BP declined to comment on what it described as speculation in the run-up to the investor day. The event, originally planned to take place in New York on 11 February, was delayed and will be held in London because Auchincloss is recovering from a medical procedure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re talking about 20-25 times more fires than … [the] peaceful average of the previous 10 years. And that’s particularly … to do with the very dry circumstances, particularly in the east of Ukraine, where the war zone is, combined with heatwaves.”In those circumstances, with campfires made by soldiers and the ignition of drones and other ammunition, combined with there being no chance to deploy firefighters, small fires “escalate into bigger and bigger ones and basically rage on uncontrolled”, De Klerk said.“This is also worrying because these forests are carbon sinks. They store carbon everywhere, worldwide, and if they … go up in flames, [for] the forest to grow back and to take back that CO2into the soil again, to the trees, takes 40-60 years, depending on what tree.”De Klerk, who has worked on climate emissions analysis for two and a half decades, started investigating the climate impact of the war in Ukraine soon after the invasion on 24 February 2022.For the latest report, he and colleagues combined the emissions from fires with emissions from warfare, buildings reconstruction, damage to energy infrastructure, refugee movement and civil aviation displacement to estimate greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 229.7m tonnes of CO2since the war began.The warfare itself – taking in the emissions from tanks, warplanes, fortification construction, exploding ordnance and so on – has contributed the most to the climate impact, accounting for 82.1 mtCO2e, 36% of the total, followed by reconstruction, which researchers estimated at 62.2 mtCO2e, 27% of the total.“In the first 12 months, reconstruction led to the most emissions due to the fact that most of the damage to civilian infrastructure (buildings, hospital, roads etc) happened in the first weeks/months of the war. The rate of damage (and hence emissions) slowed down in the second and third year due to static frontlines,” De Klerk said.“Warfare is almost linear over the years as fossil fuel use is the major contributor to warfare emissions and rather constant. Another contributor, ammunition use, has varied over the months but has a much smaller impact on total warfare emissions.“Energy infrastructure emissions were very much impacted by the one-offNord Stream eventin September 2022. The damage to local infrastructure in the second and third 12-month period therefore did not translate into significant growth of the total.”Civil aviation emissions, which included extra emissions as a result of aircraft having to avoid the war zone, were mostly linear with time, and emissions from refugee movements also mainly occurred in the first year of the conflict, De Klerk said.He and his collaborators pulled together their findings from a range of sources including official Ukrainian government data on the destruction of civilian infrastructure, FlightRadar records of civilian aircraft movements, and satellite data on the extent of wildfires across the conflict zones.It was the military emissions data that was the most uncertain, he said, “because the militaries are not willing to share information”. For those figures, De Klerk and his team used proxy values for the amount of fossil fuel used by the average soldier and data they were able to scrape together on fuel shipments fromRussiato the frontlines.De Klerk said he had already started broadening his investigations beyond the Ukraine war. He said: “These conflicts and these wars – it’s not only Ukraine but it’s also Israel, and what we’re seeing happening between the US and China – mean that investment in the military is steeply going up, and they are responsible for about 5.5% of world emissions – the military themselves and the military industry.“But if we’re going from 2% to 5% spending [on the military] then probably these emissions will double at least … At some point that 5.5% will become 10%, will become 20%. Just imagine what an F-35 uses in kerosene.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Patients have told doctors about side-effects including an inability to use their legs, other mobility problems, fatigue, pain and sudden weight gain.It is unclear how widespread the adverse reactions to Tyruko are. NHS England said the problem has only been seen at the London hospital. However, one of the patients there claimed to know of people with MS being treated at 15 other hospitals in England who have experienced similar setbacks to their health after being moved on to Tyruko after sometimes years taking Tysabri.Problems have arisen since NHS England began moving patients across the country with very active relapsing remitting MS from Tysabri on to Tyruko, a “biosimilar” drug, last April. A biosimilar is a version of a drug that has fallen out of patent, allowing other pharmaceutical firms to legally make a medicine that is as safe and effective as the original but on average 72% cheaper.NHS England hopes to save £1bn over the next five years by expanding its use of off-patent drugs for a range of conditions, including MS. It spends £17bn a year on medicines.The side-effects from Tyruko are causing so much concern within the health service that NHS England is in discussion with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) about what to do.The outcome will be eagerly awaited by MS patients and charities as well as specialists in the disease. Around half of the NHS’s network of hospitals which treat those with MS are already taking part in NHS England’s rollout of switching those on Tysabri on to Tyruko instead.A spokesperson for Sandoz said: “Patient safety is our first priority. We are seeking to understand the situation at Imperial healthcare NHS trust, which appears to contrast with the experience of patients at other UK hospitals. We believe it’s premature to draw conclusions at this point. We continue to work with the NHS and regulatory authorities to resolve this.”They added that “Tysabri and Tyruko are considered interchangeable by the MHRA, which has determined that there are no meaningful differences between the two versions”.Before the switchover began, Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, which runs Charing Cross, had 345 patients on Tysabri – the largest number in the UK. It began giving them Tyruko instead last May. Doctors there expected to see some mild, short-term side-effects as a result of the switchover, as had happened with the introduction of previous biosimilars.But around half their patients reported “continuing and significant side-effects that worsened over some months, which was not expected”. They have now all been switched back on to Tysabri.In a letter it sent to MS patients in December, Imperial said: “Clinicians did expect some patients to report side-effects but only relatively mild ones that resolved after a short period.“However, a number of our patients reported a continuing worsening of their side-effects and/or their MS symptoms following their switch to Tyruko.” All had their treatment reviewed by a doctor or MS clinical nurse specialist.Drugs expert Dr Andrew Hill, a research fellow in the pharmacology department at Liverpool university, said: “There should be an investigation into why these side-effects are seen, and whether they resolve for people who switch back to the branded formulation.”Any inquiry should look at whether adverse reactions to Tyruko had been seen in other countries, he added.An NHS spokesperson said: “We understand that reports of significant side-effects have been focused on patient experience at one trust.“We are currently in discussions with the MHRA and the Department of Health and Social Care to determine what, if any, steps could be taken by MS centres across the country following the reported experiences of patients under the care of Imperial healthcare NHS trust.”MS groups said they were aware of the adverse reactions but suggested that only small numbers of patients are affected.“We are aware of a handful of people who have experienced significant symptoms following the switch,” the Multiple Sclerosis Trust said. But the fact that the patients involved have highly active MS “means their MS may be more difficult to manage, and new symptoms may be a common element of their diagnosis”.Laura Thomas, head of policy at the MS Society, said: “Some people have told our MS helpline they’ve started experiencing side-effects since switching from Tysabri to Tyruko, and some have told us they’re unsure if Tyruko is as effective. However, there are many others who haven’t reported any issues at all.”Explore more on these topicsMultiple sclerosisNHSPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Clifford began working as Starmer’s AI adviser last year, having also advised his predecessor, Rishi Sunak.As an investor in technology stocks, he holds shares in dozens of companies in the AI sector, including many British startups. He is also the chair of Entrepreneur First, an investment firm he set up, which has holdings in more than 100 companies of its own.The government announced on Monday, however, that Clifford had sold all his shares in Faculty AI, the strategy company which has worked closely with the government on AI safety, the NHS and education.Downing Street defended Clifford, saying he had stuck to government disclosure rules since taking up his role.The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “He has followed the process … There is a process on appointment where you declare all of your interests, you work through necessary mitigations to manage any interests.”Sources have told the Guardian that Clifford has agreed not to buy or sell any of the companies he part-owns while working for the government, or to be involved in decisions on new investments made by Entrepreneur First.In the coming weeks, ministers will have to decide how easy they want it to be for AI companies to access creative content to build their models. The government has said it wants such content to be available by default, with an option to opt out of any such arrangement. But industry figures including John have argued it should instead be an opt-in system.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)LabourKeir StarmerComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

The judge told him he would serve 40% of the term in jail and the rest on licence.Ikram said: “You were out drunk in the early hours. The attack was unprovoked. Being in drink is no excuse and as a member of parliament, you could reasonably expect robust challenge from constituents and members of the public.“You continued the attack whilst the victim was on the ground. This incident may well not have come to an end had the bystander not intervened. Your conduct would have had impact on others watching on. You continued to rant as you left.“Your reference to being a member of parliament in the aftermath brings negative impact to the office you are privileged to hold. Your profile and position of power as a servant of the people ought to be a role model to others. That is something you have to be mindful of in all that you do.”The conviction could pave the way for a byelection in Amesbury’s constituency. He won his seat at the last general election 235 days ago.The court heard Amesbury had been drinking before he arrived at a taxi rank, where Fellows approached him to remonstrate about a bridge closure in the town.Footage showed Amesbury punching Fellows to the head, knocking him to the ground, then following him on to the road and starting to punch him again, at least five times.He was then heard saying: “You won’t threaten your MP again will you, fucking soft lad.”The sentence was met with apparent shock in the courtroom. Richard Derby, representing Amesbury, asked the judge: “Is that an immediate sentence?” The judge nodded, replied “yes” and left the courtroom.Derby then requested the judge come back into court as he wished to make an application for bail for Amesbury, pending an appeal against his sentence. Ikram returned to court, sat down, paused briefly and said: “Application refused.”A byelection would be triggered if Amesbury resigns as MP. As Amesbury’s sentence is less than a year, he is allowed to continue as an independent MP during any appeals he might make, but if those appeals are unsuccessful he would then be subject to a recall petition.The petition would be open for six weeks and 10% of voters in his constituency would need to sign it to remove Amesbury as MP. If the threshold is met, it would trigger a byelection.The Conservative party co-chair Nigel Huddleston called for Amesbury to resign. “It is right that Mike Amesbury MP has pleaded guilty for his inappropriate actions,”he said on X.“The residents of Runcorn and Helsby deserve an MP who is able to stand up for them in parliament. Mike Amesbury should do the right thing and resign.”A Labour party spokesperson said: “The Labour party took swift action following Mike Amesbury’s completely unacceptable actions and he is no longer a Labour MP or a member of the Labour party. It is right that Mr Amesbury pleaded guilty and has now been sentenced.“Local residents in the Runcorn and Helsby constituency deserved better and we look forward to them getting the representation they deserve in the future with a new Labour MP.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeCheshireLabourEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Critical work will continue but some projects will need to be slowed down, paused, or stopped. This will impact parts of our supply chain.”Hutton told employees at the site – which employs more than 10,000 people – that all areas of the business will be affected and spending reviewed.It is understood that internal calculations had forecast that at least £3.1bn would be needed to meet Sellafield’s spending requirements next year, when accounting for rising costs. The site was awarded £2.8bn for the current financial year.The public spending watchdog has said the ultimate cost of cleaning up Sellafield is expected to rise to £136bn, causingtensions with the Treasuryas the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, attempts to tighten public spending and spur growth.In 2023, the Guardian’sNuclear Leaksinvestigation revealed a string of safety concerns at the site –from issues with alarm systems to problems staffing safety roles at its toxic ponds– as well as cybersecurity failings, radioactive contamination and allegations of a toxic workplace culture.View image in fullscreenSellafield is home to the world’s largest store of plutonium.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesHutton has not told staff which projects could be paused or stopped at the site, which covers two square miles and hundreds of buildings. Staff carry out a range of work from painstakingly emptying the toxic ponds to building new facilities to house nuclear waste.Hutton said that safety and security would be prioritised and the site would adhere to legal and regulatory rules, sources said.However, staff at the hazardous toxic site in north-west England remain concerned that cuts to spending could affect safety and jobs.Dan Gow, a senior organiser at theGMB union, said: “GMB calls on Sellafield to be fully transparent about any cost-saving measures and to engage with us to ensure the workforce is protected.“No worker should ever have to fear that budget cuts will put their safety at risk.“GMB is urging all workers to stand together, stay informed, and ensure their voices are heard. Now more than ever, being part of a strong, organised union is the best way to protect jobs, rights and safety.”The Office for Nuclear Regulation last weektook Sellafield out of special measures for its physical security– but said concerns remained over its cybersecurity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, after more than three weeks of silence, we can no longer wait,” Entwistle said.“We’re now urgently calling on the British consulate to do everything in their power to get us answers and to put as much pressure as they can on the Taliban for their release.”The couple were arrested alongside a Chinese-American friend, Faye Hall, and an interpreter from their training business.A Taliban official said it would attempt to release the couple “as soon as possible”, the BBC reported.Abdul Mateen Qani said: “A series of considerations is being taken into account, and after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible.”Qani added that the three foreign nationals had Afghan passports and national ID cards.TheForeign, Commonwealth and Development Officesaid on Monday it was “supporting the family of two British nationals who are detained in Afghanistan”.Earlier, the BBCcited a Taliban officialas saying that two British nationals believed to be working for a nongovernmental organisation in Bamiyan had been arrested about 20 days ago after using a plane without informing local authorities.Entwistle said her parents had initially kept in touch via text messages after they were detained, and had assured their four children they were fine. However, contact stopped three days later. The family have had no contact with their parents for more than two weeks.The couple married in Kabul more than 50 years ago, and run Rebuild, “an Afghan-registered research and training business” that has been operating since 2009.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a ban on women working and on female education beyond primary school in the country, but this project had apparently been approved by the local authority.In an open letter to the Taliban, Entwistle and her three brothers said: “We do not understand the reasons behind their arrest. Our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded.”The Foreign Office advises against all travel to Afghanistan. It says there is a heightened risk of British nationals being detained there, and they could face imprisonment of months or years.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibanForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeForeign policySouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

After the odds of a future collisionrose earlier this year, the likelihood of an impact is now so low as to be negligible.At about 40–90 metres (130-300ft) in width, asteroid 2024 YR4 is far smaller than that which ended the reign of the dinosaurs – a body that was about six to nine miles (10-15km) wide. However, an impact with Earth couldstill have caused death and destruction: the asteroid was deemed capable of releasing energy equivalent to 7.8 megatonnes of TNT explosive.Don’t look up: is an asteroid heading for Earth? – podcastRead moreAs a result, a planetary defence response was triggered, beginning with experts closely tracking the trajectory of the asteroid. Initially the likelihood of an impact in 2032 rose, reaching 3.1% on 18 February this year, but data fromNasareveals it is now 0.0017%.In other words, there is 99.9983% chance the asteroid will miss Earth. Indeed, the “city-killing” asteroidcurrently ranks zeroon theTorino impact hazard scalethat ranges from a no-risk nought to a global-catastrophe 10.The change was not unexpected: as the European Space Agencypreviously pointed out, an asteroid’s impact probability often rises before dropping off as additional observations are made.“This asteroid was a good demonstration of why we have these procedures, and of them working as expected: a higher than normal – but still very low – risk triggered further observations and planning, and these observations let us rule out an impact,” said Colin Snodgrass, a professor of planetary astronomy at the University of Edinburgh.Snodgrass added that such alerts were likely to become more common. “We should get used to alerts like this – as the new Vera Rubin Observatory starts scanning the skies later this year we will find many more asteroids, and some will no doubt require further attention to rule out impacts,” he said.“This shouldn’t be a cause for alarm – it is a sign that our technology is improving and we are doing better at discovering asteroids, and means that, if we do find one coming towards Earth, we have a better chance of finding it with enough warning time to do something about it.”Explore more on these topicsAsteroidsSpaceAstronomyNasanewsShareReuse this content"

God help us all,”postedthe X account Republicans Against Trump.Gregg Nunziata, a Republican and former general counsel to Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, warned that Bongino was a more extreme appointment than Patel – who has portrayed the bureau as an arm of a so-called “deep state” dedicated to undermining Trump and has vowed to turn its Washington headquarters into a museum.“Kash Patel should have been a redline. Bongino is what you get when [Republican] Senators fail to do their jobs and say no to Patel,” Nunziatawrote.“The Trump Admin is turning federal law enforcement over to unqualified, unprincipled, partisan henchmen. It’s unacceptable and conservatives need to say so.”Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator for Connecticut,wrote: “Trump has chosen grifters to lead the FBI. Dan Bongino’s entire show is telling listeners the world is ending so they buy the dozens of survivalist products he sells. I know this feels like a bad dream. It isn’t.”Trump announced Bongino’s appointment in a post on his Truth Social network late on Sunday night, calling it “great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!”The president praised Bongino – who has run unsuccessfully three times as a Republican in congressional races in Maryland and Florida – as “a man of incredible love and passion for our country” and said he was giving up his position as “one of the most successful podcasters in the country” to serve.However, Bongino’s qualifications have been called into question since the deputy director is traditionally in charge of the bureau’s day-to-day enforcement operations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2018, he said: “My entire life right now is about owning the libs.His appointment was greeted with glee by Trump supporters.“This is incredible news!! Thank you @dbongino for the sacrifice.

In the UK, cases are expected to rise from 58,756 cases a year in 2022 to 71,006 cases a year in 2050. Deaths will jump from 12,122 a year in 2022 to 17,261 in 2050.The findings werepublished in the journal Nature Medicine.“Every minute, four women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide and one woman dies from the disease, and these statistics are worsening,” said the IARC scientist Dr Joanne Kim, one of the authors of the report.“Countries can mitigate or reverse these trends by adopting primary prevention policies … and by investing in early detection and treatment.”The projected increase in cases worldwide is probably due to a mix of factors, including a growing and ageing global population, improvements in detection and diagnosis, and a higher prevalence of known risk factors for the disease.Factors that increase the risk of breast cancer include getting older, inherited faulty genes and a family history of the disease.Globally, most breast cancer cases and deaths occur in women aged 50 and above, who account for 71% of new cases and 79% of deaths, the IARC said.About a quarter of breast cancer cases can be prevented, the study’s authors said, for example by reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight and becoming more active.Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide but its burden is not evenly distributed. The IARC said diagnosis rates were highest in Australia and New Zealand, followed by North America and northern Europe, and lowest in Asia and Africa. However, death rates were highest in Melanesia and Polynesia, and in west Africa.Over the last decade, incidence rates grew by 1% to 5% a year in 27 of 50 countries studied, the IARC said. Importantly, breast cancer mortality rates decreased in 29 of 46 countries analysed.Dr Isabelle Soerjomataram, the deputy head of the IARC’s cancer surveillance branch, said: “Continued progress in early diagnosis and improved access to treatment are essential to address the global gap in breast cancer and ensure that the goal of reducing suffering and death from breast cancer is achieved by all countries worldwide.”Explore more on these topicsBreast cancerWomen's healthHealthCancernewsShareReuse this content"

He said he was “perfectly aware that these wounds cannot be erased or healed” and he was ready to “take responsibility” for his actions.Almost all the children were unaware of the alleged abuse until police knocked at their doors having discovered their names in the handwritten “black books” found at Le Scouarnec’s home.The abuse is alleged to have taken place between 1989 and 2014, when Le Scouarnec worked at more than a dozen private and public hospitals in Brittany and other parts of westernFrance.In 2017, neighbours in Jonzac, north of Bordeaux, reported Le Scouarnec to police. In 2020, he was convicted for the rape or sexual assault of four children, including a young hospital patient. He was sentenced to 15 years and is currently in prison.View image in fullscreenCampaigners outside the courthouse in Vannes on Monday as the trial opened. The alleged abuse by Le Scouarnec is said to have taken place between 1989 and 2014.Photograph: Thomas Padilla/APWhen detectives searched his home they found hard disks containing more than 300,000 photos and videos featuring child sexual abuse, as well as notebooks recording details of the alleged abuse of patients. Officers also discovered a collection of dolls, some lifesize, under the floorboards.In one note, Le Scouarnec is alleged to have written: “I am a paedophile and I always will be.”The trial, which is expected to last four months, will also focus on how Le Scouarnec was allowed to continue operating on children despite having been convicted and given a four-month suspended sentence for possessing child sexual abuse images in 2005.His employers and the professional body for doctors, L’Ordre des Médecins, were informed, as was the French ministry of health. No action was taken.More than 60 lawyers are representing the victims and their families, who will give evidence next month in the chronological order in which the abuse is alleged to have taken place. Two hundred and fifty-six of the victims were under 15, with the youngest aged one and the oldest 70.One of Le Scouarnec’s lawyers, Maxime Tessier, told the court his client admitted to the “vast majority” of the charges. Le Scouarnec’s former wife and his three children are expected to give evidence on Tuesday. Other members of the surgeon’s family will be questioned the following day.View image in fullscreenMaxime Tessier, one of Le Scouarnec’s lawyers, told the court his client admitted to the ‘vast majority’ of the charges.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPAMarie, one of those seeking justice at the court in Vannes, said: “I want all our trauma to be recognised. They can tell us that it’s in our head, but it’s been there for years and even before we knew what he did to us.”Before the trial opened, Frédéric Benoist, a lawyer for the child protection association la Voix de L’Enfant (Child’s Voice), a civil party in the case, said it was “scandalous” that L’Ordre des Médecins was included in the case along with the victims.Negar Haeri, a lawyer representing the order, said they were “defending the collective interests of the profession that had been sullied by the alleged activities of Joël Le Scouarnec”.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportIn the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

The court also upheld the conviction of Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, once Holmes’s romantic partner and president of Theranos.A three-judge panel for the 9th US circuit court of appeals inSan Franciscorejected claims of legal errors at their separate trials held in 2022.Holmes, 41, who started Theranos as a college student and became its public face, was indicted alongside Balwani in 2018. The two were tried separately andsentenced in 2022to 11 years and three months, and 12 years and 11 months, respectively. Holmes was ordered to pay $452m in restitution to investors, but a judgeplaced the penalty on holddue to her limited financial resources.Holmes’s sentencehas been reduced by more than two yearsfor good behavior while incarcerated, and she is expected to be released in 2032, having served a nine-year sentence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, his prognosis remained guarded.Francis, who has been eating normally, received a video on Monday from the Holy Family church in Gaza and then called the parish, a daily routine maintained since 9 October 2023.He wasadmitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on 14 Februaryand was subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection, pneumonia in both lungs and a mild renal insufficiency.A statement that evening said the pope was also receiving “high-flow oxygen therapy” through a nasal cannula, but continued to remain “vigilant and well orientated”.The world’s press has gathered at St Peter’s Square, where large electric billboards with a black background are publicising prayers for the pope’s health that will be held on Monday night. The event will be led by Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state.Francis had been showing signs of improvement until Saturday, when he was given supplemental oxygen and blood transfusions for a low platelet count after a prolonged asthma-style attack.View image in fullscreenPope Francis was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli hospital on 14 February.Photograph: Franco Origlia/Getty ImagesOn Friday, doctors said the pope was not “not yet out of danger” and that he was expected toremain in hospital for at least another week.They said the main threat facing Francis would be the onset of sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can occur as a complication of pneumonia.Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Gemelli hospital, said on Friday that the pontiff was taking a “significant” medication load and would not be discharged until he was fully out of the woods, because if he returned home, he would just start working again. “We need to focus on getting through this phase … the pope is not a person who gives up.”He said Francis knew he “was in danger, and he told us to relay that”.In a message published in lieu of his weekly Sunday Angelus prayer, which the pope normally delivers from a window overlooking St Peter’s Square, Francis thanked medical staff. “I am confidently continuing my hospitalisation at the Gemelli hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment – and rest is also part of the therapy!” he said.Vigils have been held outside the Gemelli, which has long been the preferred hospital for pontiffs. Well-wishers have also gathered in St Peter’s Square.“I’m sorry Pope Francis is not well,” said Stanley, a visitor from El Salvador, as he photographed the billboard message. “He’s a good person and very lovable. I say that as a non-Catholic – he’s a person who I respect.”Pierre, from France, said: “He’s 88 so would be at risk but I hope he gets through this. I think he’s a good pope, and has been a fairly modern one even if the Catholic church still has a long way to go with modernising.”Jim, from the US, said the pontiff was “one of the most important leaders in the whole world. In my view, he is probably the most important leader – we need him and I really hope that he lives.”The pope has maintained a punishing work schedule, despite increasing health issues, and especially because it is the Catholic jubilee year. Last September, he carried outa mammoth 12-day tour to the Asia Pacific, one of the few places in the world where the Catholic church is growing in terms of baptised faithful and religious vocations.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanThe papacyCatholicismItalyChristianityEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He was 93.Hill died at home in Belvedere,California, according to his publisher, Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. A cause of death was not given.Although few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on Abraham Zapruder’s chilling home movie of the assassination, provided some of the most indelible images of Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas on 22 November 1963.Hill receivedSecret Serviceawards and was promoted for his actions that day, but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy’s death, saying he didn’t react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save Kennedy.“If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess,” a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS’s 60 Minutes in 1975, shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. “And I’ll live with that to my grave.”It was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally start putting the assassination behind him and accept what happened.View image in fullscreenJohn F Kennedy slumps down in the back seat of the presidential limousine in Dallas, Texas, after being fatally shot, on 22 November 1963.Photograph: James W Ike Altgens/APOn the day of the assassination, Hill was assigned to protect the first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, and was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its way through Dealey Plaza.Hill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine.Zapruder’s film captured Hill as he leaped from the Secret Service car, grabbed a handle on the limousine’s trunk and pulled himself on to it as the driver accelerated. He forced Jackie Kennedy, who had crawled on to the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off.Hill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service, retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and recurring memories of the assassination.The 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller In the Line of Fire, about a former Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in part by Hill.Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn,North Dakota. He attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency’s Denver office for about a year before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and first family.Since his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the assassination only a handful of times, but the most poignant was his 1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several times.“If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn’t be here today,” Hill said.“You mean you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot?” Wallace asked.“The third shot, yes, sir,” Hill said.“And that would have been all right with you?”“That would have been fine with me,” Hill responded.In his 2005 memoir, Between You and Me, Wallace recalled his interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career.In 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN’s Larry King Live, where Hill credited that first 60 Minutes interview with helping him finally start the healing process.‘Conspiracies are just theories … not fact’: the Secret Service agent haunted by JFK’s shootingRead more“I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then thank him more because he’s what caused me to finally come to terms with things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,” he said. “It was because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to recover.”Decades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books – including Mrs Kennedy and Me and Five Presidents – about his Secret Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021.“We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for,” McCubbin Hill said in a statement. “We were soulmates.”Clint Hill also became a speaker and gave interviews about his experience in Dallas. In 2018, he was given the state of North Dakota’s highest civilian honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider award. A portrait of Hill adorns a Capitol gallery of fellow honorees.A private funeral service will be held in Washington DC on a future date.Explore more on these topicsJohn F KennedySecret ServiceCaliforniaJackie OnassisNorth DakotanewsShareReuse this content"

A worker wrote a letter of complaint at the time saying the minister appeared to have been drinking, swore and called him a “loser” repeatedly, even forming an “L” with his fingers on his forehead.Bayly sent two apologies in reply, saying he “misread the moment” and meant his comments in a “light-hearted manner”. He reassured the worker: “I was not intoxicated when we met.”Despite stepping down as a minister after his latest encounter, Bayly said he would remain a member of parliament and looked forward to serving his electorate.The conservative government of the prime minister, Christopher Luxon, which took office in November 2023, is sagging in the polls as voters struggle with the rising cost of living.Luxon said the arm-handling incident happened on 18 February and he had accepted Bayly’s resignation on Friday, delaying the announcement to give the minister time to speak to his family and staff.“I think that’s been pretty quick, to move as fast as we have within the week. It’s pretty impressive,” he told reporters.The prime minister said Bayly told him he felt his actions “fell well short of the expectations he sets for himself”. Luxon said he appreciated that Bayly wanted to continue to be a lawmaker and thanked him for doing an “exceptional job” as minister.Asked if Bayly might one day return to a ministerial post, he told reporters: “Never say never.”Bayly was replaced as commerce minister by Scott Simpson, who had been the senior whip responsible for party discipline in parliament.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In Goma alone, a city of 2 million people and a humanitarian hub for those who have been displaced, the fighting killed nearly 3,000. Those injuredhave overwhelmed medical facilities, with patients with gunshot and shrapnel wounds cramming into hospitals.Last week, theUN human rights office accused M23 rebels of killing three childrenin Bukavu.On Sunday, the DRC’s communications minister, Patrick Muyaya, said thatRwandaand M23 had killed more than a dozen people in Goma.More than 40,000 people, mostly women and children, havefled to Burundiin February because of the conflict, including more than 9,000 in a single day.M23, which is made up of Tutsis who left the Congolese army more than 10 years ago, is one of more than 100 armed groups fighting against Congolese forces in the mineral-rich eastern DRC.View image in fullscreenCongolese police officers who have reportedly switched their allegiance to M23 and are going to be retrained under the militia.Photograph: Michel Lunanga/AFP/Getty ImagesThe group has more than 8,000 fighters, according to the UN, which has accused neighbouring Rwanda of backing the militia and said the fighters were supported by about 4,000 troops from Rwanda. Rwanda denies the claims.M23 says it is fighting to protect Tutsis and Congolese people of Rwandan origin from discrimination and wants to transform Congo from a failed state to a modern one. But analysts have said that is simply a pretext for Rwanda’s involvement, and suggested Kigali is actually motivated by designs on its neighbour’s mineral resources.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They included the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb. Twenty-four joined online.The coordinated Europe-led show of solidarity came after a torrid week, in which Donald Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war against Russia,described Zelenskyy as a “dictator without elections”, and made it clear Europe would have to enforce and pay for any future peace settlement.Three years of war in Ukraine – in picturesRead moreThere was strong collective pushback against the US president’s upside down version of recent history and a consensus thatUkrainehad to take part in negotiations over its future. “The war is against Ukraine. So Ukraine has to be at the negotiating table,” Zelenskyy told the visiting leaders, saying Europe had to be there, too. He added: “Peace can’t be declared or announced.”Ukraine’s security is Europe’s security.pic.twitter.com/Ofq7eeMs9n— Gitanas Nausėda (@GitanasNauseda)February 24, 2025US and Russian negotiators are due to hold a second round of talks soon, aftera meeting last week in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. The White House has said the war could end “this week” – raising fears that a quick US-Russia deal will echo Vladimir Putin’s demands that Ukraine cede territory and capitulate.At least seven European countries announced significant new packages of economic and military support to Kyiv on Monday, with von der Leyen promising a €3.5bn (£2.9bn) payment. TheTrump administrationhas indicated that US weapons deliveries will probably stop and has said Ukraine will have to repay any future military assistance at double the actual price.Several EU leaders acknowledged the continent had to spend more on its own security and – as the Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin,put it – “do more and talk less”. Lithuania’s defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, said Trump’s repeated demand for greater spending from fellow Nato member states was a necessary but “painful kick”.She added that the “unpleasant” events of the last week, when Trump repeated Kremlin talking points and apparently dumped Ukraine as an ally, had changed the psychology of European decision-making. “When you feel your own arse is on fire, you move faster,” she said.View image in fullscreenWorld leaders stand either side of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena, in Kyiv.Photograph: Javad Parsa/NTB/AFP/Getty ImagesThere was also overwhelming support for Ukraine’s EU membership and for its attempts to join Nato. The country could join the EU before 2030, von der Leyen said, if Kyiv continued its reforms at their current speed and quality.Sitting next to the Ukrainian president, Stubb, the Finnish president, said it was not up toRussiato determine which alliances Kyiv joined, or the shape of the European security order. “Putin lost this war. We will see Ukraine in Europe and in Nato,” he said.Justin Trudeau reaffirmed Canada’s support “until the war is over and Ukraine wins”.Hours after world leaders arrived, air raid sirens rang out across the capital. Early on Sunday, Russia carried out its biggest aerial raid since its 24 February 2022 all-out attack, sending 267 drones across Ukraine’s border. At least four people were killed in strikes across the country.On Monday, Zelenskyy, his wife, Olena, and prime ministers and presidents laid candles at a popular memorial in the centre of Kyiv to soldiers and civilians killed in Russia’s war. Afterwards, politiciansposed for a symbolic group photoon the steps of the Maidan, Kyiv’s independence square and a symbol of the country’s sovereignty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s Europe’s destiny.”Zelenskyywrote in his anniversary address: “Three years of absolute heroism by our people. Eternal gratitude to the fallen heroes.”Keir Starmer said the UK supported a “just and lasting peace for Ukraine”, adding that: “We face a once-in-a-generation moment for our collective security and values.” The British prime ministerhas said UK troops could be sent to Ukraineas part of a possible peacekeeping contingent, on condition the US provided a “backstop”. “Russia does not hold all the cards in this war,” Starmer told Zelenskyy by video.The White House has categorically ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine and it is unclear what a backstop means. The Labour MP Alex Sobel said Nato countries could provide air support and impose a no-fly zone – an idea proposed in 2022.

Troops would be “anathema” to Putin and therefore the right thing to do, he said.View image in fullscreenEvening ceremony at the memorial to fallen defenders of Ukraine at the Maidan Nezalezhnosti.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianJohnson also denounced the “nightmare of Orwellian language” in the US, and the “absolutely rubbish” claim that Ukraine attacked Russia first. He said Zelenskky should sign a$500bn (£395bn) minerals dealwith the US, arguing this would give the White House a direct stake in protecting Ukraine and its own business interests. Zelenskky has so far resisted andon Sunday said he did not “recognise” the $500bn figure.“Trump wants to show something to his Ukraine-sceptic Republican base,” Johnson said. He added: “The tragedy is that he [Trump] has been listening for too long to [the conservative political commentator] Tucker Carlson, who has been taking the Kremlin line. The deal is well worth the price for Ukraine.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaEuropean UnionUrsula von der LeyenJustin TrudeauKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Now the 70-year-old artist is going to the ‘Olympics of art’ where she has ‘all sorts of things to say about Britain’s history and the British pavilion itself’Alex NeedhamMon 24 Feb 2025 15.00 ESTShareLubaina Himid, the artist known for her large stage-set-style installations that draw attention to figures overlooked by history, has been picked by the British Council to represent the UK at the 2026Venice Biennale.“I’m energised and so up for it,” the artist said of the challenge to fill the British pavilion with her work at “the Olympics of art”. She added: “I was ready to do it when I was 30 – it’s just that the British Council weren’t ready for me.”Himid, 70, is only the second Black woman to represent the UK at Venice.Sonia Boyce was the first, in 2022, and received the top prize of the Golden Lion for her multimedia installationFeeling Her Way, a celebration of the Black female musicians who had inspired her. At the 2024 biennial, Britain was represented by John Akomfrah.All three artists are pioneers of Black British art, for instance participating in the First National BlackArtConvention, which was held at Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1982. Their work was often overlooked or marginalised by the predominantly white mainstream art establishment, an experience which Himid says will influence her approach to the pavilion.“We absolutely thought of ourselves as artists, but we were often in places that weren’t dedicated to the showing of art,” Himid said, citing multidisciplinary arts spaces like the Africa Centre and ICA in London. “You might come in for a cup of tea, or be queueing for cinema tickets, and you’d look at our work on the wall. We realised that those were the kinds of environments in which we could speak to the people we wanted to speak to, because they were welcoming.”View image in fullscreen‘I for ever have my eye out for what’s happening’ … Naming the Money, 2004, by Lubaina Himid pictured on show at the Royal Academy’s 2024 exhibition Entangled Pasts: 1768-Now.Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/ShutterstockHimid is confident she can rise to the task of representing Britain. “Why not?” she told the Guardian. “I’m British. I’ve lived here since I was four months old.” She was born in Zanzibar and is now based in Preston, where she teaches at the University of Central Lancashire.The artist believes that people whose national identity is called into question due to their race often have a sharp antennae for the public mood. “I don’t live here complacently. I for ever have my eye out for what’s happening. What’s the political situation? How are people feeling? What’s missing from museum collections? Sometimes, those of us who feel we don’t belong have several kinds of narratives running at the same time. I have all sorts of things to say about Britain’s history and the pavilion itself.”Some of Himid’s work, such as her 2007 sculptureSwallow Hard: The Lancaster Dinner Service, and her paintingsLe Rodeur, have drawn attention to the UK’s involvement in the slave trade. In recent years, there has been a rightwing pushback to the “woke” uncovering of such narratives, both by artists and bodies such as the National Trust, that has intensified since the election of Donald Trump.“The right are always trying to unravel things,” Himid said. “But the point of artists is to open stuff up, let the cat out of the bag, spill the milk. It either opens up good conversations, or everyone just has to deal with it. The 1970s, when I was at art school, were tough times. So were the 1980s. But I kept making the work I wanted to make – there’s nothing else I can do.”The choice of artist to represent their country can be a vexed one. Khaled Sabsabi was due to represent Australia at Venice next year, but was sacked after the shadow arts minister complained about a 2007 video work thathad included images of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.“Artists have to say what we want to say, and sometimes people don’t want us to say it,” Himid said. “No one’s ever told me to tone down my work. They let me show it and then they take the piss.”This year, Himid will revisit a 1985 show of art by Black women which she was forced to stage in a corridor at the ICA which ran from the bar to the toilet – a far cry from the expansive halls of the British pavilion. Himid will spend the rest of the year making work for Venice before the biennale opens next April.What kind of work does she plan to make? “I always paint, so there will be paint,” the artist revealed, hinting: “I’m interested in how surrealism meets the everyday, the space between a question and an answer. I’ve got a lot of work to do. It’s nerve-racking, but exciting. I wouldn’t be doing it if I didn’t think I had something interesting to say.”Explore more on these topicsLubaina HimidVenice BiennalePaintingArtnewsShareReuse this content"

Here are 10 of the wildest to grace our screensStuart HeritageMon 24 Feb 2025 07.54 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 07.57 ESTShareToday sees the debut ofThe Baldwins, a reality TV show about Alec and Hilaria Baldwin and their seven children. According to TLC, the show will demonstrate “what life is really like for the Baldwins – chaotic, funny, exhausting and filled with love. Alec and Hilaria’s dynamic as a couple will also take centre stage, with moments that showcase their deep partnership as they navigate challenges hand in hand.” Which, given that it is still not long since Alec Baldwin fatally shot Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust, is quite a lot of challenges.But however you view The Baldwins – either as a moneymaking necessity for a family in trouble, or something less edifying – they now join a long line of other reality show families that have opened themselves up for the public to gawp at. Here are 10 of the most notorious.10. Til Death Do Us Part: Carmen and DaveSuch was the rush for celebrity reality shows in the early 00s that they would give anyone a series. Witness 2004’s seven-episode Til Death Do Us Part, in which Baywatch star Carmen Electra prepared for her marriage to Jane’s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro. And it was just that. Seating arrangements, location scouting, cake buying; nothing was too mundane for these hellcats. Spoiler alert: the couple filed for divorce less than three years after filming wrapped.9. Being Bobby BrownView image in fullscreenMade you wish for an intervention … Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston.Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Sygma/Getty ImagesIt’s important to note that nobody wanted a reality show about Bobby Brown. But he was married to Whitney Houston, and by 2005 she was in such freefall that she had nobody to advise her against it. The resulting show was almost gratuitously unedifying. Watching any of it made you feel grubby. Watching the episode where Brown explains how he helps Houston relieve her constipation, you found yourself actively wishing for an intervention.8. Keeping Up With the KardashiansView image in fullscreenBizarre … Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian in Keeping Up With the Kardashians.Photograph: Entertainment/Rex/ShutterstockThe Kardashians have reached such a point of cultural saturation that it is easy to overlook just how weird it is. It’s a reality show about a bunch of identical-looking Stepford Wives – trapped inside a loop of only being famous because they’ve got a show – strutting around a warehouse-sized mansion saying absolutely nothing of note. The patriarch is, retrospectively very clearly, transitioning. Kanye West drifts in and out. There is no identifiable content whatsoever. It’s bizarre.7. 19 Kids and CountingIn the US, the channel TLC carved out its own genre of competitive breeding, where your chances of landing a show directly correlated with the number of children you had. Jon and Kate Plus 8 was a good start, but they were soon eclipsed by the Duggar family, who inexplicably had 19 children. That was exploitative enough. The fact that the show was eventually hauled off-air after sexual molestation allegations against the oldest son were revealed just makes it worse.6. Gene Simmons Family JewelsFor a while there, there was no reality TV show Gene Simmons wouldn’t enthusiastically consent to. He was on Rock School. He was on Criss Angel Mindfreak. He was on the child trauma psychology show Shrink Rap. And yet his greatest contribution to the medium was Family Jewels, which ran for six years until 2012. A reality show that followed Simmons, his wife, Shannon Tweed, and his two children, it was standard enough reality fare, save for the episodes where Simmons had to take a lie detector test to see if he’d been sleeping around or not.5. Meet the Rees-MoggsView image in fullscreenScrambling for work … Jacob and Helena Rees-Mogg with their children.Photograph: Discovery+/PAWhenever there is a change in government, it is inevitable that recently unelected ministers will find themselves scrambling for work. But none have been quite as desperate as Jacob Rees-Mogg, who signed his family up for a reality show the instant he saw the writing on the wall.Meet the Rees-Moggswas an attempt to show Jacob and his clan as a normal family, which is especially hard to do when you live in a mansion full of portraits of yourself and local people keep spray painting the phrase “Posh Twat” around town.4. Hogan Knows BestSometimes reality shows are deliberately structured to make their subjects look more exciting. In retrospect, Hogan Knows Best – a VH1 series about Hulk Hogan and his family – did the exact opposite. Onscreen they came across as a cartoonishly oversized and bright orange sitcom family, wayward but ultimately protective. Offscreen, Hogan’s marriage was deteriorating due to his infidelities (his wife would soon shack up with a 19-year-old) and their son crashed his car while drunk, causing his friend to be in a vegetative state.3. WahlburgersView image in fullscreenA shameless commercial … Mark, Paul, Alma and Donnie from Wahlburgers.Photograph: A&E Network ProductionArguably a family born for reality TV, the Wahlbergs are a clan of intensely high-frequency roughneck Bostonians, comprising one Hollywood actor, one member of New Kids on the Block and an array of peripheral biological and honorary Wahlbergs including Jenny McCarthy and the guy they based Drama from Entourage on. Together, of course, they decide to start a burger franchise. The whole thing is really a shameless commercial, but an entertaining one nonetheless.2. Totally Scott-LeeFuture historians will one day write books about Totally Scott-Lee, a one-off 2005 reality series about the attempts of former Steps member Lisa Scott-Lee to launch a solo career. This was a show with real stakes, since Scott-Lee – flanked by her brother and husband – made the early wrongheaded decision to announce that she would quit the business if her first single didn’t go Top 10. Spoiler: it did not go Top 10.The moment she discovered thisremains one of the most compelling of the entire genre.1. The OsbournesView image in fullscreenEvery reality show since owes it a great debt … Jack Osbourne, Sharon Osbourne, Ozzy Osbourne and Kelly Osbourne.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyHow could it be anything but? Aside from Anna Nicole Smith’s show, which was altogether more ugly and exploitative, The Osbournes is the original and best reality TV show. Essentially a live-action Simpsons, if Homer had also been a world-renowned rockstar, it was a full-tilt bananas show about a dysfunctional (but unquestionably loving) family. The show made stars of every member, and every reality show that followed owes it a great debt.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe that we’d had enough of reality, thanks. It’s telling that nine out of the 10 nominees are essentially set in the past, or in isolated or fantasy realms, from 1960s America (A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys) to “Mexico” (Emilia Pérez, filmed in France), from Wicked’s Oz to Dune: Part Two’s Arrakis. Only one entry is set in genuine, here-and-now, modern-day society. What’s more,Anoragoes to places mainstream cinema rarely does: the grubby streets, the strip clubs, the all-night cafes, off-season Brighton Beach in Brooklyn and the Russian and Armenian communities who live there. Anora also gives us the opposite: gated mansions, deluxe hotel suites, private jets. That’s the kind of film it is; that’s the kind of world we live in.But the main reason Anora should win is that it’s simply an adorable film – full of heart and passion and energy and justlife. It’s impossible not to be swept along with its hero, Ani – a gutsy but tragically naive lapdancer who falls for a Russian oligarch’s spoilt son, and spontaneously marries him. Mikey Madison’s beautifully open and spirited performance means we’re rooting for her every step of the way. Some have likened Anora to a Cinderella-like fairytale – minus the happy ever after. Pretty Woman it ain’t – but there’s far more going on here. As a snapshot of the degraded American Dream, a quarter of the way into the 21st century, for my money there’s been nothing better.One of the things that makes Anora so adorable is the way it mixes pain with joy, the depressing truth with the seductive fantasy, bleak social realism with screwball comedy. It shouldn’t work but it does. When Ani first falls for the feckless Vanya and they hightail it to Vegas, for example, we’re whisked along with them in an intoxicating whirl of garish glitz and dance pop and freewheeling camerawork – even as we know this love won’t last. And when it does come crashing down, it’s tragic but also hilarious, most memorably in the bravura sequence where the thugs Igor and Garnik attempt to apprehend Ani at the family mansion, massively underestimating her ability to put up a fight. Their boss Toros turns up to find his henchmen nursing bite marks and broken noses amid the broken furniture. “What happened?” he asks. “Shehappened,” they say.As with Sean Baker’s earlier movies (Tangerine, The Florida Project, Red Rocket), Anora homes in on sex work as the ultimate distillation of American capitalism; a place where sex, money and power come together – along with economic insecurity, exploitation and discrimination. As a lapdancer and escort, Anora is the embodiment of simulated desire: the “fake it till you make it” mentality. Vanya’s supposed wealth dangles the promise of fairytale class mobility for Ani, but he has his motives, too – not least escape from his overbearing parents (when we meet his monstrous mother, we understand why). How much would they love each other if they met under different circumstances? How much is all love really transactional? How do we know when it’s real? Artifice is everywhere in this movie: fake fur, fake wealth, fake love – it’s no coincidence that their romance takes place in the US capital of unreality, Las Vegas.It’s not just Anora, though; pretty much everyone in this movie is faking it to make it. Baker is too generous a film-maker to paint any of them as purely evil, but all of them are bent out of shape by the power of money. Vanya is a manchild pretending to be a player to his friends, and a good student to his parents. Igor is essentially a decent guy, a would-be Prince Charming even, but he’s hired muscle, so that’s what he must be. Even Toros drops his role as a priest halfway through a baptism when he gets the call from his boss.In the movie’s ambiguous final scene, as Ani’s relationship with Igor reaches its climax (or rather, doesn’t), she breaks down uncontrollably and we’re left to wonder why. It’s been a long few days, for sure, but I see it as her no longer knowing what shereallyfeels, the difference between genuine and simulated emotion. It’s the crisis of meaning 20th-century French philosophers warned us about – but Anora makes the point far less pretentiously, with wonderful lightness of touch and empathy for its characters. It’s not just a film to admire; it’s a film to love. And Ani is a character for our times. So when future historians ask what happened in 2024, we can reply, “Shehappened.”Explore more on these topicsFilmBest picture Oscar hustingsOscarsAnoraAwards and prizesMikey MadisonSean BakerSex workfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bandleader RZA has alluded to later worldwide dates, saying in a statement:This is a special moment for me and all my Wu brothers to run around the globe together one more time and spread the Wu swag, music, and culture. Most importantly to touch our fans and those who have supported us throughout the years. On this tour we’re playing songs we’ve never played before to our audience and me and our production team have designed a Wu-Tang show unlike anything you’ve ever seen.If these do prove to be the group’s final shows, it will bring the curtain down on a wildly creative – and at times fractious – career for the nine-strong group.They formed in Staten Island in 1992, and with production by RZA, the group delivered their debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) the following year, telling gritty stories filled with references to martial arts and comic books.Their supersized second album Wu-Tang Forever topped the charts in the US and UK, while third album The W contained some of their biggest hits including Gravel Pit and Protect Ya Neck (The Jump Off). Three more studio albums followed, plus a curio release: Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, an album released as a single copy, bought for $2m by pharmaceuticals tycoon Martin Shkreli in 2015.Some of the members’ solo albums, such as Ghostface Killah’s Supreme Clientele and Raekwon’s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, are also regarded as pinnacles of the hip-hop genre. They lost one of their most distinctive members in 2004, with the death of Ol’ Dirty Bastard to an accidental drug overdose, and corralling the MCs together hasn’t always been easy – there have been a number of other releases with one or more members missing.This April brings the release of Black Samson, an album with all nine members together again, though it is not an official Wu-Tang Clan album and is instead co-credited to producer Mathematics. The group also put on a united front – for most dates at least – at a Las Vegas concert residency held in 2024.Support on the US tour will come from Run the Jewels, the hip-hop duo of El-P and Killer Mike.Explore more on these topicsWu-Tang ClanHip-hopRapnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s often a matter of timing – you might find a certain presenter grating at seven in the morning, but the same one prattling on after lunch totally inoffensive. Yet such a visceral, borderline irrational reaction does make the early morning slot a dicey endeavour.Nick Grimshawwill already be well aware of this occupational hazard as he takes over the 6 Music breakfast show from Lauren Laverne – he helmed Radio 1’s more high-profile equivalent between 2012 and 2018. As he kicks off his debut programme with the kind of hushed reverence that has long been de rigueur on the station, it’s obvious he is doing his best not to rile the faithful.I don’t find Grimshaw remotely irritating, though I can see why his (now toned-down) persona – slightly ditzy, chummily familiar – might not be for everyone. Personally, I’m very much looking forward to him bringing more of his giddily droll humour to the show. (We got a sprinkling of comedy this morning, largely courtesy of a an email requesting UB40 from a man eating a pork pie in bed). Yet, unlike his previous gig, the 6 Music breakfast show is clearly not meant to be a personality showcase. It’s not even supposed to be particularly entertaining; 6 Music is all about the songs (the clue’s in the name), something Grimshaw acknowledges early doors. He is “here with one job only: to start your day with the best music”.This approach means that 6 Music’s rivals are not other stations but music streaming services – and, for the most part, Grimshaw makes an excellent case for the value of the station on these terms. The first half hour is a perfectly calibrated combination of indie classics (New Order’s Bizarre Love Triangle), the zeitgeist’s latest (the new Fontaines DC), 00s nostalgia (Simian Mobile Disco’s Hustler), and critically acclaimed music that deserves a wider audience (courtesy of South African artist Moonchild Sanelly). And there’s also something obscure that may be the next big thing (I was delighted to be introduced to the next-gen nu-metal of Toronto’s Doflame). This mix of the comforting and the cutting edge, curated by human beings with great taste, is a salve and joy in a world of coldly generic, algorithmic playlisting.Yet, for all 6 Music’s taste-making ability, the station also functions as a time warp. Not only has the presenting lineup been largely identical for the past two decades – Grimshaw is a rare new starter – but there’s a roster of tracks that have been in almost constant rotation for the same period. Clearly, Grimshaw is not immune to this requirement for suffocating consistency: cue Beastie Boys’ Intergalactic, Alright by Supergrass and the Smiths’ How Soon Is Now?Most of these came as part of Cloudbusting – the closest thing the breakfast show has to a feature (blessedly, in my opinion) – which involves an hour of upbeat music designed to combat the grey weather. In terms of non-musical interludes, we get a funny and lively (if not overly insightful) interview with Leigh Bowery’s friend Sue Tilley – who discusses her book and anupcoming exhibitionabout the iconic performance artist – and a quick chat with Laverne before she returns in the mid-morning slot. Here, Grimshaw reflects on his first show. “I was really overthinking it,” he admits, before realising “it’s literally just pressing play and talking in between those songs.” No, it’s not a broadcasting revolution, but with a newly subdued Grimshaw and some excellent tunes, the 6 Music breakfast show is in safe hands.Nick Grimshaw’s 6 Music breakfast show is on weekdays from 7amExplore more on these topicsRadioNick GrimshawreviewsShareReuse this content"

This year, the leading UK act was producer and singer Artemas, for I Like the Way You Kiss Me.British stars such as Charli xcx – arguably the most conversation-dominating UK act of 2024, with her album Brat – Dua Lipa and Coldplay did not feature. It is the first time since 2003 that a UK act hasn’t featured in either the singles or albums list.The No 1 song globally was Beautiful Things by Benson Boone, and the No 1 album globally was The Tortured Poets Department byTaylor Swift.K-pop boybands dominated the albums list, with two entries from Seventeen (Spill the Feels at No 6 and 17 Is Right Here at No 8), along with Enhypen (Romance: Untold at No 4) and Stray Kids (ATE at No 10). The remainder of the list came from US superstars: Hit Me Hard and Soft byBillie Eilish(No 2), Short n’ Sweet by Sabrina Carpenter (No 3), SOS by SZA (No 5), One Thing at a Time by Morgan Wallen (No 7) and Stick Season by Noah Kahan (No 9).In the singles chart, only Irish songwriter Hozier, with Too Sweet at No 6, deviated from the otherwise total US dominance of the list, which spanned pop (Carpenter’s Espresso at No 2) to rap-country (Post Malone and Wallen’s I Had Some Help at No 7) and a five-year-old song by Swift, Cruel Summer, at No 9. The insistence of Kendrick Lamar’s blockbuster Drake diss track, Not Like Us, was confirmed as it appeared at No 8.Jo Twist, chief executive of British record industry body the BPI, told the BBC: “British artists may have enjoyed stronger years on the international stage, which perhaps isn’t surprising given some of our biggest names were not in cycle in 2024.“There was still plenty to be excited about, as a new generation announced itself – not least Charli xcx, who enjoyed a breakthrough year globally, alongside international chart success for emerging artists such as Jordan Adetunji, Artemas and Good Neighbours, while the likes of Lola Young and Myles Smith are now rapidly building an international following.”Twist said that it is “undoubtedly becoming much harder to break talent in a hyper-competitive global music economy”.The news comes ahead ofthe Brit awards this weekend, led by xcx with five nominations for Brat, followed by Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith with four.Global bestselling albums of 2024Taylor Swift – The Tortured Poets DepartmentBillie Eilish – Hit Me Hard and SoftSabrina Carpenter – Short n’ SweetEnhypen – Romance: UntoldSZA – SOSSeventeen – Spill the FeelsMorgan Wallen – One Thing at a TimeSeventeen – 17 Is Right HereNoah Kahan – Stick SeasonStray Kids – ATEGlobal bestselling singles of 2024Benson Boone – Beautiful ThingsSabrina Carpenter – EspressoTeddy Swims – Lose ControlBillie Eilish – Birds of a FeatherShaboozey – A Bar Song (Tipsy)Hozier – Too SweetPost Malone – I Had Some Help ft Morgan WallenKendrick Lamar – Not Like UsTaylor Swift – Cruel SummerNoah Kahan – Stick SeasonExplore more on these topicsMusicMusic industryPop and rockTaylor SwiftKendrick LamarSZABillie EilishnewsShareReuse this content"

We toil away in the unconscious belief that a special person is a better person, and a special life is a better life. Whether that specialness is conferred by the glamour of celebrity or social media likes, or by the dignified success of reaching the top of your profession, or by the glow of being anointed head girl (no, I wasn’t, and I’m not bitter about it, not at all), this craving to be raised above others, to be “the special one”, can lie at the heart of everything we do.This wish might be lurking under the making and breaking of your relationships, as you seek the person who will make you feel special, and reject the ones who don’t. It might hide in the extra hours you spend in the office to get something “just right” for your boss, rather than settling for good enough. It might ring out with the alarm that wakes you far too early to train for a marathon, or to perfect a yoga pose.I can write about this with some insight, because I too want to be special. I may have to delete that sentence later, it feels so excruciating. There has been nothing more mortifying than hearing the crushing words from my analyst, “Perhaps you want me to feel that you’re special.”Moment by moment, interpretation by interpretation, my analyst has helped me to see and understand the very high cost I have paid in working so very hard to be special. The effort spent trying to impress others; the dazzling meals I was too tired to cook but cook I did; the Guardian column that I just couldn’t stop tinkering with. What can get lost in all this are the ordinary feelings and parts of myself that have ended up neglected, because I didn’t consider them dazzling enough. My desire to be special led me away from myself. Apart from anything else, it is exhausting. I remember a friend telling me that I didn’t have to try so hard, and it made me want to cry; the problem was, I did have to try this hard – I wish I didn’t.I’ve been thinking about this a lot since becoming a mother. I think it is very natural to want your child to feel special, perhaps more special than others, so they can develop self-confidence. But I don’t think real self-confidence comes from being elevated above others; it comes from knowing and being oneself and feeling loved for that in an ordinary way. It is not believing you are the best and striving to be that; it is understanding that you have value for being you. It is very easy to give a child, unconsciously, the impression that to be special, they need to try to be somebody else. Perhaps the most valuable gift you can give a child is the permission to be ordinary.Trying to be special, to live a special life, can in reality take you further and further away from a better one. It is very easy to get caught up in who’s climbing the ladder on LinkedIn and lose sight of the precious moments of the life you are actually living. It is quite possible the better life that you’re trying to build by reading this article is already right in front of you; you just can’t see it because you’re trying to live a different one.There is a disturbing vulnerability that comes with an unconscious wish to feel specialNow that I have become aware of this part of myself that so craves that feeling, I don’t seem so compelled to act on it. I cook simpler meals. I feel a lot more freedom when writing these columns. I feel less of a need to perform than I used to, and when I do feel that need, I can recognise it and respond differently (sometimes). I’ve also become much more aware of the beauty of ordinary moments that I am fortunate enough to experience every day. A cheeky glance from my daughter to her father; the “rrrrrp” of my cat as she jumps on the bed in the middle of the night and starts purring; opening a new book and realising I’m in safe hands, it’s going to be good.There is a disturbing vulnerability that comes with an unconscious wish to feel special. It means you can easily be drawn into relationships built on sand – falling in love not with the other person, with who they are, but with yourself through their eyes. Someone who can make you feel like you are the most special person in the world – far more special than anyone else – can also just as easily make you feel like you are the dirt on the bottom of their shoe. And you might be inclined to believe that’s who you are, too.It can be a huge relief to find a partner who can treat you in an ordinary way, as an ordinary person, as someone who does not need to be special and dazzling. At first, it might feel boring, if you’re used to the cycle of idealisation followed by denigration. But after a while, you might realise that boring is just a denigration of something far more precious. You might have found someone who recognises you and loves you in your ordinariness. It might not always feel as exciting, but it can feel more real; it can feel like coming home.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodExplore more on these topicsLife and styleHow to build a better lifeMental healthHealthRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And, as I did as a child, I lose myself in a world of books ...Dale Berning SawaMon 24 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 18.39 ESTShareLast September, I started walking to the library every day. As a University College London alumnus, I get free membership of both the Senate House library and the university’s main library. It is 90 minutes door to door, at a thinking pace, the perfect stretch of time during which to fuss over whatever is bothering me (a sentence, a professional hurdle, a private conversation) then gradually forget all about it and just let my mind wander too. That’s what the walk does. It unknots me.That the destination is a library only compounds that. The beep when I swipe in with my card is the loudest thing I’ll hear all day. The necessary quiet of the space gentles my every gesture. I open doors more quietly. I pull chairs out from behind tables more carefully. I set up my station and sit down more promptly. And then I breathe.All around me are these old tomes with clothbound covers – exactly the kind of books I used to look for as a child in my library at primary school. At that age, already, I often felt the need to escape the busyness of the world outside and I’d latch on to the oldest hardbacks as the best place to go for a good story.These days, it is online we are all trying – if momentarily – to escape. Well, this really is the place to do that. It is not that I need to consult an art history book for every piece of journalism I write, but doing so inevitably yields different details from only Googling an artist: a quote, say, from a 1970s catalogue no one has thought to digitise, or the title of a piece an artist mentioned seeing when they were a student in the 1980s.Also, just looking up from my laptop for the kind of regular break physios or optometrists sternly recommend now brings excitement, not dread. Instead of seeing the many chores (laundry, admin, clutter) that crowd my tiny workspace at home, my eyes land on a sea of titles. I’ve started photographing stacks of books. It is like concrete poetry.I got to Senate House early the other morning and picked an empty room at random, only to realise at 10am that I was in the German literature section, surrounded by titles that composed something unexpectedly lyrical when put together (Light Beneath the Horizon; So I Sat Then Between All the Seats; Twilight). In the art history section, I’ve felt a certain thrill at reconnecting with the kind of Big Book you have to consult repeatedly as a student (Erwin Panofsky’s Early Netherlandish Painting) but that you then somehow never lose, like furniture in your mind. This week I opened a book on Cy Twombly and glitter drifted out from the creases. You see what books do? Someone was inspired …If I’m cold or jittery, I’ll go downstairs and kind of melt into the noise of the coffee shop. If I’m stressed, I’ll walk to the Frank Auerbach section. And when I’m done, if there’s time, I walk home. No day at the office or WFH has ever felt as good.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedLibrariesUniversitiesHigher educationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His landline has stopped working and he’s been told by his providerEEthat he may need to accept a new phone number to get his service back.He lives alone and relies on his phone for human contact. It will be a challenge for him to let people know his new number and he risks being cut off from medical communications.SP, LondonIt sounded to me as though your friend had unwittingly had his phone line switched to Digital Voice. This enormous project is transferring the analogue network to an internet-based service before the old copper network is switched off in January 2027.The switchover hasgrave implicationsfor vulnerable customers as digital lines do not work during power outages and may be incompatible with vital telecare buttons. Some customers have reported that lifelong phone numbers have been lost in the process.Telecoms firms agreed to delay transferring the most vulnerable until they were certain those customers would not be negatively affected. However, it turns out that your friend was indeed transferred without his knowledge after he visited an EE shop for help with his mobile phone. It seems a salesperson signed him up to a new contract without taking into account his circumstances.Two weeks later he returned from respite care to discover that his devices were no longer working. His telecare button may also have been affected, but he has not yet had to use it. Moreover, the equipment has been installed downstairs in the hall, which makes it hard for him to hear the phone ring and impossible to reach in time from his upstairs sitting room.Soon after you contacted me, he was admitted to hospital with chest pains, attributed in part to the distress of the saga. The good news is his number has now been restored; the bad is that there will almost certainly be many more in his situation as Digital Voice ramps up.EE told me it’s investigating why a visit to a store resulted in the switchover. “We’re extremely sorry that the customer’s experience has fallen short of the high expectation we set for all of our customers,” said a spokesperson. “We have determined that his landline handsets are operational and will remain in contact until his complaint has been fully resolved.”Customers whose lost telecoms service is not restored within two working days are entitled to compensation from their provider under rules by the regulator Ofcom.Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

The smoky notes of poached haddock and a creamy leek mash; soft buns stuffed with grilled squash and spiced-up creme fraiche, and a soupy dish of pearl barley and dried mushrooms are just three that spring to mind.A simple midweek roast has become something of a winter staple in this house. Not the full bells and whistles Sunday lunch but something I can do in less than an hour on a Wednesday evening. I pop a few chicken thighs in the oven, then make a side dish of bread sauce, seasoned with thyme leaves and the delicious crusty bits from the roasting tin. Cheap and quick, but it feels almost as special as the Sunday roast.Another regular visitor to my kitchen at this time of year is a straightforward pasta and greens recipe. I like to use one of the hollow pastas that hold olive oil and grated parmesan, and any greens that look particularly fresh and crisp. This is a great time for greens and I tend to go with whichever look best in the shop, cavolo nero and purple sprouting broccoli being two of my favourites. A simple dish, with barely a handful of ingredients, but one of which I never tire.The jars of dried ingredients in the cupboard have an important role to play right now. One recipe that I have repeated all winter has been a risotto-style dish of pearl barley and mushrooms. The grain is cooked separately, as it needs a rolling boil. It is at its best left until it is tender but still slightly chewy. I use several types of mushrooms, usually bought in mixed boxes, but there is no reason why you couldn’t make it with chestnut mushrooms alone. The dish, with its deep umami notes, is always a calming presence after a busy day.The kitchen takes on an especially nurturing role at this time of year. Our daily cooking becomes as much about keeping people warm as it does about having a good time around the table. Shopping expeditions may be less than exciting right now, even something of a challenge, but we can still come up with something good for everyone.Roast chicken with thyme and bread sauce (pictured above)Bread sauce polarises opinion, but it is one of my favourite accompaniments for a roast chicken or game bird. I make it in the roasting tin after the chicken has come out, stirring in the deliciousness left behind by the roasted bird, together with chopped thyme and a little butter. My feeling is that it should be served piping hot or not at all, like porridge. A good sourdough produces a thicker, more flavoursome sauce than a plain white loaf.Serves 2onion1, mediumolive oil2 tbspbutter50gthyme leaves2 tsp, choppedchicken thighs4For the saucemilk300mldouble cream100mlfresh white breadcrumbs150gthyme leaves2 tsp, choppedsage leaves2 tsp, choppedPreheat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 6. Peel the onion and cut in half, then cut each half into four segments. Put the olive oil and butter in a roasting tin and warm briefly on the hob till the butter has melted. Add the thyme leaves, some salt and black pepper and the chicken thighs, skin-side down. Turn them over in the thyme butter so they are nicely coated on both sides, then transfer to the oven and bake for about 35 minutes till golden.Warm the milk in a saucepan and set aside. When the chicken is ready, remove it and keep it warm, leaving the roasted onion in place. Put the tin over a moderate flame and pour in the milk, scraping at the bottom of the roasting tin to dissolve any sticky residue from the roasted chicken into the milk. Pour in the cream and stir in the breadcrumbs, the thyme and sage and bring to the boil, stirring all the time. Taste for seasoning then serve with the chicken.Butternut brioche bunsView image in fullscreenButternut brioche buns.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverButternut squash is the cut-and-come-again vegetable.

Place them in a single layer on a grill pan or baking sheet, brush on both sides with a little olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. Heat an overhead grill and cook the butternut slices for about 10 minutes till golden, then turn and cook the other side. Make sure they are soft and tender.Mix together the creme fraiche and mustard. Split the brioche buns in half and toast the cut surfaces until golden. Slice the tomato. Divide the onions between the buns, place slices of tomato and butternut on top of the onions followed by a spoonful of the mustard creme fraiche and a little of the Lao Gan Ma. Place the second piece of brioche on top.Orecchiette with purple sprouting broccoliView image in fullscreenOrecchiette with purple sprouting broccoli.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverThe deep hollows of the orecchiette hold tiny pools of olive oil, lemon zest and grated parmesan in this, the simplest of winter suppers. Purple sprouting is good here, but shredded cavolo nero, savoy cabbage or chopped broccoli are fine too. I often chop a couple of anchovy fillets – finely, almost to a paste – and stir them into the olive oil with the garlic.Serves 2purple sprouting broccoli250gorecchiette200ggarlic2 plump clovesolive oil2 tbsplemon1, finely zested and juicedBring a large pan of water to the boil and salt it generously. Trim the tough ends of the purple sprouting then cut into small pieces, each about 10-15g in weight. Have a bowl of iced water to hand.Put a deep pan of water on to boil and, when boiling, dunk the purple sprouting in. Leave for 2 minutes, then lift it out with a draining spoon and transfer to the iced water.When the water comes back to the boil, tip in the pasta and cook for about 9 minutes. Keep testing until it’s done to your liking. While it is cooking, peel the garlic, then crush to a paste with a good pinch of salt – I find a pestle and mortar easiest.In a wide saute or frying pan, warm the oil and garlic paste. You don’t want the garlic to colour, so stir as it warms. Roughly chop the cooked purple sprouting and add to the garlic.Drain the pasta and tip into the oil and sprouting, turning the ingredients over in the pan with a large spoon.Season the pasta with a little black pepper, then stir in the lemon zest and, if you wish, a little of the juice, then divide between two plates.Smoked haddock, leek mashView image in fullscreenSmoked haddock, leek mash.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverA perennial winter dinner in this house. I vary the mash, sometimes putting spring onions or parsley in, other times making it with waxy potatoes and olive oil for a silkier, sticky mash. A couple of spoonfuls of the smoke-scented milk in which you have poached the fish is quite pleasing trickled over the potatoes.Serves 2potatoes750g, largeleeks450gbutter75g, plus a little moresmokedhaddock450gmilk500mlbayleaves3peppercorns6chopped parsleyto finishPeel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces and boil them in deep, salted water till tender.While the potatoes are cooking, roughly chop and thoroughly wash the leeks.

Let them cook, with the occasional stir, for about 15-20 minutes until soft.Drain the potatoes thoroughly then mash them with the softened leeks and keep warm.Place the haddock fillets in a shallow pan, cover with the milk and 100ml water and add the extra knob of butter. Add the bay leaves and peppercorns and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, cover with a lid and let the fish cook for about 12 minutes. Lift the fish out and drain briefly on kitchen paper.Place spoonfuls of mash on warm plates, then put a piece of fish on top and spoon over the buttery milk.

I often use the cheaper broken dried mushrooms as an alternative to the more expensive dried porcini. That said, you only need 10g to impart a deep mushroom flavour to the stock. Pearl barley can take anything from 25-40 minutes to cook to tenderness. It is worth testing every few minutes, the ideal texture being both soft and satisfyingly chewy.Serves 4driedporcini10gpearlbarley250gonion1, mediumolive oil4 tbspgarlic2 clovesthyme leaves1 tspassorted fresh mushrooms250gtomato puree1 tbspplain flour1 tbspdried chilli flakes½ tspPut the kettle on. Tip the dried porcini into a heatproof bowl then, when the water is boiling, cover them with 500ml of boiled water and set aside.In a medium-sized saucepan, cover the pearl barley with twice its volume of water, lightly salt it, then bring to the boil. Lower the heat and let it cook for 30-35 minutes until it is tender and pleasingly chewy.Peel and roughly chop the onion. Warm the olive oil in a large pan, stir in the onion and let it cook over a moderate heat until pale gold in colour – a good 15-20 minutes. Peel and reduce the garlic to a paste, either by grating on a fine-toothed grater or mashing it with a pestle and mortar. Stir into the onion and continue cooking for a couple of minutes. Chop and add the thyme leaves.Finely slice any large mushrooms (king oyster, large flat or chestnut). Trim any smaller, fragile varieties (enoki, shimeji). Stir them into the onions and continue cooking for about 5 minutes until they start to colour. Stir in the tomato puree. Leave on the heat for 2-3 minutes, then introduce the flour. Add the dried mushrooms and their soaking water and bring to the boil.When the liquid boils, lower the heat, season with salt and pepper and stir in the chilli flakes. Simmer for 10 minutes then add the cooked pearl barley. Cook for a further 10-15 minutes, until the mushrooms are soft and silky and the sauce has thickened a little.Serve in shallow bowls.The Observer aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It just so happened that I was back in London a few weeks ago, so I could attend a bash to commemorate and celebrate the life of food historian and typographerGillian Riley. It was a beautiful, lively occasion organised by Gillian’s family and friends, and held atRoom 71-73in north London, just a few streets from the house she and her partner, James, lived and worked in so prolifically for many years. There was food, of course, and much of it – a half-wheel of parmesan and fanned plates of prosciutto and salami – from the local delicatessen, to which Gillian was a devoted customer. Wine flowed, too, thanks toThe Little Wine Shop, also around the corner and another place to which Gillian and James were as devoted as the staff were to them: their last delivery arrived just a few weeks before Gillian died last year, aged 90.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Gillian’s sister, Joanna, spoke about their early life growing up in North Yorkshire and how Gillian was always a “greedy” girl. Gillian’s niece, Esther, remembered the colour, texture, tastes and possibilities that Aunty Gill brought into her life. Others then participated in a lively pass-the-mic: colleagues from the worlds of typography and publishing, some of whom had once been her students, as well as friends and collaborators from the worlds of translation, academia, art and food writing. The stories and memories were eclectic, but they all had one thing in common: the invitations to lunch and dinner. Everyone there, it seemed, had enjoyed (often countless times) Gillian’s hospitable good cooking: meals she would shop for locally or in Chinatown, prepare with precision and glee, and share, while also discussing the next meal.Another thing that came up again and again was the affection, from people in all her worlds, for Gillian’s masterly translation ofCastelvetro’s 17th-century treatiseon fruit and vegetables, which includes several pages on cabbage: savoy (both curly and not), green and white. I also have several emails in which Gillian and I discussed cabbage, and more specificallypes coj ocaponèt(stuffed cabbage) in Piedmont, which is traditionally filled with leftover roast meat, but is also a vehicle for whatever happens to be left over, which the other day was rice, vacuum-packed chestnuts and half a tub of ricotta.When serving in wide, shallow bowls, remember – and this is Gillian’s advice – to ladle a bit of the cooking liquid over the stuffed leaves. They don’t really need any accompaniment beyond some bread for mopping the juices and a salad of mixed leaves with lemon dressing, and maybe some grated parmesan. Enjoy, while also discussing the next meal.Cabbage stuffed with rice, chestnuts and cheeseServes41 large savoy cabbageSalt and black pepperOlive oil4 onions, peeled and finely diced50g diced bacon, or pancetta (optional)200g cooked rice100g cooked chestnuts,crumbled100g ricotta20g grated parmesan1 egg2 tsp freshly minced or dried herbs(I used a mix of oregano, sage and marjoram)1 glasswhite winePull 12 large leaves from the cabbage and set aside, then shred the rest of the head. Bring a pan of salted water to a boil and, working in batches, plunge the whole leaves in the water for a minute. Lift out, run under cold water, pat dry and lay flat on a tea towel (if any leaves have a particularly thick rib, pare away so the leaf sits flat).Try this recipe and many more of Rachel’s Roman adventures the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.In a frying pan, warm five tablespoons of olive oil and cook two-thirds of the onion and the bacon, if using, until soft. Add the shredded cabbage and cook, moving it around the pan, until the cabbage completely collapses. Working in a bowl, mix the rice, chestnuts, cheeses, egg, herbs and a few grinds of black pepper, then add the cooked, shredded cabbage and mix again.Spoon egg-sized amounts of the filling in the middle of each whole leaf. Bring up the bottom of each leaf to cover the filling, fold in the sides and roll forwards to form a neat enclosed bundle, securing each one with string or a toothpick.You want a heavy, low-sided pan that will hold the 12 rolls snugly in a single layer. Melt a generous knob of butter and a tablespoon of olive oil, then soften the remaining diced onion.Add the rolls, pour in the wine and a glass of hot water, then cover, reduce to a simmer and cook, with the lid slightly ajar, for 30-40 minutes, until the rolls are tender, and the juices thickened and slightly sticky. Ladle a bit of the cooking liquid over the stuffed leaves when serving.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodVegetablesMain courseWinter food and drinkCheeseLeftoversrecipesShareReuse this content"

Some young people are opting for short periods off throughout their working livesMon 24 Feb 2025 09.28 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 21.30 ESTShareName:Micro-retirement.Age:Coined in 2007, but surging in popularity.Appearance:Like quiet quitting, but luxe.Is this one of those things wheregen Z takes an old concept, gives it a new name and pretendsthey invented it?Not at all. The concept is taken from a 2007 book calledThe 4-Hour Workweekby Timothy Ferriss.I take it back.Although nobody really talked about it until this year, when a bunch of TikTokers started doing it, so you’re partly right.So what is it?You know work-life balance?I amvaguely aware of it, yes.And you know how the company you work for only cares about wringing every last drop of energy out of you, and nothing you do is ever enough, and it exhausts you?This I am more familiar with.Well, why not try a micro-retirement? It’s where you combat burnout by taking some time to focus on you.I’m listening.One big proponent isAdama Lorna, who was inspired by Ferriss’s book and took a six-month micro-retirement. She says: “Instead of waiting until you’re 60 or 70 to travel the world and indulge in hobbies, you do them while you have your youth, your energy and health.”Thisisn’t new. It’s called a sabbatical.It isn’t really a sabbatical, because people want to make a lifestyle out of micro-retirements. For instance, some micro-retirees are planning to spend the rest of their lives travelling for a year after every three years spent working.But when will they actually retire?Oh, they won’t. They’ll just keep working three years at a time until they die.What if they get sick or become incapacitated in old age?Shh, this is about micro-retirement, not the inability of the young to acknowledge the inevitability of declining health.Does micro-retirementhave to involve travel?Not at all. Retirees don’t always travel. Some take up hobbies, or find ways to get involved in the local community. Others just watch lots of bad television and are sad because their children never visit, so there is always that.I don’t think I’llbe able to afford a micro-retirement.Then why not try amicro-micro‑retirement instead?And what exactly is amicro-micro-retirement?Well, I just made up the term. But it’s where you sneak away from your desk three times a day to cry in a toilet cubicle. It keeps me going.Do say:“Screw you, guys, I’m taking a micro-retirement.”Don’t say:“See you next week.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersPass notesHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How Republican bans on ‘woke’ books have reached new levelTrump administration escalates movement forged by US states to censor literature in full-scale DEI crackdownMarina DunbarMon 24 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 10.12 ESTShareWhen the actorJulianne Moorelearned her children’s book,Freckleface Strawberry, a tale of a girl who learns to stop hating her freckles, had been targeted for a potential ban at all schools servingUS militaryfamilies, she took toInstagram, posting that it was a “great shock” to discover the story had been “banned by the Trump Administration”.Moore had seen a memo that circulated last week revealing that tens of thousands of American children studying in about 160 Pentagon schools both in the US and around the world had had allaccess to library books suspendedfor a week, while officials conducted a “compliance review” to hunt out any books “potentially related to gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology topics”.Although whether Moore’s book would be selected for “further review” or banned entirely remains unclear, the episode brought into stark relief that the movement to ban books in the US – which has been bubbling up for several years, mostly in individual states – had reached a whole new level: the federal one.Donald Trump’s re-election, and his subsequentcrackdown ondiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, has many campaigners fearing that the Pentagon move to scrub its libraries of anything it opposes ideologically could be the first of a series of broad attempts to eliminate any discussions of race, LGBTQ+ issues, diversity and historical educationfrom public schools.Pentagon schools suspend library books for ‘compliance review’ under Trump ordersRead moreTheTrump administrationhas scoffed at the idea that it is banning books, and last month it instructed the Department of Education toend its investigationsinto the matter, referring to bans as a “hoax”. Indeed, many deny that banning books is censorship at all – a disconnect that stems not just from the historical context of book banning, but from a semantic dispute over what it means to “ban” something.In the early 20th century, books such as Ulysses by James Joyce and The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck were banned due to “moral concerns”.Likewise, the red scare of the 1950s saw increased censorship of materials perceived as sympathetic to communism, while the 1980s saw attacks against books dealing with race and sexuality, such as The Color Purple by Alice Walker, which was nearly banned two years after its release in 1984 after a parent petitioned against its use in an Oakland, California, classroom.The difference today, however, is that instead of coming primarily from conservative community organizers, the book banning movement is now coming from government – school boards, local governments and now, with the Pentagon move, even the federal government, increasingly working in lockstep.The modern wave of book bans could be said to have started with a backlash against The 1619 Project, a journalistic anthology by Nikole Hannah-Jones published by the New York Times. The project aimed to reframe US history by centering the contributions of Black Americans, but conservative politicians – including Trump – claimed it taught students to “hate their own country”.View image in fullscreenA woman waits for the start of the Dragon Con Parade in Atlanta, Georgia, in September 2023.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAIn response,Republicanlawmakers moved to ban the work in schools, marking the beginning of an intensified campaign against so-called “anti-American” literature.According to PEN America, a non-profit dedicated to defending free expression in literature, more than 10,000 book bans occurred in public schools during the 2023-2024 school year. Books that address racism, gender and history were disproportionately targeted.“The whole principle of public education is that it is not supposed to be dictated by particular ideologies that aim to censor what other people can learn and access in schools,” Jonathan Friedman, the managing director for US free expression programs at PEN America, said.Rightwing politicians, however, have increasingly used book banning as a rallying cry, portraying certain books as tools of “indoctrination” – failing to note the irony that indoctrination is the process of carefully limiting ideas, like banning books.Multi-level barrage of US book bans is ‘unprecedented’, says PEN AmericaRead moreOne key figure has been the governor of Florida,Ron DeSantis. He has echoed Trump’s dismissal of book bansas a “hoax”, and spearheaded multiple attempts to reshape education to reflect only conservative values, including theStop Woke Act, which restricts discussions on systemic racism, and the Parental Rights in Education Act, widely known as the “don’t say gay” law, which limits discussions of gender identity and sexuality in classrooms.Banned titles in Florida schoolsnow include Beloved and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, Normal People by Sally Rooney, Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood and The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky.What DeSantis and other rightwingers often say is that these efforts don’t truly constitute “bans” because they only remove books from schools, rather than totally outlawing them from being bought in the US, and therefore don’t encroach on free speech. John Chrastka, the executive director and founder of EveryLibrary, argued that this is faulty reasoning.“The private marketplace is protected by the first amendment in ways that the government is not beholden to,” he said. “The idea that because a book is still available for sale means that it’s not being banned outright is only the difference between a framework that was in place prior to the 1950s” and today.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Realizing that the first amendment prevented them from blocking the book from US bookstores, critics turned their attention to libraries instead, a grayer area in terms of constitutional protections.DeSantis and other rightwing politicians have taken the lesson: if the constitution prevents you from banning a book from being bought or sold inFlorida, the next best thing is to ban it from the places most people would have the easiest access to it – schools and libraries.“It doesn’t add up,” Chrastka added, “the idea that a teenager in a state where it’s impossible for them to get to an independent bookstore because they don’t exist any more somehow has enough liberty to buy the book when the school library is blocked from having it available for them.”Another key distinction is between banning books from classroom curriculum versus removing them from school libraries – which, unlike classrooms, are historically protected spaces for free access to ideas.“What you read for a class supports the curriculum,” says Chrastka, whereas “the school library is supposed to support independent reading. One of them is required reading and the other one isn’t, but [the reading material] is meant to be available.”The landmark supreme court case Island Trees School District v Pico in 1982, when a school board in New York removed books from its libraries it deemed “anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy”, established that school boards cannot restrict the availability of books in their libraries simply because they don’t like or agree with the content.Critics contend the new wave of book bans, although not yet about preventing sales at bookshops, fails to meet the intended purpose of libraries: to preserve and provide a variety of ideas and information that may not be readily or equally accessible to everyone.Trump administration gives schools deadline to cut DEI or lose federal fundsRead moreNow, many fear that once certain books are established as unacceptable in schools, the censorship could spread to colleges, bookstores and eventually nationwide bans. Even if that does not happen, experts say one of the most reliable ways to ensure ideas are suppressed is to dismantle the education system, making Trump’srepeatedly statedgoal of eliminating the Department of Education a particular concern.“The vast majority of the budget for the Department of Education and the laws and regulations that make sure that the department is functional go to help students succeed and protect students who are otherwise vulnerable,” said Chrastka.With the education system having been chipped away at for decades with budgets cuts,low literacy ratesand high dropout rates, book bans only make it weaker.“What we need in this country is for students to feel supported and to find their own identities, and reading is a core component of that,” Chrastka said. “Let’s let the kids discover themselves and discover their own path forward in the process.”Explore more on these topicsUS book bansCensorshipUS constitution and civil libertiesJulianne MooreSchoolsUS educationLaw (US)featuresShareReuse this content"

But the trend persisted. In 2024 women maintained a strong 52.8% share of sales, despite a broader decline in the African art market.“This shift marks a significant moment in art market history, particularly as global sales of women artists have not yet reached parity with men,” says Lindsay Dewar, chief operating officer of research companyArtTactic. “The African art scene stands out as a leader, where women artists are thriving and performing exceptionally well.”View image in fullscreenMumbaphilia (J.E.) by Julie Mehretu sold for $5.8m at Christie’s.Photograph: Courtesy Biennale Art VeniceArtTactic calculated the percentages from sales figures at international auction houses including Sotheby’s, Christie’s, Phillips, Bonhams and Strauss & Co.In 2024, the total sales value of female African artists reached $22m (£17.5m), with 452 women represented – an increase from 288 in 2023, says Dewar. The five highest priced sales were all by women, with the Ethiopian-American contemporary artist Julie Mehretu leading the rankings. Already the best selling artist of the year, her abstract acrylic and ink paintingMumbaphilia (J.E.)sold for $5.8m at Christie’s.The second highest-grossing African female artist was the South African modernistIrma Stern(1894–1966), whose work was influenced by German expressionism.While the market has been experiencing a downturn – falling by 27% in general and 45% in the African sector – the continued success of women suggests a fundamental change rather than a temporary fluctuation, Dewar says.Works by Nigerian visual artistsNjideka Akunyili CrosbyandToyin Ojih Odutola, and South African painterMarlene Dumasalso sold for more than $1m last year. “Their presence at the highest levels of the market underscores the increasing recognition and valuation of African women artists,” says Dewar.View image in fullscreenNigerian artist Njideka Akunyili Crosby was one of the highest-selling African artists last year.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianAlastair Meredith, head of art at the South African auction house Strauss & Co, is unsurprised by the gender parity. “Certainly from a South African perspective, some of the highest value artists – whether they’re modern or contemporary – are women.”Strauss & Co has seen a rising demand for works by female African artists, includingEsther Mahlangu, known for her vibrant geometric works carrying on the traditions of Ndebele art. A mural by Mahlanguwas unveiledat UK’s Serpentine gallery last October.Works by artists such as Dumas andLynette Yiadom-Boakye, a British artist with Ghanaian heritage, can sell for millions of pounds at auctions in London and New York.“Some of the highest value, the highest-grossing artists, certainly on the contemporary side, happen to be women,” Meredith says. “Dumas and Yiadom-Boakye are artists that command enormously high prices.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a black female painter during the apartheid era, her opportunities were limited,” he says.Self-taught, Mgudlandluwas influenced by l Fingo and Xhosa mural art and she predominantly painted vibrant landscapes.Dana Endundo Ferreira, the founder and chief executive of Pavillon 54, a digital art platform, says that with the global interest in African contemporary art, women are beginning to receive the recognition they deserve. “Several female artists are reshaping the landscape and, across the continent, black women artists are no longer on the margins – they are leading the conversation,” she says, citing artists such asPeju Alatisein Nigeria, andZanele Muholiand Thenjiwe Niki Nkosi in South Africa.“Black women artists on the continent still face unique challenges, including limited infrastructure and representation in galleries and institutions, difficulties accessing international markets, and systemic biases that have historically undervalued their work,” she says. “Many often still operate within male-dominated spaces where recognition comes more slowly.”View image in fullscreenZanele Muholi with their work, Manzi I, West Coast, Cape Town, at Tate Modern in London, June 2024.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDewar attributes the new gender parity to several factors. “One is the inclusion of African women artists in major contemporary sales rather than only in specialised African art auctions,” she says. “This exposure alongside blue-chip western artists like Andy Warhol gives their work greater visibility and credibility. It adds a gravitas,” she says.‘African art is not a fleeting trend’: Moroccan museum to celebrate rich creativity of continent’s artistsRead moreThere has also been a broader movement toward increased representation of female artists as auction houses and collectors actively seek to diversify their collections. And interest in younger artists has also contributed, with new generations entering the art world on a more equal footing.“The number of women artists sold at auction has grown by 130% since 2015,” Dewar says. “That’s a huge increase.”View image in fullscreenLynette Yiadom-Boakye’s paintings of figures can sell for millions of pounds.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDespite such advancements, female African artists still operate within a market significantly different from the global picture. The average price of their work in 2024 was approximately $23,500, whereas the global average for female artists stood at $180,000.But Dewar sees encouraging signs of broader market shifts.“Their ability to achieve sales parity in a region where art sales have traditionally been male-dominated is a notable achievement,” she says.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe art marketArtAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They came up with €50m (£41.4m) to help Ukraine.“And I said: ‘Are you crazy? We are talking about a war,’” Borrellrecountedin late 2024, shortly before standing down. “Do you know what does it mean, a war? Put three zeros behind! … And then we started taking things seriously.”Now, on the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the EU is once again being asked to add zeroes to military budgets and get serious, this time about the defence of not only Ukraine but the whole continent, as the certainties of the postwar order crumble.European leaders, shocked by Donald Trump’s swift concessions to Putin andfalsehood-laden tiradeagainst Volodymyr Zelenskyy, are facing a bitter reality. Europe fears an unjust settlement will be imposed on Ukraine, while a resurgent Russia threatens the security of the continent. Countries in central and eastern Europe have long warned that Putin will not stop at Ukraine and have been the most vocal in highlighting Russia’s disinformation, sabotage and attacks on Putin’s enemies on European soil.“Europe’s security is at a turning point,” said the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, arriving in Paris last week forcrisis talks. “Yes it is about Ukraine – but it is also about us.”View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron welcomes Ursula von der Leyen at the Élysée Palace in Paris last week.Photograph: Abdul Saboor/ReutersEven now, some fear Europe is reluctant to confront the changed reality. “There is still a belief that the United States is the pillar to European security,” Ivo Daalder, a former US ambassador to Nato, said in an interview on Tuesday, after Trump’s call with Putin and before the US president’sattack on Zelenskyy.“Wake up, Europe!” he said. “Be ready, and be ready to defend yourself, and do not immediately say we can’t do this without the United States. The United States may not be there. It may not be a trustworthy ally. It may, in fact, decide not to come to Europe’s aid.”Daalder co-chaired a transatlantic taskforce convened by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center that publisheda reportthis month urging Europe to take more responsibility for its own defence. The recommendations include spending 3% of national income on defence, well above the current Nato minimum of 2%. More than a decade after that 2% target was set, seven EU countries are still lagging, including Spain and Italy.Why Europe’s defence spending may need a bold new approachRead moreThose hundreds of billions in new funds could be poured into multiple projects: increasing the readiness of Europe’s large combat forces; building up a six-month inventory of ammunition, fuel and spare parts; acquiring “strategic enablers” – a long list of resources that are lacking in Europe such as intelligence, maritime patrols and air-missile defence systems.Kajsa Ollongren, a former Dutch defence minister who was on the taskforce, said there could be “no more excuses” on defence spending. “This is a crisis” and “an actual threat to our security”, she said, insisting governments must find ways to pay for defence, despite pressures on budgets at a time when the European economy isin the doldrums. “We have no choice, and we have to act at speed of relevance, which is much quicker than we normally do things in Europe,” she said.The way to bigger defence budgets is being cleared by theEuropean Commission, which polices EU member states’ debt and deficits. At the Munich Security Conference last week, von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, announced that the EU executive was ready to relax its fiscal rules “in a controlled and conditional way” to allow member states to “substantially increase their defence expenditure”.1:38US no longer ‘primarily focused’ on Europe’s security, says Pete Hegseth – videoMany member states would also like a defence version of the€750bn Covid recovery plan, where the EU embarked on unprecedented joint borrowing. Germany, backed by its frugal ally the Netherlands, is opposed, although the frontrunner to be the next German chancellor,Friedrich Merz, has signalled openness to discussing the idea. In aninterview with the Guardianand other newspapers earlier this month, the European Council president, António Costa, said it was too soon to exclude any solution, although he added: “We should not fix on only one solution.”Obstacles are legion. Common borrowing requires a common decision on repaying debt. The EU has no plan for how to repay the €30bn annual recovery plan debt and interest that will be due from 2028, a sum equivalent to 20% of the annual EU budget.Nick Witney, a former chief executive of the European Defence Agency, said more focus was needed on what defence spending was for. “We have no agreement on what the key capability priorities are,” he said. “Everybody in Europe has at least accepted that we are woefully vulnerable to air and missile attack in this new world of drones and cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles,” although he pointed out that Europe had three separate – and conflicting – air defence proposals. “The idea of Europeans converging and pooling their efforts and resources as logic demands is still very far from being realised.”After years of rivalry between Nato and the EU over defence, a clearer division of labour is emerging. Nato will remain responsible for military deployments and strategy, while the European Commission is carving out a bigger role covering “back office” functions such as procurement and developing Europe’s depleted arms industry. A defence white paper from the commission on 19 March is expected to set out ideas, with decisions by EU leaders forecast at a summit in June.The stately timetable of Brussels is a world away from the brutal realities of the Ukrainian frontline. More immediately, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, is urging European nations to send Ukraine military support, including at least 1.5m rounds of ammunition, air-defence systems, missiles, drones and training to Ukrainian brigades, according to a leaked paper that will be discussed by EU foreign ministers on Monday.View image in fullscreenUkrainian soldiers practice shooting down drones in Kharkiv oblast.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBut even before Trump’s overtures to Putin, western European diplomats have long privately conceded that Europe would not fill the gap left by any withdrawal of US military aid for Ukraine. While European nations are divided over sending troops to Ukraine, Zelenskyy hasconcluded“security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees”.Witney, who is now at the European Council on Foreign Relations, has a gloomy prognosis. “The period when we were happy to entirely empty the shelves of our storehouses and send it all to Ukraine, I think maybe is coming to an end,” he said. “People are increasingly thinking, no, we need to make sure our own armed forces are capable of offering decent deterrence to the Russians.”Daalder, the former Nato ambassador, said the best way of convincing Trump to stay involved in Ukraine was for Europe to lay out a detailed plan and timeline about taking more responsibility for its own defence. But if Trump turns his back on Europe, “you still have to do it”, he said.Nato could survive without the US, he said, highlighting that it was up to the other 31 members, who are almost all European nations. “The question is not whether Nato can survive. The question is whether Europe is willing to do what it takes for security to be strengthened and supported by Europeans, for Europeans.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionEuropeUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in recent years Berlin has widely been regarded as missing in action in the EU, hobbled by internecine feuding in a coalition government that has causedflip-flops and delayed decisions.Olaf Scholz has a cool relationship with Emmanuel Macron, slowing down the fabledFranco-German motor that powers the EU. The Polish-German relationship has also been rocky,strained by disputes over European air defenceand historical grievances.Friedrich Merz, on course to become Germany’s next chancellor, has promised to restore German leadership in Europe.“I think Merz and his team understand the urgency of the global situation and that we need a functioning German government soon,” said Jana Puglierin, the head of the Berlin office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The situation is so urgent that we need to first agree on some fundamental principles to be able to speak with a voice in Brussels … of course, for the EU, the earlier the better.”The euro has recovered some of its lost value since last yearThe rest of Europe is looking to the continent’s biggest economy to send more military aid to Ukraine. Merz, who has previously warned Scholz against “an appeasement policy” towards Russia, has promised to send Kyivlong-range Taurus cruise missileslong denied. He is also likely to face demands to send German troops to Ukraine as part of a deterrent or peacekeeping force, a discussion that Scholz described as“completely premature”.Puglierin said there was consensus among mainstream parties that “we cannot throwUkraineunder the bus” but predicted “hard coalition negotiations” over funding aid “and that can, of course, paralyse support for Ukraine”.Merz’s government will soon face calls to increase Germany’s defence spending toat least 3% of GDPat a Nato summit in June. Such demands willintensify pressure to reform Germany’s debt brake, which limits annual government borrowing to 0.35% of GDP. Many EU countries also want Berlin to reverse its opposition to pan-European borrowing for defence – so-called eurobonds. Despite his fiscally conservative economic stance, Merz has signalled openness to both options, but neither is a foregone conclusion.Janis Emmanouilidis, deputy chief executive at the European Policy Centre, said Merz has been extremely careful not to say anything “which might cost him in his own party”, where many do not want debt-brake reform or eurobonds. It is “difficult to judge Merz’s room for manoeuvre” on the debt-brake, he said.The centre-right leader is expected to dial down radical ideas from the campaign trail, such aspermanent controls at the German border, as part of a five-point plan that included turning away all asylum seekers. Strict controls would damage relations with Germany’s neighbours. Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, last yearcondemned controls introduced by Scholz’s government as “unacceptable”.Emmanouilidis expects Merz to enjoy better relations with Tusk and Macron, although said it would be difficult for relations “not to get better”. Merz’s leadership style “indicates that he will be trying to play a stronger role” in contrast with Scholz’s “lack of boldness”, Emmanouilidis said, although “the devil will be in the detail”.But the most testing leader for Merz will be Donald Trump, who in one month has upended the certainties of postwar German foreign policy – an icy reality for Merz’s Christian Democratic Union party, a traditional ally of the US Republican party. Since the US vice-president, JD Vance,met the far-right leader Alice Weidelandattacked European democracies, Merz, a lifelong transatlanticist, sounds less optimistic about striking deals with Trump, Puglierin said. “Germany is very sensitive to attacks on the EU … I think that this could lead to more openness to help make the EU work.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeOlaf ScholzUkraineEuropean UnionFriedrich MerzanalysisShareReuse this content"

My friend’s father – most everyone’s father or mother or uncle, whoever – would, while on business trips overseas, visit the occasional video store or flea market and return with whatever films or books or albums they happened to find. It’s a haphazard, incomplete thing to consume the culture of a faraway place in this manner, like trying to divine the contours of a mouth from the texture of spittle.Red Dawnis a bad movie. Bad in a special, sincere kind of way. It’s about a bunch of teenagers who fight back against a Soviet invasion of the United States. Released in the early 80s, it belongs to a large fraternity of films in which scrappy underdog Americans fight back against the seemingly insurmountable but of course ultimately very surmountable power of the Soviet empire. In a couple of decades, the Russians would pass the baton of villainy to people who look like me, though in our case there was no real empire to speak of, and so we were mostly small-batch insidious, our specialty less tank-and-jet and more suicide-bomb-level violence. It didn’t much matter; Red Dawnwith Arabs instead of Soviets for villains would have still been shit.In 2012, almost 30 years after I first watched the original, someone decided to remake Red Dawn. This time, there was no Soviet empire to invade the mainland, and so instead the Chinese would have to do. Again, it didn’t much matter – the point isn’t geopolitical fidelity, the point is 90 minutes of rah-rahing American tenacity in the face of overwhelming odds. Never back down, never surrender, that sort of thing.Problem is, China is a big market for movies. And so, at the last minute, for fear of missing out on millions in potential box office returns, the producers decided to change the villain. In the final cut of the Red Dawn remake, it’s North Korea that invades the United States. It’s always the sign of a well-crafted movie when you can change a central narrative beam in post-production and it doesn’t make any difference at all. I’m reminded of a guy in one of my old writing groups who, fearing his story didn’t have enough female representation, did a find-and-replace and changed every instance of “Sam” to “Samantha”, then went through and changed the pronouns accordingly, leaving everything else the same.View image in fullscreenPatrick Swayze, C Thomas Howell and Charlie Sheen in the original Red Dawn.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/AlamyAgain, it didn’t much matter. Except that it does, over time – this glaring disconnect between cultural self-image and pragmatic reality. In a 2016 essay, the writer and former soldier Roy Scranton describes watching Star Wars while stationed in Baghdad. He is forced in that moment to confront the reality that so much of the American self-image demands a narrative in which his country plays the role of the rebel, the resistance, when at the same time every shred of contemporary evidence around him leads to the conclusion that, by scope and scale and purpose of violence, this country is clearly the empire.A central privilege of being of this place becomes, then, the ability to hold two contradictory thoughts simultaneously. The first being the belief that one’s nation behaves in keeping with the scrappy righteousness of the underdog. The second being an unspoken understanding that, in reality, the most powerful nation in human history is no underdog, cannot possibly be one, but at least the immense violence implicit in the contradiction will always be inflicted on someone else.I’ve seen this person many times – they occupy a hallowed place in American culture, catered to by so many of the nation’s dominant cultural forces, from Monday Night Football to the Country Music Awards to the entirety of AM radio. It’s the person who in self-image professes to be a rule-breaker, untamable, wild – and in the next breath sides unquestioningly with every facet of state power. I’ve seen the Punisher decal on the bumper, the stylized American flag denoting the thin blue line:I’m an outlaw; also, anyone who disobeys the cops deserves to be killed.My first impulse is to mock the contradiction, but there’s no contradiction, not really, because the bedrock of this particular identity isn’t conformity or nonconformity – it’s self-interest. Anyone who buys into both the narrative of American rebelliousness and the reality of American authority understands that both have been created to serve them. The man in the action movie looks one way, the man the cops just shot in a traffic stop another.View image in fullscreenToward the end of December 2023, the South African government brings charges of genocide againstIsraelat the international court of justice. The case rests on Israel’s wholesale destruction of health facilities and the blocking of aid as evidence that what is being destroyed here isn’t a single terror organization, but a whole people. Much of the initial South African brief relies on the words of Israeli officials themselves, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s referencing of the complete destruction of Amalek in the Bible.Among those who have been calling for an end to the relentless killing, the development inspires a set of conflicting emotions. First, there is the basic relief of watching some official entity – any entity – do something. Time and again, in conversation with friends, some of whom have lost family members in this killing spree, there is a sense that one must be going mad: to see so plainly the destruction, the murdered children filmed and presented for the world to look upon and then to hear the leaders of virtually every western nation contend that this is not happening, that whatever is happening is good and righteous and should continue and that in fact the wellbeing of the Palestinian people demands this continue – it’s enough to feel like you’re losing your mind.Second, there is the realization that of course it would be a country like South Africa that would take this step – a country deeply versed in the ugly mechanics of apartheid, for whose citizens checkpoints and forcefully sealed-off towns are not abstractions, but the very recent past that, from the safety of the present, everyone now claims they always opposed.Beyond relief and recognition, there is a more complicated thing – an understanding that the machinery of the west has never had much of a capacity for self-diagnosis. Who does? Who that achieves power of this scale ever does?Waiting on a western judicial institution to cast judgment on a killing spree financed and endorsed by the west means, inevitably, watching a disjointed ballet of impossible reconciling. The narrative – as enshrined in countless constitutions and declarations and charters which are so often held up as the differentiating marker of superiority of this world over the other – demands moral purity, opposition to injustice, adherence to the principle that all innocent lives are equal and deserving of dignity. The reality is that an ally of the west is killing civilians by the tens of thousands and it would be politically inconvenient to call this wrong now when for months, years, decades it has been deemed perfectly fine.View image in fullscreenThe international court of justice in The Hague, the Netherlands, in 2024.Photograph: Dursun Aydemir/Anadolu via Getty ImagesAnd so we must watch the impotent pantomime of a Canadian prime minister declaring that while his government absolutely supports the international court of justice, it doesn’t support the premise of the South African case, whatever that tortured rhetorical construction is supposed to mean. We must watch the German government – whose police forces, in the name of fighting antisemitism, arrested Jewish protesters calling for a ceasefire – come to Israel’s defense at the court.In time there will be findings of genocide. There will be warrants issued, even. The structures of international law, undermined at every turn, will nonetheless attempt to operate as if law were an evenly allotted thing. As though criminality remains criminal even when the powerful support, bankroll, or commit the crime.It’s no use, in the end, to scream again and again at the cold, cocooned center of power: I need you, just this once, to be the thing you pretend to be.There is an impulse in moments like this to appeal to self-interest. To say: these horrors you are allowing to happen, they will come to your doorstep one day; to repeat the famous phrase about who they came for first and who they’ll come for next. But this appeal cannot, in matter of fact, work. If the people well served by a system that condones such butchery ever truly believed the same butchery could one day be inflicted on them, they’d tear the system down tomorrow. And anyway, by the time such a thing happens, the rest of us will already be dead.No, there is no terrible thing coming for you in some distant future, but know that a terrible thing is happening to younow. You are being asked to kill off a part of you that would otherwise scream in opposition to injustice. You are being asked to dismantle the machinery of a functioning conscience. Who cares if diplomatic expediency prefers you shrug away the sight of dismembered children? Who cares if great distance from the bloodstained middle allows obliviousness? Forget pity, forget even the dead if you must, but at least fight against the theft of your soul.In the summer of 2014, I began writing the first draft of my debut novel, American War. It’s a piece of speculative fiction set in the 2070s and covers the aftermath of a second civil war. I never thought of it as a particularly American book, but rather an attempt to superimpose stories from the other side of the planet onto the heart of the empire. It didn’t seem like a particularly clever narrative trick on my part.Three weeks or so after I finished the first draft, Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president. The novel would end up being published in April 2017 and come to be almost universally read as an exclusively American story, a literal prediction of where this country might be headed. A bidding war breaks out for the film rights. Time and again, various production company executives tell me how perfectly the novel has managed to capture this moment in American life, and I can’t help but think that the exact opposite is true. Something of American life has captured the novel. The word “dangerous” is used quite often, always as a compliment.Then, in January 2024, I receive an email from the director who was set to work on the American War adaptation, letting me know he and the production company are stepping away from the project. “Prudence suggests this is not the time for making movies about freedom fighters or terrorists (no matter which side of that argument one is on),” he writes.A few weeks earlier, a novelist I know tells me her appearance at a small book club has been canceled – the organizer tells her it’s because they “stand with Israel”. My friend is an American of half-Egyptian, half-Scottish descent. A Palestinian artist’s retrospective at the University of Indiana is shuttered. People who call for a ceasefire are demoted, fired, called antisemites and terrorist-supporters.View image in fullscreenBeit Lahia in Gaza on 21 February 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIt all feels so petty, the stakes so low. On the other side of the planet entire bloodlines are being wiped out and here in the sheltered world we are subject to relatively pathetic indignities – loss of income, disinvitations, cold shoulders from people who in a different time might have been quite proud of themselves for having a Brown friend. Every now and then we hear about those instances when the stakes turned out not to be so low, when this passive punishment transformed into something much more active, sometimes deadly. But for the most part it’s just a constant trickle of reminders of one’s place in the hierarchy – and it is precisely because of this that it becomes so tempting to just shut up, let what’s going to happen happen to those people over there and then, when it’s done, ease into whatever opinion the people whose approval matters deem acceptable.I start to see this more often, as the body count climbs – this malleability of opinion. At a residency on the coast of Oregon, I read the prologue to this book; a couple of days later, one of the other writers decides to strike up a conversation.“I’m not a Zionist,” she says. “But you know, I’m not anti-Zionist either. It’s all just so complicated.”I have no idea what to say. I feel like an audience at a dress rehearsal.There’s a convenience to having modular opinions; it’s why so many liberal American politicians slip an occasional reference of concern about Palestinian civilians into their statements of unconditional support for Israel. Should the violence become politically burdensome, they can simply expand that part of the statement as necessary, like one of those dinner tables you lengthen to accommodate more guests than you expected. And it is important, too, that this amoral calculus rise and fall in proportion to the scale of the killing, so that one might always be able to say, “Well, we could never have known it would get this bad, but now, now everything has changed.”It’s almost refreshing, then, when one is faced with the ugliest and yet most honest face of western apathy, the face that knows full well the scale and severity of the horror but believes it to be absolutely justified, absolutely necessary. I know this face, too. It appears on talk shows and atop opinion pieces stating, euphemistically or not, that the same world in which you can buy avocados all year round and your iPhone keeps getting more powerful and you never have to live in fear of an occupying force obliterating your family with missiles is the world in which an insignificant group of people you’ll never meet simply have to die. And whatever disgust this equation, laid bare, might inspire, many know it to be true. This is the world we’ve created, a world in which one privileged sliver consumes, insatiable, and the best everyone else can hope for is to not be consumed. It is not without reason that the most powerful nations on earth won’t intervene to stop a genocide but will happily bomb one of the poorest countries on the planet to keep a shipping lane open.How long can the fabric of a pleasing story hold? Presented the facts of the situation without label, without real-world anchor, like actors asked to read the screenplay and pick a role, how many Americans would instinctively choose that of the Palestinian calling for an end to occupation? The South African calling for an end to apartheid? The Haitian calling for self-rule? How many would want to believe, as so much of the culture here has always strained to believe, that they side with the underdog, the downtrodden who refuses to give up, the rebel in the face of empire? And then, should the scenes be transposed back to the unforgiving reality of the world as it is, how many, knowing the limitations of the stories we tell ourselves, would just as instinctively retreat into the comforting fold of empire?One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against Thisby Omar El Akkad is out now in the UK published by Canongate. It will be released tomorrow, 25February, in the United States by Knopf, and in Canada by McClelland & Stewart.Spot illustrations by Ben Hickey"

The actor reflects on her TV show Severance, political chaos in the US and why human beings are a disasterByEmine SanerMon 24 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 05.40 ESTShareIf escaping the world by running for the hills looks increasingly attractive to many of us – perhaps living on a commune –Patricia Arquettefeels like that too. Head to the mountains, she says. “Plant seeds and farm.” But maybe not the commune part – she lived in one as a child and it wasn’t always utopian. If our conversation is more dystopian than usual, it’s probably because we’re talking about Severance, the hit Apple TV+ show now in its second season. In the first series, we were introduced to Lumon Industries, where some workers, tasked with doing something unknown but probably malevolent with data, were willingly “severed”; their work selves detached from their outside selves, with no memory between the two. If the drama started as an off-kilter take on work-life balance, it soon morphed into something much darker.Arquette plays Harmony Cobel, an icy and (mostly) controlled senior manager at Lumon before she was fired, then rehired. In the outside world, she is Mrs Selvig, neighbour of Mark, another Lumon employee (he is severed, she isn’t, and he doesn’t know she is his boss). Arquette wouldn’t say she likes Cobel as a character. “I feel sorry for her, in a way,” she says. “To be so indoctrinated by a thought system or organisation, whether it’s a religion, or a corporation or a military. Obviously, she’s done some things that are reprehensible, but like all people who do bad things, they always have reasons, excuses, for why they needed to do that thing.”A forthcoming episode, which Arquette can’t talk about, explains a lot about why Cobel is as she is. It’s intense – the flashes of almost violent emotion we’ve already seen come out in a deluge – and Arquette is typically brilliant. It reinforced her sympathy for the characters. “I kind of feel sorry for everyone. There’s a lot of self-deception, a lot of wanting to belong, of wilful ignorance – and then just a lot of trickery and deception. That is never good.”View image in fullscreenArquette as Harmony Cobel in series two of Severance.Photograph: Apple TV +Arquette was intrigued by Severance – she hadn’t done sci-fi before, and wanted to work with Ben Stiller, who directs most of the show, and with whom she first worked on the 1996 film Flirting with Disaster. The weirdness of the drama appealed, and she had no idea if it would be a hit. But then, you rarely do, she says. When she didTrue Romance, the 1993 Quentin Tarantino-scripted film “it was a bomb”. Then it picked up a cult following and cemented Arquette as a 90s indie cinema queen. “You never know how anything’s going to be, you just try to make something good.”She was drawn to the idea of “divided” people, and different selves within one human being. “I really feel like it’s a huge problem in the world. You read about it every day.” The moralistic church leader who is also abusing children, she says, or people who have two separate families, each a secret from the other. Even those who have affairs. “There are so many things people are doing, and they seem comfortable living these alternate realities … Lumon is kind of a corporate personification of that.” Humans, she says, “I guess just are a disaster”. She laughs.Watch the trailer for series two.When Severance started in 2022, the real world’s tech overlords still had a vague appearance of decency. Elon Musk hadn’t implanted a chip in someone’s brain and AI didn’t seem like an existential threat. “It feels weird already, and we’re about to go into a weird world,” says Arquette. Things we wouldn’t have dreamed of before will become normalised. Look, she says, at how “people became emboldened to be mean behind their computers, they can just let their meanness out”. How might we behave in virtual reality? It is enough to make her want to run the other way to that mountain, to plant seeds and farm.As for the current political situation in the US, Arquette, who describes herself as an activist, says she is “horrified about a lot of the things” that have swept in with Trump’s second presidency – racism and dismantling of LGBTQ+ rights, the attacks on institutions. On transgender rights, which President Trump targeted soon after taking office, it is “terrifying”, says Arquette; her sisterAlexis, who was an actor and activist before her death in 2016, was trans. “The whole thing is dehumanising, nightmarish. Women’s rights are also on the chopping block, state after state. It just really breaks my heart.”View image in fullscreenArquette, right, with her siblings Alexis, centre, and Rosanna.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyEarlier this month, Trump purged the board of the John F Kennedy Center for the performing arts, the leading arts venue in Washington DC, which receives federal funding, andbecame its new chair, warning that the centre was “not going to be woke”. Does Arquette worry about the sort of stories that will now be told – or, more importantly, won’t? Yes, she says. “For maybe the last 10 years, there was a serious movement for inclusivity and diversity, and what are the stories of these artists? It makes the arts richer.”It was perhaps inevitable that Arquette became an actor, like all four of her siblings, includingRosannaandDavid. Her father, Lewis Arquette, appeared on the Waltons, her grandfather, Clifford, was a comedian. “I’m a fourth-generation actor, so I grew up with it, and it was part of the way that we communicated as a family and something we really valued.” In her career, Arquette has worked with leading directors includingDavid Lynch,Martin Scorsese,Richard Linklater(she won an Oscar for her role in his film Boyhood) andMichel Gondry.Her life outside work has been just as full and varied. Her mother, Brenda, was an actor and artist; she was Jewish and Arquette’s father converted to Islam. Arquette spent her teen years in Los Angeles, going to punk clubs (though she says she was “more new wave”). At 20, she became a single mother when her son was born. Later, she married Nicolas Cage; they divorced after six years in 2001, and she went on to have a daughter with her second husband, the actor Thomas Jane. Activism has been part of her life; she used her Oscar acceptance speech in 2015 to call for equal pay for women.View image in fullscreenWith her first husband, Nicolas Cage, in Berlin 1999.Photograph: Ronald Siemoneit/Sygma/Getty ImagesArquette was reportedly writing a memoir a few years ago but it hasn’t materialised. She’s still writing it, she says. “It’s just so vulnerable, I guess, writing.” She worries nobody will want to read it. “There’s that little inner critic. You have it with acting, but you also have it with everything. I think people struggle with the inner critic all the time, and it really can hold you back. Probably it’s the main thing that does hold you back.” Does she still hear it? She’s an Oscar-winner! “Yeah, I’ve always had that, I think I always will. It’s a lovely thing to win an Oscar, but it’s not a fundamental change to who you are or your own insecurities.”The Arquette family lived for a period on a commune in Virginia when she was a child. What values from that time have stayed with her? A love of nature and “a relationship with the dirt and the soil, lying on your back and watching clouds, looking at stars and watching meteorites. Climbing trees when the first cherries come out. Quiet and solitude too – I’m comfortable with quiet and solitude.” That period taught her that life is “not about material objects or material success, but a community and connection that goes beyond all of that. Art was a big part of that.”It wasn’t all idyllic – it was a community of humans, after all, and as we have already established, humans are a disaster. Arquette says she was mostly insulated from any tensions as a child, but “it started to become obvious, especially as time went on, that there were issues. Like, we were all poor.” There were resentments about who contributed more financially than others. “My dad said: ‘You try to create this ideal society, and then you bring in the seeds of society with you.’ You’re not escaping society.”View image in fullscreenArquette and Christian Slater in True Romance, which was scripted by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyWhen the family moved to Los Angeles, it was a culture shock. She remembers being asked by a child at school what kind of car her dad drove; she had no idea there were different models, and what that meant. “These jeans are better than those jeans, this watch is better than that watch. I really didn’t understand any of that. I think I kept that with me. I appreciate beautiful things – don’t get me wrong – but I also understand it doesn’t matter.”Honestly, the grossest things that have happened to me did not happen in this businessDid that drive her career decisions? Arquette’s first few films were indies – perhaps she wasn’t bothered about earning money? Not so, she says. “For sure, I wanted to make lots of money because, being a single mom at 20, I know how scary it is when your rent’s due, or your baby needs to go to the doctor and having to borrow from people. Making money was very important to me. I wanted to work with great directors and interesting material, but sometimes you just have to pay your rent and you go for the opportunity, whatever it is.” That said, as her career started to take off afterTrue Romance, Arquette says she turned down more commercial lead roles. “They were boring parts, it felt not that fun to play. I wasn’t interested in the girlfriend parts.”Navigating the film industry as a young woman wasn’t much different from anywhere else, she says. “Honestly, the grossest things that have happened to me did not happen in this business. I grew up at a time when the whole world was pretty blatantly creepy.” You had to be tough, she says, to cope with “racy jokes and people commenting on your body, or even brushing past you or touching you in a certain way. I would have gone crazy if I took it all personally. I feel like my whole life was a bit of a booby trap of all of that stuff.” She clarifies: “My younger life. Now, no. When you’re old, you’re OK.” She laughs. Not that Arquette, who is 56, considered herself beautiful in her 20s, she says, but she was aware that others thought so, “and how dangerous it was. My beauty in the world was dangerous for me, and scary.”View image in fullscreenArquette and Ellar Coltrane in Boyhood, 2014, directed by Richard Linklater.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyShe has always been interested in challenging the idea of beauty, she says – this was a child who refused to have her teeth straightened. “Looking certain ways really impacts how my characters are treated in their lives, and how they perceive the world … This is part of how I tell the story of different human beings.” In Boyhood, it was striking to watch herself age in real time over the 12 years it took to shoot, but it would have made no sense for her character, a struggling single mother, to look like a Hollywood star, facelift, expensive tweaks and all. In Escape atDannemora, the television crime drama directed by Ben Stiller, Arquette looked unrecognisable as prison worker Joyce “Tilly” Mitchell . Is it more acceptable for female actors to age on screen now? “I think there’s definitely a lot of people that haven’t done [cosmetic surgery], and they work a lot, and they are beautiful,” says Arquette. “And there are some people that have done that work, and they are beautiful and they also are working. There’s not one group that I don’t respect as women.” Of course she has felt pressure, she says. “As a feminist, I feel like everyone gets to do whatever the fuck they want with their own face and body. I’m not saying I won’t ever have a facelift.” It’s just that in her varied career, it “hasn’t made sense in any of the parts that I’m playing”.View image in fullscreenArquette in Medium, 2005, her first television lead role.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyArquette was one of the first film stars to move to TV, playing the title role inMedium, the supernatural crime thriller. People couldn’t understand it, she says. “‘Why did you go to TV? You used to make movies’,” she mimics. “But I was interested in trying to see if you could do good work on TV.” She foresaw that the kind of mid-budget and arthouse films she loved were in trouble, and wasn’t snobby about appearing on network television. “My great-grandparents were in vaudeville, and I thought: why can’t we entertain the masses?” Anyway, by then she was in her mid-30s and wasn’t finding many fulfilling film parts. “You’re not the object-of-desire girlfriend age any more, but the wife parts are super boring. TV was different – it was interesting, the parts for women.”For the last few years, although not deliberate, Arquette has been “exploring the shadow side of women”. She has done it in Escape at Dannemora and The Act, in which she played a mother with Munchausen’s Syndrome by proxy, and even Severance. In her own life, there has been a shift, too. “My kids are grown up now. I’m not in a relationship. I’m not sure, politically, what’s happening in America. I’m like, where do I want to live? I’m in a weird moment in my life where I don’t know what I want to do.” Far from making that sound disorienting or paralysing, Arquette makes it sound full of possibility.Severance is on Apple TV+Explore more on these topicsThe G2 interviewPatricia ArquetteDramaTV streamingApple TV+TelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In early February, he was shot and killed and the identities and motives of those responsible are still unknown.ReporterJamie Fullertonmet and visited Imam Muhsin at his Inner Circle mosque. He tellsHannah Moorethat in person Muhsin was “pure love” and describes the inclusive community-building and wedding officiating that the imam undertook, as well as the scriptural foundation that his practice was based upon.Imam Muhsin chose ‘faith over fear’ and this led him into debates with Islamic leaders as well as to support sessions right across the African continent, where he helped other queer Muslims reach a place of self-acceptance.

He returned at around 4pm. At about 11.15am on Sunday, Scott left the hotel again.A colleague called Scott’s UK-registered phone number at around 6pm, but it was off. A missing person police report was filed on Sunday evening and a search began.Capital News in Kenya reportedthat detectives from the country’s Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said Scott was last seen at a club in the upmarket Westlands area of the city before he vanished.DCI believe Scott visited a bar in the area the day before his disappearance and that he returned to the venue on the day he disappeared to meet a friend, before taking a taxi to Pipeline, one of the city’s biggest slums, shortly after 7pm. Police believe Scott was held at a house in Pipeline, possibly while his abductors attempted to siphon money from his bank accounts.Scott’s professional profile says he joined Fico in 2014, from Experian UK. He is described as being responsible for global regulatory and compliance product management, based at the company’s London office. He studied at Woodmill high school in Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy technical college.Before the discovery of the body, Fico said they were working with local partners and authorities to investigate the matter.They added: “Our thoughts are with Campbell’s family and friends. Please respect his privacy and do not speculate about this situation. If anyone has information that may be helpful regarding his whereabouts, please contact local authorities or the Metropolitan police.”The Foreign Office was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsKenyaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In Goma alone, a city of 2 million people and a humanitarian hub for those who have been displaced, the fighting killed nearly 3,000. Those injuredhave overwhelmed medical facilities, with patients with gunshot and shrapnel wounds cramming into hospitals.Last week, theUN human rights office accused M23 rebels of killing three childrenin Bukavu.On Sunday, the DRC’s communications minister, Patrick Muyaya, said thatRwandaand M23 had killed more than a dozen people in Goma.More than 40,000 people, mostly women and children, havefled to Burundiin February because of the conflict, including more than 9,000 in a single day.M23, which is made up of Tutsis who left the Congolese army more than 10 years ago, is one of more than 100 armed groups fighting against Congolese forces in the mineral-rich eastern DRC.View image in fullscreenCongolese police officers who have reportedly switched their allegiance to M23 and are going to be retrained under the militia.Photograph: Michel Lunanga/AFP/Getty ImagesThe group has more than 8,000 fighters, according to the UN, which has accused neighbouring Rwanda of backing the militia and said the fighters were supported by about 4,000 troops from Rwanda. Rwanda denies the claims.M23 says it is fighting to protect Tutsis and Congolese people of Rwandan origin from discrimination and wants to transform Congo from a failed state to a modern one. But analysts have said that is simply a pretext for Rwanda’s involvement, and suggested Kigali is actually motivated by designs on its neighbour’s mineral resources.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the year running to March 2024 alone, there were 2,180 assessments linked to witchcraft.The statistics, compiled by the National FGM Centre, come as the filmKindoki Witch Boyis released, telling the story of Mardoche Yembi, 33, who was accused of witchcraft as a child growing up in north London and subjected to an exorcism. Its release date also marks the 25th anniversary of the death ofVictoria Climbié, an eight-year-old girl who was tortured after accusations of witchcraft were levelled against her.Yembi hopes that the new film will encourage more of these children who are suffering behind closed doors to come forward.He said: “If a story like Kindoki Witch Boy had been out there when I was a child going through those experiences I would have felt less alone. I want this film to transform something that was bad into something good, to help other children going through the same thing. I hope children who are being accused will see that there is help out there and they can survive it.”Kindoki is one of several words used to describe the kind of witchcraft Yembi and Victoria were accused of along with terms sucha as djin, juju and voodoo.Victoria, who died on 25 February 2000, was brought to the UK by her great-aunt Marie-Thérèse Kouao, offering Victoria’s parents a European education. But Victoria was killed, after suffering prolonged and extreme abuse, by Kouao and her partner Carl John Manning.Killer shows no remorse at Climbié inquiryRead moreThey said she was possessed by evil spirits and she wasexorcisedby a pastor and forced to sleep in a bin bag in a freezing cold bathroom. At the time of her death, 128 separate injuries were found on her burned and malnourished body, in one of the most horrific cases of child abuse doctors had ever seen.She had come into contact with several health and social care services in the months before her killing. Manning and Kouao were jailed for her murder in 2001. Her death led to a child protection service overhaul.Yembi and Victoria were born just weeks apart and lived a few miles from each other in north London. Yembi was sent to the UK at the age of eight by his father from his home country of theDemocratic Republic of the Congoafter his mother died, to be looked after by relatives.Like many other children facing witchcraft accusations, Yembi was scapegoated for causing health and financial misfortunes in his relatives’ lives. Social services became concerned about him because his extended family said they wanted to send him back to DRC for an exorcism.Unlike Victoria, he did not experience physical abuse, but social services placed him with a foster mother who supported him for the next decade. He thrived in her care and now works to support young care leavers.The film, directed by Penny Woolcock, was shot over a period of nine days using a mix of professional and non-professional actors. Jeriah Kibusi plays Yembi and Fatmata B Jalloh plays herself as his foster mother.Yembi and Victoria never met, but he said that she had been very much in his mind while he had been working on the film.He said: “Part of this film is for her. She didn’t have a chance to make it. I want to keep her name alive.”Children accused of witchcraft can call Childline on 0800 1111 or NSPCC on 0808 800 500.Explore more on these topicsChildrenEnglandWitchcraftDemocratic Republic of the CongoFemale genital mutilation (FGM)ReligionAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He has been crusading to slash the US federal government’s size at the behest of the US president, who has consistently challenged Canada’s sovereignty since returning to the White House for a second presidential term on 20 January.Elon Musk’s demand that federal workers document what they do provokes chaosRead moreReed’spetition– filed on 20 February – accuses Musk of having “engaged in activities that go against the national interest of Canada” by acting as an adviser to Trump. Trump has invited the scorn of Canada’s 40 million residents by making threats about imposing steep tariffs on Canadian products and openly boasting about having the US annex the country, including shortly before its national hockey teamdefeateda selection of US opponents in a politically charged 20 February tournament final.The petition asserts that Musk’s alignment with Trump makes him “a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty”. It asks the Canadian prime minister,Justin Trudeau, to take away Musk’s Canadian passport and revoke his citizenship with immediate effect.Trump has often mocked Trudeau as “governor”, the title given to US states’ chief executives. And Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022 for $44bn to relish Trudeau’s announcement in January that he would resign as the head of Canada’s Liberal party after it selected a new leader, with the tech billionaire praising clips of the Canadian Conservative party chief, Pierre Poilievre.As the Canadian Press noted, petitions like Reed’s require 500 or more signatures for them to gain the certification necessary to be presented to Canada’s House of Commons and potentially garner a formal government response. Reed’s petition evidently had no trouble clearing that threshold, having collected about 203,000 signatures as of early Monday, with no indication that the number would soon stop rising.Canada’s House of Commons is scheduled to resume its work on 24 March, though the country could call for a general election before parliamentary members return. The signing period for Reed’s petition was set to expire on 20 June.As Canada’s CTV Newsreported, the country can revoke citizenship in certain cases, including in instances of fraud, people’s misrepresenting themselves or intentionally withholding information on an immigration or citizenship application. A person can also renounce their citizenship for various reasons, according to Canadianlaw.A person whose Canadian citizenship is revoke must wait 10 years to get it back again, CTV News added.Musk’s directive to ostensibly cut federal spending – after Trump lost re-election in 2020 to Joe Biden but then secured it in November at the expense of Kamala Harris – has affected hundreds of thousands of US government civil servants. The cuts include thousands at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense and Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Parks Service, among others.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A worker wrote a letter of complaint at the time saying the minister appeared to have been drinking, swore and called him a “loser” repeatedly, even forming an “L” with his fingers on his forehead.Bayly sent two apologies in reply, saying he “misread the moment” and meant his comments in a “light-hearted manner”. He reassured the worker: “I was not intoxicated when we met.”Despite stepping down as a minister after his latest encounter, Bayly said he would remain a member of parliament and looked forward to serving his electorate.The conservative government of the prime minister, Christopher Luxon, which took office in November 2023, is sagging in the polls as voters struggle with the rising cost of living.Luxon said the arm-handling incident happened on 18 February and he had accepted Bayly’s resignation on Friday, delaying the announcement to give the minister time to speak to his family and staff.“I think that’s been pretty quick, to move as fast as we have within the week. It’s pretty impressive,” he told reporters.The prime minister said Bayly told him he felt his actions “fell well short of the expectations he sets for himself”. Luxon said he appreciated that Bayly wanted to continue to be a lawmaker and thanked him for doing an “exceptional job” as minister.Asked if Bayly might one day return to a ministerial post, he told reporters: “Never say never.”Bayly was replaced as commerce minister by Scott Simpson, who had been the senior whip responsible for party discipline in parliament.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Adopted by the UN security council, the sanctions are designed to curtail Pyongyang’s program of exporting labour and goods to raise funds for its weapons programs.Some North Korean crew were allegedly kept at sea for up to a decade, transferred from vessel to vessel and often temporarily transferred to other ships to avoid being detected at foreign ports, with their salary given to their government.EJF identified the North Korean crew through photos, video, and interviews with 19 Indonesian and Filipino fishers who worked alongside them in the Indian Ocean.The North Koreans described in the EJF report were likely sent to work on the boats by their government, which is known to export its citizens as labourers. It is one of several forms of forced labour which the UN office of the human rights high commission sayshas become “deeply institutionalised”in the closed-off authoritarian country.Australian defence force officer stripped of security clearance over loyalty to IsraelRead more“Some of the North Korean crew told me that they work on Chinese fishing vessels to escape from military conscription,” one Indonesian fisher told the Guardian. “There are only two choices, to support the government by working in plantations or a government enterprise, or to work abroad on Chinese fishing vessels.”“My [North Korean] friend told me was that in seven years working on fishing vessels, they and their family were never given the money. The government takes the money and once they return the government builds them a house as compensation. They were not happy about the arrangement but they don’t have any option.”The fishers also described multiple at-sea transfers of the North Koreans and alleged attempts to hide them from detection by temporarily moving them to another vessel before going in to port.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“This indicates that vessel captains, and likely vessel owners, were aware that the use of this labour was prohibited,” said EJF. In 2022 six North Koreans and a Chinese boat captain were arrested in Mauritius for allegedly refusing to report the North Koreans’ entrance to the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One has 112 vertical launch cells and has reported anti-ship ballistic missile range of 540 nautical miles,” she said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailCollins said the information she had was that the vessels were not nuclear-powered and did not have nuclear weapons, or missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, onboard.“They’re not telling us what they’re planning,” Collins told RNZ. “We’re taking them at face value that they are undertaking normal transits when it comes to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, that they’re not breaking the law.“But as we’ve said, it is always better to give a lot more notice when it comes to live firing.”The Chinese navy notified the Australian defence department shortly before the drill on Friday.Collins told RNZ that assertions by China’s ambassador to New Zealand that appropriate advance notice of the drills had been given were “wrong”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It involved the ships changing formation and placing a target in the water, manoeuvring again, and then recovering the target. No live fire was observed, but the change in formation was consistent with a live-fire drill.On Saturday, New Zealand navy personnel advised live rounds were fired from a Chinese warship in international waters.Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on the weekend that senior defence officials were continuing to monitor the ships after they were first spotted moving south in international waters about 280km off Sydney on Thursday.The foreign affairs minister,Penny Wong, met with her Chinese counterpart and demanded to know why the vessels only offered limited notice before the firing was carried out.China’s actions are believed to have complied with international law and the Australian Defence Force advised there was no imminent threat to its assets or those of New Zealand.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandChinaAsia PacificAustralian militaryAustralian foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Because when we came into government, inflation has six in front of it, now it’s got a two in front of it,” he said, also citing record creation of jobs, real wage increases, tax cuts, and cutting the debt by $200bn.“If you don’t get the economy right, you don’t get other things right,” he said.Albanese gave a glimpse of what will likely be his stump speech of the campaign, spruiking the government’s commitment to universal child care, climate change and women’s economic equality.“We’ve restored our position with the world as well,” he said. “We were pariahs, we were in the naughty corner in international forums like the Pacific, we’ve restored those relationships.”Albanese addressedDutton’s announcementon Sunday that the Coalition would match Labor’s $8.5bn funding boost to Medicare, which will expand the bulk-billing incentive and make access to GPs cheaper.Albanese disagreed with a comment by host Patricia Karvelas that “It’s being matched by Peter Dutton, though, so you get it either way, right?”“No,” said Albanese. “Because [the Coalition] said before 2013, remember they got elected, Tony Abbott, famously [said] ‘No cuts to health, no cuts to education’. First budget: $80bn [of budget cuts] – 50 [billion] off hospitals, 30 [billion] off education.”There is a clear Trump doctrine.

People heckled you and you left very quickly.”“I was referring to today,” said a defensive Albanese. “I had a very warm welcome at the president’s home… and with all of the community leaders who were there.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsAnthony AlbanesenewsShareReuse this content"

The witness said someone in the group had yelled: “You smashed our windows, you black cunts.”The now-19-year-old said the ute had returned sometime later and “the three men jumped out”.Katrina was separated from her newborn twins for 33 days. NSW psychiatrists warn specialised support for mothers is in crisisRead moreShe said the trio had continued yelling about the smashed windows and the teenagers denied having a hand in it.“I remember seeing all of them walk back towards the car to grab weapons,” she said. “Really skinny kind of long poles.”The witness described one of the men as muscular and said the other two were skinny. “The boys started running and the men were chasing after them,” she said.She also said Cassius had been among the teenagers fleeing from the men and that they had fled into bushland near the Tafe.The witness said the muscular man and one of the skinny men ran into the bush after the boys with metal poles.She said Cassius later emerged from the bush and he was “holding his head and it was bleeding down like his head and his ear, and he was crying”.Ben Stanwix, for the prosecution, has previously said Gilmore got out of the ute before it returned to the teens and that Brearley, armed with a metal pole, attacked two teens in the group. He then climbed back into the ute with Palmer and Forth, Stanwix has told the court, and drove after some of the other teens in the group who had run across the grassy open space.Cassius had been among them, Stanwix said, and Brearley, who was “hunting for kids”, had struck him on the head at least twice. One blow split his left ear in half and another cut his forehead.Stanwix said Brearley “was filled with fury about his broken car windows”, which happened a day earlier, and about threats communicated via social media that a group of “kids” could damage the home he shared with Gilmore.Prosecutors have told the court that Forth, Palmer and Gilmore had helped Brearley and knew his intent.The smashed car windows were part of a series of escalating tit-for-tat incidents that started on 9 October, the court has been told, when some of the accused allegedly “snatched two kids off the street” and unlawfully detained them, punching, kicking and stabbing one of them.This was triggered by a“love triangle”involving Gilmore’s 14-year-old brother and another teen of similar age, the court has heard, and social media exchanges about the boys fighting.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsWestern AustralianewsShareReuse this content"

Democrats branded the move a “disgrace”.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Macron saidEuropewas prepared to provide security guarantees to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire including peacekeepers, although they would not be sent to the frontline.UN general assembly backs resolution condemning Russia for Ukraine warRead moreTrump said he saw no objection to European troops being sent to Ukraine to serve as peacemakers, adding that he had raised the idea with Putin. “Yeah, he will accept it,” the US president said. “I’ve asked him that question.“Look, if we do this deal, he’s not looking for more war. He doesn’t mind. But I’ve specifically asked him that question. He has no problem with it.”Trump last weekbrandedthe Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a “dictator” and falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war, signalling a fundamental breach with Europe.At a joint press conference in the East Room, he told reporters. “It’s time to end this bloodletting and restore peace. We’ve had some great conversations, including withRussia… Our focus is on achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible and ultimately a permanent peace.”The US president claimed he had made more progress in the past month than was made in the previous three years. “I believe that Emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues,” he said. “Europe must take a central role in ensuring the long-term security of Ukraine.”Macron responded that he thought he and Trump had “made very substantive steps forward” in their discussion but stressed that peace “must not mean a surrender of Ukraine or ceasefire without guarantees”.Meanwhile, Putin on Monday also signalled that he was not opposed to Europe’s involvement in the talks. In a televised interview reported by Agence France-Presse, the Russian president said: “Not only European [countries] but other countries too have the right and can take part.”Trump and his team have been negotiating a minerals revenue-sharing agreement with Ukraine to recoup some of the money that the previous administration had sent to Kyiv to repel Russia.Earlier, in the Oval Office, Trump described the minerals deal as “very close” and said he might meet Zelenskyy soon to seal the agreement.“He may come in this week or next week to sign the agreement, which would be nice,” Trump said, adding that he would also be meeting Putin at some point.Zelenskyy last week rejected US demands for $500bn in mineral wealth from Ukraine to repay Washington for wartime aid, contending that the US had supplied nowhere near that sum so far and offered no specific security guarantees in the agreement.Asked if Ukraine should be willing to cede territory to Russia as part of a negotiated end to the conflict, Trump said: “We’ll see,” and noted that talks were just beginning.Macron became the first European leader to visit Trump since he regained power a month ago. He was at the White House for a morning session that lasted an hour and 45 minutes, including both leaders participating in a video conference with other G7 leaders about Ukraine.The pair projected cordiality but clashed when Trump made false claims about the funding of the war. He said: “Just so you understand, Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine. They’re getting their money back.”Macron leaned over to touch Trump’s arm and interjected: “No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60% of the total effort. It was like the US: loans, guarantees, grants. We have $230bn in frozen assets in Europe, Russian assets. But this is not collateral of a loan because it is not our belonging. So they are frozen.”Trump responded: “If you believe that, it’s OK with me. They get their money back, and we don’t. But now we do.”During the joint press conference, Trump said: “Before I came here there was no communication with Russia whatsoever. Russia was not answering calls … But when I got here one of the first calls I made was to President Putin and we were treated with great respect and they want to end this war, so that’s a big thing.He added: “I think it’s to the very much benefit of Russia to make a deal and to go on with leading Russia in a very positive way.”But Macron warned: “I think it’s super important to go to the peace. But my strong point was to say: ‘Let’s try to get something first which can be assessed, checked and verified.’”He added: “We want peace, but we don’t want an agreement that is weak.”In an interview with Fox News after his visit with Trump, Macron said a truce betweenUkraineand Russia “could be done in the weeks to come”. He also praised Zelenskyy’s leadership and said it was crucial for Trump to meet with the Ukrainian president.The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, is to visit Trump later in the week, amid alarm in Europe over Trump’s hardening stance toward Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year-old conflict.That alarm deepened on Monday when the US voted against a UN resolution condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine and calling for the nation’s occupied territory to be returned. The UN general assembly passed the resolution by an overwhelming margin.Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator who co-led a bipartisan delegation to the recent Munich security conference, said: “This vote is a disgrace. Trump’s senseless betrayal of the alliances that have kept Americans safe since world war two and his fealty to the murderous aggressor Putin are a national security threat.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyUkraineEuropeEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpVladimir PutinRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Now we must get the fundamentals right,” he added.Pressed by reporters over whether Starmer had meant Trump’s explosive interventions had changed things for the better or worse, his spokesperson said: “Absolutely for the better. He’s brought about these talks that could bring lasting peace in Ukraine, which is what we all want to see.”On Monday, Britain announced the largest package of sanctions againstRussiasince the early weeks of the full-scale invasion. Starmer said he hoped to force Putin “not just to talk, but to make concessions”.The prime minister told the Ukrainian president and European leaders that Kyiv “holds all the cards in this war”, a direct contradiction of Trump’s remarks last week that Moscow was in the position of strength.He repeated calls for Ukraine to have a seat at the table for any peace talks, and for aUS “backstop” to any agreement.UN general assembly backs resolution condemning Russia for Ukraine warRead moreIn aG7call on Monday that included Trump, Starmer underlined Britain’s support of Zelenskyy’s government. Downing Street said afterwards the prime minister had urged allied countries to increase their military support for Ukraine and their economic sanctions on Russia.But he was also careful to praise Trump. Starmer’s spokesperson said he had “welcomed the lead president Trump is taking on delivering peace, and [is] committed to working with him and other G7 leaders to deliver a just and lasting peace”.The UK left the door open to Russia eventually rejoining the G7, after Dan Jarvis, the security minister, appeared to signal it could while speaking to broadcasters. However, Downing Street made clear this would not happen while Russia was still occupying Ukrainian territory.“Our position on the G7 just hasn’t changed. We can’t countenance Russia joining the G7 whilst it has got illegal forces in Ukraine. That has been our longstanding position,” Starmer’s spokesperson said.Jarvis had told Times Radio that Russia rejoining the G7 would be “a matter to be discussed with international allies”. The security minister added that it would “no doubt” be considered once the Ukraine war was over.David Lammy, announcing the new sanctions package, said history had shown that Moscow would respond only to strength, rather than “paper promises”.Listing multiple security agreements that Russia had “betrayed” over the years, the foreign secretary added: “This is foreign policy by lies.”The Foreign Office said 107 new entities would face sanctions, including 40 “shadow fleet” ships and 14 “new kleptocrats”, including the Russian billionaire Roman Trotsenko, as part of the largest package since 2022.Among those sanctioned was No Kwang-chol, the North Korean defence minister, who was targeted as a result of his country’s decision to send troops to help the Russian war effort. The US and EU sanctioned No at the end of last year.The UK is also placing sanctions on the Kyrgyzstan-based Keremet Bank, the first non-Russian bank to be targeted, while companies in China, India and Turkey that supply tools and goods to Russia’s military were also listed.Separately, the Home Office announced a move to widen travel sanctions for Kremlin-linked figures, while the UK will put another £20m into medical and rehabilitation support for Ukrainians on the frontline.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsUkraineDonald TrumpKeir StarmerVolodymyr ZelenskyyG7EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now more than ever, it holds true: We must put Ukraine in a position of strength.”In an apparent sideswipe at Donald Trump’s administration after it began talks with Russia last week about ending the war that excluded Ukraine and Europe, he added: “For a just peace, the attacked country must be part of peace negotiations.”Merz, a known transatlanticist – a proponent of a close relationship between the US and Europe – later said that “all the signals we are receiving from the United States indicate that interest in Europe is decreasing”.“If those who really do not just make ‘America first,’ but almost ‘America alone’ their motto prevail, then it will be difficult,” he told reporters. “But I remain hopeful that we will succeed in maintaining the transatlantic relationship.”For many years, Berlin had resisted calls from Paris to build up Europe’s defence capabilities, feeling secure under the protection of the nuclear-armed US.However, Merz has made clear he felt Europe’s largest economy was facing a new era. “In particular following the announcements from Washington in the past few weeks, it’s clear that we Europeans now need to very hurriedly become capable to act,” he said.Men were more likely to vote for the AfDHe also made reference to interference from the Trump administration in Germany’s election campaign, calling it unacceptable. Elon Musk, the president’s close ally, congratulated the AfD’s candidate for chancellor after the anti-Islam party’s strong performance in the election. On Monday Musk posted on X: “It is only a matter of time before AfD wins.”The AfD won about twice the vote share it garnered at the last election three years ago. But it will not be part of negotiations to form a coalition government because of the “firewall” that has historically existed between mainstream parties and the far right.A jubilant Alice Weidel, the AfD’s co-leader and candidate for chancellor, called her party’s performance “historic” and decried Merz’s refusal to enter into coalition with the AfD as a “democracy blockade”, arguing that millions of voters were in effect disfranchised by the decision.The AfD did particularly well in the former communist east, where it secured 43 out of 48 available seats after campaigning vigorously on an anti-Islam, anti-immigration platform, and backing the “remigration” of immigrants and German citizens deemed to have poorly integrated.On Monday Merz, whose CDU/CSU alliance won 28.5% of the vote, said: “We need to see that we solve the problems in Germany together so that we step for step, deprive this party of its breeding ground.” If that failed, he said, referring to the next election, “we’ll have very different problems”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The CDU leader provoked controversy in January by relying on AfD support to get a non-binding migration policy through parliament.His hardline migration policies are diametrically opposed to those of the SPD, and the parties – who together would have a small majority in the Bundestag – are likely to engage in stormy negotiations as they try to thrash out a grand coalition.Many Germans fear a re-run of the last GroKo, as they are known, led by Angela Merkel between 2018 and 2021, which critics accused of a lack of ambition and failing to tackle pressing challenges such as economic and bureaucratic reform, defence spending increases and an infrastructure overhaul.Younger German voters are turning to the Left and AfDSunday’s election was bruising for all the parties in the incumbent government. The SPD, Germany’s oldest political party, received its worst ever result, with 16% of the vote share. Scholz, who will remain as chancellor until Merz has formed a government, called the result “bitter”.The Greens garnered 11.6% of the vote, down three points from 2021. The market liberal FDP failed to reach the 5% threshold needed to get into parliament, as did the leftwing conservative Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW). The leftwing Linke party garnered 8.8%.Merz said he hoped to form a coalition by Easter in late April, stressing the urgency of the negotiations and saying: “The world is not waiting for us.”In his press conference, Merz also said he would ensure that the Israeli prime minister would be able to visit Germany without being apprehended, after a warrant was issued for his arrest by the international criminal court for alleged war crimes committed in Gaza.Merz called it “an absurd idea” that Benjamin Netanyahu should not visit Germany and said he had told Netanyahu as much by phone.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightOlaf ScholzEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He even joked that the only “great thing” the EU has done is to mandate that bottle tops should not be detachable.Uefa weighs up scrapping extra time for Champions League knockout roundsRead moreSpeakingto Delo, a newspaper from his home country of Slovenia, Ceferin began by praising his new expandedChampions Leagueformat, which he described as “perfect”. But he soon moved on to politics, and his perception that Europe is “losing out in every way” because of regulation and what he sees as moral grandstanding.“We should unite, but I don’t know if that is possible,” Ceferin says. “We should open up and stop regulating the market so much. No one, not even China, should be our enemy – and it isn’t – we should treat everyone as partners. We preach to others how they should behave, but we have a problem doing exactly that ourselves.“We are all fed up with political correctness. Here in the western world, freedom of speech no longer exists. You can no longer say what you think. On one hand, there are the rightwing populists who have a simple rhetoric – migrants are taking your jobs and engaging in crime, LGBT propaganda will make families nonexistent, they will destroy your children, and so on.“This is such simplistic populist rhetoric that anyone can understand it. On the other hand, almost all western mainstream politics (it is neither left- nor rightwing) and most of the mainstream media are addressing people from the intellectual and arrogant high ground.”Ceferin argued that, because “no one can say what they think any more, except standup comedians”, the counter-argument to rightwing populism is not being made. “Nobody talks to the people, nobody explains to them that people can love each other regardless of their sexual orientation, nobody explains to them that some people are uncomfortable in their own bodies, that migrants do indeed commit crimes, too, but they are punished like everyone else. Mainstream politics should ask itself what it is doing wrong to make all this happen. You cannot say to people to not talk about it any more.”He was also critical of “mainstream politics, especially by the left wing” in causingUefato abandon plans to reintroduce Russian teams to European youth competitions two years ago. “The media started attacking Uefa and everyone backed off, saying: ‘We would support the idea, but the governments won’t let us.’ In reality, they did not let the children socialise. Politics generates hatred and intolerance out of self-interest, while speaking out against it.”European leaders gathered on Monday in Kyiv to mark three years of thefull-scale invasion of Ukraineand passed a motion in the UN condemning Russian aggression.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also rejected reports that the Champions League final will be staged eventually in the US after a media rights deal with the US agency Relevent. “They have not discussed moving the Champions League finals to another continent,” he said. “I probably would have known if we had negotiated it.”As for the Champions League, in which 36 teams have competed in a single league stage this season, Ceferin declared himself pleased. “I only heard positive responses. I estimate that 99% of people are now satisfied with the renewed Champions League. The competition is even more unpredictable than before, nobody knew until the very last moment whether they would qualify. It’s a perfect success, and the Champions League ratings are excellent.”Explore more on these topicsUefaFootball politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Last week, the US president falsely claimed that Ukraine started the war andlabeled Zelenskyy as “a dictator”, while the Ukrainian president expressed frustration over being excluded from US-Russia negotiations to end the war and accused Trump of livingin a Kremlin “disinformation bubble”.Several dozen people, holding Ukrainian flags and dressed in blue and yellow, stood in the crowd at Bowling Green park on Monday morning, and observed a moment of silence in between remarks delivered by representatives and organizers to commemorate the anniversary.“Today we mark three years of Russian barbaric invasion of Ukraine and unprecedented … large-scale war that[Vladimir] Putinunleashed on the European continent,” Serhiy Ivanchov, the consulate general of Ukraine in New York, told the crowd. “Three years of our resistance.“Unfortunately, the Russian unprovoked war continues andUkrainestill needs international support more than ever,” Ivanchov said. “Ukraine needs a reliable and clear system of security guarantees.”View image in fullscreenWounded members of Ukraine’s armed force help raise a Ukrainian flag in New York City on Monday.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianNew York City is home to the largest Ukrainian community in the United States, with about 150,000 Ukrainian New Yorkers.The city’s mayor, Eric Adams, who attended the Ukrainian flag raisinglast year,did not attend Monday’s ceremony, but sent two representatives from the mayor’s office of immigrant affairs in his place.Dilip Chauhan, the deputy commissioner for the mayor’s office for international affairs, read out a statement sent from Adams in which he said that Ukrainians “throughout the five boroughs have long enhanced life in our diverse city and they will continue to play a key role as we take bold steps to grow our economy and afford a safer, fairer and more prosperous future”.The mayor proclaimed Monday 24 February 2025, as Ukrainian Heritage Day, and said in his statement he was “honored and deeply moved on this anniversary to be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainian New Yorkers as we raise their flag and say in a single unified voice, united against aggression and ‘SlavaUkraine’ (glory to Ukraine)”.View image in fullscreenSerhiy Ivanchov (left) Dilip Chauhan (center) and Erick Salgado hold a proclamation from Eric Adams declaring 24 February 2025 as Ukrainian Heritage Day.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianAt the gathering two wounded Ukrainian soldiers were present. As the national anthem of Ukraine was performed and the Ukrainian flag was raised alongside the US flag, many attenders wiped away their tears.“We have gathered to remember a very solemn day that many of us will never be able to wrench from our hearts, hearts that many of us will never be able to put together,” Andrij Dobriansky, director of communications and media for the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, said.Among those in the crowd was Dasha Wilson, who had a Ukrainian flag wrapped around her shoulders.“I’m very proud of my country that we have withstood for three years,” said Wilson, who moved to New York 10 years ago. “I’m very appreciative for Americans for helping Ukraine.”View image in fullscreenPeople attend a Ukrainian flag raising on Monday.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianGiven the recent rising tensions between Trump and Zelenskyy, Wilson said that she hoped that the US and Ukraine would “remain good partners” and continue to “work together”.Last week’s geopolitical events shocked many Ukrainians at home andabroadas well as US lawmakers and allies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a reminder,Benjamin Netanyahuhas delayed the handover of 620 Palestinians indefinitely as he is demanding Hamas stop what he called its “cynical use of hostages for propaganda”.Naim – a member of Hamas’s political bureau - said the Israeli prime minister is “intentionally sabotaging” the truce agreement. Hetold Al Jazeera:Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step, which was releasing 620 prisoners, are already released.Because Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal; he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war.Therefore what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed upon number of Palestinians plus the 620 Palestinians?Basem Naim said Benjamin Netanyahu is preparing a return to Israel waging war on Gaza.Photograph: Ozan Köse/AFP/Getty ImagesThe release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were released on Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the Gaza ceasefire’s first phase. Five of the six hostages freed on Saturday had been escorted by masked, armed militants in front of a crowd – a display that the UN and Red Cross have criticised as cruel after previous handovers.Hamas had previously said it would release four bodies this week, completing the truce’s first phase, but this is now in doubt. Netanyahu has appeared reluctant to talk about the second phase of the three-stage ceasefire agreement, which would involve a complete Israeli military withdrawal fromGaza.People watch as Hamas fighters take position ahead of the release of Israeli hostages in Rafah, Gaza Strip, on 22 February 2025.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APShareUpdated at09.18 EST"

However, after more than three weeks of silence, we can no longer wait,” Entwistle said.“We’re now urgently calling on the British consulate to do everything in their power to get us answers and to put as much pressure as they can on the Taliban for their release.”The couple were arrested alongside a Chinese-American friend, Faye Hall, and an interpreter from their training business.A Taliban official said it would attempt to release the couple “as soon as possible”, the BBC reported.Abdul Mateen Qani said: “A series of considerations is being taken into account, and after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible.”Qani added that the three foreign nationals had Afghan passports and national ID cards.TheForeign, Commonwealth and Development Officesaid on Monday it was “supporting the family of two British nationals who are detained in Afghanistan”.Earlier, the BBCcited a Taliban officialas saying that two British nationals believed to be working for a nongovernmental organisation in Bamiyan had been arrested about 20 days ago after using a plane without informing local authorities.Entwistle said her parents had initially kept in touch via text messages after they were detained, and had assured their four children they were fine. However, contact stopped three days later. The family have had no contact with their parents for more than two weeks.The couple married in Kabul more than 50 years ago, and run Rebuild, “an Afghan-registered research and training business” that has been operating since 2009.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a ban on women working and on female education beyond primary school in the country, but this project had apparently been approved by the local authority.In an open letter to the Taliban, Entwistle and her three brothers said: “We do not understand the reasons behind their arrest. Our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded.”The Foreign Office advises against all travel to Afghanistan. It says there is a heightened risk of British nationals being detained there, and they could face imprisonment of months or years.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanTalibanForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeForeign policySouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

He was 93.Hill died at home in Belvedere,California, according to his publisher, Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. A cause of death was not given.Although few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on Abraham Zapruder’s chilling home movie of the assassination, provided some of the most indelible images of Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas on 22 November 1963.Hill receivedSecret Serviceawards and was promoted for his actions that day, but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy’s death, saying he didn’t react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save Kennedy.“If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess,” a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS’s 60 Minutes in 1975, shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. “And I’ll live with that to my grave.”It was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally start putting the assassination behind him and accept what happened.View image in fullscreenJohn F Kennedy slumps down in the back seat of the presidential limousine in Dallas, Texas, after being fatally shot, on 22 November 1963.Photograph: James W Ike Altgens/APOn the day of the assassination, Hill was assigned to protect the first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, and was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its way through Dealey Plaza.Hill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine.Zapruder’s film captured Hill as he leaped from the Secret Service car, grabbed a handle on the limousine’s trunk and pulled himself on to it as the driver accelerated. He forced Jackie Kennedy, who had crawled on to the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off.Hill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service, retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and recurring memories of the assassination.The 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller In the Line of Fire, about a former Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in part by Hill.Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn,North Dakota. He attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the army and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in 1958. He worked in the agency’s Denver office for about a year before joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and first family.Since his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the assassination only a handful of times, but the most poignant was his 1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several times.“If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn’t be here today,” Hill said.“You mean you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot?” Wallace asked.“The third shot, yes, sir,” Hill said.“And that would have been all right with you?”“That would have been fine with me,” Hill responded.In his 2005 memoir, Between You and Me, Wallace recalled his interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career.In 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN’s Larry King Live, where Hill credited that first 60 Minutes interview with helping him finally start the healing process.‘Conspiracies are just theories … not fact’: the Secret Service agent haunted by JFK’s shootingRead more“I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then thank him more because he’s what caused me to finally come to terms with things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,” he said. “It was because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to recover.”Decades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books – including Mrs Kennedy and Me and Five Presidents – about his Secret Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021.“We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for,” McCubbin Hill said in a statement. “We were soulmates.”Clint Hill also became a speaker and gave interviews about his experience in Dallas. In 2018, he was given the state of North Dakota’s highest civilian honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider award. A portrait of Hill adorns a Capitol gallery of fellow honorees.A private funeral service will be held in Washington DC on a future date.Explore more on these topicsJohn F KennedySecret ServiceCaliforniaJackie OnassisNorth DakotanewsShareReuse this content"

Fossil fuel use in buildings accounts fornearly a thirdof all US planet-heating pollution, and top UN climate scientists say building electrification must be the “dominant strategy” for decarbonization. Gas usage in the home has also been linked tochildhood asthmaand an array ofother health issues.“The fossil fuel industry is maliciously trying to promote their corporate interests, to the detriment of the safety of our children,” Gaurab Basu, a professor at Harvard Medical School, who did not work on the report. “We must fight back.”Reached for comment, Karen Harbart, CEO of the AGA, said climate advocacy groups were “willfully spreading misinformation on the safety of gas stoves and promoting ill-informed energy policy that would drive up prices and sacrifice environmental progress”. The industry would “continue to implement inclusive solutions to deliver life essential energy and reduce emissions for our customers and communities,” she said.The Guardian approached the National Propane Gas Association for comment.In July 2019, the city of Berkeley, California, became the first US city to ban gas hookups for heating and cooking in all new buildings. The groundbreaking policy inspired similar legislation in dozens of cities, includingNew York Cityand Los Angeles, as well as a 2023statewide banin New York.These measures sparked swift – and often successful – backlash from fossil fuel interests, which lobbied policymakers, took to the courts, and coordinated “front groups”, to overturn and prevent them, the researchers write.Within months of the Berkeley gas ban’s passage, the industry began lobbying for legislationin many statesto pre-empt cities from enacting similar measures. The American Gas Association and its members appear to have played an early role promoting these bills, InfluenceMap says.At least 26 states have now passed these policies.In November 2019 – less than two months before the Berkeley gas ban was meant to be enacted – the restaurateur trade group California Restaurant Association also submitted a lawsuit against the policy. The AGA filed a “friend-of-the-court” brief in support of the litigation.A court ultimately ruled in the plaintiffs’ favor. Berkeley agreed last year tooverturnits groundbreaking policy.The National Propane Gas Association has also sued New York state over its gas ban, and both a utility and a trade group representing fossil fuel companies have filed a legal challenge to asimilar measurepassed in a Maryland county. And in October 2023, the National Propane Gas Association announced a legal action fund to fend off “illegal governmental overreach that seeks to eliminate energy choice”.The industry has also funded pro-gas front groups for its campaigns, the researchers say. New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, which has fought city and state gas bans, for instance, counts utilities as members and receivesfundingfrom fossil fuel interests including a leading trade group. Coloradans for Energy Access similarlyliststrade groups and utilities as members and in 2021 itsboard of directorswas composed completely of utility representatives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The government last yearrolled backa plan to phase out gas cooking; the announcement about the decision “seemed to directly mirror industry asks”, Piziak said.The campaigns weren’t identical. In the US, industrypress releases, public statements and court filings usually framed gas bans as threats to consumer choice, the researchers found. Pro-gas Australia campaigns mostly centered around the purported need for fossil fuels to maintain energy affordability and reliability, whereas in the EU, the most common talking point was the need for “technology-neutral” policies.But the aims have been similar, and some actors may have even been involved in the pro-gas advocacy in multiple countries, the authors say. InfluenceMap compared the membership of the industry associations spearheading campaigns in the three regions and found at least one company, Shell, is a member key groups in the US, the EU and Australia. Several oil and gas companies belong to trade groups in two of the three regions. The true extent of this overlap is hard to determine due to lack of transparency from trade associations, the authors write.The Guardian has contacted Shell for comment.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentDemocracy and justiceFossil fuelsOilGasnewsShareReuse this content"

Her aging row home needs various repairs, while other costs associated with home ownership rose continually too.“I had to take out an additional mortgage to replace the heat and AC system,” she said. “I keep increasing the deductibles on the home insurance to try to keep the premiums down. They ratchet up every year, while my income does not. I won’t be able to do more repairs unless our circumstances change significantly. Our necessities consume 75% of my income, with 50% of that housing costs.”Affordable housing is in short supply across the US. Atlanta may have found a way forwardRead moreMeg was among scores of homeowners from across the US who shared with the Guardian how much they have been struggling with the rising cost of home ownership.Elevated mortgage and loan interest rates, exploding home insurance premiums andrising property taxesin many parts of the country, as well as higher costs for energy andeye-watering costsfor home maintenance works have flipped the dream of owning a home into a nightmare for many Americans.Homeowners who had assumed their properties would become valuable assets and provide security described their homes as “money pits” and “financial burdens”, and said they felt stuck in homes they could barely or no longer afford, with insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance now often costing more than people’s mortgages.“I’ve come to view home ownership and healthcare as destabilizing forces in my life,” said Bernie, a 45-year-old network engineer from Minneapolis. To finance owning his and his wife’s $300,000 home and saving for the future, the couple was foregoing medical and dental treatment of any kind and cutting back on expenses everywhere, he said, despite a pre-tax household income of more than $250,000.“In four years we plan to sell our home and move full-time into an RV,” Bernie said. “Our house provides no security.”Costs are overwhelming, if I could get rid of this house I absolutely wouldAmieAmie,44, a self-employed writer from rural Maine, purchased her $260,000 home in 2020, securing a 30-year fixed mortgage at an attractive 3.5% interest rate.“Although my mortgage is reasonable, the price for anything else is causing considerable financial stress for my partner and me,” she said.“Home oil costs are astronomical. The cost to make energy efficient repairs such as new windows, improved insulation, or heat pump installation are beyond our financial reach.“Quotes to redo our roof range between $65,000 and $140,000, more than I make in a year. Home equity loan interest rates are at 11% now around here, and I’m scared to commit to such a big loan at the risk of losing my house if I can’t pay the monthly fee.”Property taxes of about $4,000 annually are another worry. “They just went up again,” Amie said. “I recently had to create a payment plan for the electricity bills. If we could build a small holding on this land and get rid of this house I absolutely would. It’s completely overwhelming. I feel trapped.”Amie’s concerns were echoed by many who said they now wanted to rid themselves of homes that had become too expensive to own and maintain, but felt mostly unable to do so: selling and moving somewhere cheaper, various people said, would force them onto higher interest mortgages; others said they had considered going back to renting, but had concluded this was not feasible either due to exponentially rising rents in many parts of the US.View image in fullscreenStephanie moved across the US and gave up on traditional home ownership to escape unaffordable housing costs.Photograph: HandoutStephanie, a 49-year-old psychotherapist, sold her Massachusetts home and moved to Colorado, where she, her sister and her fiance purchased a manufactured home for $130,000.“It’s all we could afford given our student loans and my temporary disability due to multiple surgeries in seven months,” she said. “I don’t believe it’s feasible for me to own a non-manufactured home again. After I sold my last home, I walked away with only $200k, after 17 years of mortgage payments and large expenditures on upkeep.“While the resale value of manufactured homes can be very low, Stephanie hopes to evade costly repairs because of her new home’s simplicity, as well as the risk of falling into mortgage arrears in times of illness.Various older people who had either paid their homes off already or were expecting to be mortgage-free soon said they would likely have to sell and relocate to areas with lower taxes for homeowners, among them 60-year-old Angela, a product manager from a southern Chicago suburb.“I bought this house 19 years ago for $220,000,” she said. “If I’m lucky, I can sell it for $300,000.”Local house prices, she said, had not gone up by very much in all this time, in part because local property taxes were prohibitively expensive.I just did not expect my home insurance costs to go up like that in my retirementJane“We have this huge tax burden here, it has really gotten out of control. Property taxes increased by $3,100 last year. I now pay $8,800 per year on a home I can perhaps only sell for $280,000. I’m in a better position than most people and make a decent salary today, $170,000.“But I’m thinking – how do I afford these taxes in retirement? I’m cutting back on everything.”Anxious about her property taxes eating up funds she will need for her retirement, Angela has been exploring a move to a rural area with a lower tax burden.“But those very rural areas tend to be more conservative. This nation is so divided, I might be totally isolated in some of these places,” she said.View image in fullscreenJane, from California, is facing the loss of her home due to unaffordable fire insurance.Photograph: HandoutOlder homeowners said they had not anticipated having to meet such rapidly increasing home ownership costs when they had begun planning their retirement finances decades prior.Jane, 69, a pensioner from rural California, was among people who said their homes had become unaffordable primarily because ofsoaring insurance ratesin their natural disaster-prone areas.With approximately $100,000 of her mortgage still outstanding on a home that is in a high-risk fire area, her savings are being eaten up by fire insurance costs and she has taken on more credit card debt.“We bought the house in 2008 for $190,000,” Jane said. “The cost for fire insurance is skyrocketing, my rates jumped from $3,200 a year to $7,886 in October. Maybe I should have planned better, but fire insurance wasn’t a thing when I bought this property. I just did not expect costs to go up like that in my retirement.”Her fixed social security income of $2,000 also makes it tough to keep up with more expensive propane and electricity. “I had savings, but I only have enough for one more year, $10,000. I don’t know what to do. I’m very scared.”Jody, a mental health professional from Florida in her 50s, said she was among the many Americans who havegiven up on insuring their homes, as rates are increasingly unaffordable and coverage is too poor.I have no homeowners insurance, like many, many of my neighboursJodyHomeowners insurance on her mortgage-free manufactured home would cost $5,000, she said, with an annual deductible of $8,000 and coverage of maximally $60,000 – a lot less than it would cost to replace the home if it was destroyed.“As a result, I have no homeowners insurance, like many, many of my neighbors,” she said. “No average person, even in a dual income [household], can afford to own a home here anymore. I’m selling and moving back to Michigan.”When a tornado last year tore through the mortgage-free home of Connie Jones, a 63-year-old graphic artist from Wisconsin, her insurer of nearly 20 years declined to pay for most of the damage in the neighbourhood, forcing the family to take out loans of $19,500 for roof and fence repairs.“We will have to put off retirement to make the payments,” Jones said. “Owning our home is too expensive and we are considering other options.View image in fullscreenThe home of Connie Jones, purchased in 1997, was supposed to be a family asset, but has been swallowing large amounts of money over the years.Photograph: Connie Jones/Guardian Community“We’re debating whether to sell and move to a more affordable area or keep our property for an inheritance for our daughter. Property taxes are almost $4,000 a year and keep increasing. We really don’t know if it’s all worth it and definitely feel like we can’t balance all the costs of owning a home. We have enough equity [to buy again], however we are leaning more to renting our home in future.”I’ve had to take out a mortgage, as a senior citizen to pay off nearly $100,000 of high interest credit card loans I had to pay for the upkeep of the housePatriciaPatricia, a pensioner in her 70s from rural Massachusetts, was one of several people who said they had been forced to take on significant debt in old age to keep being able to meet their home ownership costs.Having built her three-bedroom house in 1985 for about $250,000, the property is now valued at between $450,000 and $525,000, an appreciation which, Patricia said, was being largely cancelled out by the ongoing, rising costs of owning the home.“I was mortgage-free from 1985 until 2025, but recently I’ve had to take out a mortgage, as a senior citizen, at around 10% interest to pay off nearly $100,000 of high interest credit card loans I had to pay for the upkeep of the house,” she said.Patricia now fears she will not be able to downsize eventually, as the proceeds of her home sale, after her property loan is deducted, will be too small to buy again in a small town in the area.I had considered finding senior roommates, but was forced out in the endBill HowardView image in fullscreenBill Howard at Jardín Botánico de Medellín in August 2023.Photograph: Bill/Guardian CommunityBill Howard, 67, was among various pensioners who said they had realised that staying in the US was financially no longer possible for them, as their fixed retirement incomes had no chance of keeping up with rising housing costs.He had tried to hold on to his late mother’s home in Reno, Nevada, which was increasing in value.“I had considered using a service to find senior roommates, but Reno is in a wildfire zone, my home insurance was rising. I knew I was not going to be able to sustain this,” Howard said. He maxed out several credit cards to fund home repairs in preparation for the sale, and moved to Medellín,Colombia, the day after the house went on the market.“I took two suitcases with me and started life over at 66 in July 2024,” he said. “It was incredibly painful to leave everything behind. There were many reasons why I wanted to stay; it felt like being forced out.”Fortunately, Howard now feels happy about the move, and is about to buy an affordable apartment in Medellín. “You go from being scared to death living in the United States to thinking: ‘OK, things will work out, because the cost of living here is lower’ – a few hundred a month instead of thousands.”View image in fullscreenMorgan, from Philadelphia, is no longer sure whether buying his home was a good financial investment.Photograph: Morgan/Guardian CommunityMorgan, a 36-year-old associate director of brand partnerships at a fashion company from Philadelphia, only recently got onto the property ladder, but now worries his house purchase may become a permanent financial drain.“My insurance just increased by $150 per month, and with higher utilities my total monthly home expenses have risen by about $300 to $400. I’ve depleted some of my savings,” he said.“I’ve had to prioritize discretionary expenses and have cut down the number of times per month I’m seeing a therapist. I have considered selling my house to cut down on expenses, but I only bought a year and a half ago and I’d prefer not to sell yet so I don’t lose money on closing costs.”The political andeconomic uncertaintyis further adding to Morgan’s concerns.“I worry,” he said, “that owning a home gives me less flexibility if there’s an emergency, or a financial crisis.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsHousingEconomicsCommunitiesColombiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many of Apple’s products that are assembled in China and imported to the US could face 10% tariffs introduced by the White House earlier this month, though the iPhone maker secured some waivers from China tariffs during the first Trump administration.It is not the first time the iPhone-maker has made a splashy announcement about a multibillion-dollar investment in theUS economyduring a Trump administration. In 2018, during the first Trump administration, Apple said its new and ongoing investments would contribute $350bn to the US economy over five years.This new injection of $500bn in expected spending includes everything from purchases from US suppliers to US filming of its television shows and movies for itsAppleTV+ service. The company declined to say how much of the figure it was already planning to spend with its US supply base, which includes firms such as Corning that makes glass for iPhones in Kentucky.Apple removes advanced data protection tool in face of UK government requestRead moreTrump, in a Truth Social post, thanked Apple and Cook, saying the move reflected the company’s faith in his administration.Though some of Apple’s components are made in the US – such as chips from manufacturers such as Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo – most of Apple’s consumer products are still assembled outside the US, particularly in China. A 10% tariff could drastically increase the cost of Apple’s flagship product, the iPhone, on its home turf.Apple said it last month started mass-producing chips of its own design at an Arizona factory owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC). “Apple is the largest customer at this state-of-the-art facility, which employs more than 2,000 workers to manufacture the chips in the United States,” the blog post announcing the investmentread.Bringing TSMC – which produces an estimated 90% of the most advanced semi-conductors in the world – toArizonaand helping introduce legislation that later became the Chips Act to bolster US semiconductor production were two of Trump’s biggest industrial policy moves during his first term. Now, Trump is reportedly planning on issuing changes to the Chips Act signed under the Biden administration, which promised $30bn in subsidies to manufacturers planning to build chips factories in the US. But Trump said he did not believe these companies, such as TSMC, needed money, but rather they needed an “incentive”, according to the Associated Press.“And the incentive is going to be they’re not going to want to pay at 25, 50 or even 100% tax,” Trump said.Apple said on Monday it would also work with Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, to build a 250,000 sq ft facility in Houston, where it will assemble servers that go into data centers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features that help draft emails and perform other tasks. Those servers are currently made outside of the US, Apple said. The company also said it will expand its existing data centers in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada.Apple said it planned to increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5bn to $10bn, with part of the expansion being a “multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon” at TSMC’s Arizona factory.Apple did not disclose details of its deal with TSMC, but it has in the past used the fund to help partners build out the infrastructure needed to deliver products or services for Apple.The announcement comes afterreportsindicated TSMC is in talks with Intel to acquire its chip-making plants – a move the Trump administration has encouraged, according to the New York Times. Intel has previously struggled to compete with TSMC and as it stands most of the company’s chips remain manufactured in Taiwan.Apple will also open a manufacturing academy in Michigan, where its engineers, along with local university staff, will offer free courses for small and mid-sized manufacturing firms in areas such as project management and manufacturing process optimization.Explore more on these topicsAppleDonald TrumpUS economyTrump tariffsArizonaManufacturing sectorTim CooknewsShareReuse this content"

The pilot will be putting his feet up and drinking tiny cans of Sprite from here to the middle of May. Sit back, zone out. Stick on a bad film with Seth Rogen in it. You can even watch the football if you like. Just don’t expect much to happen for the next three months.So much for that excitingly bumpy, turbulence-fuelled Premier League season, all perky upstarts, crumbling certainties and unexpected shifts of altitude, which really did seem to be shaping up just a few short weeks ago. As of game weekend 26 andArsenal’s defeat against West Ham, followed byLiverpool strolling through Manchester City, the league has reached a stage of premature entropy.Let them eat fruit: Manchester United close staff canteen in latest cost-cuttingRead moreIt is incorrect to suggest that the title race is over. Or rather, it’s only half correct. The title race is over, barring some kind of black swan collapse, Arne Slot deciding this is the perfect moment to reel out his Jazz Odyssey tactics phase. But lots of other things are over, too. In fact, pretty much the whole shebang.We know who is going to win the league. We know who is going to get relegated (another note of dulling certainty: the same three teams who came up). We know who’s going to come second.Manchester Citywill surely also end up in the top four, with midweek football now safely off the schedule.Jeopardy, then. What have we got? Five teams going for two (probably) Champions League places. You can almost hear the broadcasters changing tack already. Come feast on that Big Fifth Place Energy. Welcome to Lower Court Judgment Day. Mid-Tier Repeat or Revenge. Almost-Super Almost‑Showdown Sunday. It is, just as a reminder, still February.Looking down the table one thing does stand out. Why aren’t these teams better? It is necessary to be vigilant here, to resist the temptation to decide everyone is In Crisis, everyone is bad, everyone is a failure because they’re not the best. The In-Crisis klaxon is like the service buzzer in a chain hamburger restaurant. It flashes when it’s your turn. And we will get to everyone in the end.But still, something isn’t quite right. ThePremier Leaguecontains six of the 10 richest clubs in the world, or indeedevergiven the constant rise in riches. And yet the question remains. Who is good here? Who is thrumming with rude health? Who is building a dynasty from the bottom up? Who is reinventing the tactical blueprint?View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola in despair on the touchline as Liverpool’s defeat of his Manchester City team all but confirmed the title will be heading for Anfield.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APWe’ve gotLiverpool. We have an encouragingly ambitious tier between third and eighth place. But we also haven’t had a proper three- or four-pronged title race for years. Very few teams out there seem happy or well placed on their journey. The league is rich. The league is the greatest show on earth. But there is also no real sense of excellence here, of fresh competitive peaks being crested, at least not on the pitch. Why has this happened? And is it ever going to stop?There is one obvious answer. The Premier League is a competition invented by money, for the benefit of money, and for the future dissemination of money as yet unguessed at. And money does not in itself make you good at football.What is a good team in professional sport? Something built out of hard choices, struggle, time, chemistry. Make one of these and you will naturally make money too. It becomes a virtuous cycle. But there is a sense in the league right now that nobody really remembers how to do this, or has the time; or even that it no longer really matters, such are the benefits of just being grandly so-so.Football teams are product. That argument has been won. Really good, coherent, captivating football teams are something else. And while capitalism is very good at generating volume and revenue, the things it isn’t so good at making include painstaking, high-quality objects of beauty.The obvious example is the current version ofChelsea. On a register of performance versus money spent there is a fair argument this is the most inept example of team building ever conceived. Treat your team like a talent-grooming fund. Build a portfolio of players while demonstrating only the most basic grasp of what talent looks like, or how capricious and brittle it is. This is what you end up with, the Band Aid chorus line trying to make an album.It is a grotesque model – but one that is at least a logical extension of the league it represents. Too much flux, too many choices, too little in the way of extreme, ruthless competence. The same scattergun commercial hunger has transformed Manchester United into the sporting equivalent of a nuclear plant accident. Scroll down the league and short-termism and poor, flighty choices are the norm.The response to the failure of short-term team-building has been the trend for “philosophy coaches”, jobbing Euro-dudes with a vision and a promise of some kind of quick-fix, self-levelling team‑substance. Give me five years of Alex Ferguson creating a culture, but do it in three months. But even this is hampered by greed. Trying to introduce new systems and patterns midseason because you have no off-season, just tours and revenue-raising exercises. This is like trying to learn French on the way to the exam.Leicester City thought it was a good idea to appoint Ruud van Nistelrooy, who has spent the past two months mooning about like a sad dying vampire in a mid-90s romantic fantasy film. West Ham have spent too long not seeming to know what they want to look like, or how to make people feel good, thrashing about in search of “identity”, stasis, calm pockets of air.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But nobody really knows for sure.It seems obvious one part ofLiverpool’s success this seasonis born out of simple stability, the merits of just not changing much, recognising what is already good.Arsenal will be castigated for failing to buy a No 9when they couldn’t find the right one for the right price. This is poor management of a squad. But it is at least an attempt to do the right thing, to maintain control, to build rather than snatch at a finished, functioning team.It seems clear that there is a relationship between the lack of really high-functioning teams and the general poverty of Premier League ownership and administration. Perhaps it isn’t such a mystery so few footballing chief executives have any kind of profile outside the industry. Football-facing tycoons seem to be their own class, too. AsGraham Potter once said of the Chelsea ownership: “They must be clever people, they’re billionaires.”View image in fullscreenArsenal stumbled against West Ham, and are berated for not signing a No 9, but at least they have attempted to build a team under Mikael Arteta.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesIs this true? Clever billionaires tend to be the ones you’ve never heard of. Whereas at times you get the feeling English football is just incredibly lucky to have lived through the years of endlessly booming broadcast rights, the tide that raises all ships. You can accidentally set fire to the sails, tear down the rigging. The product will protect you.At least, it has up to now. It is no secret the Premier League’s success has been toxic for aspects of the rest of the football world, ripping out talent and expertise, diminishing other leagues. The sense that the domestic league could also sabotage itself, disrupt its own competitive edge, is easily ignored by those who stand to benefit from its financial rewards in the short term.The way to preserve that core product is obvious enough: more, not less, regulation. The PSR regime may be unpopular with those who wish to hurl money at the wall, or distort the free market by harnessing the subsidies of a nation-state. But the rules have also given us the best of the league right now, that raft of peppy, well‑run clubs such as Bournemouth and Brighton who have managed to combine expertise and income into a coherent whole.More of the same would be one way of throwing a lightning bolt through a stagnant league. A cap on salaries, even more rigorous transfer spending rules, incentives to build and produce a team rather than conjure one out of the fire, with the aim always of invigorating competitive balance. Which is, after all, the one thing you need to keep people interested.For now the Premier League does seem to have found an unexpected solution to fixture overload, player fatigue and the dilution of the spectacle. Too many games? Just end the season as a contest in February and play out three months of semi-exhibition stuff. It should at the very least keep everyone fresh for the Super League.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolChelseaManchester CityFinancescommentShareReuse this content"

There are even fewer who can share how they prepared to hit a college court as an early enrollee, starting on a team with players three to four years older than them.There are fewer still who had all that under their belts and then suffered a season-ending (and potentially career-ending) injury a year later – and who bounced back in such a tremendous way.Notre Dame point guard Olivia Miles is pretty special. Despite the fact that she may overtake Paige Bueckers as this year’s No 1 pick in the WNBA draft, the 22-year-old is still low-key. She’s not a household name and it’s not apparent she wants to be, but if you follow women’s college basketball, she’s inescapable.Everything was going Miles’ wayuntil she suffered a major knee injuryin February 2023. She had committed to Notre Dame as the No 8-ranked player in the 2021 recruiting class, and even enrolled early, beginning her first basketball season soon after her 18th birthday. As the team’s starting point guard, she averaged 13.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and 7.2 assists; and became the second freshman in the school’s history to post a double-double.Her sophomore season started out powerfully. Before her injury, she averaged 14.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and 6.9 assists per game; after it, she was named the All-ACC first team. Suddenly she was sidelined for the foreseeable future with a torn ACL, forced to endure painful surgeries as Hannah Hidalgo stepped into her spot and began to dominate.Miles wasn’t back on the court until November 2024, but instead of ceding control to Hidalgo, the pair put the team first and have since built one of the most dominant backcourts in college hoops today. Miles is known for her elite passing – she’sdrawn comparisonsto Portugal’s Ticha Penicherio, who played in the WNBA for the Sacramento Monarchs – and she’s at her most fluid as a basketball player when she has the room to think ahead and map out several scenarios, the Doctor Strange of women’s basketball.But to understand Miles’ game, it’s helpful to go back to her freshman year at Blair Academy in New Jersey. Her coach, Quint Clarke, says he knew Miles was special when he first saw her play as an eighth grader, but “after four or five practices, it was clear she was something unique”.Clarke adds: “I had never seen a player with her style, flair, or creativity. Everyone who walked into our gym would be drawn to her game, and she quickly became a fan favorite.”He also offers insight into how Miles plays the way she does now for Notre Dame: with plenty of intention. “All that crazy stuff she does in games, she practices that,” Clark explains. “She imagines it and has options mapped out in her head … Good players react to the game; great players anticipate the game, but Olivia was the only player I’ve ever coached who would manipulate the game. Her ability to read the game was almost supernatural, and she frequently made plays in practice that had the rest of us laughing in amazement.”View image in fullscreenOlivia Miles of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish drives to past Ahnay Adams of the Miami Hurricanes during the fourth quarter last week at the Watsco Center in Coral Gables, Florida.Photograph: Sam Navarro/Getty ImagesThe style of play is akin to that of Luka Dončić says international basketball trainer Tremaine Dalton. “She manipulates the game in her own way; she can change pace, she can pass, she can score. Olivia can see the floor in a way that’s different. Other players that are trying to anticipate what she wants to do, but she’s already ahead of them.”At this point in the collegiate season, there are three things most athletes in Miles’ position are focusing on: the next game they’ll play, how the season is going as a whole, and the looming NCAA Tournament. To be preoccupied with the WNBA draft and her rank would be foolish and a distraction, but to pretend that it’s not right there in front of her face would be dishonest.It’s a scenario that other top draft picks have had to contend with. Alexis Hornbuckle, who was drafted out of Tennessee by the Detroit Shock in 2008 as the fourth overall pick, remembers the feeling. Hornbuckle was drafted along with her teammate, Candace Parker, who went first overall.“For us, especially for Candace and I, we were still focused on one thing: a national championship,” she says of the months leading up to the draft. “Yes, we were excited, but we had unfinished business. So being able to stay focused on the task at hand was our main focus, and that’s likely true for Olivia and the other young ladies being drafted this year.”Then-Tennessee coach Pat Summit was also instrumental in keeping her focused. “You don’t believe the hype until you finish what you said you’d do,” Hornbuckle adds. Miles, she says, “seems to be very focused on what she wants and is willing to work hard to ge tit, and I think she understands the talent and gifts that God blessed her with.”Angel McCoughtry, who was drafted as the first overall pick in the 2009 draft by the Atlanta Dream, says there’s a lot happening before and during the draft. First and foremost, at this point, Miles is likely focused on the regular season, but the draft is dancing in the periphery. Hearing your name called at the draft is rewarding, she says, because “it shows all your hard work, sweat, and tears pays off.”Off the court, Miles is the exact person she seems to be, Clarke says. “The joy she gets from her teammate’s success – that is genuine,” he says. “The happiest I ever saw her in a game was when our manager got in once and hit a three.” It’s that spirit, that empathy, combined with her prodigious skill that makes Miles such an intense threat on the court and a fascinating prospect for the WNBA.Whether or not Miles snatches Bueckers’ presumed spot at the top of the draft remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain: basketball fans had better get used to hearing her name.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsBasketballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They even share the status of beingdiscarded by Chelsea, but Sunday’s match may be where their paths finally diverge. Salah delivered a goal and an assist while De Bruyne was a shock selection,unused by Manchester City in Madrid. On Friday Pep Guardiola hinted the Belgian’s time at the club was done. If Sunday was a last hurrah, De Bruyne misfiring passes and chasing shadows was a brutal reminder of how time catches up with even the very best. Where the Belgian exhibits physical decline from sheer miles on the clock, Salah, just a year younger, played to his peak, often buzz-sawing into midfield areas De Bruyne once commanded. The Egyptian king’scontract situationremains at an impasse, the sense being he awaits the right offer from Liverpool. De Bruyne may now be reduced to mere cameos as Guardiola rebuilds, a sad coda.John BrewinMatch report:Manchester City 0-2 LiverpoolView image in fullscreenMohamed Salah with Dominik Szoboszlai after setting up Liverpool’s second goal at City.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/Reuters2Arsenal lose heads in costly defeatYou could sense the anxiety creeping in at the Emirates on Saturday before Jarrod Bowen scored what proved to be the winner for West Ham. That had only increased by the time Mikel Arteta hauled off Declan Rice and Riccardo Calafiori after 10 minutes of the second half, with Myles Lewis-Skelly lasting 17 minutes from the bench before being sent off. It was the fifth red card for Arsenal this season in thePremier League– two more than anyone else – and once again contributed to them dropping points as they desperately try to make up ground on Liverpool. Arsenal’s lack of composure this season when they go behind or are reduced to 10 men may prove to be their downfall and Arteta will hope they can regroup in time for the crucial trip to Nottingham Forest on Wednesday evening. “We have to keep going, still many points to play for,” said the captain, Martin Ødegaard. “We can’t feel sorry for ourselves and have to learn from this.”Ed AaronsMatch report:Arsenal 0-1 West Ham3United face long road back to eliteManchester United club staff, some with decades of loyal service, have lost their jobs for this? Cost-cutting by Sir Jim Ratcliffe is not going to re-establish the club among the elite any time soon, given how far they have fallen behind and how onerous the task confronting Ruben Amorim is. Everton should have condemned Amorim’s team to a third consecutive league defeat long before they were left bewildered by the 96th-minute penalty incident. The video assistant referee’s failure to show Matthijs de Ligt’s shirt-pull on Ashley Young to referee Andrew Madley on the pitchside monitor, and to instead focus purely on Harry Maguire’s tussle with the veteran, was inexplicable. It was a huge let-off for United and Amorim, who again spoke of needing to “survive this season” before planning ahead. “We have so many problems,” he added. A squad unsuited to its manager’s requirements is one of them, and United do not have the resources for the extensive rebuild needed. It is a long way back from here.Andy HunterMatch report:Everton 2-2 Manchester United4Maresca searching for net gainEnzo Maresca stopped short of saying Filip Jörgensen would keep his place after the goalkeeper’s howler gifted Aston Villa victory. Maresca dropped Robert Sánchez last month after a series of errors but now the Chelsea manager must decide whether to restore him in goal againstSouthamptonon Tuesday. With Kepa Arrizabalaga and Djordje Petrovic out on loan, third-choice Marcus Bettinelli – whose only appearance for the club was more than three years ago – is Maresca’s other option. Jörgensen made a couple of smart stops at Villa Park, chiefly to deny the substitute Donyell Malen before the corner that led to Marco Asensio’s winner, but his error ultimately cost Chelsea. Asked if he would keep faith with the 22-year-old, Maresca replied: “I don’t know. It’s not [because of] today’s mistake that I’m going to change the idea about Filip. This is a moment where we need to support each other and continue to work hard.”Ben FisherMatch report:Aston Villa 2-1 ChelseaView image in fullscreenThe Chelsea goalkeeper Filip Jörgensen saves a shot by Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa.

Over the past six months he has visibly matured from an uncertain, almost ephemeral presence to a player of real substance, a tireless runner and aggressive tackler but also a passer of genuine quality; his pass completion rate against Ipswich was 85%. Saturday was only the 19-year-old’s seventh start in the league, although he has been picking up experience in the Carabao Cup and the Europa League, but he is already an assured figure alongside Rodrigo Bentancur. Ange Postecoglou’s preferred midfield at the moment appears to be Bergvall and Bentancur plus a creator. There hasn’t been much good to come out of this season for Tottenham but it may be that, in time, the case hardening of their fleet of teenagers will work to their advantage.Jonathan WilsonMatch report:Ipswich 1-4 Tottenham6Howe’s boss sees Newcastle hang onEddie Howe might have chosen a different performance for the Newcastle chair, Yasir al-Rumayyan, to witness after flying from Riyadh. Although his team beat Nottingham Forest 4-3 at St James’ Park they were clinging on at the end having led 4-1. “It was good to see the chairman but he might have heard a couple of swear words from me,” said Newcastle’s manager. “I think he was in the same sort of emotional state though.” Al-Rumayyan is also here for talks on whether Newcastle stay at a rebuilt St James’ Park or seek planning permission for a new home nearby. Several of Howe’s team may have retired by the time a new stadium is built, but do not bet against Lewis Miley having established himself as the star of England’s midfield.Louise Taylorskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it is certain that – to the presumed relief of Manchester United and West Ham – for the second consecutive year, the three promoted clubs are surely going back down. More troublingly still, at no point has there been much more than an outside chance that Ipswich, Leicester or Southampton might survive. Two seasons may be a small sample size, but with Leeds, Sheffield United and Burnley contesting the Championship’s automatic promotion slots, the sense is that the top division is increasingly hard to access and even harder to remain in. That is not the sign of a healthy competition.Daniel HarrisMatch report:Southampton 0-4 BrightonView image in fullscreenDejected Saints players during their latest heavy defeat.Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC/Getty Images8André a giant presence for PereiraVictory at Bournemouth was a coup for Vítor Pereira, with Wolves unrecognisable from the tactical anarchy that was often on display under Gary O’Neil. It also offered a blueprint for those looking to stop Andoni Iraola’s previously runaway train. Having Matheus Cunha certainly helped, the Brazilian a magnet for the ball in those moments when Wolves were relieving the pressure on the defence. His winning goal was the finish of a forward full of confidence, but another Brazilian, the midfielder André, was praised by his manager. “I give freedom to the other midfielders but André is the player who balances the space between the lines,” said Pereira. A star of the Fluminense team that won the 2023 Copa Libertadores, André was linked with moves toManchester Cityand Liverpool only to pitch up at Molineux. His assimilation at Wolves has been gradual, but the player who had scouts flying to South America has begun to show what he can do.John BrewinMatch report:Bournemouth 0-1 Wolves9Stylish Lacroix looks a steal for PalaceMaxence Lacroix is a fine player. Tall, imposing and quick across the ground, theCrystal Palacedefender was excellent during his side’s 2-0 win at Fulham. Raúl Jiménez was barely given a sniff of goal. The Fulham striker did break through when it was still 1-0 in the second half but he was denied by a superb covering challenge from Lacroix. It was expert defending and it is not a surprise that Palace are so difficult to break down on their travels. Their unbeaten away run in the Premier League stretches back to October and the foundations are laid by their solid back three. Chelsea cutting Trevoh Chalobah’s loan short has not made a difference. Chris Richards is doing well, Marc Guéhi is as smooth as ever and Lacroix, who joined from Wolfsburg last summer, looks a smart buy. Why were other teams not in for him?Jacob SteinbergMatch report:Fulham 0-2 Crystal PalaceView image in fullscreenMaxence Lacroix of Crystal Palace (right) celebrates after Daniel Muñoz scored to seal a 2-0 win at Fulham.Photograph: Molly Darlington/Getty Images10Van Nistelrooy may have given up ghostIs Ruud van Nistelrooy positioning himself to avoid culpability if Leicester are relegated? The team have lost 11 of his 15 matches in charge in all competitions and their league goal difference mushroomed to -34 after Friday’s 4-0 home defeat by Brentford. Only one new player was bought in January, the full-back Woyo Coulibaly, and the manager’s post-match comments seemed to indicate he felt blame should fall beyond his players and, by extension, himself. “You have to look at performing at the maximum of your capabilities, I cannot ask the players to do more than that,” he said. “With the squad we have, it’s a huge, huge, huge mountain to climb to stay in this league.” It does feel like the former Manchester United player is covering his back. He signed a contract in November until June 2027 and it is doubtful the club would countenance sacking a second manager in a season – Steve Cooper lasted only five months – so the director of football, Jon Rudkin, and the owners may have a tough call to make in the summer.Peter LansleyMatch report:Leicester 0-4 BrentfordPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool2738642Arsenal2628533Nottm Forest2611474Man City2615445Newcastle2610446AFC Bournemouth2614437Chelsea2612438Aston Villa27-2429Brighton2644010Fulham2633911Brentford2653712Tottenham Hotspur26153313Crystal Palace26-13314Everton26-43115Man Utd26-73016West Ham26-173017Wolverhampton26-182218Ipswich26-301719Leicester26-341720Southampton26-429Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballLiverpoolManchester CityArsenalWest Ham UnitedManchester UnitedEvertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He even joked that the only “great thing” the EU has done is to mandate that bottle tops should not be detachable.Uefa weighs up scrapping extra time for Champions League knockout roundsRead moreSpeakingto Delo, a newspaper from his home country of Slovenia, Ceferin began by praising his new expandedChampions Leagueformat, which he described as “perfect”. But he soon moved on to politics, and his perception that Europe is “losing out in every way” because of regulation and what he sees as moral grandstanding.“We should unite, but I don’t know if that is possible,” Ceferin says. “We should open up and stop regulating the market so much. No one, not even China, should be our enemy – and it isn’t – we should treat everyone as partners. We preach to others how they should behave, but we have a problem doing exactly that ourselves.“We are all fed up with political correctness. Here in the western world, freedom of speech no longer exists. You can no longer say what you think. On one hand, there are the rightwing populists who have a simple rhetoric – migrants are taking your jobs and engaging in crime, LGBT propaganda will make families nonexistent, they will destroy your children, and so on.“This is such simplistic populist rhetoric that anyone can understand it. On the other hand, almost all western mainstream politics (it is neither left- nor rightwing) and most of the mainstream media are addressing people from the intellectual and arrogant high ground.”Ceferin argued that, because “no one can say what they think any more, except standup comedians”, the counter-argument to rightwing populism is not being made. “Nobody talks to the people, nobody explains to them that people can love each other regardless of their sexual orientation, nobody explains to them that some people are uncomfortable in their own bodies, that migrants do indeed commit crimes, too, but they are punished like everyone else. Mainstream politics should ask itself what it is doing wrong to make all this happen. You cannot say to people to not talk about it any more.”He was also critical of “mainstream politics, especially by the left wing” in causingUefato abandon plans to reintroduce Russian teams to European youth competitions two years ago. “The media started attacking Uefa and everyone backed off, saying: ‘We would support the idea, but the governments won’t let us.’ In reality, they did not let the children socialise. Politics generates hatred and intolerance out of self-interest, while speaking out against it.”European leaders gathered on Monday in Kyiv to mark three years of thefull-scale invasion of Ukraineand passed a motion in the UN condemning Russian aggression.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also rejected reports that the Champions League final will be staged eventually in the US after a media rights deal with the US agency Relevent. “They have not discussed moving the Champions League finals to another continent,” he said. “I probably would have known if we had negotiated it.”As for the Champions League, in which 36 teams have competed in a single league stage this season, Ceferin declared himself pleased. “I only heard positive responses. I estimate that 99% of people are now satisfied with the renewed Champions League. The competition is even more unpredictable than before, nobody knew until the very last moment whether they would qualify. It’s a perfect success, and the Champions League ratings are excellent.”Explore more on these topicsUefaFootball politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Non-playing staff there will be offered soup and bread.The news emerged before an all-staff meeting at Old Trafford’s Manchester Suite on Monday when, the Guardian understands, the club’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, confirmed the closure of the staff canteen and other key decisions, including confirmation that there will be more redundancies. No questions were taken at the briefing.Manchester United staff warned they could be sacked if they leak informationRead moreWhile he did not inform the hundreds of staff how many of them would lose their jobs, Berrada apologised for saying in September there would be no more cuts after Ratcliffe’s initial round of about 250. Afterwards employees received an email, just after 3pm, informing them the number of redundancies will be “150-200”. There are 900 members of staff.The staff canteen at Old Trafford, which usually opens from 11.30am to 1.30pm, is expected to be shut at the end of the week. Employees currently gain entry via a pass that allows free hot meals and tea and coffee, with some soft drinks charged for.Instead of lunch, free fruit will be available for those working at the stadium. Casual match-day employees will continue to receive a packed lunch. The club believe £1m will be saved by ending free lunches.On Monday afternoon, United announced a “transformation plan” that was outlined in a statement. “The transformation plan aims to return the club to profitability after five consecutive years of losses since 2019,” it said. “This will create a more solid financial platform from which the club can invest in men’s and women’s football success and improved infrastructure.“As part of these measures, the club anticipates that approximately 150-200 jobs may be made redundant, subject to a consultation process with employees.”Berrada added: “We deeply regret the impact on those affected colleagues. However, these hard choices are necessary to put the club back on a stable financial footing. We have lost money for the past five consecutive years. This cannot continue. Our two main priorities as a club are delivering success on the pitch for our fans and improving our facilities. We cannot invest in these objectives if we are continuously losing money.”At the meeting, Berrada referred to other club models that have leaner workforces and are successful on the pitch. Those also in attendance included Roger Bell, the chief financial officer, Annie Hale, the human resources director, and Collette Roche, the chief operating officer. When speaking Bell displayed a chart showing the club’s losses over recent years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only in May will we know that answer for sure, but the scale of the celebrations from those associated with Leeds here perhaps told you everything you need to know.The popular song aimed in Leeds’ direction when things are going wrong is to decry that Daniel Farke’s side are falling apart. But here, when it mattered most, this team showed that they are anything but one that capitulates in the crucial moments.Sheffield United v Leeds United: Championship – liveRead moreIt looks increasingly like this club and their manager will again be a Premier League side next season. Last week, they dug deep at Elland Road to score twice late on andoverturn a losing position against Sunderland. That was monumental, but this was on another level and has ramifications for the whole promotion race, not just Leeds.Having fallen behind after a horrendous error from Illan Meslier, who somehow palmed the ball into his own goal, Leeds were arguably fortunate not to be further in arrears after being dominated by aSheffield Unitedside who, at that point, were heading top and about to end Leeds’ 15-game unbeaten league run.But having ridden out a storm, Leeds delivered when they needed to for the second Monday night in succession. If you had offered them a draw when Junior Firpo equalised with 18 minutes left, and a two-point lead at the top, maybe a Leeds team of years gone by would have taken it. But not this side, who are built to go to the very end.Ao Tanaka turned home a Joe Rothwell corner as injury time approached before Joël Piroe’s long-range strike turned the promotion picture on its head. Just 18 minutes earlier, Sheffield United were going top, and Leeds had just a four-point cushion to third-placed Burnley. Now, that gap is seven, and the Blades are only two clear of Scott Parker’s side. It was a seismic evening.View image in fullscreenTyrese Campbell (23) looks on as Illan Meslier somehow manages to palm his header over the line after it had hit a post.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA“It’s a priceless three points,” Farke said. “It was the worst possible start, but the reaction they showed was outstanding. We want to make sure we keep winning points and end in the best possible position. I’m very proud of the boys.”The one blot on the night: the news that their captain, Ethan Ampadu, will require knee surgery after missing this game.While Farke, his staff and his players were able to bask in the celebrations with the travelling Leeds support at full time, the mood was markedly different for Chris Wilder. His team fully deserved to lead when Meslier produced a horrific piece of goalkeeping, turning the ball in after Tyrese Campbell had headed against the right-hand post from barely a foot out.They could, and perhaps should, have gone further ahead. And you did wonder whether their profligacy would come back to haunt them against this Leeds side. That emphatically proved to be the case and with a trip to Burnley still to come, Sheffield United may now have to seal their own Premier League return the hard way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We had to produce a top performance and we just fell a little bit short.”Farke, who was serving a touchline ban following his third yellow card of the season, saw his substitutes be instrumental in transforming this pulsating Yorkshire derby, spearheaded by Rothwell’s introduction in the 58th minute. The 30-year-old changed the outcome of the game and added real energy to Leeds’ midfield. He was involved in the equaliser too, as Dan James’s cross was met by a superb header from Firpo.And as the final minutes approached, only one side looked like winning. It was a stark contrast to most of the first half, with the hosts well on top, but after Michael Cooper produced a wonderful save to deny Willy Gnonto, he was powerless to prevent Tanaka from heading home at the far post after Rothwell’s corner had been knocked down by Firpo.Leeds then sealed matters as Piroe brilliantly struck from long range to spark wild scenes. It was Farke’s German counterpart, Jürgen Klopp, who coined the term mentality monsters to describe his great Liverpool side. It is a characteristic you can put against a team who look increasingly certain to be heading back to the Premier League next season.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSheffield UnitedLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

How might he react if the Blues miss out on Champions League qualification again?Jacob SteinbergMon 24 Feb 2025 10.05 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 10.53 ESTShareRemember those chants of “We’ve got ourChelseaback” when Enzo Maresca’s side thumped Southampton at St Mary’s in December? Life moves quickly in west London. Two months have passed since those heady days, back when the talk was of a burgeoning title challenge, and the mood at Stamford Bridge has fractured so rapidly that the theme of a protest against the owners before their home game against Southampton on Tuesday night is – wait for it – “We want our Chelsea back”.It may seem an overreaction to a dip in form. Even so it is not hard to find fans who feel a growing disconnection with the club and struggle to understand Chelsea’s youth-driven recruitment strategy. They sense that the change pushed by the majority shareholder, Clearlake Capital, has been too intense; that too much knowledge has left the building since the end of the Roman Abramovich era. Perhaps it is why Chelsea, who have built a squad full of raw talent but short of experienced leaders, look rudderless when games go against them.This may be the problem with investing more than £1bn in a process where the plan is not to win now but to be the best at some unknown point down the line. Look to the future as much as you like, but what about the here and now? What happens if injuries bite, inconsistency flares, mistakes in the transfer market pile up, you keep being outdone by streetwise opponents and Champions League qualification begins to look dicey? You may find that your biggest star starts to look a little restless.It is not yet time to panic about Cole Palmer. It is, though, fair to wonder what will go through his mind if Chelsea again miss out on a Champions League place. Palmer clearly belongs at the highest level. The 22-year-old is an elite player, scorer in a European Championship final, and there is no doubt he has built on the breakout campaign of last season. He has 14 goals this term, six assists, and has produced some spellbinding moments.Yet his frustrated demeanour during Chelsea’s past two games is a concern. Palmer had to be cajoled to acknowledge the away support after a 3-0 loss at Brighton on Valentine’s Day and he was not his nonchalant, carefree, shrugging self during the 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa last Saturday. If anything the man with the “cold” celebration looks a little too icy at the moment. He is shooting his teammates plenty of frosty glares – Christopher Nkunku was on the end of one after failing to latch on to a wayward pass from Palmer against Villa – and is drifting to the margins more regularly.View image in fullscreenPalmer celebrates with Gareth Southgate after the Euro 2024 semi-final win against the Netherlands, when he created the winning goal for Ollie Watkins.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAThat is partly a consequence of teams paying more attention to Palmer and going to greater lengths to crowd him out. He is not a surprise package any more and has to cope with the shift in expectation. The positive take is that this is merely a challenge for Palmer to overcome on his journey to the top. Chelsea, who are seventh after two wins in their past 10 games, need him to meet it. Games against Southampton and Leicester offer them and Palmer a chance to get back on track before tougher assignments.Equally it is not ideal that Chelsea rely so heavily on someone so young. It was noticeable during Chelsea’s win over Wolves last month that Palmer took responsibility when it was 1-1, but it is not a sustainable situation. Palmer can show the way with his technique and imagination but he is not a bullish character like Jude Bellingham. He would benefit from being able to lean on some wise old heads during difficult moments. Two Chelsea greats, Joe Cole and Frank Lampard, have spoken about the importance of youngsters being protected by older players.The concern is that bad habits set in without that guidance. Palmer has forced own-goals in two recent outings but he has not scored in six games and is trying to do too much at times. The danger is he will feel under pressure to produce. His expected-goals data is down, he is shooting from worse positions and he missed two good chances to make it 2-1 against Villa.Not that this is a dramatic decline. Although Palmer is without an assist since 1 December, his creativity has not diminished. His expected assists have risen from 2.63 to 4.15 in the past 12 games. Before the trip to Brighton he had created 32 chances in the Premier League since 4 December, the most in Europe’s top five leagues. The problem is none of those chances were taken.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionPalmer is surrounded by wastefulness. Nicolas Jackson had gone eight games without a goal before sustaining a serious hamstring injury against West Ham this month. Nkunku looks uninterested. Jadon Sancho, Pedro Neto and Noni Madueke, another struck down by a hamstring problem, have not produced enough on the flanks. “Cole is a human being,” Maresca said on Monday. “The problem is we rely on Cole for everything and I’ve said since the start we need to rely on the team.”But the difference is that Lampard and Joe Cole were surrounded by hardened winners at Chelsea. Palmer is having to work it out for himself and unless Chelsea are prepared to bring in more ready-made talent the danger is their brightest star will start to get itchy feet.Explore more on these topicsChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 47-year-old, who has previous managerial experience at Clyde, Kelty Hearts and Alloa, will be joined by coaches Issame Charaï, Neil McCann, Billy Dodds and Allan McGregor.“If I am being honest, it came out of the blue, so it has been a whirlwind 24 hours, but I am just happy to get it done, get my staff together, get to the training ground and get going,” Ferguson toldRangersTV.“I had to be respectful that my backroom staff were in jobs elsewhere, so we had to get all this sorted. Thankfully, the guys worked hard, and so did the chief executive and the chairman, and we got it done quicker than expected.“When I was asked about this job, it was one I couldn’t turn down. Albeit it is only for three months, but it is my job to go and get a kick out of this group of players.”The club’s chief executive, Patrick Stewart, told Rangers’ official website: “Philippe and his team have worked tirelessly during their time at the club and have played an important role in developing the first team’s young players. I want to reiterate, the issues we are facing run deeper than the manager. The ongoing football review seeks to address those issues and we will continue to implement its findings in the coming weeks and months ahead of appointing a new, permanent manager.View image in fullscreenPhilippe Clement was sacked as Rangers manager after the 2-0 home defeat by St Mirren.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images“When I spoke to RangersTV last week, I was clear that everyone is judged on results and nobody will get unlimited time in any role at the club.

Rangers have struggled badly on their travels, winning only five of their 13 away matches in the Premiership.The likes of former manager Steven Gerrard, Sean Dyche and Derek McInnes, in charge at Kilmarnock, have been linked with the vacancy, while Rangers are in talks about a multi-million pound investment by a United States-led consortium which includes Paraag Marathe, president of 49ers Enterprises.Explore more on these topicsRangersScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

Then, following a consultation with the club’s nine-person, fan advisory board, a public announcement will be made at some point next month.More immediately, proposals for a new training ground will also be considered during this week’s discreet gathering somewhere in Northumberland – Maften Hall Hotel has been mentioned as a likely venue but directors have previously met at Close House Hotel and Alnwick Castle.The identities of players who could potentially inhabit the new weekday base were the subject of recruitment talks in Northumberland last week when the attentions of Newcastle’s senior boardroom management turned to the need to refresh Howe’s squad this summer.Howe is adamant he wants to retain his four “stars” – Isak, Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimarães and Anthony Gordon. If the fulfilment of that desire could yet hinge on whether the team – currently fifth in the Premier League – qualifies for next season’s Champions League there is confidence the club are now well placed to not only keep their top players but restock Howe’s squad while remaining on the right side of profit and sustainability rules.Newcastle’s manager has complained of an at times, slightly “stale” senior group, this season as he copes with the consequences of not having been able to sign a first-team ready player in any of the past three transfer windows.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those currently under such scrutiny include the Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford, the Crystal Palace and England centre-half Marc Guéhi, the Bournemouth defenders Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, the Lille striker Jonathan David and the PSV and Bournemouth wingers Johan Bakayoko and Antoine Semenyo, respectively.With the much-heralded Isak contracted to Newcastle until 2028, Paul Mitchell, Newcastle’s sporting director, is confident of keeping a striker who has scored 50 goals in 76 Premier League appearances on Tyneside but is expected to attempt to inflate an already stratospheric price tag by shortly opening talks with Isak’s representatives over a contract extension.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedSaudi Arabia and sportnewsShareReuse this content"

There was a scuffle in the elevator, nothing in the hallways.“We came back as a team and one of the boys had got a toy baseball bat somewhere. That was mistaken as a weapon in the elevator but it played no role.”Police were not called and Young said security had not been involved in the clash, which he admitted “got out of hand”.“Security didn’t break anything up,” Young said. “We went downstairs to sort our room out and that’s when they’ve reviewed the footage and asked us to leave. The club sorted it out and we’re very thankful to be staying here at Resorts World.”Smithies and Young are not expected to be sent home. Both are available to be named to face the Warriors in the NRL season opener at Allegiant Stadium this weekend.“I want to apologise for the actions on Thursday night,” Young said. “It wasn’t good enough.“Things got a bit out of hand on Thursday night. I’m happy to move on. I’m embarrassed for myself, our teammates and the NRL. We’ve dealt with it internally as a club. Sticky’s [coach Ricky Stuart] been on the front foot.

England’s Test captain has chosen to focus on his fitness and his duties with the red ball, and Moeen has decided to retire from county cricket so he can grasp the opportunities offered by global franchise leagues.The competition has brought only bad luck to Stokes, who in five appearances has scored just 14 runs at an average of 3.50 and sustained one serious hamstring injury,while playing for Northern Superchargerslast August. That pulled muscle kept him out of all cricket for two months and, after a recurrence while playing for England in New Zealand late last year, he required surgery from which he is recovering.He also decided to skip the Indian Premier League this year to “look after my body”. When announcing that decision last November, he said: “It’s about looking at what I’ve got ahead and making the decision that I think is right for me to be able to prolong my career as long as possible.”Joe Root backs ‘brilliant leader’ Jos Buttler as England face crucial gameRead moreThe Hundred this year starts the day after England’s five-Test series against India concludes at the Oval, with the first fixture for the Superchargers – for whom Stokes still hopes to play in future seasons – coming against Welsh Fire at Headingley a further two days later. England’s Test side will by then be shifting focus to an Ashes series that starts in Australia in November.With memories fresh of his battle to return from his hamstring injury in time for England’s Test series in Pakistan last October – he eventually missed the first of their three games there and said that in his desire to recover “I did physically drain and ruin myself” – the 33-year-old has opted to build some space into his schedule.Moeen’s decision deprives Birmingham Phoenix of a local cricketing hero and the man who has captained them in all but two of their 32 Hundred games across four seasons. The 37-year-old has not ruled out returning to the team next year, but meanwhile he will take on a player-coach role at Warwickshire for the T20 Blast; while promising to make himself available for their group games, he will be involved only as a coach should they qualify for the quarter-finals in September.“This is a big decision for me and not one I’ve taken lightly,” Moeen said. “I’m still passionate about the game and want to play as much as I can. I still love playing. I still have passion for the game and I love being in a team environment. I also enjoy talking to players about cricket, the tactics, and I think that’ll help me move smoothly into coaching after my playing days are over.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s doing so much right on the field, making good decisions and creating a really good environment for us to thrive in.“I think he’s a brilliant leader. He’s the best white-ball player we’ve ever produced and he’s got the full ­support of everyone within our dressing room to keep going.”Rob Key, England’s team ­director, kept faith with Buttler afterpoor defences of the 50-overandT20 World Cupsand is in Pakistan ­watching the squad first-hand. So far, his decision to expand Brendon McCullum’s role as head coach to incorporate the white-ball side has not delivered the same uplift in results that the Test team had post-Root.As regards the XI to face Afghanistan at the Gaddafi Stadium, one change is expected, with Jamie ­Overton in line to replace Carse. The latter struggled with toe ­blisters on the recent tour of India, with the removal of stitches before the ­Australia game followed by an infection. Impeded, Carse was England’s most expensive bowler on the night.View image in fullscreenBrydon Carse struggled against Australia, proving England’s most expensive bowler at 9.85 per over.Photograph: Matthew Lewis/ICC/Getty ImagesFlagged up by Carse’s absence from training on Monday, the issue has now ended his tournament and could yet affect his intended spell in the Indian Premier League next month. On Monday night the InternationalCricketCouncil approved the leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed as his replacement, with tournament rules not requiring a like-for-like player.The switch arguably makes England’s 15-man squad more rounded, not least if they somehow progress to the first semi-final in Dubai. The ground there is hosting all of India’s matches for the longstanding geopolitical reasons and is likely to require a second frontline spinner alongside Buttler’s established trump card, Adil Rashid.Not that England can afford to think that far ahead, their match against Afghanistan being a must‑win game, likewise Saturday against South Africa in Karachi should they claim that initial victory. One advantage against the Afghans is ­familiarity with conditions in Lahore, even if Buttler’s side failed to transcend the evening dew against Australia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under Taliban rule, its cricket board has duly been unable to deliver a women’s programme.The England and Wales Cricket Board islobbying the ICC to at least tacklethe latter issue, with funding for an Afghan women’s team in exile representing one demand. Richard Gould, the ECB chief executive, is also in Lahore for the match and took the heat off Buttler and his players this month byruling out a boycott.Quick GuideNew Zealand beat Bangladesh to reach last fourShowNew Zealand moved into the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy taking India along with them after a five-wicket win over Group A opponents Bangladesh on Monday. Chasing 237 for victory, New Zealand shrugged off the loss of two early wickets and rode Rachin Ravindra's classy 112 and Tom Latham's 55 to get home in 46.1 overs. Bangladesh earlier squandered a good start and made 236 for nine in 50 overs thanks to Najmul Hossain Shanto's 77 and Jaker Ali's 45 after the Black Caps spinner Michael Bracewell picked up four for 26. The result meant that the defending champions, Pakistan, joined Bangladesh in being knocked out of the tournament after losing their opening two matches against New Zealand and India.ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Root, who was part of theEngland side stunned by Afghanistanduring the 2023 World Cup, said: “[Key, the ECB and Buttler] all spoke with experts on the ground and don’t see that boycotting this game is going to make any sort of positive impact.“Clearly there’s things over there that are hard to hear and read up on but cricket is such a source of joy for so many ­people. For a number of ­people within Afghanistan, cricket gives them hope, gives them joy. Hopefully the two teams can do that in this next fixture.“From our point of view, we’re playing and we’ve got to make sure that we put our best foot forward, play our best cricket and find ourselves on the right side of the result.”Explore more on these topicsICC Champions TrophyJoe RootJos ButtlerEngland cricket teamAfghanistan cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool had drawn four of their previous eight games which had created an opening. Had Arsenal beaten West Ham and Liverpool lost at Manchester City this weekend, the title would have been in Arsenal’s hands, at least to the extent that they would have won it if they had won every game they had remaining this season, including away at Liverpool. But, afterArsenal limped to a 1-0 defeat, Liverpool produced their best performance in weeksto win 2-0. Thegap is 11 pointsand, even though Arsenal have a game in hand, it’s very hard to imagine either Liverpool dropping sufficient points or Arsenal winning enough for that to be overturned.Arteta described himself as “very, very angry” after his side’s defeat, admitting they were “nowhere near the levels that we have to hit to have the opportunity to win the Premier League”. But there’s been an element of that all season. This was only Arsenal’s third league defeat of the campaign, but there has been something distinctly underwhelming about them. Too many points have been frittered too cheaply. Too often they have failed to grasp chances. And too often ill-discipline has let them down.Myles Lewis-Skelly’s red card on Saturday was the fifthArsenalhave collected this season. That’s not a sign, as a significant proportion of Arsenal’s support would insist, of referees being against them but of their players repeatedly committing needless offences. Sure, other teams have got away with kicking the ball away, but the best way not to get a second yellow card for kicking the ball away is a) not to get a first yellow card; and b) not to kick the ball away. Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard were both dismissed for the most pointless offence and in both games, at home to Brighton and away at Manchester City, wins became draws.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreWilliam Saliba was sent off as they lost 2-0 at Bournemouth. Although Lewis-Skelly’s red at Wolves was overturned – generously, frankly, given he kicked Matt Doherty several feet from the ball – he was sent off again on Saturday, denying a goalscoring opportunity with a crude lunge on Mohammed Kudus. That’s 10 points gone in games Arsenal finished with 10 men: 10 extra points would have Arsenal a point behindLiverpoolwith a game in hand.Where Arsenal have been unfortunate is with injuries: to lose Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus simultaneously would be extremely hard for any squad to deal with. Could they perhaps have brought in a striker last summer rather than bolstering their midfield and backline? Certainly the loan signing of Raheem Sterling hasn’t worked.But it’s also true that Arsenal are not a side that handles adversity well. They get down on themselves, lose faith too easily. When Martin Odegaard was injured earlier in the season, there was a sense that in the absence of their highly gifted captain, they no longer believed great things were possible. Again and again this season, there has been a sense of acquiescence in disappointment: not only on Saturday, but also in the defeat at Bournemouth, in the draws to home to Everton and Aston Villa and away to Fulham and Brighton.They lack a certain edge, the capacity to get the job done even in unfavourable circumstance, the hardness of champions. Liverpool, by contrast, have that quality in abundance. There haven’t been many games this season when they have obliterated their opponents, only a handful of indelible performances, but they are the masters of doing enough, playing within themselves, getting over the line. And they have, in Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk, the best attacking player and the best defensive player in the league, which really does help.Sunday was a consummate performance. The statistics may show that Liverpool had only 34% possession and only eight chances to City’s 16 (Liverpool won the xG 0.7-0.6) but once Salah had put them ahead from a well-worked corner after 14 minutes, a win for Arne Slot’s team seemed inevitable. It was their seventh 2-0 league win of the season; a margin that typifies their ability to win comfortably without overextending themselves, the scoreline of champions.Even if Arsenal can somehow find an inner resolve and rally to win every Premier League game until the end of the season – although their focus will surely now shift to the Champions League – they could only get to 89 points. That means 26 points from their final 11 games guarantees the title for Liverpool. Realistically, they are not likely to need anywhere near that figure and should have their 20th championship, pulling them level with Manchester United, wrapped up long before they play Arsenal at Anfield in May.On this dayView image in fullscreenWilliam Garbutt first came to Genoa to work on the docks.Photograph: Luca Reina Mafaraci/Getty Images/iStockphotoWilliam Garbutt was one of the great pioneers of football, his story typical of those early 20th-century British men who set off for Europe full of fine intentions only to find politics and history overwhelming them. Garbutt was born in Hazel Grove near Stockport in 1883 and played as an outside right for Reading, Woolwich Arsenal and Blackburn Rovers. Aged 29, he went to Genoa to work in the docks, but soon found himself appointed as the first manager in Italian football, leading the team to the northern championship in 1913. When war was declared, he was sent to the front in France.He returned to Genoa and, introducing such progressive ideas as structured warm-ups, hot showers and signing players from other clubs, led them to back-to-back national titles in 1923 and 1924. He left the club in 1927 and worked for Roma, Napoli, Athletic of Bilbao and Milan before rejoining Genoa in 1937. When the second world war broke out, he fled, and was separated from his daughter. His wife died in an Allied air raid and, although he was later reunited with his daughter, the sense was that he never quite recovered. He returned to the UK in 1951 and died in Leamington Spa on 24 February 1964.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

A senior Labour source said the bill was “properly in the background” and that there were still “no hard proposals in terms of what the legislation looks like”. “They said let’s try and get it done before Christmas – now it’s summer,” the source added.Another Labour source briefed on the legislation said an iteration of the bill had been prepared months ago but was now up in the air because of Trump, with ministers reluctant to take action that could weaken the UK’s attractiveness to AI companies.Trump has torpedoed plans by his predecessor Joe Biden for regulating AI and revoked an executive order on making the technology safe and trustworthy. The future of the US AI Safety Institute, founded by Biden, is uncertain after its director resigned this month. At an AI summit hosted in Paris, JD Vance, the US vice-president, railed against Europe’s planned regulation of the technology.The UK government chose to side with the US by refusing to sign the Paris declaration endorsed by 66 other countries at the summit. Peter Mandelson, the UK’s ambassador to Washington, has reportedly drafted proposals to make the UK the main hub for US AI investment.Speaking to the committee in December, Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, appeared to suggest the AI bill was at an advanced stage. But earlier this month Patrick Vallance, the science minister, told MPs that “there is no bill at the moment”.A government spokesperson said: “This government remains committed to bringing forward legislation which allows us to safely realise the enormous benefits of AI for years to come.“As you would expect, we are continuing to engage extensively to refine our proposals and will launch a public consultation in due course to ensure our approach is future-proofed and effective against this fast-evolving technology.”Ministers are under pressure over separate plans to allow AI companies to draw on online material including creative work to train their models without needing copyright permission.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of Apple’s products that are assembled in China and imported to the US could face 10% tariffs introduced by the White House earlier this month, though the iPhone maker secured some waivers from China tariffs during the first Trump administration.It is not the first time the iPhone-maker has made a splashy announcement about a multibillion-dollar investment in theUS economyduring a Trump administration. In 2018, during the first Trump administration, Apple said its new and ongoing investments would contribute $350bn to the US economy over five years.This new injection of $500bn in expected spending includes everything from purchases from US suppliers to US filming of its television shows and movies for itsAppleTV+ service. The company declined to say how much of the figure it was already planning to spend with its US supply base, which includes firms such as Corning that makes glass for iPhones in Kentucky.Apple removes advanced data protection tool in face of UK government requestRead moreTrump, in a Truth Social post, thanked Apple and Cook, saying the move reflected the company’s faith in his administration.Though some of Apple’s components are made in the US – such as chips from manufacturers such as Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo – most of Apple’s consumer products are still assembled outside the US, particularly in China. A 10% tariff could drastically increase the cost of Apple’s flagship product, the iPhone, on its home turf.Apple said it last month started mass-producing chips of its own design at an Arizona factory owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC). “Apple is the largest customer at this state-of-the-art facility, which employs more than 2,000 workers to manufacture the chips in the United States,” the blog post announcing the investmentread.Bringing TSMC – which produces an estimated 90% of the most advanced semi-conductors in the world – toArizonaand helping introduce legislation that later became the Chips Act to bolster US semiconductor production were two of Trump’s biggest industrial policy moves during his first term. Now, Trump is reportedly planning on issuing changes to the Chips Act signed under the Biden administration, which promised $30bn in subsidies to manufacturers planning to build chips factories in the US. But Trump said he did not believe these companies, such as TSMC, needed money, but rather they needed an “incentive”, according to the Associated Press.“And the incentive is going to be they’re not going to want to pay at 25, 50 or even 100% tax,” Trump said.Apple said on Monday it would also work with Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, to build a 250,000 sq ft facility in Houston, where it will assemble servers that go into data centers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features that help draft emails and perform other tasks. Those servers are currently made outside of the US, Apple said. The company also said it will expand its existing data centers in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada.Apple said it planned to increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5bn to $10bn, with part of the expansion being a “multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon” at TSMC’s Arizona factory.Apple did not disclose details of its deal with TSMC, but it has in the past used the fund to help partners build out the infrastructure needed to deliver products or services for Apple.The announcement comes afterreportsindicated TSMC is in talks with Intel to acquire its chip-making plants – a move the Trump administration has encouraged, according to the New York Times. Intel has previously struggled to compete with TSMC and as it stands most of the company’s chips remain manufactured in Taiwan.Apple will also open a manufacturing academy in Michigan, where its engineers, along with local university staff, will offer free courses for small and mid-sized manufacturing firms in areas such as project management and manufacturing process optimization.Explore more on these topicsAppleDonald TrumpUS economyTrump tariffsArizonaManufacturing sectorTim CooknewsShareReuse this content"

He has been crusading to slash the US federal government’s size at the behest of the US president, who has consistently challenged Canada’s sovereignty since returning to the White House for a second presidential term on 20 January.Elon Musk’s demand that federal workers document what they do provokes chaosRead moreReed’spetition– filed on 20 February – accuses Musk of having “engaged in activities that go against the national interest of Canada” by acting as an adviser to Trump. Trump has invited the scorn of Canada’s 40 million residents by making threats about imposing steep tariffs on Canadian products and openly boasting about having the US annex the country, including shortly before its national hockey teamdefeateda selection of US opponents in a politically charged 20 February tournament final.The petition asserts that Musk’s alignment with Trump makes him “a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty”. It asks the Canadian prime minister,Justin Trudeau, to take away Musk’s Canadian passport and revoke his citizenship with immediate effect.Trump has often mocked Trudeau as “governor”, the title given to US states’ chief executives. And Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022 for $44bn to relish Trudeau’s announcement in January that he would resign as the head of Canada’s Liberal party after it selected a new leader, with the tech billionaire praising clips of the Canadian Conservative party chief, Pierre Poilievre.As the Canadian Press noted, petitions like Reed’s require 500 or more signatures for them to gain the certification necessary to be presented to Canada’s House of Commons and potentially garner a formal government response. Reed’s petition evidently had no trouble clearing that threshold, having collected about 203,000 signatures as of early Monday, with no indication that the number would soon stop rising.Canada’s House of Commons is scheduled to resume its work on 24 March, though the country could call for a general election before parliamentary members return. The signing period for Reed’s petition was set to expire on 20 June.As Canada’s CTV Newsreported, the country can revoke citizenship in certain cases, including in instances of fraud, people’s misrepresenting themselves or intentionally withholding information on an immigration or citizenship application. A person can also renounce their citizenship for various reasons, according to Canadianlaw.A person whose Canadian citizenship is revoke must wait 10 years to get it back again, CTV News added.Musk’s directive to ostensibly cut federal spending – after Trump lost re-election in 2020 to Joe Biden but then secured it in November at the expense of Kamala Harris – has affected hundreds of thousands of US government civil servants. The cuts include thousands at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense and Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Parks Service, among others.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Holmes claimed that the Edison could perform a wide swath of medical tests with a single drop of a patient’s blood, which would have represented a significant advance in biotechnology. Her invention never lived up to her promises.In advance of the ruling on her appeal, Holmes appeared on the cover ofPeoplemagazine earlier this month for her first interview since being locked up.

Oliver joked that he looked like “Eddie Redmayne was cast to play Ice Cube” and while Zuckerberg stressed the importance of returning the site to its roots and emulating real-world conversations, he was wearing a $900,00 watch, a sign of how “out of touch” he is.Oliver said it was “a pretty notable shift” given how Zuckerberg had previously apologised to Congress about how the site had allowed lies to spread.He went back and talked about section 230, which was created at the start of the internet and meant that sites were shielded from liability for what its users post as they “couldn’t possibly vet” all of the content unless it was deemed to be illegal.He said “mostly it allows them to moderate without fear” and that moderation is “absolutely key to making the internet bearable”.He added: “If you want people to use your site and crucially have companies want to pay to advertise on it you’re going to have to make choices about what to remove and how you make those choices is always going to be contentious.”The “initial optimism” expressed by those involved withFacebookthat users could be trusted to behave didn’t last and moderation became “a grim job” with boundaries difficult to define.Oliver said that for Zuckerberg “a simple dream of ranking his classmates by fuckability” soon became a “company struggling to stop people from accusing random pizzerias of human trafficking”.He soon was under “heavy fire for allowing fake news and hate speech to proliferate” with those on the right claiming “political persecution” for content being removed which was “obviously all bullshit”.“Conservatives have been crying censorship for years but the evidence for that is very weak,” he said while adding that they were “more likely to spread disinformation according to numerous empirical studies”.Zuckerberg spoke on the Joe Rogan podcast about how the spread of Covid disinformation meant there was pressure to remove anti-vaxx stories after Biden claimed this was “killing people”.Yet despite his claims that he was being forced to remove such stories after being cursed and screamed at by government agencies, nothing that actually happened “fit Zuckerberg’s narrative” and “allegations like these have been adjudicated in court”.He felt like he was being forced to comply with Democratic rule yet his recent behaviour has shown something different.“Trump threatened Mark Zuckerberg with life in prison then Mark Zuckerberg turned around, gave him money, hired one of his buddies and changed the direction his company was going,” he said. “It doesn’t take a genius to draw a conclusion there.”He spoke about the “$25m bullshit lawsuit” that Trump won against him.“Trump is doing exactly what Zuckerberg accused the Biden adminstration of: leveraging the power of his office to pressure social media companies to bend to his will.”Oliver said that with the new lack of restrictions it “sure seems set to become an absolute sewer of hatred and misinformation”, which he argued it already was but, he said: “We’re about to see what happens when they really stop trying”.There was recently a 5,000% increase in searches on how to delete accounts and users who remain should take things with “even more of a grain of salt than you did before”.But Oliver reminded viewers that advertising makes up 98% of revenue still and that this involved companies trying to microtarget you. But “you can change your settings” to affect profits, details of which he said were on www.johnoliverwantsyourraterotica.com.Explore more on these topicsJohn OliverJohn Oliver recapUS televisionSocial mediaDigital mediaTelevisionTV comedyComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s nobody to talk to if you’re struggling through a question.”Lecture halls, once packed with students, have beenemptied in favour of pre-recorded talks, Mai says, some of which are reused from past years and are out of date. Even lab demonstrations have been replaced by lifeless, directionless Zoom breakout rooms.Mai has sat through online classes that slumped into silence just halfway through their one-hour time slot as her lecturer pleaded for the grid of faceless audience names to engage with simple questions.“Nobody spoke,” she says. “It’s so awkward, it’s so painful, you just want to get out.”As soon as she graduated Mai moved to Hobart to study medicine, a rare course with compulsory in-person practical classes. Lockdowns were a fading memory and she expected a packed campus.But, apart from her medicine classmates, it was deserted, she says – as it remains two years later.“I had this very naive vision of, ‘Oh, wow, I’m going to meet so many students from many different places’ – [but] a lot of students don’t attend, just because they have other work and life commitments,” she says.When I was an undergraduate, student life was on campus. A lot is being lost in the shift to online learning | Judith BrettRead moreAustralian students like Mai are entering universities expecting an experience many establishments no longer offer. They imagine themselves with time and space to explore big ideas with their peers and teachers, sharing vibrant discussions and on a path to independent adulthood, only to find no one has time to sit around on the quad and talk.Those who can’t afford to spend all week on campus – or who aren’t given the option for in-person classes – worry they’re missing out on ahigher-quality educationwhile being charged ever-increasing fees.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsStudents under financial pressure have cut back on classes and picked up more work, while cash-strapped universities have held on tounpopularbut cheaperonline classes. The result, students say, is a vicious cycle of falling campus attendance: as fewer students attend class in person, attending class in person becomes even less appealing, and universities offer fewer in-person opportunities because students are not showing up.Many, like Mai, now ask themselves: “What’s the point of going on campus?”Australian expectations for university life date back to the pre-1980s ideal of study without work, according to Dr Thuc Bao Huynh, a research fellow at Monash University’s Centre for Youth Policy and Education Practice.“If someone was a student, they wouldn’t really be doing all that much else except being a student,” he says. “That’s not the case any more.”The myth of campus life is butting up against the modern reality in which increasingly few students have the luxury of their studies and social life being their main responsibilities. Since the 1990s growing numbers of Australians from a broader range of backgrounds have taken the opportunity to study while working part-time to support themselves. Cost-of-living pressures have accelerated this trend, Huynh says, forcing more students to treat university as a part-time commitment.Asrent and living costshave risen, the share of students with jobs hasjumped, according toseveral analyses. Nearly half of all students opted tostudy part time instead of full time in 2023.View image in fullscreenThose who can’t afford to spend all week on campus – or whose courses don’t have in-person classes – worry they’re missing out on a higher-quality education while being charged ever-increasing fees.Photograph: Agenzia Sintesi/Alamy“Being a student is [now] mashed in with everything else that young people are going through,” Huynh says. “It’s just another thing that they have to deal with.”Struggling to juggle university and work and given the option to do their coursework online, Jedd Brockhouse’s classmates at La Trobe University in Melbourne’s north see no point in coming on campus.“If you know you don’t have to be there, then why fit in an hour of traffic to go and sit in a class for two hours?” he says.Sam Lane only learned how much he had missed out on when he took a break from his law classes to try his hand at art history.He says he went to university in 2019 looking for the picture of campus life his parents had painted: “That kind of traditional sitting on the quad, going for beers and talking about your readings … everyone’s on the lawn at the same time and you run into people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

His three-hour long art history classes forced him and his peers to meet face-to-face while giving them time to grapple with and debate aesthetics and philosophy.“You didn’t feel like you were just there to be chewed up and spat out of the lecture hall,” he says. “If something was interesting to the class, you could delve into it.”But once his art tutorial ended Lane had to hurry back to UNSW’s main campus in Sydney’s east for classes that had been required to cut their on-campus teaching hours, with professors rushing through impossible quantities of information.View image in fullscreenSam says he went to university in 2019 looking for the picture of campus life his parents had painted.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/TheGuardian“There’s no time to chat, there’s no time to get to know the people around you,” he says. “You’re too busy trying to get through all the content super quickly.”Lane is now coming to the end of his degree and has watched as falling in-person attendance strains student societies and puts a halt to long-running party traditions, including battle of the bands events.“People realise what they lost and really want to get back into it … [but] there’s no good time to put it [on] because there’s not enough people on campus, they can’t get a turnout,” he says. “It’s just a bit dead.”The trend to online learning reflects broader pressures: reducedfederal fundingand thethreatened loss of international students, a major income source, have forced universities to find savings. At the same time, university staff are teaching 200,000 more students than they were a decade ago.Kaab Qureshi, a second-year student at Canberra’s Australian National University, says he has had difficulty learning in some classes that have become “ginormous” as the university cut and condensed contact hours.“They just want to cut costs as fast as they can,” he says. “I believe they put reputation and profits above student engagement and support.”For those who can afford to hang around on campus, not even overstuffed face-to-face classes have stopped them from finding the community they wanted.Kristy Sauw, Qureshi’s classmate at ANU, says her first year of university couldn’t have been better. After moving from a Wagga Wagga high school to an on-campus residential hall, it was easy for her make friends and get to classes in person.“I made a lot of friends in my philosophy tutorial because we viewed it as an hour to just yap and it was really fun,” she says. “As much as we focused on what we were actually talking about, we also just got to bond and talk over random topics.”Qureshi put up the extra money to live in a residential hall for his first year but rising rents have forced him to move back in with his family, a 90-minute drive away.“As much as I might want to be on campus, if I can’t afford it, I can’t afford it,” he says. “Even though it’s better for my mental health, it’s just something I would have to give up.“That’s just the uni life.”*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsAustralian universitiesAustralian educationYoung peopleCost of living crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the end, he laughed and said: ‘I am the real Crazy Taxi!’ It was a strange experience.”Initially released in arcades, the zany, pop-punk drive-em’-up celebrates its 25th anniversary this month. Crazy Taxi was an addictive coin-swallowing thrill ride, the game’s eccentric cabbies continually yelling “Ready to have some fun?” and “Time to make some crazy money!” in the faces of perturbed-looking normies who simply wish to be chauffeured over to Pizza Hut. Driving green-haired Axel’s yellow 1960 Cadillac Eldorado so fast that its front bumper smashed into sunny San Francisco’s concrete hills was a memorable experience for all who played. (The Ford Mustang-driving Gena was my mum’s character of choice.)I remember losing an entire summer trying to master the “crazy dash” technique that allowed you to boost faster around corners on the critically acclaimedSegaDreamcast version of the game (released in 2000 and running at an impressively fluid 60 frames-per-second), instead of going outside to play with my friends. Subsequent ports on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox 360 drove sales of Crazy Taxi into the millions, creating a hit for Sega at a time where things weren’t easy, as the formerly dominant Japanese console manufacturer was on the edge of exiting that business.View image in fullscreenA memorable experience for all who played … Crazy Taxi.Photograph: SegaRock band the Offspring provided turbo-charged guitar riffs for Crazy Taxi’s soundtrack, but that’s not the only thing that makes it feel like a time capsule from the turn of the millennium. This game captured the carefree hyperactivity of late 90s/early 00s pre-9/11 America; an era where many young people’s biggest worry was whether beer-swilling Stone Cold Steve Austin might retain the WWE world title.Despite its crossover success, Crazy Taxi had a lot of early detractors, Kanno remembers. “At the beginning of development, more than half of the project members were strongly opposed to the idea of a game about taxi drivers,” he recalls.The way Hollywood had historically framed cabbies made the concept of Crazy Taxi a tough sell for Sega’s executives. In the words of Marcello Di Cintio, the author of Driven: The Secret Lives of Taxi Drivers: “Cabbies in pop culture have often been characters on the margins. The stereotype, then and now, is that cabbies had a window on the seedy side of urban life, and were part of a nocturnal world the rest of us don’t see. Drugs. Alcohol. Sex …”View image in fullscreen‘What I wanted to express the most in Crazy Taxi was the dynamism of movie car chases.’Photograph: SegaKanno, though, was much more interested in the less sinister taxi drivers present in Luc Besson’s 1998 action-comedy film Taxi, as well as the challenge of turning the guy behind the steering wheel into someone more lovable. Crazy Taxi’s drivers are decidedly un-sinister, a bunch of grinning, colourfully dressed thrill-seekers who are the furthest thing from mundane. Kanno wanted the game to do for taxi drivers what Paperboy had done for, well, paperboys. “I told the team: ‘I think it is the job of games creators to make regular jobs look more cool! Even if this is a vision that no one has ever had before, then we should do it.’”Growing up, Kanno found taxis somewhat magical, he says. “In Japan, taxi doors open automatically. As a child, I wondered why taxi doors opened as you approached them, but my family’s car door stayed shut? This was so mind-blowing to me that I came to see taxis as these magical things.” When he got older, Kanno was obsessed with old Hollywood movies, and wanted to capture that same giddy tension and glamour presented in the iconic driving sequences in classics such asThe Italian JobandThe French Connection. A location such as San Francisco was perfect. “What I wanted to express the most in Crazy Taxi was the dynamism of movie car chases. I chose San Francisco because it is a city with so many undulations that you can constantly express that kind of action.”Unlike most racing games, Crazy Taxi makes you think on your feet rather than learn its tracks. (Echoes of this chaotic approach can be seen in The Simpsons: Road Rage, which basically took the Crazy Taxi concept over to Springfield.) “This is a game where players make split-second decisions in constantly changing situations,” Kanno says. “That’s why I made the other vehicles into obstacles. The design is not about memorising every course and taking the best line, but about the player navigating a constantly changing path.”A planned multiplayer mode was cut due to the technical limitations of the time. But the leaderboards still allowed for competitive, wait-your-turn battles between friends. For those who still struggle to last more than two minutes while playing Crazy Taxi (FYI: one rooftop shortcut is a gamechanger), is there any chance of a modern, multiplayer-enabled sequel? “I can’t say much,” replies Kanno. “But Crazy Taxi will make you smile again soon!”Explore more on these topicsGamesSegaRetro gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Good riddanceMoira DoneganWhenever you see a horror of anti-democratic rule, remember Mitch McConnell. You have him to thankMon 24 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 10.55 ESTShareYou would think that this is exactly whatMitch McConnellwanted. McConnell, the 83-year-old Kentucky senator – who announced last week thathe will retire in 2026and not seek an eighth term – is one of the most influential Republicans in the history of the party. But he has in recent weeks expressed dissent and discontent with the direction of theRepublicanparty. He voted against some ofDonald Trump’s cabinet appointees, refusing, for example, to cast a vote for the confirmation of the anti-diversity campaigner and alleged rapist and drunk Pete Hegseth.He has also voiced some tepid and belated opposition to Republicans’ extremist agenda, citing his own experience as a survivor of childhood polio as a reason for his opposition to Republican attacks on vaccines. But the Republican party that McConnell is now shaking his head at is the one that he created. He has no one but himself to blame.Over his 40 years in theUS Senate, with almost two decades as the Republican leader in the chamber, McConnell has become one of the most influential senators in the nation’s history, radically reshaping Congress, and his party, in the process. Few have done more to erode the conditions of representative democracy in America, and few have done more to enable the rise of oligarchy, autocracy and reactionary, minoritarian governance that is insulated from electoral check. McConnell remade America in his own image. It’s an ugly sight.Lessons for the resistance 2.0 on how to fight back against Trump | Jan-Werner MüllerRead moreIn the end, McConnell will be remembered for one thing only: his enabling of Trump. In 2021, after Trump refused to respect the results of the 2020 election and sent a violent mob of his supporters to the Capitol to stop the certification of the election results by violent force, McConnell had an opportunity to put a stop to Trump’s authoritarian attacks on the constitutional order.McConnell never liked Trump, and by that point, he didn’t even need him: he had already won what would be his last term. He could have voted to convict Trump at his second impeachment; if he had, it’s likely that other Republican senators would have been willing to do so, too, and that Trump could have been convicted and prevented from returning to power. He didn’t. McConnell voted to acquit, and to allow Trump to rise again. If the next four years of Trump’s restoration are anything like the first 30 days have been, then that will turn out to have been the singularly significant decision of McConnell’s career.But McConnell had been working against American democracy long before Trump sent the mob to ransack the Senate chamber and smear feces on the walls. It was McConnell, after all, who is most responsible for the current campaign finance regime, which has allowed unlimited amounts of dark money spending to infiltrate politics – making elections more influenceable, and politicians’ favor more purchasable, in ways that tilt public policy away from the people’s interests and towards those of the billionaire patron class.Such arrangements of funding and favors are not consistent with democracy; they change politicians’ loyalties, diminish the influence of voters, diminish constituents and their needs to a mere afterthought or communications problem in the minds of elected representatives. This was by design, and it is how McConnell liked it. In Washington, he operated at the center of a vast funding network, moving millions and millions of dollars towards those Republicans who did his bidding, and away from those who bucked his authority.It was partly his control over this spiderlike web of wealthy funders that allowed McConnell to exert such control over his caucus. It is hard to remember these days, when Republicans pick so many fights with each other, that the party was once feared for their discipline. McConnell was able to snuff out any meaningful dissent and policy difference in public among Republican senators with the threat of his deep-pocketed friends, always ready to fund a primary challenger. The lockstep from Republicans allowed McConnell to pursue what he viewed as his twin goals: stopping any Democratic agenda in Congress, and furthering the conservative capture of the federal courts.As Senate Republican leader during the Obama years, McConnell pursued a strategy of maximal procedural obstructionism. His mandate was that no Republican in the Senate would vote for any Obama agenda item – that there would be no compromise, no negotiation, no horse trading, no debate, but only a stonewalled total rejection of all Democratic initiatives. This has become the singular way that Republicans operate in the Senate; it was McConnell who made it that way.The underlying assumption of McConnell’s strategy of total opposition and refusal was that Democrats, even when they win elections, do not have a legitimate right to govern. In practice, the authorities of the presidency or congressional majorities expand and contract based on which party is in power: Republicans can achieve a great deal more in the White House, or with control of Congress, than Democrats can.In part this is because of McConnell’s procedural approach, which posits bending the rules to suit Republican interests when they are in power, and enforcing the rules to the point of functionally arresting legislative business when Democrats take the majority. This, too, is antithetical to democracy: constitutional powers can’t be limited for one party, and expanded for another, so that voters are only fully represented if they vote one way. The strategy of obstructionism functionally ended Congress as a legislative body in all but the most extreme of circumstances. What was most the most representative, electorally responsive, and important branch of the federal government has receded to the status of a bit player, and policymaking power has been abdicated to the executive and the courts. That’s McConnell’s doing, too.Maybe it was part of McConnell’s indifference to the integrity of democracy meant that he refused, during the Obama era, to confirm any of the president’s judicial nominees. Vacancies on the federal courts accumulated, with seats sitting empty and cases piling up for the overworked judges who remained. But McConnell’s seizure of the judicial appointment power from the executive was only in effect when the president was a Democrat; when Republicans were in power, he jammed the courts full of far-right judges.It’s time for Americans to withhold their taxes | Judith LevineRead moreWhen Antonin Scalia died in 2016, under Obama, McConnell held the US supreme court seat open for almost a year, hoping that Trump would win the 2016 election and get the chance to appoint a right-wing replacement. When Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, just a few weeks before the 2020 election, McConnell jammed through the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. His tendencies, then, were always authoritarian: power, in his view, did not belong to those the people elected to represent them. It belonged, always, to Republicans – no matter what the voters had to say about it.Mitch McConnell is an old man. In 2026, when he finally leaves office, he will be 84. He will not have to live in the world that he made, the one where what was left of American democracy is finally snatched away. But we will. Whenever you see a horror of anti-democratic rule – whenever cronyism is rewarded over competence, whenever cruelty is inflicted over dignity, whenever the constitution is flouted, mocked, or treated as a mere annoyance to be ignored by men with no respect for the law or for you – rememberMitch McConnell.

And you’re just in and out. But I do actually need a good GP to talk about all the stuff I’ve been ignoring. You know, for me and for the kids. And for my ageing parents. Do you know anyone?”It’s a question I’ve been asked – on repeat – for the past few years. You’ve probably had the conversation too. Many of us have been worrying about the demise of Australia’s universal healthcare. Medicare rebates for general practice have been essentially frozen for over a decade. But now, finally – finally! – theLabor government commitsto pulling Australia out of the ice age. And to our even greater astonishment, the LNP – which has previously argued against socialist universal healthcare – ismatching the pledge.So should we be excited? Yes and no.I suspect many will opt not to participate and rather continue to practise more thorough medicine for wealthier peopleAnthony Albanese says he has a vision that 90% of GP consultations will be bulk-billed by 2030. As a public health-trained GP, I rejoice. General practice, and more broadly primary care, is the backbone of the Australian healthcare system. Done well, it prevents health crises and helps patients survive and break cycles of despair and disability. A stitch in time saves nine: primary preventive care has been shown to cut tertiary hospital costs and healthcare spending. There are many things to celebrate here: an investment in primary care and particularly the commitment to support for junior doctors entering the GP workforce.But it’s worth interrogating what the government is promising. Medicare funding is complex, and it is getting more complex. It isn’t well known that the vast majority of GPs are not salaried health workers (unlike hospital doctors). GP practices are run as small businesses, with the government using our universal health insurance scheme to set patient rebates and incentivise GPs to work in a particular way. The government is proposing boosting funding to bulk-billing incentives and applying these incentives to all patients – not just children andHealthCare Card holders. I, and many, have tried (and failed) to run completely Medicare-funded quality bulk-billing GP practices for the underprivileged. It is an extremely difficult, almost impossible, endeavour. This change will make it easier for those bulk-billing clinics that have been running in the red, especially if they have been doing a lot of short consultations.Albanese’s bulk billing pledge renews the promise at the heart of Medicare | Bill BowtellRead moreBut there are some downsides.Albanese’s reform entrenches the notion that a quick consult is a good one. There is still more detail to be revealed about funding measures for chronic disease management and practice payments. But it appears that Medicare might still incentivise “throughput” over “quality”. And these quality consultations are what I (and many in “deep-end GP clinics” have been advocating for.I have written before about the value ofslow medicine. I’ve spent the past decade working withunderprivileged peoplewho cannotafford a gap. This pledge will support that sort of clinic to stay afloat. But I’m not sure that it will support listening, rapport or good communication. I’m not sure it recognises that longer consults are needed for people with more complex conditions, low literacy, more severe illness, mental health issues and other barriers.For many non-bulk billing clinics, these changes may be a cut in funding, rather than a boost. I suspect that many clinicians will opt not to participate and rather continue to practise slower, more thorough medicine for wealthier people. They will continue to charge a gap. The new patient rebates are still too low to cover the cost of this sort of care. If the Labor government isn’t careful, it could entrench two types of care: good, thorough care for those who can afford it. And quick, bulk-billed care.Prime minister Albanese has said that he wants “every Australian to know they only need their Medicare card, not their credit card, to receive the healthcare they need”. It’s music to my ears. After decades of underfunding primary care by all political parties, we have a lot of catch-up investment to do. I’m excited to see progress and a commitment to universal healthcare by the Labor government. But I’m worried that without reform for quality care, we won’t be able to provide good, free care for 90% of people.Patients want to be heard. GPs want to be able to listen and care. We want to hear and respond when a teenager is suicidal. To debrief a woman after a traumatic birth, and support her breastfeeding and bonding. To recognise when chest palpitations aren’t just anxiety. To make good referrals, not write one-line handoffs. To call a specialist or allied health worker and ask for advice. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners isasking for better fundingfor longer consults and mental healthcare. It’s an important demand because we need good medicine, not just fast medicine.Dr Mariam Tokhi is a general practitioner and teaches narrative medicine at the University of MelbourneIn Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

But it is his duty to go there upholding British and European valuesMon 24 Feb 2025 12.44 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 13.12 ESTShareDay by day another vast hole opens up beneath what was once solid. The man who is on course to become Germany’s next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, once the most pro-US of leaders, has declared Nato in effect over. In his clear-eyed perception of Donald Trump’s first month, 80 years of shared transatlantic values have fallen into that crater. The US “doesn’t care about the fate of Europe one way or another” and Washington’s actions have been “no less drastic, dramatic, and ultimately no less brazen” than Moscow’s, he said. Now, Europe must defend itself.The moment smacks of that 1940 David Low cartoon of a British soldier standing on a rock in a stormy sea, shaking his fist as the Luftwaffe approach: “Very well, alone”. But this time we Europeans are alone. JD Vance, the US vice-president,declared war on European values and traditions; Europe’s liberal “enemies within” are more dangerous in his eyes than Russia or China. Those spell-breaking words told Europeans that the US can never be trusted again; at any time, Americans may vote for a leader who betrays old allies, sharing no affinity with Europe’s liberal democracies, international rights or laws. “The west” no longer exists as an entity bound by shared beliefs.Keir Starmer knows that every step he takes inside the White House on Thursday could set off some Trumpian explosive device. Emmanuel Macron will have already tested the ground (he arrived there today). The US president’s wild unpredictability, whether by design, delusion or distraction, is a weapon in itself, and a wary Starmer is war-gaming it with his advisers. That “bridge” of a “special relationship” remains in No 10’s official briefing lexicon, but by now it is wholly illusory.View image in fullscreenDavid Low’s June 1940 Evening Standard cartoon Very well, alone.Illustration: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyStarmer’s task is to salvage the best possible agreements on Ukraine, tariffs and defence without wavering on what once were mutual principles. He has his red lines, echoed across Europe: “No talks about Ukraine, without Ukraine”. No mafioso protection racket grabbing Ukraine’s mineral wealth to pay off bogus debts. Reuters reports that unless Volodymyr Zelenskyy payshalf a trillion dollars, the US will cut off Ukraine’s access to Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite communications network, crippling the country’s defences. In the face of such brutishness, Starmer is the right man: lawyerly, calm and diplomatic. He will not be riled into pointless verbal warfare. He brings Europe’s pledges to spend more, and possibly the hubristic offer of the UK’s new ambassador, Peter Mandelson, of a “new economic partnership” with the UK as a hub for US AI to “Make our economies great again”.But everyone can see that Trump’s “reset” with Vladimir Putin is irreconcilable with Nato. The alliance is dead if it fails to resist a Russian aggressor, a despot who murdersopposition politicians, commits unspeakablewar crimes, kidnaps thousands of Ukrainian children, with a declared intent to return Warsaw pact countries to its embrace. Trump is Russia’s greatest asset.Starmer will avoid verbal spats with a champion spitter. Be bold, comes the best advice from Merz, warning Europe’s leaders “not to come to Washington as a dwarf” or they“will be treated as one”. As Europe speedily circles the wagons, the UK finds its role will be vital, as Macron and Merz call for a joint nuclear shield to be provided by France and the UK, pivoting from US nuclear dependence. In a continent that is losing the security we relied on all our lives, trade disputes become a trivial quibble, Brexit an irrelevance. Merz is calling for Europe to come together in foreign, trade and security policy. Starmer ought to seize the chance, and abandon Labour’s fears of Brexiters.With its colossal majority, Labour has nothing to fear in rallying the country around joint European defence as a necessary patriotic cause, leaving the Tories and Reform confounded. The public that welcomed Ukrainians rejects Trump’s betrayal plans:21% of peoplestrongly support British soldiers being stationed in Ukraine as peacekeepers, and 37% of people “somewhat” support the idea. Only 21% are opposed to it. The idea of a European army would have been unthinkable during the Brexit referendum. Meanwhile, on trade, a majority of voters in every constituency thinks the government shouldprioritise tradewith the EU over the US, even in Clacton, Nigel Farage’s seat.Fifty-five per cent of Britonsnow say it was wrong to leave the EU, while just 11% call Brexit a success. There’s no need to reopen those old wounds. A Europe united against new perils seems likely to loosen its rigid single market rules on trade, given that Britain would be contributing so much in mutual defence. As Britain strives to spend up to 3% compared with Germany’s 1.5% defence spending, the doors to trade must surely open for the UK to regain some of the 4-5% of GDP it haslost since Brexit.View image in fullscreenHugh Grant and Billy Bob Thornton in Love Actually, 2003.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThe Brexiters now sound bizarrely out of tune. Last week, David Frost, who led the UK’s negotiations with the EU,frantically tweeted: “Labour are taking us back into the EU orbit by stealth and hoping you won’t notice till it’s too late. Don’t let them get away with it.” Yet those days are done. Instead, all of Europe and the UK need defence eurobonds for all to borrow. If the opposition attacks the chancellor for breaking a borrowing pledge, Labour need only point to the frightening new world where Elon Musk sends warm congratulations not to Germany’s new leader, but to the far-right AfD.There will be a White House press conference during Starmer’s visit, a dangerous opportunity for Trump to say unspeakable things while leaving Starmer dumbstruck. If he’s lost for words, he might remember those spoken by a particularly memorable British prime minister at a press conference with a US president in 2003. Hugh Grant, playing the prime minister in Love Actually,told the president, Billy Bob Thornton: “I fear that this has become a bad relationship; a relationship based on the president taking exactly what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to Britain. We may be a small country, but we’re a great one, too … And a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward I will be prepared to be much stronger. And the president should be prepared for that.”The real world is not scripted by Richard Curtis for happy endings. Poking presidents in public is not politic, and Starmer is likely tooffer Trump a carriage ride with King Charles. But he will have no trouble rousing voters to defend European and British values against Trumpism.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

To facilitate the move, the barrister not only had to be ennobled, but it required giving theboot to Emily Thornberry– a long-serving shadow cabinet member who’d held the post in opposition for several years – which came as a surprise.Friends of Hermer soon began to wonder how long he would last in post, as they suspected that the Labour government would not be radical enough to live up to his principles (particularly on Israel, the KC being a criticof its occupation of the Palestinian territories). And quitting would be low-stakes when an easy return to the day job awaits.What has emerged is the reverse. After weeks of media pressure, there are now rumours that Hermer could be sacked for being too forceful in making the government fit his principles.Critics outside the governmentaccuse the “lefty lawyer” of adopting an approach to the job that prioritises international law over national sovereignty. He is seen by them as imposing an out-of-touch liberal attitude on government decisions, characterised by his view of the British empireas “deeply racist”, and to come with unacceptable baggage. Their concerns range from substantive issues to more trivial ones, such asa recent story in the Telegraph, which highlighted how Hermer had to reduce his no win, no fee bonus in a 2006 case.‘Deeply unfair’: how attorney general became lightning rod for criticism of StarmerRead moreWhen I interviewed Hermer last month, he responded that if his critics “want to pick a fight with the government because it says international law is important”, then “that’s a fight I’d quite look forward to”. “Bring it on,” he said.The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, has claimed the AG’s former client list throws upconflicts of interest– such as Gerry Adams, who could get compensation if the Legacy Act (which offers immunity to Troubles-era crimes in Northern Ireland) is repealed. The rebuttal is simple: Hermer follows the same process as his predecessors. Wherever conflicts arise, such matters will be directed to the solicitor general instead.Those close to Hermer admit that specific briefings are tricky to counter. Law officer convention means the matters on which he has or has not advised the government cannot be revealed. His team believes publishing a list of broad topics from which he would recuse himself, as some have suggested, would make the job too difficult.Mounting criticism from inside the tent is more concerning. This centres on two accusations: that Hermer is a block on the government’s agenda, and that he lacks the political nous needed for the job. The former in particular is strongly denied by Hermer’s allies, who say the idea he would shy away from challenging legal battles is absurd considering that he has fought many “unwinnable” cases during his career.“To criticise him is to kill the messenger,” says former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve. Hermer’s unhappy colleagues claim he is an obstacle to achieving their policy goals, but allies argue that the AG is simply imparting home truths, and his critics within the government need to accept the tough love.Born in south Wales but now resident in north London,Hermer, 56, is a cheerful man who, sources say, always picks up the phone or rings back when advice is sought. His political background is typical of the averageLabourMP under Starmer: Hermer joined Labour aged 16 and opposed Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership because he thought it made the party unelectable and due to the antisemitism crisis. Why, then, is such an inoffensive character getting people’s backs up?Hermer and Starmer have been friends since meeting on Hermer’s first day at Doughty Street Chambers in 1996. But being the prime minister’s oldest friend in the cabinet has not protected Hermer from criticism. On the contrary, it seems his proximity to the prime minister is provoking internal attacks.The AG is hindered by not having spent the last 15 years sitting in the tearoom with the MPs who now make up the cabinet. There is also a sense that his role has been given greater significance in Starmer’s government – a reaction to the risky approach of recent Conservative administrations to lawfulness – and that this roving brief may be causing resentment. One theory is that Hermer sits on an usually high number of cabinet committees, so he is delivering blunt advice more directly than predecessors, who might have done it more often via government lawyers.The assertion that he lacks politics – one that has been levelled at Starmer many times – is a key part of the internal dispute. It is true that Hermer still doesnot see himself as a politician. And, crucially, he believes his role relies on “the ability to provide independent, impartial advice that is not tainted by day-to-day political considerations”. Is Hermer’s job to give advice, which ministers can choose to follow or not? Or is it to ensure his advice aligns with ministers’ policy priorities?“I think they’re shocked he gives such stark advice,” one senior aide says of ministers who oppose Hermer. “People need to be a bit more robust. The advice is only advice. If you want to take the political risk, that’s up to you.”Others counter that an attorney general’s analysis of a legal problem is not only an opinion but the law, and ministers must follow the advice or resign, which means Hermer is there to understand the politics, too.Perhaps Hermer does lack political nous, but it looks like this is precisely the character Starmer was hoping would fill the role. Often, the true frustration of Hermer’s critics appears to actually be with the PM, with the attorney general a convenient proxy. “All the things people don’t like about Keir are being directed at Richard because he’s not the boss,” says one friend. As long as doubts linger over Starmer’s ability to combine delivery with a strong political narrative, Hermer is vulnerable.Sienna Rodgers is deputy editor of the House magazineExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

To confirm this, scientists dissected a frog’s eye and removed the lens. If you dissected eyes in biology class, you may remember that a lens is extraordinarily simple and unlike other organs. It is a hard, clearish, object that comes out clean: no blood supply, no blood. It looks like a glass bead, and functions – inanimate – much like glass, and not like most things we find in our body (except maybe teeth, which function like knives). Look through the lens at the classroom around you, you will see it clearly, but upside down.A manatee: Imagine eating lettuce under water | Helen SullivanRead moreA frog in space,moving further and further from the sun, would eventually start to see not a shrinking star but tiny flashes of light: individual photons. This is because as the photons travel further from their source, they are spread over greater areas: they will hit a frog’s eye less and less often.My grandmother had a pond full of frogs. During the holidays, we would collect tadpoles in jars and watch them grow bigger and grow limbs. Looking at them from the bottom of the jar, you could see their translucent skin, like the soft throat of an adult frog. The best stage was legs plus tail: the most awkward, the most like one of those kids’ books where the pages are split so that as you turn the top or bottom, a hybrid animal is formed.View image in fullscreen‘My grandmother is dead, but I can hear her voice, the frogs in the dark garden outside the window.’Photograph: AJ Withey/Getty ImagesThe frog’s metamorphosis seems more like a human’s than a butterfly’s – maybe it is that so much is visible, and awkward, whereas the butterfly forms in secret. Perhaps it is that our memories make us amphibious: moving between memories, imagination, the past, the future and the world present around us.I love their beautiful hands, especially those with tapioca pearls as fingertips, and the long, graceful thigh section of their legs: a surprise, attached to those boxy torsos. And that the old English word for frog is ‘frosc’. And Robert Gibb: “Breath / was a kind of skin, we learned, /In which they were wrapped.”When I was a kid, We All Stand Together, the Paul McCartney song from the animated short film Rupert and the Frog Song would play often on TV as some sort of placeholder. I was growing up in newly democratic South Africa and it seemed to be part of that experience, the idea that if we all worked together, we could forgive the past and build something glorious. The song was released in 1984 – when a kids’ songbacked by fictional frogscould reach No 3 on the UK singles chart – so I have no idea what it was doing on South African television a decade later. There is probably a more mundane reason than the fact that it is just totally wonderful.In the film, the song starts with a frog conductor and a frog orchestra and three frog vocalists in a pink seashell. More frogs appear; they hop as they sing. They drift past, singing, on a spinning lily pad. There are frog violinists, accordion players, ballet dancers. Two black cats try to sing and are shushed by an owl. Night falls, fireflies appear, the frog animation becomes impressionistic colours and shapes; watching it now, knowing about frog eyes as I do, it seems like a film partly about this ability of frogs to register the pulse of a single quantum of light.In the poet C Dale Young’s The Tree Frog, he wonders how it is that he can visualise the face of a man who is not there. “Why his image persists … is beyond anything I can understand.”I feel the same way: I cannot begin to understand where or how it is that I can see my bedside light switched on, and the mood of the room around it. Or myself as a child, watching frogs sing on TV. It is a trick of the light. But then you can hear nonexistent frogs, too. My grandmother is dead, but I can hear her voice, ice moving in her glass of whisky, the frogs in the dark garden outside the spare room window.“What lessons must be learned to overcome the final act of longing?” Young asks.Sometimes the curtain does notcompletely fall, and the play, barely visible,continues. This much I know. This muchthe textbooks have taught us. The blind manCervantes built continued to see and saw fartoo much, could not accept the utter purityof Abstraction. But is that not our essential fault?A tree frog croaks against the backdrop of memory,and the cold sheets and darkened room return,but you are not here to whisper me to sleep.Helen Sullivan is a Guardian journalist.

The historic success of the far right in Germany’s federal election is a threat not only for all disadvantaged groups in this country – including women, immigrants, queer people, people of colour, Jewish people, disabled people – it is a threat to democracy that should concern everyone.Still, it is those groups that will be most affected by a mood shift that comes with the reality that one in five voters are in favour of a party whose co-leader, Alice Weidel,announcedlast night on live TV: “We will hunt them down!” Echoing a warningonce proclaimedby a former AfD co-chair in 2017, when the party first entered parliament, this was ostensibly a warning to other political parties, but her intentional wording of course provokes all of us who the AfD sees as opponents. And it doesn’t even cause a scandal any more. We know whothey areand what theyare up to. The question is: who else will join them in rhetoric and actions?On Sunday night, when the counting of the election results had just started, I stopped by an “election party for the plural democracy” in Berlin. The non-partisan event, billed as a “public screaming”, took place only a few metres away from the chancellery. Gathered under the umbrella of an anti-fascist consensus, artists, activists, journalists and academics came together in short panels to share their hopes and fears for the coming years, while the audience was having pizza and dancing to hip-hop band the Swag’s uplifting performances in between. It felt good to be among people who dressed up and left the house, instead of mourning at home. The victories of conservative and far-right parties had been widely expected, so we celebrated the small victories instead: the pro-business FDP and the anti-immigrant populist party BSW didn’t make it into parliament; the Left tripled its votes since polls from December, from 3% to almost 9%.The important conclusions of the night were: we have to organise and strengthen our resistance against the right-leaning majority, we have to spread this energy outsideBerlinand we have to watch out for each other and leave all bitterness arising from intra-left conflicts aside. The priority has to be to protect our civil and human rights. None of these strategies are new, of course, but it’s important to reassure each other again and again, especially after a night of results that felt like a turning point for progressive forces. And it certainly helps to do so under a giant disco ball.Alice Weidel had reason to be elated: the AfD can’t be ignored nowKatja HoyerGerman-British historian and author of Beyond the Wall: East Germany, 1949–1990Germany’s election could almost convince outside observers that consensus politics is alive and well in Berlin. There is aclear winner: the conservative CDU/CSU, whose leader, Friedrich Merz, looks set to be the next German chancellor. The incumbent, Olaf Scholz, conceded immediately and congratulated his challenger. There were no concerns of civil unrest nor suspicions of electoral fraud.But underneath the surface, deep cracks have appeared in Germany’s political landscape. After the second world war, theconservativesvowed that there must never be a successful party to the right of them. Now, it’s obvious that they’ve failed in that ambition. The anti-immigration AfD has doubled its support from 2021, coming second with about a fifth of the vote share.The AfD leader, Alice Weidel, was visibly elated. Understanding that this electoral breakthrough has made her party impossible to ignore, she told reporters: “We’re now firmly anchored as aVolkspartei” – or “people’s party”, a term once used exclusively for the CDU/CSU and Olaf Scholz’s SPD as the big beasts of German politics.Weidel didn’t hold back in demonstrating what will likely become the AfD’s strategy: breaking down the so-called firewall that’s keeping it out of power. All other parties have vowed never to work with the AfD. As Merz begins the difficult task of assembling a coalition that forces his centre-right party to turn to a centre-left coalition partner, Weidel reminds him that her door is open too, “so that the will of the people might be implemented”.She was alluding to Merz’s election promise to restrict irregular immigration, which is somethingpollssay the majority of Germans want. His likely coalition partner, the SPD, is very uneasy about that, not least because the AfD might vote with it, which many see as a breach of the firewall.Meanwhile, as the main opposition party, the AfD won’t have to dirty its hands with messy election results and compromise politics. It doesn’t have to find answers to complicated questions. All it has to do is point to conflict between Germany’s centrist parties in their quest for solutions, knowing a fifth of the German electorate lends a lot of weight to the battering ram hammering the firewall.If there are clear winners of Germany’s 2025 election, it’s the political fringes.80% voted for liberal democracy – Merz should govern for themCas MuddeStanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of GeorgiaIt was a typical western European election for the 21st century: the centrist parties scored historically bad results, the far right gained,and the party system fragmented further.Although the results showed aRechtsruck,a swing to the right, it was much smaller than expected – particularly in light of a campaign focused on immigration and the role of the far right, which is a combination that has proved to be the perfect breeding ground for recent far-right victories in western Europe, for example Sweden in 2022 and the Netherlands in 2023.True, a small majority of Germans did vote for anti-immigration parties, but all of them underperformed. The conservative CDU/CSU won the most seats but did not top 30%, its second-worst result in history; the far-right AfD came second nationally but, at just over 20%, fell short ofits performance in state electionsa few months ago. The left-conservativeBSWfailed to win enough seats to enter the Bundestag at all, despite a year of media hype about its prospects.Rather than declaring the minority that voted for the far right to be “the” German people, the centrist parties should accept and address the pluralism of Germany’s population. With a stagnating economy and a new global reality, the country needs a strong democratic government, as the chancellor-to-be, Friedrich Merz, noted in his conciliatory victory speech.His government should neither cater to the far right nor define itself in opposition to it. Rather, it should constitute a broad, grand coalition with the Social Democrats and the Greens, around a necessarily minimal but nevertheless positive agenda that situates Germany at the heart of a liberal democratic Europe. Like so many centrist campaigns before, the anti-immigrant campaigns of both centrist parties (CDU/CSU and SPD) did not win over any far-right voters. Nor did they inspire their core voters. To do that, they will need their own ideas and priorities, which means looking beyond immigration (which was only thethird most important issuefor voters, despite the disproportionate media and political attention) and a constructive focus on socioeconomic issues (the most important issue for CDU/CSU and SPD voters), as well as ensuring peace in an increasingly hostile world (the second biggest issue for SPD voters, fourth for CDU/CSU voters).In other words, they should govern for the 80% who voted for liberal democracy rather than for the 20% who voted against it.Merz is caught between conservatism and authoritarianism, at home and abroadMariam LauPolitical journalist with Die ZeitIn a somewhat sombre mood, Germany’s Christian Democrats celebrated their victory on Sunday night after a country in turmoil had, in huge numbers (an 83% turnout, unmatched since German reunification), gone to the polls. Even though their own score was underwhelming – the CDU/CSU had expected a solid third of the votes, and got only 28.5% – Friedrich Merz is set to fulfil a life-long dream: at the age of 69, after several failed attempts, he is expected to become chancellor of the Federal Republic.A business lawyer who has done quite well for himself during a decade outside professional politics, Merz has never actually governed. But even without that experience, the future chancellor knows what challenges he faces. The country, though still the world’s third-largest economy, is in the third year of recession. Political tensions have mounted, in particular after a succession of killings in public places in which the suspects were refugees or Islamists. The AfD, Germany’s far right, has now doubled its strength and will sit to Merz’s right in the German Bundestag with a mind-boggling 152 seats, reflecting the votes of about 20% of the electorate. The AfD, not the Social Democrats, came in second.Merz, a cultural conservative and a liberal in his economics, has often expressed his personal disgust vis-à-vis members of the AfD. He does not greet them, even when caught alone with one of their midst in an elevator. And yet the chancellor-to-be recently granted them an unnecessary triumph when bringing a motion into parliament concerning migration that would only be passed with the AfD’s consent.Merz’s CDU/CSU finds itself in a quandary: while the Social Democrats (whom he will have to govern in coalition with) paint him as a rightwing populist who is paving the way for the far right, the AfD recently yelled at him in the Bundestag: “We are the future, Herr Merz! Follow us if you still have any strength left.” Many in the CDU/CSU fear that this will be their last chance: “If the centre parties don’t manage to solve our country’s problems, the next elections will be lost,” Merz said at many campaign stops. “And the elections after that will be those of 2033. Imagine that.”But the central pitch of his campaign has been a global one. Merz, a staunch transatlanticist and pro-European, sees Germany at the forefront of the worldwide clash between democracies and authoritarians. It was a shock for him and his party to see how Elon Musk, the US president’s right-hand man and owner of the platform X, blatantly interfered with the elections in favour of the AfD, a party with many anti-American instincts. Merz openly vented his anger and annoyance at JD Vance’sMunich interventionin the same vein. It is this – the palpable and existential difference between conservatism and authoritarianism – that will mark his reign, one way or the other.Germany’s mainstream parties legitimised the far rightTarik Abou-ChadiGerman political scientist and professor of European politics at the University of OxfordIn many ways, it was a relatively normal election. With an incredibly unpopular government and a dire economic outlook, voters decided to support opposition parties instead of those that made up the previous coalition. All members of the outgoing coalition made up of the SPD, Greens and FDP lost votes – with bigger losses for the SPD and FDP than for the Greens. The conservative opposition CDU/CSU came out on top.However, even in this relatively normal election, some things stand out. Above all, the dramatic electoral success of the far-right AfD, which almost doubled its vote share and came out with more than 20% of the vote. The AfD has massively benefited from immigration being the dominant issue in the campaign. Over recent years, nearly all other parties have moved further to the right on immigration. As we know fromextensive researchon this phenomenon, such accommodation normalises and legitimises the far right.As in many other European countries, the behaviour of the mainstream left and mainstream right has strongly contributed to the success of the far right in Germany. Only a few weeks ago, the CDU/CSU tried to pass a law with the support of the AfD – a historic precedent in the Bundestag. This clearly did not help the CDU/CSU electorally. It lost close to a million voters to the AfD. But this strategy has moved the AfD from the fringes to the centre of German politics. While the AfD will very likely not be part of the next German government coalition, this election and the behaviour of other German parties have lifted them into a new position of power.The second remarkable result comes from the leftwing Die Linke. It had been written off as a dead party that was very likely not to make it into the Bundestag again after Sahra Wagenknecht broke away to form her own movement. However, the Linke strongly increased its support in the last weeks of the campaign. Many believe that the party managed to attract progressive voters who were alienated by the SPD and Greens, especially on migration and Gaza.While many progressives turned their backs on the SPD a long time ago, the Greens seemed like the natural home for these voters. However, as part of a government that pushed through draconian measures against asylum seekers, and running a campaign strongly focused on the centre, the Greens did not manage to gain these voters’ support. Their biggest losses were among younger voters – their former stronghold. Die Linke saw huge gains among these voters and it has also come out as the strongest party in Berlin.It should be a lesson for left and progressive parties in Europe that moving right can be a costly strategy, because progressive voters will look for a new home.Europe needs German leadership to save Nato and the EUPaul TaylorSenior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreAs Donald Trump rushes to carve up Ukraine with Vladimir Putin over the heads of the Ukrainians and Europeans, Europe urgently needs a stronger Germany to give its voice more weight. Berlin has been largely absent from diplomacy over the future of the EU and Nato, because its government was weak and divided long before it collapsed last year, and its economy is in the doldrums after two years of recession. With France also in political crisis, there is a power vacuum at the heart of Europe just when strong leadership is vital.Conservative Friedrich Merz, who will be the next chancellor after his party topped Sunday’s poll, is determined to provide that leadership. He sounds bolder and less cautious than the outgoing Social Democratic chancellor, Olaf Scholz. On Sunday night, Merz said his absolute priority would be “to strengthen Europe so that we can achieve step-by-step real independence from the US”, adding that it was not clear “whether we will still be able to talk about Nato in its current form” after Trump’s rapprochement with Russia. The lifelong Atlanticist has said Europe can no longer rely on American protection, and called for talks with the UK and France on sharing their nuclear deterrent with Germany and Europe.Yet it remains unclear how far Merz will be able to overcome Germans’ deep-seated aversion to all things military, boost defence spending substantially by loosening the country’s borrowing straitjacket, or agree to borrow jointly with European partners to procure key defence systems. Sunday’s result gives him a chance to form a two-party coalition with the Social Democrats. However, even with support from the Greens, he will not have the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament to reform the constitutional debt brake, unless he can win votes from the opposition hard-left Die Linke or the far-right AfD. It will take two months to form a new government, and, as Merz put it, “the world will not wait for us, but Europe is waiting for Germany”.To give the ailing EU a new impulse, the conservative leader has pledged to restore Germany’s strained relations with Paris and Warsaw, and to draw Britain into a security partnership with the main European powers. It will take skill to surmount tensions with France over German support for more EU free trade agreements, notably with South America, and with Poland over its longstanding demand for reparations for destruction dating back to the second world war.Germany’s voice will be crucial in shaping how far the EU pauses or slashes energy and environment regulations in its quest to restore economic competitiveness. German conservatives also lead the European Commission (Ursula von der Leyen) and the largest group in the European parliament (Manfred Weber of the European People’s party), so Merz is well placed to press his deregulation agenda. However, von der Leyen was the architect of the EU’s Green Deal legislation to fight climate breakdown, and she may resist a drastic rollback.The new chancellor faces daunting challenges in Europe, but his partners are yearning for a more proactive Germany.This was a bad result for progressives, but Merz lacks a strong mandateDominic SchwickertExecutive director of the independent thinktank Das Progressive ZentrumYes, the result is certainly not a good one for progressive forces. As in most industrialised countries, the population is massively dissatisfied with the current federal government. Furthermore, the centre-left alliance was far too often preoccupied with internal disputes even before its collapse in November. As a result, the conservative CDU/CSU and the far-right AfD have been stable leaders in the polls for more than a year. Progressive forces, meanwhile, find themselves in an unfamiliar position: instead of being in favour of change, the SPD and Greens are currently generally perceived as being in favour of extending the status quo – which the majority does not want.And yet: Friedrich Merz and his party do not have a strong mandate. Given the high level of dissatisfaction with the coalition government, the CDU/CSU cannot be satisfied with a meagre gain of four percentage points and the second-worst result in its history.Either way, Merz does not have much time to form a stable government – which is what is needed now, taking into account the global political situation. The CDU/CSU’s ideal scenario – only needing one partner and being able to choose from two – has not materialised. The CDU/CSU is dependent on the SPD.The good news: if a black-red coalition (CDU/CSU-SPD) is formed, Germany will have a stable, centrist government – with a strong Green party in the opposition. However, as a junior partner, the SPD would once again be faced with the difficult task of ensuring stability in the country through compromises with the CDU/CSU – and at the same time renewing itself. The Greens, who have lost the least among the coalition forces, are facing a crucial analysis: isRobert Habeck’s course, which has brought the Greens out of their niche as an ecological party, still the right one – or did it cost them more votes in the leftwing milieu than could be won in the centre? This question will determine the internal party discussion over the next few weeks.What is important for the next federal government in terms of its agenda? The top priority must be for Germany to expand its defence and security policy capabilities even more decisively and, in close coordination with Poland and France, to assume a leading role in a Europe that must defend itself against Russian imperialism and the anti-western course of the Trump administration. This requires an end to small-mindedness in fiscal policy: a reform of thedebt braketo enable urgently needed investment in German defence capabilities, competitiveness and infrastructure; anticipating the uncertain majority situation in the new parliament, such a programme should still be initiated under and together with the Scholz government. Finally, the new federal government must manage to bring the migration debate back to an objective level and find a face-saving solution for all parties involved; contrary to what Merz suggested during the election campaign, this can only be a European policy solution.This is precisely why the coalition negotiations must be finalised quickly – so that Germany does not continue to be gripped by its internal issues, but rather, in view of the changed global political situation, it ensures that Europe is self-confident and capable of acting in the battle of the great powers, and not shredded by it.Explore more on these topicsGermanyThe panelAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)Olaf ScholzEuropeFriedrich MerzcommentShareReuse this content"

Mine did tooJason HazeleyMillie had fantastic recall, unlike mine. Now there are parts of my past – and myself – that I’ll never be able to rememberMon 24 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 04.14 ESTShareIwas midway through Kathryn Mannix’sWith the End in Mindwhen it happened. It’s a comforting book – the author is a palliative care consultant – that describes the basics of a good death: a diminuendo. The mind fades. The breath slows. Inevitably, gently, life stops.And then I got the call: my sister Millie had died. Her death, at the age of 47, was sudden and unexpected. She was my only sibling – four years younger than me. I put the book down. I’ll probably never finish it.Shockgriefis not the same as “here it comes” grief, the feeling you eventually get when someone has been ill and deteriorating for some time. There’s no chance for reflection while shock is in charge. In the days that followed, I was overwhelmed by one notion: that someone ought to tell Millie she was dead – she didn’t see this coming either – and that the someone ought to be me.Then the sadness began to change. Shock grief gave way to something new. Let’s call it horizontal grief. I’d done vertical grief. My father died years ago, and I have lost grandparents and aunts and uncles – but losing the only other member of the family who went to the same primary school as me and with whom I shared the back seat of the Austin Maxi and argued over the Kellogg’s variety pack on day one of every holiday was something new and dreadful.My sister was a lot of what I’m not. She was immensely practical. Pulling down a wall was, to her, what straightening a picture is to me. Millie also (unlike me) had a phenomenal memory for detail. She could describe the pyjamas I was wearing when we were woken by the garden wall getting blown down in the great storm of 1987 (when I first and finally heard my mum say “fuck”). She knew the name of the boy at the French holiday camp who told 10-year-old me how babies were made. She remembered my imaginary friend, Tommy Taplin, better than I did.As Millie’s death graduated from a “shock” to a “thing”, I began to realise just how much I had always relied on her version of events. When she was born, she “bought me” (in the charming, absurd tradition that an unborn sibling is gestating alongside a gift) a present. It was something to do with either Noddy or the Wombles. But which? I’ll never know again. When she died, she took the memory of not one but two childhoods with her – in all their vivid, silly, scattered, doesn’t-matter-but-it-does detail.My brother and father drowned on a bright summer day. Swimming brings me closer to the two men I’ve lost | Indigo PerryRead moreI feel as though I have lost a witness, someone who can attest to what happened to us both. Millie is gone; my father has been dead many years; and my mother’s memory is cruelly abandoning her. It is as though 90% of the family photo albums are suddenly gone. “To lose your younger sister is a terrible thing,” wroteBlake Morrison. “There’s no one alive to check the truth.”I am resigned to a future of “I don’t know”. Why did our dad throw his career away in his 30s? I don’t know. But he would have told Millie. Did I imagine an apparently lost bus struggling to turn around in our cul-de-sac one Saturday morning? Millie would have been able to confirm. Did our nan smoke weed? I’m sure Millie mentioned that once. Except I’m not sure now, and can’t be.Memories are the stories we tell ourselves, and they are the building blocks of the self. But if you can’t remember the stories, who are you? Anyone who has loved someone with memory issues knows the horror that is watching apersonality vanishwhile the person remains. Dementia, if heredity determines it, could be my future. The rest of my memories could in time be corrupted and deleted.For many bigger reasons, I miss Millie. She was very, very alive – an inveterate showoff, and with good reason. I have never known anyone more impossible to ignore. One memory I hope I never lose is of her blazing her way through Katy Perry’s Roar at a children’s party, madly choreographing all the kids. Louder than a lion, that was my sister.Jason Hazeley is a comedy writer who is partly responsible for TV untellectual Philomena CunkDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then he comes back for moreMon 24 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 10.36 ESTShareIhave a friend, an American author, who writes about war. Over the past decades, he has been to South Sudan, Rwanda, Congo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza and other conflict zones. In the case ofUkraine, he said one thing stood out: here it was obvious who was the aggressor and who was the victim. Alongside Bosnia, Ukraine’s resistance to Russia remains, in his opinion, one of two truly just wars.After three years of fighting a just war against Putin’s aggression, we are now facing, with Donald Trump, an unjust peace. Ukraine will lose lands and will not receive compensation for its losses. War crimes will go unpunished and Ukrainians will not be provided with the security guarantees needed to protect them from future Russian attack.It is not a new scenario. Think of the Russian-Georgian war of 2008. Russia attacked neighbouring Georgia, yet the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy, whose country held the presidency of the European Council, did his best toappeaseRussia,forcing Georgia into a humiliating peace.Russia’s war on Georgiahad another, lesser-known consequence. AfterRussia’s victory, Vladimir Putin subsequently adopted plans for a full-scale war against Ukraine. The weak western response to Russia’s aggression in Georgia gave Putin reason to believe that it would react similarly in the case of Ukraine. Just as his war against Georgia was largely a reaction to itspro-western revolutionof 2003, Ukraine was to be “punished” for the 2004 Orange revolution that threatened to move Ukraine out of Russia’s orbit. Putin’s plan leaked and its details appeared in a2009 newspaper articlewritten by two leading Ukrainian security experts. But at the time it was considered so fantastical that few people credited it.In any case, Ukraine was spared whatever fate Putin had in mind for it in 2010, when the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych came to power. In 2013, Yanukovych surprisingly supported Ukraine’s journey towards European integration. But in a sudden volte face, when it came to signing a historic association agreement with the EU that year,he pulled the plug. This abrupt change of heart came after a meeting with Putin. There was speculation that Putin coerced Yanukovych by threatening to launch his war on Ukraine if the country continued its westward movement. Yanukovych’s unilateral refusal to sign the EU agreement triggered anew wave of proteststhat began in Kyiv in November 2013 – and eventually became known as theEuromaidan revolution.The standoff dragged on for months, and by early 2014 it became clear that a Russian invasion was only a matter of time. I am telling this from my own experience: during the Euromaidan, I worked at an ad hoc thinktank, and we were informed about Putin’s plans. We knew we had only until the end of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Immediately after it ended, theannexation of Crimeabegan. According to the thinking in the Kremlin, this was supposed to initiate a “Russian spring” – an uprising of the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine against Kyiv. It failed to materialise. The majority of Ukrainians, regardless of what language they spoke, did not want to let war into their homes.Instead of a civil war in Ukraine, Putin got a low-intensity war in Donbas that he could not win. Still, he knew how to wait. Those who know Putin well say the philosophy he lives by is similar to that of judo – a sport he has practised since his youth. In judo, you stay close to your opponent and wear them down until they give up. Despite the failure to achieve his goals in 2014, Putin abandoned nothing. The full-scale invasion of 2022 confirms this.More than once, Putin and his spin doctors have insisted that Russia is not at war with Ukraine, but with the west in Ukraine. He sees Ukraine as an artificial nation, created by the west to subvert Russia’s power. Independent Ukraine is guilty by the very fact of its existence. Truce is possible in such a war but not peace – just as there could be no peace in the war between Rome and Carthage.However, a truce would resolve very little if anything. And for Ukraine it would bring an additional risk. From the beginning of the war, Ukrainians have been demanding a just and lasting peace. Now, instead, they will get a shaky and unfair truce.The discrepancy between high expectations and humiliating reality is one of the most reliable indicators of a pre-revolutionary crisis. Unlike 2004 and 2014, a new revolution could be led by people who have returned from the front and feel betrayed by their own government. The resulting civil conflict would give Putin the perfect opportunity to invade Ukraine again – this time under the pretext of establishing political stability.In February 2022, Putin’s objective was to capture Kyivin three days. What he failed to do then, Trump may help him to achieve within the next three years or even sooner. And then, the whole world is before him. Experts say he will be ready to attack the west within thenext three to five years.Many in the west are ignoring his long-term ambitions now, just as they ignored them in 2008. But if history has anything to teach us, one of its lessons is this: you cannot appease an aggressor who is thinking long-term. Ukrainians learned this the hard way. Prior to the full-scale invasion of 2022, we were warned about the war but we didn’t want to believe it. It is probably human nature to mobilise only once a threat becomes real.I would love to be wrong, but my historian’s gut tells me that in February 2022 the world entered a decade of war. The saying “if you want peace, prepare for war” remains as relevant after three years of war in Ukraine as it has been for 2,000 years.Yaroslav Hrytsak is a historian and professor at the Ukrainian Catholic University in LvivExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVladimir PutinRussiaEuropeGeorgiaTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t be provokedSam RoggeveenFaced with economic or military coercion, the best strategy is not to be aggressive or obstreperous but quietly implacableFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastSun 23 Feb 2025 21.49 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 00.44 ESTShareThe PLA Navy’s unprecedentedlive-fire exercise640 kilometres off the south coast of New South Wales, quickly followed by a second such exercise closer to New Zealand, was provocative and deeply regrettable. But it does not call for an immediate aggressive Australian response, it does not show that the Australian government’s diplomacy is failing, and it certainly does not indicate that Australia is helpless as China’s military power grows.If this exercise somehow demonstrated that the government hasn’t been tough enough onChina, then what would that say about the frequent foreign naval activity in waters off China’s coast?For example, it is pretty well agreed these days that Beijing’s illegal artificial island-building campaign in the South China Sea has succeeded. China now exercises a high degree of control over that area, thanks to the overwhelming military and constabulary forces it has staged there, which can move around the area quickly.Australia confronts China over apparent live-fire exercises conducted off coastlineRead moreAustralia, along with its allies and partners, routinely sails warships through South China Sea waters claimed by Beijing. But would anyone seriously claim that Beijing’s policy in the South China Sea has therefore failed? Those transits are designed to make a political and legal point about the status of the waters. They don’t materially change the fact that China is defacto in charge there, and that in a shooting match it would start with a major advantage.The lesson for Australia is to ensure that the same applies to China as its navy grows and, inevitably, it increases its activity near Australia. China needs to know that, while it is free to operate in those waters, it does so in the knowledge that, in the worst case, Australia can overcome whatever Beijing sends our way. That means building an Australian Defence Force focused tightly on the job of sinking ships and shooting down aircraft that threaten our landmass.Contra Alan Kohler, who wrote that “Australia would have no hope against China, as Beijing reminded us last week with live warship drills off the NSW coast”, that’s a job Australia is quite capable of doing, even without a reliable American ally.Geography is Australia’s biggest asset in this regard. It’s over 7,000 kilometres from Sydney to Hainan Island, China’s southern fleet headquarters. China is clearly capable of sending a flotilla that far, but it’s an extremely taxing and expensive journey, and it is difficult for even the most capable navy to sustain forces at those distances.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailWhich makes it imperative for Australia to maintain its advantage by ensuring that China can never build military bases closer to Australia. In that regard, Australian policy has been rather successful lately, starting with the Pacific Step-Up under the previous government and continuing in more recent times with defence agreements withNauru, TuvaluandPapua New Guinea.I’ve written previouslyabout the need for Australia to adopt a stoical position on China. It can be tempting, in moments like these, to demand an immediate and forceful response. But let’s remember the lesson of China’s economic coercion campaign against Australia, which ended just last year. Australian policy ultimately succeeded not because the government was aggressive or obstreperous, but because it was quietly implacable. Over decades, Australia had built a resilient, globalised economy that could absorb the shocks China meted out. This allowed the Morrison and Albanese governments to pursue essentially the same policy: they never escalated the dispute, and they never backed down.Provocations such as China’s weapons drills are the moments when stoicism is tested, when the temptation is to lash out because it fulfils a psychological need to feel like you’re doing something, and the political pressure to look like you’re doing something. But the right response is to continue the quiet work ofmaking Australia into an echidna: unthreatening to those who mean the nation no harm, but prickly and indigestible to those who do.Sam Roggeveen is director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program.

Now the 70-year-old artist is going to the ‘Olympics of art’ where she has ‘all sorts of things to say about Britain’s history and the British pavilion itself’Alex NeedhamMon 24 Feb 2025 15.00 ESTShareLubaina Himid, the artist known for her large stage-set-style installations that draw attention to figures overlooked by history, has been picked by the British Council to represent the UK at the 2026Venice Biennale.“I’m energised and so up for it,” the artist said of the challenge to fill the British pavilion with her work at “the Olympics of art”. She added: “I was ready to do it when I was 30 – it’s just that the British Council weren’t ready for me.”Himid, 70, is only the second Black woman to represent the UK at Venice.Sonia Boyce was the first, in 2022, and received the top prize of the Golden Lion for her multimedia installationFeeling Her Way, a celebration of the Black female musicians who had inspired her. At the 2024 biennial, Britain was represented by John Akomfrah.All three artists are pioneers of Black British art, for instance participating in the First National BlackArtConvention, which was held at Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1982. Their work was often overlooked or marginalised by the predominantly white mainstream art establishment, an experience which Himid says will influence her approach to the pavilion.“We absolutely thought of ourselves as artists, but we were often in places that weren’t dedicated to the showing of art,” Himid said, citing multidisciplinary arts spaces like the Africa Centre and ICA in London. “You might come in for a cup of tea, or be queueing for cinema tickets, and you’d look at our work on the wall. We realised that those were the kinds of environments in which we could speak to the people we wanted to speak to, because they were welcoming.”View image in fullscreen‘I for ever have my eye out for what’s happening’ … Naming the Money, 2004, by Lubaina Himid pictured on show at the Royal Academy’s 2024 exhibition Entangled Pasts: 1768-Now.Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/ShutterstockHimid is confident she can rise to the task of representing Britain. “Why not?” she told the Guardian. “I’m British. I’ve lived here since I was four months old.” She was born in Zanzibar and is now based in Preston, where she teaches at the University of Central Lancashire.The artist believes that people whose national identity is called into question due to their race often have a sharp antennae for the public mood. “I don’t live here complacently. I for ever have my eye out for what’s happening. What’s the political situation? How are people feeling? What’s missing from museum collections? Sometimes, those of us who feel we don’t belong have several kinds of narratives running at the same time. I have all sorts of things to say about Britain’s history and the pavilion itself.”Some of Himid’s work, such as her 2007 sculptureSwallow Hard: The Lancaster Dinner Service, and her paintingsLe Rodeur, have drawn attention to the UK’s involvement in the slave trade. In recent years, there has been a rightwing pushback to the “woke” uncovering of such narratives, both by artists and bodies such as the National Trust, that has intensified since the election of Donald Trump.“The right are always trying to unravel things,” Himid said. “But the point of artists is to open stuff up, let the cat out of the bag, spill the milk. It either opens up good conversations, or everyone just has to deal with it. The 1970s, when I was at art school, were tough times. So were the 1980s. But I kept making the work I wanted to make – there’s nothing else I can do.”The choice of artist to represent their country can be a vexed one. Khaled Sabsabi was due to represent Australia at Venice next year, but was sacked after the shadow arts minister complained about a 2007 video work thathad included images of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.“Artists have to say what we want to say, and sometimes people don’t want us to say it,” Himid said. “No one’s ever told me to tone down my work. They let me show it and then they take the piss.”This year, Himid will revisit a 1985 show of art by Black women which she was forced to stage in a corridor at the ICA which ran from the bar to the toilet – a far cry from the expansive halls of the British pavilion. Himid will spend the rest of the year making work for Venice before the biennale opens next April.What kind of work does she plan to make? “I always paint, so there will be paint,” the artist revealed, hinting: “I’m interested in how surrealism meets the everyday, the space between a question and an answer. I’ve got a lot of work to do. It’s nerve-racking, but exciting. I wouldn’t be doing it if I didn’t think I had something interesting to say.”Explore more on these topicsLubaina HimidVenice BiennalePaintingArtnewsShareReuse this content"

The dignified richness of her vocal was tempered by the subtly volcanic power she displayed on her reading of To Sir With Love off Lost Takes – a not-so-quiet fire that always resided within her.She grew up in awe of Mahalia Jackson but, doubting she’d ever match the gospel pioneer’s fearsome pipes, dedicated herself instead to piano. At 15, she won a scholarship to study piano at Howard University, where – after the singer she’d been booked to accompany at the annual freshman talent show got cold feet – she sang Henry Nemo’s wartime pop standard Don’t Take Your Love From Me and won the competition. Subsequently, she focused her studies on singing, becoming assistant conductor of the university choir and directing a production of Aida.While singing standards in Washington DC nightclubs after graduation, she enraptured pianist and singerLes McCann, who sent her to Atlantic’s studios. There, in a 10-hour marathon in early 1969, she recorded her debut album First Take, an uncompromising and ambitiously diverse collection comprising Leonard Cohen covers, soulful tunes penned by future collaborator Donny Hathaway and Ballad of the Sad Young Men, a powerful salute to gay men who lived their lives in secret. But it was her cover of Ewan MacColl’s folk standard The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face – an almost unbearably intimate, desolate recording, used brilliantly by Clint Eastwood in his 1971 directorial debut Play Misty for Me – that sent the album to the top of the charts, selling more than 2m copies and winning Flack the first of numerous Grammys.First Take set the tenor for albums of substance and character that were informed as much by her classical and gospel roots as the soul milieu she was marketed to, but still scored hits. Quiet Fire, released in 1971, returned her to her gospel roots, applying her dignified fervour to songs sacred and secular. The title track of Killing Me Softly, released in 1973, would prove her biggest, most enduring hit. Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway, an album of duets with the troubled soul auteur, released in 1972, showcased a lighter side to Flack’s signature sound, one she explored further on 1975’s effervescent Feel Like Makin’ Love, with the title track delivering her third chart-topping single.Flack was badly shaken when Hathaway took his own life in 1979, before they could complete a mooted second album of duets. A subsequent collaboration with Peabo Bryson sired Tonight I Celebrate My Love – its synths and dulcet crooning coining the insurgent adult contemporary genre that would dominate the decade, but the collaboration failed to match the lightning she’d captured with Hathaway. The bold statements of her earlier work gave way to Christmas albums, sets of Beatles covers and the theme tune to NBC sitcom Valerie; still, no one sang them quite like Roberta.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

But behind her, Flack had left a career that was like no other, which was exactly what she’d aimed for. “I didn’t try to be a soul singer, a jazz singer, a blues singer,” shetold the Guardian in 2020, looking back on a lifetime she’d spent honing her own voice. “My music is my expression of what I feel and believe in a moment.”Explore more on these topicsRoberta FlackPop and rockSoulcommentShareReuse this content"

As he publishes a memoir, Holland talks about frisky stallions, today’s ‘over-sensitive’ era – and being huge in HungaryMon 24 Feb 2025 11.11 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 12.18 ESTShareTo the general showbiz warning about never acting with animals, Jeffrey Holland has a specific footnote to add about equine erections. While filming Hi-de-Hi!, the 1980s BBC sitcom set in a holiday camp, Holland one day found himself playing the front half of a pantomime horse, with co-star Su Pollard in the rear. The visual gag was that the rag nag ends up riding a real one. “So the horse had to be in the scene,” recalls Holland. “But it took rather an interest in the pantomime one and started sniffing around its hindquarters. Su said words to the effect of, ‘Oh, eck!’ and asked for help. But I’m afraid all I could say was, ‘You’d better brace yourself, Su. I’m going to eat some grass!’”A horseman on set diverted the randy stallion, but the incident triggered a flashback for Holland. A panto he once appeared in included a Coventry production with real horses. One would become aroused as soon as it walked on stage, forcing the director to place an actor with a large flag between it and the audience. “Apparently, it was responding to a perfume an actress was wearing,” Holland recalls – and being careful with scent around mounts is one of the many useful tips for younger performers contained in Holland’s new memoir, The First Rule ofComedy..!When my then wife saw me playing a serious resistance fighter, she said it was the funniest thing she’d ever seenThe title comes from the “professional” advice that Paul Shane, as campsite entertainment host Ted Bovis, would give to Holland, playing younger comedian Spike, in Hi-de-Hi! That show dominates the book, but Holland’s involvement in it was the result of sheer chance. In 1975, dismayed at not being cast in two plays at Chichester, the then 29-year-old went grumpily and reluctantly to audition for a London stage show of Dad’s Army. “I was furious when I arrived. But David Croft, the director, cast me and that was the day that changed my life. It’s better not to think about it having gone the other way, really. It’s terrifying.”View image in fullscreen‘Spike was written with me in mind’ … Holland at home in London.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianIn this theatrical spin-off from the Home Guard sitcom, Holland had “five or six costumes, and it was 78 steps from the stage to my dressing room so I was up and down them all night. I think that may have stuck in David’s mind: Jeff Holland likes silly costumes! So Spike, who was always appearing in outrageous get-ups, was written with me in mind.”Holland became a member of Croft’s TV repertory company. As well as Hi-de-Hi! he appeared in two other shows Croft co-wrote with Jimmy Perry (Dad’s Army, You Rang M’Lord?), one collaboration with Jeremy Lloyd (Are You Being Served?) and one with Richard Spendlove (Oh, Doctor Beeching!) He missed out on Croft and Lloyd’s ’Allo ’Allo! on TV but got the full set by appearing in a stage version.’Allo ’Allo! was a parody of Secret Army, a serious BBC drama set in occupied Belgium. It is thought that Holland is the only actor to have been in both franchises, although his first performance in Secret Army offered a clue to where his career was headed: “I played a French resistance fighter called Michel. Wearing a beret, doing comedy eye acting, I looked a complete tit. When my then wife saw it, she thought it was the funniest thing she’d ever seen. Maybe that’s why I’ve mainly done comedy.”Croft’s successes were, unusually for sitcoms, often set in the past, whether the second world war home front, the 1920s stately home of You Rang, M’Lord?, the 1950s holiday camp of Hi-de-Hi!, or the 1960s branch railway station of Oh, Doctor Beeching! This, Holland believes, was key: “David always said that if you set them in the past, they wouldn’t date. He also disliked doing Christmas specials because those could only be repeated once a year. That was his producer’s brain at work.“The knack David and his co-writers had is that they were wonderful at creating situations in which people who would otherwise never have met were forced to be together. Those businessmen in Dad’s Army would never have socialised but, under the umbrella of the Home Guard, they had to. And in Hi-de-Hi!, they were all failures who would have given anything not to be stuck with those other flops. Spike Dixon was desperate to be a comedian but had no hope whatsoever.”View image in fullscreenFavourite character … Holland with Su Pollard in You Rang M’Lord?Photograph: Radio Times/Getty ImagesCroft’s theories of comedy worked to the extent that, 37 years after its final episode aired, Hi-de-Hi! is still streaming on multiple platforms including ITVX, while Holland attends regular fan days in Harwich, where it was filmed. He also goes to Dad’s Army events in Thetford, Norfolk, although he only played the small part of a truck-driver who mud-splatters Captain Mainwaring. He is one of the last surviving actors from the show, so feels it is his duty to attend.“It’s extraordinary how the shows live on. At the last Hi-de-Hi! event, there was a six-year-old who knew all the episodes by heart and really loved Spike, who she wanted to meet. Her mum tactfully warned her that Spike would look very different today – which obviously I do! – but she didn’t seem to care. Her mum wasn’t even born when we made the show. I don’t think I’m recognisable now but, just the other day in the street, someone shouted out, ‘Hi-De-Hi Mr Holland!’”In fact, he’s Jeffrey Parkes, the name of the family into which he was born in 1946 in Walsall, the West Midlands still audible in his speech. As with many actors, he was forced to change his surname under Equity rules because a soundalike already had it. “I only use Holland in the business. I couldn’t bring myself to change my first name – though I know actors who have – because I’ve been Jeff all my life. Holland was my grandma’s maiden name and it’s suited me well.View image in fullscreenThe age of the train … in Oh, Doctor Beeching!Photograph: Bbc/AllstarHe has Parkes and Holland bank accounts, the latter for acting fees. He is from the generation that still get “residuals” (repeat fees) rather than “buyouts” (a single payment). A comedy rerun channel, That’s TV 2, shows You Rang M’Lord at 8pm every evening. Holland’s role as James Twelvetrees (“almost a straight role in a comedy”) is his favourite TV character and he was astonished to discover that “it’s shown in Hungary every day in either English or Hungarian. They just love it. It’s because they recognise that two-tier system, the unfairness of it, from having been under the communists for decades.”Another recent residual payment was £140 for a recent BBC Four repeat of the 1978 Thomas Hardy serial The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which he played a cart-driver. Holland rewatched not from vanity but morbid curiosity. When filming, he was still heavily stitched from a vasectomy the previous day, and a scene in which he jumps down from the cart sent shockwaves through his penis. “I still remember the pain. But, watching it, you really couldn’t tell. Which gives me a certain professional pride. I played through it.”He has generational regrets about the way he feels the profession has changed, finding many young stage actors inaudible: “They’re not taught voice projection like I was. The college I went to in Birmingham was known for vocal training. Young actors aren’t taught how to produce the voice from the diaphragm. I’ve sat in the third row of the stalls and not been able to hear what’s being said. You want to shout, ‘Speak up!’”His speech teacher would be pleased that, even at 78, his impression of an irritated theatregoer hits the back wall of the living room, threatening to tremble the Pointless Celebrities trophy that he recently won with Su Pollard.The fact that they think Hi-de-Hi! might offend is beyond me. But there you goAnd, having spent much of his career in the TV genre of “Mrs Slocombe’s pussy”, pantomime and Ray Cooney stage sex farces, Holland also regrets the contemporary crackdown on innuendo and sexual slapstick. He is careful to draw a distinction between sexualised behaviour in workplaces or in public – “that’s clearly wrong” – and the policing of lines in old shows: “David [Croft] and Jimmy [Perry] would turn in their graves. They put a trigger warning on Hi-de-Hi! on BritBox to say these are dated opinions and some people might be offended. The fact that they think Hi-de-Hi! might offend is beyond me. But there you go. People are just over-sensitive about everything now. They’re looking for trouble.”His memoir reveals that a “very big” publisher turned down The First Rule of Comedy..!, after initially expressing interest, because of rumours that Holland had worn blackface makeup in an edition of Are You Being Served? He is indignant about this: the character was white and what was then called a “hippy” with what was known at the time as an “afro” hairdo.Alan Bennett at 90: ‘What will people think? I don’t care any more’Read moreBut, although this isn’t mentioned in the book, Holland admits that he did once wear blackface. On ITV’s Russ Abbot’s Madhouse, he, Abbot, Les Dennis and Michael Barrymore played a soul quartet group called The Four Bottoms, a spoof of Motown quartet the Four Tops. “You couldn’t do it now,” he admits. But does he wish he hadn’t done it then? “No. Because in the 80s, it got no letters from anyone at all. It was the lyrics that were funny and to sing them we had to dress accordingly. That was then, this is now.”A longtime career ambition was a one-man show about comedian Stan Laurel, which he has performed four times at the Edinburgh festival and toured around the UK. In the book, though, Holland says he will be happy to be remembered as “that bloke from Hi-de-Hi!” But is that just memoir bravado? “No! I’ve never understood those actors – I could name them but I won’t – who become known for a series and, when it’s over, they don’t want to know any more. I’m thrilled to have played Spike in the success that Hi-de-Hi! was and still is.”He is excited to be published, although suffers the irritation of many modern autobiographers: “There are three other books on Amazon claiming to be the story of Jeffrey Holland. But it’s just internet shit.”On the retail site, “Lawrence Hardison” is offering 58 pages for £15.99, “Elliot Lewis” 44 pages for £15.50 and “Jack Astley” 93 pages for £14.99. Readers may suspect that a more honest nom de plume for the authors would have the initials AI.“We put up a tweet straight away with me holding the real book. The problem is it’s not actually illegal. Although we’re looking at taking action at the one who claims ‘Jeffrey Holland takes you through the highs and lows of his life’ because obviously I don’t.”True admirers should pay for the 256 pages of The First Rule of Comedy..!, in which you also get Su Pollard’s comment about sex workers to Prince Andrew.The First Rule of Comedy..! by Jeffrey Holland is available now,published by the History PressExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreComedyTelevisionTV comedyPanto seasonActinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

He had a thousand ideas – which is weird because he was probably the only one not doing cocaine’Interviews byHenry YatesMon 24 Feb 2025 10.26 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 13.03 ESTShareSteve Cradock, guitaristI came up with the Riverboat riff during a jam in 1994. It’s just three notes – a child could have written it, and maybe that’s the appeal. It’s not at all “muso” yet it’s very memorable. A favourite tune of mine isGreen Onionswhich is similarly basic but effective. The other thing the riff reminds me of is Ray Charles’s What’d I Say. To extend it, the chorus came from a demo that our bassist Damon Minchella had made. It’s basically the same set of chords as House of the Rising Sun.When it came to recording, we’d turn up at 11am, spend a couple of hours playing cards, then get stuck into it. We’d be drinking all day, smoking spliff, having a whale of a time. I used my gold Les Paul for the solo on that track. It’s exciting – but it’s really rough and ready! There are at least two huge mistakes, where I falter and fuck up, but I just carry on. It was a time when everything wasn’t scrutinised as much as it is in the studio today – it was rawer, a bit more like a live performance where you don’t get to change things. Which is a good job because otherwise I’d have had to go back and work out a proper solo.I think I could have sung it betterThe whole thing was instinctive – we only did a couple of takes. Then I did the octave guitar parts to make it sound even more like early Fleetwood Mac. To me, Riverboat sounds like an underground blues song. At the time, we used go to this great club in Birmingham called Sweat where we’d dance the night away. It reminds me of the instrumentals being played there. You would have Indian Vibes playing and the DJ would spin a Malcolm X speech over the top.It’s an anti-hit, really. It’s like a 6/8 blues waltz, and we kept thinking: “People aren’t gonna be able to dance to this.” But Chris Evans made it single of the week and when we did theTFI Fridaypilot, he said he wanted it as the walk-on music. We got on well with Chris. He was loud, gregarious – and brilliant. He had a thousand ideas, which is weird because he was probably the only one not doing cocaine.Apart from Jools Holland’s Later, TFI was probably the last TV show where you could watch three or four bands playing live every Friday night. I remember seeing Prince soundcheck in the studio one time, with Larry Graham fromSly and the Family Stoneon bass. That was quite a thing. We were all smoking spliffs in the studio and their security tried to throw us out of the building.That whole period was incredible. There was a movement. You could feel that young people were into guitar music, clothes – there was a common thread between it all. The drink, drugs and celebrities got on my nerves after a while. But I still love The Riverboat Song. Even though it’s a very repetitive riff, it doesn’t ever get boring to play.Simon Fowler, singerSteve’s riff seemed like something you just instinctively knew. It always reminded me of that playground taunt “nur-nur-nur-nur-nur”. Our drummer Oscar Harrison came up with that lolloping beat and I wrote the vocal melody. The lyric was inspired by the scene in Apocalypse Now when the boat comes under fire. There’s a war-like edge to the song.I’m a technophobe – I’ve never touched a computer in my life, so I wasn’t really interested in the production side of Riverboat. I would do the guide vocal, then me and Oscar would sod off upstairs and play table tennis all day. I think I could have sung it better. My lower register has got a lot better. But when we recorded it, we realised we had forged the sound ofOcean Colour Scene. Riverboat doesn’t sound like other songs from the Britpop era does it?View image in fullscreen‘That whole period was incredible’ … the band in 1996, when Riverboat was released.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesI knew it was very different, and that it had a killer hook. But I didn’t expect it to break the charts. Without Chris Evans, it never would have happened. We were driving to a gig when the phone went and it was Chris. He said: “Are you all sitting down?” I said: “Of course we’re sitting down, we’re in the fucking van.” He said: “It’s gone in at No 12 midweek.” We went on Top of the Pops. Then our album Moseley Shoals went to No 2 and stayed there for six months.How did I deal with the blokeyness of 90s culture as a gay man? Well, I’m quite a blokey person anyway. When the Sun outed me, Liam Gallagher walked straight up to me and kissed me on the lips. Mel B once asked me out at TFI Friday too. And Geri said: “He bats for the other team.”Swagger. That’s a good word for The Riverboat Song. It’s like: “We’re here and we’re in the moment.” That’s why we invariably open with it, and as soon as Steve plays the riff, you know the crowd are going to love it.Ocean Colour Scene are on tour27 March to 4 MayExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeOcean Colour ScenePop and rockIndieBritpopfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or maybe you haven’t noticed Pearce’s Oscars campaign because he keeps rubbishing his own career:he was “shit” in Memento(“I’m bad in a good movie. Fuck!”), worse in Neighbours (“I played the same thing and it fucking drove me nuts”) and has cheerfully owned up to acting in“a bunch of shit during my divorce because I needed the money”.As awards campaigns go – well, it’s a lot better thanKarla Sofía Gascón’s. Not that Pearce has paid attention. “One of the [Emilia Pérez] actors said something on social media, right?” he says, in the understatement of the century.‘I hate what I did. I’m bad in a good movie’: Guy Pearce downplays his performances as Oscars loomRead moreThough The Brutalist is at the front of everyone’s minds, Pearce is promoting a completely different film: Inside, in which he plays a downtrodden prisoner who tries to convince a younger inmate to kill his notorious cellmate.But what is it like now being “Academy Award nominee”Guy Pearce? “It’s funny,” he says, rubbing that square jaw that suits both rich US industrialists and rough Australian inmates. “Not funny that I haven’t had one before – just funny to even get one, I reckon. I stop and go, ‘Wow, is that – really? OK? That’s really happened?’”Pearce is supremely unbothered by the fuss. “I’ve been nominated for a few of these awards, and I haven’t won any!” he says, laughing. “I’m not gonna win! Kieran [Culkin] will win, again.” Has he got a speech ready? “I’ve had one I’ve thought about for the last three months now – haven’t used it once! Nah, I’ll just forget it.”Pearce has a reputation as one of the more down-to-earth actors in the business: years of living inLA and now Amsterdam has not softened the Aussie contempt for puff and bullshit. He’s sweetly unguarded which can cause him trouble: two weeks before we speak, he made headlines fortelling the Guardian his ex-wife, Kate Mestitz, was the love of his life– and not the Dutch actor Carice van Houten, his partner and mother of his eight-year-old son, Monte. The resulting outrage ledVan Houten to issue an affectionate public statement, clarifying that she and Pearce actually broke up years ago without anyone knowing.“Oh God,” Pearce groans, of the headline. “It blew up into this whole thing! Look, let’s face it, I was in love with Kate when I was 12 – she got a pretty good run-up compared to anyone else in my life. So it’s a fair enough thing to say.”Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningHe and Van Houten “never felt the need to say anything” about their separation “because it’s nobody’s bloody business”, he says. “But Carice was really copping it in Holland. I mean, so was I. But she and I are the best of friends. We live together and look after our boy, and we function like a family. We have a great love, we adore each other. So yes, she probably is the love of my life now.”View image in fullscreenCarice van Houten and Guy Pearce at the 2025 Baftas on 16 February.Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty ImagesThen,a week after we speak, Pearce told an interviewer about howKevin Spacey “targeted” himon the set of LA Confidential and how he “sobbed” decades later when the allegations against Spacey began to emerge. (Spaceyresponded by telling him to “grow up”, to which Pearce declines to comment further.)In the unsettling Australian prison drama Inside, the feature debut of its director, Charles Williams, Pearce plays Warren Murfett, a prisoner on the precipice of parole, who befriends younger inmate, Mel (a remarkable Vincent Miller), and convinces him to kill his notorious cellmate, Mark Shepard, who has been imprisoned since he was 13 for mass murder. Played by Shōgun’s Cosmo Jarvis (doing the best Aussie accent by a foreigner since Dev Patel in Lion), Shepard unnerves the other prisoners with his wide-eyed sermons, often breaking out in tongues; killing him, Warren tells Mel, “is the right thing, the best thing” he can do with his life.View image in fullscreenGuy Pearce and Vincent Miller as Warren and Mel in Inside.Photograph: Mathew LynnWarren cuts an angry, sorrowful figure: he reserves his little enthusiasm for completing the celebrity trivia on the wrappers of sweets that are clearly modelled on Austalia’s Fantales. (Who cares aboutOscars– Pearce was once a Fantale entry.) Pearce loved how realised Warren was; he hates turning up on set and feeling that the character is half baked: “If a director says to me, ‘You can build the character however you want’ – I don’t want to build a character! That always worries me, because I don’t necessarily do my best work when I have to do that. I don’t trust myself.”Inside was filmed in a real prison near Geelong in Australia that hasn’t yet opened. “The staff are all there, the wardens are all there – we had to go through full security checks every time we came in and out every day, but we had the run of the place, which was quite incredible,” Pearce says.Between scenes he would walk around the prison, talking to the wardens (“A lot of them have worked in prisons for years. They hadstories”) and the extras, many of whom were formerly incarcerated: “I was getting a sense of how prison works – who would be where at what time, how you could move from here to there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of course I’m vividly imagining what it would be like if my son were to end up incarcerated, what it must be like for families who have 17-, 18-, 19-year-old boys in prison. Yes, it’s also sad for the 50-year-olds who keep going in and out all their lives – but to look at a young, vulnerable man is pretty devastating.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m really curious about the susceptibility and vulnerability we live with constantly’ … Guy Pearce as Warren in Inside.Photograph: Mathew LynnPearce shot Inside after finishing The Brutalist’s 34-day, breakneck shoot. Both films revolve around ambiguous relationships between men: Van Buren and László Tóth in The Brutalist, Warren and Mel in Inside. The lines are blurred between what is brotherly, paternal, sexual and hostile behaviour; in one scene, Warren directs young Mel in how to kill Shepard during a blowjob – brutal advice, delivered with friendly and erotic overtones.Pearce is “deeply interested” in blurred relationships between men. “As I go through life, trying to understand the dynamics between myself and my friends and – not that I really have any enemies, but people who have done wrong by me – what then happens with that relationship?” he says. “I’m really curious about the susceptibility and vulnerability we live with constantly, whether it is with your lover, your son or your brother. If a writer has homed in on that stuff, I’ll go to that every day of the week. But I’ve done some bad films before – I know I can’t sit around waiting for scripts like this to come along. I’d only work really rarely!”View image in fullscreenGuy Pearce as Harrison Lee Van Buren in The Brutalist.Photograph: Lol Crawley/APDid he take angry, lonely Warren home with him? “I probably inadvertently did, to a degree,” he says. “But I’m so used to it now, especially compared to how I used to do things. I used to feel like I had to have the character in my head 24/7, because I was fearful of losing them, and that became incredibly exhausting. I’ve slowly realised that it doesn’t necessarily mean I do better work. There are definitely days when I can’t really socialise with everyone but I’m better at compartmentalising now. I trust I can get back into the character. Thirty years ago I was pretty stressy about that stuff.”Pearce is now based in the Netherlands, where he’s “really happy” living with Van Houten (they met on set of the 2016 western Brimstone) and their son,Monte. “The pair of us are doing our best as a parenting team,” he says. “But it means that I’m missing out on my life in Australia.”In the lead-up to the Oscars he is trying to watch all the major nominees: “Not to blame my son, but I don’t think I’ve watched anything but Bluey and Harry Potter in eight years.” His co-star Adrien Brody is his call for best actor (“I just love him so much”) but he thought Timothée Chalamet was “stunning” as Bob Dylan, and Sebastian Stan “really incredible” as Donald Trump.Years ago, when Pearce was nominated for every TV award going forMildred Pierce, he found himself in a sort of support group for supporting actors: “It was me, Paul Giamatti, James Woods and Peter Dinklage. But we all got one each! I got the Emmy, someone got the Golden Globe, someone got the Sag award. We’d see each other and go, ‘Yay, you got one!

But big acts were between projects, and Charli xcx and Central Cee are hitting their strideMon 24 Feb 2025 10.37 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 10.40 ESTShareFor decades, Britain has traditionally punched massively above its weight when it comes to pop music: we’re so used to providing the world with huge stars that the sight of a list of global bestselling albums and singles that doesn’t contain a single UK artist comes as a jolt. The industry body IFPI has published its figures for 2024, and these charts are populated solely by American and South Korean artists.It tells you something about a market dramatically opened up by the rise of social media and streaming, which made music from outside the old Anglo-American pop axis more accessible and appealing. Four of the 10 biggest-selling albums of 2024 come from South Korea, a country that continues to exceed expectations, with 17m fewer people than the UK. It has proved infinitely more adept at marketing manufactured pop than Britain or the US in recent years, with K-pop fans actually spending money on albums: when you remove streaming from the equation and look at pure sales, 17 of the top 20 biggest global sellers are South Korean. Sales are helped along by fan-baiting multiple editions – Seventeen’s two charting albums had 12 different versions between them – thoughTaylor Swiftwas the canniest in this regard: she released a total of 36 versions (19 of them physical editions) of The Tortured Poets Department, which duly tops the global album list.The trend for country or vaguely country-influenced pop over the last 12 months means that traditional Nashville star Morgan Wallen is in both charts, as is Noah Kahan, whose woody singer-songwriter strains are distantly related to country. It’s a trend that militates against British artists; we’re good at many things, but country is not traditionally our forte.Furthermore, it perhaps says something about the fact that Britain hasn’t produced a new mainstream pop star striking or original enough to compete outside the confines of their homeland for several years. The highest-placed UK artist on IFPI’s global singles chart, at No 15, was Artemas with I Like the Way You Kiss Me, though nothing on his mix tape Yustyna came close to its success and perhaps his style is too jaded to significantly cross over: his most recent song was named after a porn site. But Raye’s next album could capitalise on the critical acclaim afforded her debut in the US, while Lola Young, whose UK No 1 single Messy is currently outstreaming hits by Lady Gaga, Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter globally on Spotify, could be another bright prospect.And in fairness, the IFPI list isn’t the full story. The absence of British names perhaps says less about a paucity of homegrown stars than the fact that some of the country’s biggest artists – Harry Styles, Adele, Ed Sheeran and Lewis Capaldi among them – are either on hiatus from releasing new music, or in the process of working on it. Meanwhile, you could hardly accuse Charli xcx’s Brat of being an album that landed with insufficient impact, even if its sales weren’t enough to elevate it into the year’s Top 10 biggest sellers: Kamala Harris’s campaign team changed the theme of its social media accounts to mirror that of the album after the singer endorsed the presidential candidate. Outside the period covered by the list, Central Cee’s debut album Can’t Rush Greatness entered the US charts at No 9: nothing to give Kendrick Lamar sleepless nights, but an achievement so extraordinary, given America’s traditional resistance to rap artists from outside its borders, that it would have seemed completely unimaginable even a few years ago.Tellingly, both Charli xcx andCentral Ceehave taken a long time to reach their commercial zenith: Brat is the former’s sixth album, Can’t Rush Greatness arrived nearly eight years after the latter’s debut EP. There’s a lesson about allowing artists to develop, rather than expecting immediate results, which perhaps the British music industry has heeded. After a period in which major labels would apparently alight on anything that had gone viral on social media, which yielded short-term success but little longevity (you may recall their brief faith in the questionable notion that sea shanties were very much the coming thing in 2020), they’re currently claiming to set great store in taking a longer view when it comes to what they sign. It’s the right thing to do: we’ll have to wait to see if it yields results.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMusic industryCharli xcxCentral CeeTaylor SwiftK-popanalysisShareReuse this content"

Tilley talks about sex, cash and Bowery’s untimely deathMon 24 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 05.57 ESTShare‘Leigh would have been livid that it wasn’t a painting of him that broke the record,” says Sue Tilley with a laugh. She’s talking about the £17.2m paid by Roman Abramovich in 2008 for aLucian Freudnude of her, called Benefits Supervisor Sleeping. It was then the highest price ever paid for work by a living artist and Tilley thinks Leigh Bowery, the fashion icon and performance artist, would have found a way to claim the credit. After all, it was Bowery, her great friend, who got her the modelling job.Tilley is now repaying the debt by telling the Australian’s story in a new edition of her book Leigh Bowery: The Life and Times of an Icon, featuring never-before-seen photos and an extra chapter on his legacy. You can’t really understand Bowery – his looks, his performances, his club Taboo, his band Minty – without thinking about Freud. The artist’s naked paintings of Bowery and Tilley are today’s equivalents of the great nudes of the western artistic canon. When he painted these two larger than life people in the 1990s, Freud had finally found subjects who could unlock his full and thrilling mastery of the human form, its flesh and its spirit. Yet, says Tilley, Bowery was not so much muse as collaborator, guiding the older man into preserving him and his friends on canvas.View image in fullscreenNo one dressed freakier than Bowery … at a party in 1987.Photograph: Joan Burey“Leigh liked to sort people’s lives out,” she recalls. “He didn’t like me working in the jobcentre and thought it would be nice for me to do something different. He knew he had to put the idea into Lucian’s head so he’d think it was his own idea. I was invited to lunch where I had to be inspected. Leigh told me what to wear and I completely ignored him as usual! So we had lunch at the River Cafe. It was very nice. Then the next thing I knew I was off being painted. Leigh came round to my house the day before to make me practise taking my clothes off.”Lucian would keep £50 notes in a drawer. Leigh would help himselfBowery, who is about to be celebrated in amajor exhibition at London’s Tate Modern, was born in Sunshine, Melbourne, in 1961 to religious parents who were in the Salvation Army. “He did say to me once, ‘I’m glad I was brought up properly. At least I know the difference between right and wrong. And then when I do wrong, it’s even more amazing!’”View image in fullscreenIn civvies: Bowery with friends Trojan and Tilley on the Isle of Wight ferry, 1984. Courtesy Sue TilleyHe wasn’t an outrageous rebel, though, or at least not at home. When he said he wanted to go to Britain, his parents said he had to save up. On arriving in London, he instantly got himself a job, but it was not exactly a great fit: “He worked in Burger King. But then they offered to promote him to manager, so he said, ‘I’ve got to go, I can’t be the manager.’”From then on, Bowery lived as he wanted, surviving on “bits and bobs”, gradually turning himself into a spectacular work of art. Tilley, who worked in a jobcentre by day and went clubbing by night, met him in the early 1980s. “It was at Cha Chas, which was around the back of Heaven. He wasn’t like Leigh Bowery then. He was just on the scene, going out, getting drunk. Mixed gay clubs – there were loads.”View image in fullscreen‘Leigh made me practise taking my clothes off’ … Sue Tilley in front of Benefits Supervisor Sleeping by Lucian Freud.Photograph: Alastair Grant/APIt was then, Tilley remembers, that club style went wild: “People just started dressing freakier and freakier. It was an effort to find the freakiest outfit, really. People couldn’t afford to buy designer things. Every now and then, you could save up and buy something from Vivienne Westwood, but otherwise you just sort of made them yourself.”No one dressed freakier than Bowery. He was 6ft 1in, says Tilley, and well-fleshed. But it was his personality that was colossal: “I think there was so much going on inside him that it made him bigger than he was. There was just so much for him to say and think about. He’d always been interested in learning things since he was very young – and getting his ideas out there.”Bowery began to develop his singular style, making himself into a comical giant or giantess. He wore very high heels and padded skirts that gave him an enormous rear, sewing or painting patterns of dots or tiger stripes not just on his dresses or body stockings but all over his face, initially as makeup, then on head-enfolding masks he called “fabric faces”.By the late 1980s, he was a cult figure on the London fashion scene, making a surprisingly nervous 1988 appearance on the BBC’s The Clothes Show. But there was a problem with making it as a designer: “He didn’t like making clothes for other people, really.” He claimed to be horrified by the idea of walking into Sainsbury’s and seeing other shoppers dressed like him. One exception was Tilley: he always made her dresses. “You couldn’t buy large clothes back then so he used to make them for me. They all had names. ‘What have you got for me today?’ ‘Oh, it’s Clementine,’ he’d say or, ‘This one’s Princess Margaret.’”View image in fullscreenSingular style … Bowery and Tilley before a party in 1993.Photograph: Courtesy Sue TilleyA fashion career wasn’t for him. Instead, Bowery started getting recognition in what was then a tinier London subculture: the art world. Bowery became a performance artist, appearing in the window of the Anthony d’Offay Gallery for a week, contemplating his own image in a mirror, running through a series of costumes. Tilley is still awed by the memory of his most infamous performance, which involved a much slighter performer called Nicola Bateman.“He came onstage looking enormous,” she says. “He had this big sort of velvety dress on, trying to be a bit like Divine, shoes not that high-heeled. He’s singing and dancing, then he suddenly lies back on the floor, opens his legs, and there’s a gusset with Velcro and it opens – and Nicola comes out like he was giving birth to her. This whole time he’s been holding her strapped to his body and she was all covered in blood and greasepaint and muck. He’s got vegetable soup in his mouth, so when she comes out – you know how a mother bird feeds her baby out of her mouth? He fed her like that. How he could have done it is beyond my comprehension.”You can see this for yourself ina YouTube clip of Bowery at Wigstock, the New York drag festival, belting out a toneless version of All You Need Is Love before falling to the stage to “give birth” to Bateman who then sits there motionless, naked, covered in blood, as he cavorts. If only more performance art was as funny and shocking as this.Accounts differ about which performance was witnessed by Freud, who was also represented by the D’Offay Gallery. Whichever it was, he was fascinated and wanted to paint Bowery. It was a departure for an artist whose previous subjects included wealthy art patrons and his own family. It instantly became something more than a portrait sitting. “Lucian thought Leigh would want to be painted with one of his outfits on,” says Tilley. “So I think he was thrilled when Leigh turned up and just stripped naked.”View image in fullscreenInfamous … Bowery and Nicola during a performance in 1994.Photograph: Glyn Howells/Getty ImagesI remember seeing Freud’s first paintings of Bowery at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1993. One was dominated by a rippling, tumultuous fleshy back, soft, saggy yet strong, as Bowery sits on a low velvety stool with his huge shaved head turned away. In another canvas, his keen eyes catch yours in a raw, provocative stare as he lies with one leg up displaying his penis.They worshipped each other. Leigh loved Lucian’s intelligence, and Lucian loved Leigh’s braveryA few months later, I saw Bowery perform with Minty at a club called Fantasy Ashtray. There wasn’t even a stage and they were barely a band: just a thrashing amplified chaos over which he screamed. Now that he’s being officially recognised as a legend, I suppose this is like having seen the Sex Pistols at the 100 Club. But to be honest, I was more awed by the painting of him naked and actually found it hard to reconcile the two. Who was the real Bowery: fabric-faced icon or vulnerable nude? “Of everything,” says Tilley, “he preferred being naked. He was very happy to show off his body.”It’s not hard to see the irony: a performer known for his wild all-covering costumes gave Freud his naked truth. Maybe it was about self-acceptance. “He was constantly thinking he was fat,” says Tilley. “He liked food too much, a bit like me.” But there was another reason to get himself on canvas for the ages. Bowery had been HIV positive since the late 1980s and these were to be the closing years of his life.“You know the painting where he’s standing on that box?” says Tilley. “He was incredibly ill at the time. The meningitis was kicking in. I’m so lazy I had to lie down in all my pictures. Not for anyone wouldIbe forcing myself to stand up and be uncomfortable.”The painting is Leigh Under the Skylight, the most heroically posed of all Freud’s Bowery paintings. Seen from below, he appears colossal, posing on top of a box so his head is just under the dirty grey studio skylight. It courts comparison with Michelangelo’s David and, given Bowery’s horizontal as well as vertical mass, the ancient Roman statue called the Farnese Hercules. But even as his shoulders are lit by the skylight, Bowery’s face is shadowed, broken up. You can’t help wondering: is he in great pain holding this pose, as Tilley suggests, or angry at his illness?View image in fullscreenFreud’s Under the Skylight portrait of Bowery being installed at the Fine Art Society.Photograph: Courtesy Sue TilleyThere is one thing we can be sure of: this endurance test is not being coldly forced on him by Freud,who died in 2011 aged 88. It comes out of a friendly, even loving collaboration. “They worshipped each other and they both helped each other in so many ways,” says Tilley. “Leigh loved his intelligence and Lucian loved Leigh’s bravery. And because Leigh was so big, he had to go big in his paintings, change his brushstrokes, everything. They got on like a house on fire. They loved each other.”Bowery even told Tilley there was physical intimacy. “He used to say, ‘I gave Lucian a blowjob last night.’ I’d say, ‘Oh did you?’ It was just lies, lies he used to tell.”As the critic Kenneth Clark once observed, all great nudes have an erotic charge. Freud’s certainly pass that test – yet they also have a warmth and enthusiasm, an amazed relish that’s fiercely loving.View image in fullscreenThe cheek of it: Leigh, Angus Cook and Cerith Wyn Evans at Barbara Hepworth’s Sculpture Garden, Cornwall, 1990.Photograph: Courtesy Sue TilleyBowery seems to have played up to the traditional role of the model as street rogue. “Freud did pay us something,” says Tilley. “But Leigh got ‘paid’ more because he used to steal it. Lucian had pound coins all over the shop and he’d go to the bank and take out £500 in £50 notes or something. They were just in a drawer and Leigh knew where they were. He would just help himself. I’d go, ‘You shouldn’t do that.’ And he’d say, ‘Oh no, he wants me to have it. He’s too embarrassed to give it, so he lets me know where it is. He knows I’ll take it.’”Out of this relationship, something larger began to take shape: a group of paintings that tell the story of a particular little creative world, as Bowery introduced Freud to his friends and they became fixtures of his studio. “So between the paintings,” says Tilley, “there are interwoven stories. The ones of Nicola, Leigh and me. Then there are other friends that have sat for him. Everyone in these pictures knows each other in some bizarre way. He even painted my brother’s girlfriend.”View image in fullscreenSue Tilley today.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianAt the centre of the stories towered Bowery, at once cajoling and manipulating Freud, letting that painter’s eye for truth depict the tragedy of his worsening illness, even when Freud wasn’t told everything. Tilley cites the painting Girl Sitting in Attic Doorway, which portrays Nicola perched naked in an alcove high on a studio wall, her face full of sorrow. Even though Bowery was “gay and that was that”, he surprised everyone, including Tilley, by marrying Bateman in 1994. Friends were given different reasons: that it was art, or even a tax dodge. But Bowery told Tilley when he was in hospital that he was scared Bateman would leave him for another man.There was no need to worry: “She loved him. She’d do anything for him. When Girl Sitting in Attic Doorway was painted, she knew Leigh was ill in the hospital and she was crying. Lucian didn’t know Leigh was that ill at the time, because we had to lie to him. The lies and the hoo-hah that went on! I love that picture.” I do too. Although Bowery had ensured Freud only partly knew about his life, you can’t miss the grief it contains.‘A living, breathing work of art’: Leigh Bowery by those who knew him bestRead moreFreud seemed almost to intuit their marriage, given one work in which he painted them lying side by side, her pale, small body dwarfed by his brownish bulk. Freud called it And the Bridegroom. “Leigh’s thumb is pressing his thigh and you can see the little dimple. It’s so lovely. Freud didn’t know they were married when he called it that.”It was a pose and a performance given in the face of death. Increasingly ill as he sat for Freud, Bowery died on 31 December 1994. Bowery wanted Freud to immortalise him in paint – but now, ironically, it’s his fashion looks and performances, seemingly so ephemeral at the time, that are the stuff of legend. Maybe Freud needs Bowery for immortality rather than the other way round. Perhaps they need each other.Tilley returns to the question of who the real Bowery was, the nude or the flamboyantly disguised performer. “Both,” she says at length, “because you can be more than one person.”Leigh Boweryby Sue Tilley (Thames & Hudson Ltd, £12.99).

Publisher Penguin Classics said that the book is the first of their hardback nonfiction classics to appear on the list.The book is a collection of 12 biographies covering the rule ofJulius Caesarand the first 11 Roman emperors. On hearing that it was in the charts, Holland was “delighted for Suetonius, to see the lad is capable of getting on the bestseller list after two millennia”.The book, published on 13 February, comes 18 months after ancient Rome became the centre of amajor internet pop culture moment, when women began asking men how often they think about the Roman empire, and posting their responses online.Holland cites several reasons for the continued fascination. Rome has “always” been the ancient civilisation that people in Britain and the west have been most interested in, partly because Britain was part of the Roman empire, and the English alphabet is Latin. “We feel closer to the Romans, perhaps, than we do to the Egyptians or the Assyrians.”However, “it’s also partly because our understanding of power derives from Rome more than anywhere else”. The US “Republican system was modelled on that of ancient Rome, but the [Roman] Republic ended up becoming an autocracy, and so in America, there’s always been this anxiety that a Republican system of government may end up an autocracy, and I guess that at the moment, that anxiety has a particular salience.”Suetonius wrote The Lives of the Caesars, commonly known as The Twelve Caesars, in the early second century AD during the reign of Hadrian. “I think the reason that it’s always been popular is the fact that it is full of the most sensational gossip. It is kind of ancient Rome’s Popbitch. It is full of scandal, and extraordinary detail, but it is also very psychologically astute,” says Holland. “It has the quality of a very highbrow gossip column.”“Had there been bestseller lists in second-century Rome, Suetonius’s Lives of the Caesars would undoubtedly have been on them,” said Stuart Proffitt, publishing director at Penguin Press.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

This year, the leading UK act was producer and singer Artemas, for I Like the Way You Kiss Me.British stars such as Charli xcx – arguably the most conversation-dominating UK act of 2024, with her album Brat – Dua Lipa and Coldplay did not feature. It is the first time since 2003 that a UK act hasn’t featured in either the singles or albums list.The No 1 song globally was Beautiful Things by Benson Boone, and the No 1 album globally was The Tortured Poets Department byTaylor Swift.K-pop boybands dominated the albums list, with two entries from Seventeen (Spill the Feels at No 6 and 17 Is Right Here at No 8), along with Enhypen (Romance: Untold at No 4) and Stray Kids (ATE at No 10). The remainder of the list came from US superstars: Hit Me Hard and Soft byBillie Eilish(No 2), Short n’ Sweet by Sabrina Carpenter (No 3), SOS by SZA (No 5), One Thing at a Time by Morgan Wallen (No 7) and Stick Season by Noah Kahan (No 9).In the singles chart, only Irish songwriter Hozier, with Too Sweet at No 6, deviated from the otherwise total US dominance of the list, which spanned pop (Carpenter’s Espresso at No 2) to rap-country (Post Malone and Wallen’s I Had Some Help at No 7) and a five-year-old song by Swift, Cruel Summer, at No 9. The insistence of Kendrick Lamar’s blockbuster Drake diss track, Not Like Us, was confirmed as it appeared at No 8.Jo Twist, chief executive of British record industry body the BPI, told the BBC: “British artists may have enjoyed stronger years on the international stage, which perhaps isn’t surprising given some of our biggest names were not in cycle in 2024.“There was still plenty to be excited about, as a new generation announced itself – not least Charli xcx, who enjoyed a breakthrough year globally, alongside international chart success for emerging artists such as Jordan Adetunji, Artemas and Good Neighbours, while the likes of Lola Young and Myles Smith are now rapidly building an international following.”Twist said that it is “undoubtedly becoming much harder to break talent in a hyper-competitive global music economy”.The news comes ahead ofthe Brit awards this weekend, led by xcx with five nominations for Brat, followed by Lipa, the Last Dinner Party, Ezra Collective and Myles Smith with four.Global bestselling albums of 2024Taylor Swift – The Tortured Poets DepartmentBillie Eilish – Hit Me Hard and SoftSabrina Carpenter – Short n’ SweetEnhypen – Romance: UntoldSZA – SOSSeventeen – Spill the FeelsMorgan Wallen – One Thing at a TimeSeventeen – 17 Is Right HereNoah Kahan – Stick SeasonStray Kids – ATEGlobal bestselling singles of 2024Benson Boone – Beautiful ThingsSabrina Carpenter – EspressoTeddy Swims – Lose ControlBillie Eilish – Birds of a FeatherShaboozey – A Bar Song (Tipsy)Hozier – Too SweetPost Malone – I Had Some Help ft Morgan WallenKendrick Lamar – Not Like UsTaylor Swift – Cruel SummerNoah Kahan – Stick SeasonExplore more on these topicsMusicMusic industryPop and rockTaylor SwiftKendrick LamarSZABillie EilishnewsShareReuse this content"

We went into the communities and spent a few days there and started chatting to people and collecting stories.”Some nuggets people told Harvey and his team find their way into the play, based on Morpurgo’s book The White Horse of Zennor and Other Stories, such as a woman who described an existential fear of the stark horizon after moving to north Cornwall from Manchester.“There are bits like that that are peppered all the way through the script,” Harvey said. Other stories do not directly appear but are there in the subtext. “Some are more overt and others subtle, more of a feeling, a theme that is woven in.”Morpurgo’s 1982 book features five stories centred on the village of Zennor, a place adored by artists, poets and mystics. “That was the first spot we visited,” said Harvey. “We did a story-gathering there. Invited people, laid on food, hired the village hall.” And the tales began to emerge.Realising there was a wealth of Cornish stories to tap into, the theatre and film company behind the play and project,o-region, applied for money fromthe UK Shared Prosperity Fund, a government programme that funds projects in places that can be hard to get to or are often bypassed – in this case, Bude on the north coast, the market town of Launceston, the Isles of Scilly,the Treneere estate in Penzance,one of the most deprived in England, and Redruth.View image in fullscreenThe play will be performed locally, in Redruth.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianThey found the hairdresser who gives all her clients the same “choppy cut” in Bude. The Scilly teacher said she took the snowball in a cool box to her pupils from the mainland because snowfall on the islands is so rare. A Treneere resident told them their cat went out mousing 9-5, so they named her Dolly Parton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the pit however, things are less assuredFlora WillsonMon 24 Feb 2025 09.27 ESTLast modified on Mon 24 Feb 2025 12.43 ESTShareAn attempt at brokering peace between warring factions is made in a tense call from a phonebox to a bar where men crowd around the beige receiver. The look: double-breasted suits and Brylcreem for one gang, brown leather and rollnecks for the other. Fedoras for all. As the curtain falls on act one, a man lights a Molotov cocktail and raises his arm to lob it into enemy property. Poison comes in mini liqueur bottles. The heroine has a serving hatch, not a balcony. Forget Verona.Even without directorial input, Bellini’s Romeo and Juliet opera has long been a red rag to purists, riffing as it does on Shakespeare’s play via multiple Italian sources. Produced in six weeks to plug a gap in the roster at Venice’s La Fenice after another composer failed to deliver, this opera-against-the-odds has never matched the popularity of Bellini’s La Sonnambula orNorma.Eloise Lally’s mid-century Little Italy update forEnglish Touring Operais energetic and stylish. Its small box set sees a bar interior – formica tables, sauce bottles, Venetian blinds – become a subtly lit ruin after the Molotov incident. Staging Romeo’s conference with the Capuleti (the production is sung in Italian) as a call via a gangster hotline is genuinely effective. So is the transformation of the Montecchi attack on the Capuleti into a slow-motion brawl in the latter’s dingy, linoleum-floored bar, even if Romeo’s attempt to crash Giulietta’s wedding in “disguise” – swapping slimline burgundy tailoring for an oversized pinstriped number – stretched the production’s internal rules about visual realism.View image in fullscreenStar-cross’d lovers … Samantha Price (Romeo) and Jessica Cale (Giulietta) in The Capulets and the Montagues.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIt was a shame the subtlety of the production wasn’t matched in the pit, where a heater nestled between musicians suggested that playing conditions weren’t ideal. Under conductorAlphonse Cemin, ETO’s pared-down orchestra sounded threadbare at times, the strings in act one far from the bel canto lushness demanded by the score. Elsewhere there were tuning problems. Crucially, despite a few carefully sculpted woodwind solos, more overall shape and direction was needed from the podium as well as more attention to balance.The singing was classier. The tiny male chorus did sterling work, while Timothy Nelson was a stentorian patriarch and Masimba Ushe a warm, sympathetic Lorenzo. Brenton Spiteri’s Tebaldo was endlessly ardent, though lacked the smooth line invited by Bellini’s famously long melodies. No such problem with Samantha Price or Jessica Cale as the star-cross’d lovers: the chemistry they alas lacked physically – why not do more with a trouser-role Romeo in 1950s NYC? – was sumptuously compensated in vocal terms. Price’s burnished mezzo worked wonders with Bellini’s lyricism, her coloratura finely delineated. Cale had the biggest voice of all, powerfully communicative but beautifully controlled in intimate moments. In a production that conjures perma-violence, Cale’s Giulietta is a force to be reckoned with.On touruntil 26 April.Explore more on these topicsEnglish Touring OperaOperaClassical musiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Northern Ballet’s new version for young audiences chucks out the gingerbread cottage and the witch who has unsavoury plans for the siblings. Rather than fearing the forest, the duo learn to love and respect green spaces in a breezy, 40-minute eco-fable with as little jeopardy as the company’s sugar-spun version ofLittle Red Riding Hooda few years ago. But this peril-free, meandering story is often witty in its compositions (by Colin Scott) and choreography (by Harris Beattie and George Liang), both with a helping of music-hall tomfoolery. The show also has an attractive, economical patchwork design by Ali Allen that matches the environmental message and creates a collage of town and countryside.This Hansel and Gretel live in an urban apartment with their father – there’s no stepmother in sight – and are glued to video games. Dad despairs of them so takes them for a walk in the woods: cue a relatable scene for parents in the audience as he bounds out into the fresh air, with the kids dragging their heels behind him. Andrew Tomlinson, dressed in a dandified business suit that matches the monochrome cityscape, stands with chest stretched and hands on hips like an adventurer surveying awe-inspiring terrain. Archie Sherman’s Hansel and Julie Nunès’s Gretel are a kerfuffle of huffs and shrugs, arms folded and lips pursed.Left alone, the duo encounter characters that shift their perspective. The first are a pair of birdwatchers – greeting them with great rippling hand shakes – whose beloved birds are represented by rod puppets and accompanied by fleet notes on flute (Sarah Bull) and clarinet (Joanna Rozario), from a quartet directed by pianist Ewan Gilford. The ensemble sits at the side of the stage so young audiences can enjoy the musicians’ characterful movements, too, and identify the sounds of each instrument.View image in fullscreenBruno Serraclara as the Rubbish Monster in Hansel and Gretel.Photograph: Emily NuttallAlexander Volpov’s cello is best at conveying the weary melancholy of a rubbish monster (Bruno Serraclara) who shuffles along with glowing eyes, weighed down by a coat of litter, looking as if a bottle bank’s innards have been spewed out. A pirouetting nature spirit (Mayuko Iwanaga) appears under Abbi Fearnley’s emerald lighting and, like a disappointed teacher, rebukes the siblings when they carelessly toss their sweet wrappers away. Instead of a witch, the children encounter the Lady of the Wood (Gemma Coutts) who shares the joy of gardening.The dancing can at times appear as didactic as the plot, with the siblings mimicking first the scampering, feet-flicking birdwatchers and finally their green-fingered host. There is an over-extended jig of a finale, and an overwhelming sense that the original story has got as lost as Hansel and Gretel themselves, but there are appealing performances and even the sorrowful rubbish monster is treated to a fairytale transformation.Touring until 7 JuneExplore more on these topicsDanceBalletNorthern BalletChildren's theatreFairytalesreviewsShareReuse this content"

One is conventionally hunky: muscular, naturally hirsute but neatly trimmed, with thick dark brows and the kind of lantern jaw that casting directors in the 1940s would have immediately drafted into a pirate adventure opposite Tyrone Power. The other is slender and feline with pink and blue hair, sharp, perceptive eyes, and the sort of eyebrows where it feels like one is permanently arched even when it isn’t.They are Demos and Nikitas, and we quickly learn that they are besties who frequent the various locales of Athens’ queer scene and had dreams at one point of being actors, and in Nikitas’ case, directing too. He asserts, with an equal mixture of admiration and jealousy, that Xavier Dolan acts in his own films and had already released four features by the time he was the same age as Nikitas.Luckily, there’s now some potential funding available for a film. But what kind of thing should they make? Write what you know, they figure. How about a spry, sexy metafiction set in and around Athens’ queer scene, starring a couple of familiar sounding BFFs, and telling the story of the summer when Demos briefly adopted a dog named Carmen?The reference point might be Dolan, but there’s at least as much Charlie Kaufman in here, if Kaufman also threw in acres of male flesh, a bit of cruising and plentiful explicit hookups, which is undoubtedly part of this film’s appeal. Shot and graded in a bright and sunny palette with plenty of scenes set beside crystal-clear blue waters, it’s easy on the eyes in more ways than one, and while there’s fun to be had with the meta conceit, it’s not a taxing intellectual exercise. Come for the acres of flesh, stay for the cute dog.The Summer With Carmen is in UK cinemas from 28 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDrama filmsGreeceComedyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It became a phenomenon inJapanin the 1960s, and intensified during the 1990s as the country struggled with a debt crisis. While some plot their departures on their own, others call on the services of “night movers”: companies that help people vanish without trace.Following the owner of one such business named Saita, Andreas Hartmann’s and Arata Mori’s poignant documentary surveys the circumstances that drive people to desperate measures. Unfolding like a suspense thriller, the opening sees a man hurriedly get inside Saita’s van, his voice trembling with fear. Unable to cope with a possessive partner, he finally manages to flee. Interviews with Saita’s other clients reveal that, besides financial catastrophes, domestic abuse is often a catalyst for escape. At the same time, the reasons for a disappearance are not always clear-cut, and the film not only lends an ear to the “evaporated” but is also sympathetic to the abandoned, who are left with gnawing questions and no answers.The juxtaposition of intimate interviews and static shots of nondescript Japanese towns adds another element of melancholy. These compositions show howjohatsuis not just an individual decision but a manifestation of larger societal issues.Interestingly, since the subjects only agree to participate on the condition that the film will never be screened in Japan, their new homes and identities are carefully obscured. But in an age when a film can travel far and wide virtually, it remains to be seen whether such measures are enough to protect their anonymity.Johatsu is at Bertha DocHouse, London, from 28 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsJapanAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

There follows a brief story of how the boy that he was pocketed an emerald ring owned by his grandmother and chucked it away in the nearby woods. The shame did not end there. A young Aboriginal maid was blamed for the theft, and he did not have the courage to step in to save her from dismissal.Just as you are losing yourself in this immersive little story, however, its author,Michelle de Kretser, steps in to inform you that “at this point, the novel I was writing stalled”. She goes on to explain how that writer’s block was a product of her difficulties with the “theory and practice” of her novel’s title: the gap between ideas about the novel – particularly those promoted by those French deconstructionists of the 1970s, and earlier by Virginia Woolf – and the impetus for storytelling.The Sri Lankan-born Australian author’s solution is to stop the first story and tell another, perhaps related one, about an anguished love triangle among friends at Melbourne University in 1986. The second story reads like a confessional; if it is not autobiographical, De Kretser wants it to seem so. “Instead of shapeliness and disguise, I wanted a [fictional] form that allowed for formlessness and mess,” she writes. “It occurred to me that one way to find that form might be to tell the truth.”De Kretser’s recent novels have often subverted themselves in these kinds of ways. Her last book,Scary Monsters, for which she won the 2023 Rathbones Folio fiction prize, had two different narratives running in parallel – one literally going from front to back in the printed book, the otherfrom back to front. One half told a realist story from 1980s France, the other was a dystopian vision of Australia’s near future. It was one of your challenges as reader to trace the connections between them; the reason they belonged together.She communes with a poster of Woolf on her bedroom wall, examining the cruelties of the long-dead author’s Edwardian racismSomething of the same thing is going on here, but, as with the last book, if the premise sounds tricksy, the writing – precise and involving, is anything but. The narrator ofTheory & Practiceis at work on a dissertation titled The Construction of Gender in the LateFictionof Virginia Woolf, and at the same time involved in an overwhelming affair with a fellow graduate student, Kit, who is engaged to their mutual friend Olivia. Their euphemism for their irresistible sex is “studying” – the excuse that Kit invariably offers to Olivia. The private joke is revealing. While Kit sits propped in the narrator’s bed reading, postcoitally, her copy of Roland Barthes’sA Lover’s Discourse, she struggles to define the semiotics of their relationship, and develops an irrational hatred for her rival, Olivia.Neither her own recently widowed Sri Lankan mother, nor her idealised “Woolfmother”, with a room of her own in the narrator’s imagination, offers much help in navigating this oldest of plotlines. There are digressions on how the sexual abuse she was subjected to by a piano teacher as a child bears relation to that endured by Woolf at the hands of her paedophile elder step-brother, George Duckworth. Life and art and academia seem to bleed into each other. The narrator imagines this book as one way of fulfilling Woolf’s prospectus for the last novel published in her lifetime,The Years, which would alternate between essays and fiction to create a “new form”. She communes with the enigmatic gaze of a poster of Woolf on the wall of her bedroom, while examining the cruelties of the long-dead author’s Edwardian racism: “[she] continued to avoid my eye, her creative-destructive energies fizzing, my boot-print half obscuring her face”.As the relationship with Kit unravels, so does the narrator’s grip on the truth of her emotions: “Everyone knows there are two types of mirrors,” she writes, “merciless and kind.” De Kretser charts a course between those reflections, however, alive throughout this ever-inventive novel to the urgent necessities of desire and their unforeseen consequences. Her ending returns you to her beginning, to the mythical-seeming story of the boy in the outback throwing all that glitters into oblivion; to the false start that leads to her latest quest for fictional truth. It is a measure of De Kretser’s beguiling talent as a novelist that she holds both these tales in balance without the whole ever threatening to fall apart.Theory & Practiceis published by Sort of Books (£12.99).

It feels like a European new wave picture by Antonioni or Resnais, but has something of the romantic travails of Franz Kafka, and even appears to anticipate the coming vogue for paranoia thrillers.Like Andrzej Wajda’sAshes and Diamondsfrom 1958, but weirder in tone, this is about a man who is part of the Polish anti-communist underground insurgency, who refuses to carry out an order to kill a communist. It was therefore a subject congenial in 1960 to Polish and Soviet authorities, but also a subject that speaks to a very complex part of the Polish mind. Refusing to kill a leftist is good … but wasn’t it the leftists, in the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, who invaded Poland in 1939 at the same time as Hitler and helped start the war in the first place?Bozek (played by Henryk Boukołowski) is a young man who just after the war comes to a small town in westernPoland, one of the territories recovered from the Germans, which needs workers to settle there. Like so many others, Bozek has no ID, no papers, but plenty of secrets (his being that the anti-communists are after him for his dereliction of murderous duty). In this rough part of Poland’s new wild west, maybe he can reinvent himself; in one startling shot, while Bozek is queueing at a government department to get official permissions, we can see through a window a fistfight in the street happening in eerie silence.Almost immediately, Bozek embarks on a chaotic series of gloomy romantic encounters: teacher trainee Lucyna (Zofia Marcinkowska) comes to see him at the flyblown cottage he has rented by the river, and even her kid sister Alicja (Laura Debicka) seems enamoured of him. These flirtations co-exist with flirtations with Olga (Halina Mikolajska), the manager of the winery where he works, and also her employee Niura (Barbara Krafftówna), a widow with a young son and elderly mother. Perhaps Bozek thinks that marrying any one of them and settling in this place will make him a non-moving target for his vengeful erstwhile comrades, one of whom does indeed show up. The dialogue is strange and stylised, like a spoken chamber opera.It can only be heading one way: for Bozek to escape again and head out as impulsively and anxiously as he arrived. He could be a metaphor for Poland’s own ambivalent attitude to its situation as a Soviet client-state – a wish to escape from history and from its own servitude. An eerie, opaque reverie.Nikt Nie Woła (Nobody’s Calling) is on Klassiki from 26 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRomance filmsPolandEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Indecent Proposal (1993)View image in fullscreenDemi Moore and Woody Harrelson in Indecent Proposal.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarWouldyoupimp out your beloved for $1m? This over-glossed kitsch-fest is like the board game Scruples in dumbed-down multiplex form, but don’t blame Moore. As the woman whose recession-hit husband (Woody Harrelson) consents to her night of paid passion with a plutocrat (Robert Redford), cinema’s supreme weeper gives it her moist-eyed all.19. About Last Night … (1986)A neutered adaptation of David Mamet’s prickly stage hit Sexual Perversity in Chicago. Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins generate comic sparks in the bickering supporting roles, while Moore and Rob Lowe keep it real centre-stage as romance blossoms and commitment issues rear their head.18. The Butcher’s Wife (1991)The role of a clairvoyant who falls for a butcher was developed for Meg Ryan. When she jumped ship, Moore took over; the result is intermittently charming despite tensions between her and the director Terry Hughes, who told the press she was hard to handle. “I was fighting to make the movie good, not crying for orange juice on set,” she protested.17. Wisdom (1986)Moore’s then-boyfriend Emilio Estevez wrote and directed this lovers-on-the-run crime caper. Terrence Malick is rumoured to have offered guidance to the 23-year-old first-time film-maker, so no wonder it all plays like a bantamweight version of that director’s Badlands, which made a star of Estevez’s father, Martin Sheen.16. GI Jane (1997)View image in fullscreenMoore in GI Jane.Photograph: Cinetext/Hollywood Pictu/Allstar“I’m expecting a certain amount of pain,” says Moore as Jordan O’Neill, who becomes the first woman permitted to try out for the Navy Seals. What she got instead for her gutsy performance was an abundance of ridicule, as well as a Razzie award for worst actress (her second, after winning in 1996 for The Juror and Striptease combined). Worth it, perhaps, for the scene in which she gets to scream: “Suck my dick!”15. The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022)Moore agreed to this brief yet knowing cameo on the condition that she could wear her own Fendi yellow jumpsuit. She plays Nicolas Cage’s wife in a film-within-the-film, a reference to the fact that both actors had duelling movies out in the early 1990s about men nearly losing their wives to millionaires in Las Vegas: Cage with Honeymoon in Vegas, Moore with Indecent Proposal.14. No Small Affair (1984)Jerry Schatzberg is rightly admired for the lacerating dramas Scarecrow and The Panic in Needle Park, both with Al Pacino, but he brings convincing warmth to this bubbly teen love story. Jon Cryer (later to be Duckie in Pretty in Pink) is a precocious 16-year-old photographer, Moore the aspiring rock star who is the object of his affections.13. Parasite (1982)No relation toBong Joon-ho’s Oscar-winner, this sharp-fanged 3D monster horror from exploitation king Charles Band gave Moore her first movie lead. She plays a lemon-grower who is plucky enough to give a plague of larva-like beasties what for. Cherie Currie, ex of the Runaways, turns blue from a bite to the leg.12. Ghost (1990)View image in fullscreenDemi Moore and Patrick Swayze in Ghost.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarAs a bogus medium, Whoopi Goldberg upstaged her earnest co-stars and won an Oscar to boot. If the rest of the movie has any weight, it is down toDemi Mooreas Molly, grieving her murdered boyfriend (Patrick Swayze). “Demi Moore exudes toughness,” said the film’s writer, Bruce Joel Rubin. “I knew I couldn’t have people walk out of the theatre at the end worried that Molly wasn’t going to be able to get through life.”11. One Crazy Summer (1986)Before John Cusack’s career shifted up several gears, he goofed around merrily in teen comedies like this and Better Off Dead … (both directed by Savage Steve Holland). He plays a cartoonist while Moore is delightful as a singer set to lose her home to a lobster restaurant magnate. She manages not to be upstaged by a rabid killer dolphin and a pair of cartoon bunnies modelled on film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.10. A Few Good Men (1992)View image in fullscreenDemi Moore with Tom Cruise and Kevin Pollak in A Few Good Men.Photograph: Columbia/AllstarThough both Moore and Tom Cruise were stars by the time they signed up for this film of Aaron Sorkin’s stage thriller, they feel like interns as the naval lawyers investigating the death of a marine. Jack Nicholson’s bellowing turn on the stand (“You can’t handle the truth!”) is rightly treasured, but there is sterling work too from Kevin Bacon and the late, glorious JT Walsh, one of US cinema’s finest specialists in the portraiture of moral corruption.9. Deconstructing Harry (1997)Above-average mid-period Woody Allen, inspired by Bergman’s Wild Strawberries. Allen is Harry Block, a novelist facing up to his flaws and his disgruntled friends and family, and encountering some of his own fictional creations. These include Moore, who turns up briefly as an amalgamation of Harry’s kvetching sister and his ex, alongside Billy Crystal as the devil (probably), and Robin Williams as a man perpetually out of focus.8. Striptease (1996)Male contemporaries with skyrocketing pay packets were applauded while Moore was slapped with the nickname “Gimme Moore” for demanding to be paid what she was worth. In the case of Striptease, that was $12.5m. This comedy would have benefited from the more knowing hand of a John Waters at the helm, but Moore has fun as the single mother (her daughter Rumer plays her on-screen sprog) disrobing to Annie Lennox at the Eager Beaver strip-club.7. Margin Call (2011)View image in fullscreenDemi Moore and Simon Baker in Margin Call.Photograph: Roadside Attractions/AllstarThesub-prime crisisplays out at a fictional investment bank modelled on Lehman Brothers. Jeremy Irons is a vampiric CEO who instructs his staff to flog everything short of the carpets, Kevin Spacey a corporate veteran nursing his dying dog. Moore, as the only prominent female figure in this macho landscape, is compellingly clenched once the blame starts to lead back to her door.6. Mortal Thoughts (1991)The script for this female-centred drama did the rounds for years, but Moore was instrumental in getting it off the ground. She clashed with the original director, Claude Kerven, who was duly fired. Robert Altman associate Alan Rudolph replaced him, and out of the wreckage emerged a surprisingly tough story of two friends (Moore and Glenne Headly) and the murder of an uncouth, violent man (Moore’s then-husband Bruce Willis).5. Please Baby Please (2022)A vision in leopard print, Moore gets one movie-stealing scene as Andrea Riseborough’s glamorous upstairs neighbour in this sub-Lynchian fable of simmering violence and sexuality. Languishing in a flat of zinging Yves Klein blue, she complains about her domestic surroundings (“I’m a wife but I’m no wifey”), fantasises about being choked (“Just a little, not too tight”) and is by turns taunting, cryptic, sensual and sinister. The hyper-stylised look and tone of the film foreshadow The Substance, as does one of Moore’s last lines: “Don’t you worry about me because I’m going to Europe.”4. Beavis and Butt-Head Do America (1997)There is a common misconception about Moore that she doesn’t do humour (unless you count the Austin Powers trilogy, which she co-produced). Naysayers must have overlooked her growling vocal turn as Dallas Grimes, whose husband Muddy (Willis) pays snickering cartoon sleaze-balls Beavis and Butt-Head $10,000 to “do” her, in a naughty nod to Indecent Proposal. Except that Muddy meanskill.3. Disclosure (1994)View image in fullscreenDemi Moore and Michael Douglas in Disclosure.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyOut of a dodgy Michael Crichton potboiler, the film-critic-turned-screenwriter Paul Attanasio (Quiz Show, Donnie Brasco) fashioned this crackling comic thriller about sexual harassment in the age of political correctness. Moore is Meredith Johnson, VP at a Seattle computer company, who preys on her emasculated colleague (Michael Douglas). The virtual reality sequence looked dodgy even at the time, but everything else still gleams with wit and naughtiness, not least Moore, who boasts: “I’m a sexually aggressive woman, and I like it.”2. Corporate Animals (2019)Stepping in at the 11th hour to replace Sharon Stone, Moore plays the CEO of an edible cutlery company, whose team-building spelunking exercise ends in gore, projectile vomiting, cannibalism, and a gaping leg wound that sings Britney Spears’s Toxic. Moore brings genuine relish to Sam (Peep Show) Bain’s script, whether asserting bogus Native American heritage (“I’ll be assuming the role of tribal elder for the duration of this trip”), gaslighting an abused male underling (“I never Weinstein’d you!”) or rationing the edible forks (“Take one prong each … and I’ll expect those handles back,” she hisses, sounding very Mark Corrigan). Her performance builds even more decisively on the wickedness of Disclosure and hints at where the third act of her career was heading.1. The Substance (2024)View image in fullscreenDemi Moore in The Substance.Photograph: APMoore’s performance in Coralie Fargeat’s body-horror phantasmagoria is a career-altering comeback on a par with Marlon Brando in The Godfather or John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, and so far ahead of everything else on this list that it deserves itsownRanked with 19 blank spaces separating it from its nearest rival. As the fading aerobics star Elisabeth Sparkle, who responds to being fired from her TV show by mainlining a black-market drug that spawns a younger alter-ego (Margaret Qualley), Moore draws on a whole career of being mocked, sidelined and underestimated. “Emotionally, [playing Elisabeth] wasn’t that big of a reach,” she said recently. “I really did understand her.” Even at her most monstrous, buried beneath layers of porridgy prosthetics that make Jeff Goldblum in The Fly look mildly carbuncular, she communicates depths of pathos, anguish and rage. Ironic that a film about the transience of youth and fame has guaranteed Moore’s own longevity.This article was first published on 10 November 2022 and updated on 24 February 2025 to include The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, Please Baby Please and The Substance.

Mustapha, my guide, has stepped aside to buy some sweet pastries from a stall. (“You’ve got to try thekaab elghazal, the ‘gazelle’s horns’. They’re really special.”) But there are someGnawamusicians, with long black tassels on their hats rotating in time to their drums, and then I cannot resist looking at large copper pots, and the handmade kettles that lead on to brass antiques. I turn. What’s up here? A doorway and the clacking of a hand loom.As-salamu alaykum! Maybe I should head back? A man with a laden donkey bellows, “Balak!” Gangway! I take another turn. Hang on, I don’t recognise any of this.At that moment, all the colours, tastes, sounds and sights are sprinkled with a magical leavening of adrenaline and the whole lot rises up like some delicious cake in the oven. I glance at the phone in my hand and make sure that location services have failed. It tells me nothing except that I am in Fez, a city of more than a million. The labyrinth has worked. I am lost.Kevin Rushby map of MoroccoMorocco has many such mazes. There are good ones in Rabat, El Jadida and Essaouira; Marrakech is known to many, and Tangier is wonderful, too. But I’m exploring the north-east of the country, starting with the largest and arguably the best: Fez, considered to be the spiritual and cultural capital.The labyrinth has obsessed humans for a very long time. King Minos of Crete supposedly incarcerated the minotaur inside the original labyrinth under his palace. As a symbol for life’s uncertain and indirect path, the labyrinth has appeared throughout the ages – check out the Mappa Mundi in Hereford Cathedral. But what, I wonder, as I head deeper into Fez, is it like to live inside a maze? What does that do to the brain? In a world of GPS and satellite-tracking, when every key and sock will soon be instantly located by embedded software, when digital dependency is total and mental-mapping consigned to history, will we dream of getting lost?Outside one small shop, I watch an old man carve combs from camel bones. There’s a slap on my back. “There you are!” says Mustapha, laughing as always. “We have a saying: those who can speak are never lost.”View image in fullscreenOued Laou market in Tétouan.Photograph: Juan Antonio Orihuela Sanchez/AlamyWe ask the comb-maker, Mohammad Shaïli, about life in the labyrinth. He is 95 years old and has been a resident all his life. “Why should I stop? I’m producing things, I’m no burden on anyone.”He went once to Marrakech, never any further. He has no boss and is surrounded by friends, family and neighbours. He picks up a small axe and begins expertly splitting tiny sticks of bone. “For putting on mascara.”How should one enjoy a long life? In the “blue zones”, the world’s reputed longevity hotspots, the keys are said to be diet and active participation in society. I want to know what Mohammad thinks. He grins. “The hand that gives is better than the one that asks.”The medina’s inhabitants shop daily for their food, a habit that forces constant interactionIs that a hint? Mustapha presses some money into the elderly man’s hand. “Thanks be to God,” he says happily, “I’ll have fava bean soup for lunch today!”I suppose we must add “staying alert to opportunities” to that blue zone wishlist.We head off to find some lunch ourselves. In the meat and fish market, there are no refrigerators. “So people know it is fresh.” The medina’s inhabitants shop daily for their food, a habit that forces constant interaction. Mustapha’s sister married into the Marrakech maze, living in an extended family of 30. She now swears she will never leave. “People feel as if they belong,” Mustapha points out, “and children love it.”View image in fullscreenSpanish architecture in Tétouan.Photograph: Ivan Vdovin/AlamyWe eatbissara, the Fez favourite winter warmer of fava bean soup, and then mint tea with wormwood leaves, and set off again, stopping at the bucket-maker’s. He has a warning, lest I get too enthusiastic about medina life. “People can be arrogant and there are outlaws.”I’ve seen a few of those, breezing through the alleyways with a sharp eye for a quick chance. The labyrinth demands concentration from everyone. “In the future,” adds the rather pessimistic craftsman, “the buckets will leak.”The next day we drive west to see a different kind of maze. The large village of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun is close to the big tourist attraction of Volubilis, a ruined Roman town, but it attracts only a fraction of those visitors to wander its quiet alleyways. “Each neighbourhood has five vital elements,” Mustapha says. “Mosque, hammam, water fountain, school …” The fifth is revealed by a hooded man walking past with a tray covered with a tea towel. He is taking his dough to the communal oven. We follow him and find Ali, firing up the capacious ancient brick oven with gnarly lengths of olive wood.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Outside the village, I meet 10-year-old Kemal and his friend on their donkeys. “I’d rather have a donkey than a car,” says the boy. “You can love a car, but it won’t love you back.”Their ambitions? “I want to be a policeman,” says Kemal.“Anything except a policeman,” says his friend.A hundred miles north is our next stop. Chefchaouen has become a tourist honeypot in recent years. Built on a Rif mountainside, this fantastic maze of stairs, alleys and archways was apparently designed by a medieval sorcerer with contributions from mind-bending artist Maurits Escher. Tourism took off when an enterprising hotelier hit on the idea of painting his establishment blue, and others followed suit. This labyrinth is most magical late at night when the visitors have gone to bed.View image in fullscreenChefchaouen is at its most magical at night.Photograph: Marko Rupena/Getty ImagesMy final goal, however, is down on the coast at Tétouan, a lovely medieval Arab medina surrounded by a Spanish-style city. Popular with Moroccan holidaymakers, it remains off the beaten track. The medina is a labyrinthine delight: shady white‑washed alleyways, green shutters, arches and tiled fountains that still run from the medieval aqueducts built by refugees in the 15th century.The market women wear traditional straw hats and sell only things that a local might need: funerary herbs, asparagus stalks and huge rounds of cork from the local forests, handy for plugging up stone jars filled with olives. One septuagenarian trader answers our questions about life in the labyrinth and longevity. “Just dip these dried figs in honey. That’s all you need.” He insists that we eat lots of them before admitting that he doesn’t actually live inside the maze.As we wander away, I’m wishing that Britain’s mazes were anywhere near as entertaining, and not mostly located in the perfume departments of airport duty-free sections. But Mustapha is chuckling. “That’s the secret,” he says. “Spend time in the labyrinth. Spend time outside. Eat figs. Be your own blue zone.”The trip was provided byIntrepid Travel, which offers various tours to Morocco.

The smoky notes of poached haddock and a creamy leek mash; soft buns stuffed with grilled squash and spiced-up creme fraiche, and a soupy dish of pearl barley and dried mushrooms are just three that spring to mind.A simple midweek roast has become something of a winter staple in this house. Not the full bells and whistles Sunday lunch but something I can do in less than an hour on a Wednesday evening. I pop a few chicken thighs in the oven, then make a side dish of bread sauce, seasoned with thyme leaves and the delicious crusty bits from the roasting tin. Cheap and quick, but it feels almost as special as the Sunday roast.Another regular visitor to my kitchen at this time of year is a straightforward pasta and greens recipe. I like to use one of the hollow pastas that hold olive oil and grated parmesan, and any greens that look particularly fresh and crisp. This is a great time for greens and I tend to go with whichever look best in the shop, cavolo nero and purple sprouting broccoli being two of my favourites. A simple dish, with barely a handful of ingredients, but one of which I never tire.The jars of dried ingredients in the cupboard have an important role to play right now. One recipe that I have repeated all winter has been a risotto-style dish of pearl barley and mushrooms. The grain is cooked separately, as it needs a rolling boil. It is at its best left until it is tender but still slightly chewy. I use several types of mushrooms, usually bought in mixed boxes, but there is no reason why you couldn’t make it with chestnut mushrooms alone. The dish, with its deep umami notes, is always a calming presence after a busy day.The kitchen takes on an especially nurturing role at this time of year. Our daily cooking becomes as much about keeping people warm as it does about having a good time around the table. Shopping expeditions may be less than exciting right now, even something of a challenge, but we can still come up with something good for everyone.Roast chicken with thyme and bread sauce (pictured above)Bread sauce polarises opinion, but it is one of my favourite accompaniments for a roast chicken or game bird. I make it in the roasting tin after the chicken has come out, stirring in the deliciousness left behind by the roasted bird, together with chopped thyme and a little butter. My feeling is that it should be served piping hot or not at all, like porridge. A good sourdough produces a thicker, more flavoursome sauce than a plain white loaf.Serves 2onion1, mediumolive oil2 tbspbutter50gthyme leaves2 tsp, choppedchicken thighs4For the saucemilk300mldouble cream100mlfresh white breadcrumbs150gthyme leaves2 tsp, choppedsage leaves2 tsp, choppedPreheat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 6. Peel the onion and cut in half, then cut each half into four segments. Put the olive oil and butter in a roasting tin and warm briefly on the hob till the butter has melted. Add the thyme leaves, some salt and black pepper and the chicken thighs, skin-side down. Turn them over in the thyme butter so they are nicely coated on both sides, then transfer to the oven and bake for about 35 minutes till golden.Warm the milk in a saucepan and set aside. When the chicken is ready, remove it and keep it warm, leaving the roasted onion in place. Put the tin over a moderate flame and pour in the milk, scraping at the bottom of the roasting tin to dissolve any sticky residue from the roasted chicken into the milk. Pour in the cream and stir in the breadcrumbs, the thyme and sage and bring to the boil, stirring all the time. Taste for seasoning then serve with the chicken.Butternut brioche bunsView image in fullscreenButternut brioche buns.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverButternut squash is the cut-and-come-again vegetable.

Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan, stir in the onions and leave them to cook over a moderate heat for about 15 minutes until soft and deep golden in colour. Set them aside.While the onions are cooking, peel and thinly slice a chunk of butternut into rounds about the thickness of a £2 coin. Place them in a single layer on a grill pan or baking sheet, brush on both sides with a little olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. Heat an overhead grill and cook the butternut slices for about 10 minutes till golden, then turn and cook the other side. Make sure they are soft and tender.Mix together the creme fraiche and mustard. Split the brioche buns in half and toast the cut surfaces until golden. Slice the tomato. Divide the onions between the buns, place slices of tomato and butternut on top of the onions followed by a spoonful of the mustard creme fraiche and a little of the Lao Gan Ma. Place the second piece of brioche on top.Orecchiette with purple sprouting broccoliView image in fullscreenOrecchiette with purple sprouting broccoli.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverThe deep hollows of the orecchiette hold tiny pools of olive oil, lemon zest and grated parmesan in this, the simplest of winter suppers. Purple sprouting is good here, but shredded cavolo nero, savoy cabbage or chopped broccoli are fine too. I often chop a couple of anchovy fillets – finely, almost to a paste – and stir them into the olive oil with the garlic.Serves 2purple sprouting broccoli250gorecchiette200ggarlic2 plump clovesolive oil2 tbsplemon1, finely zested and juicedBring a large pan of water to the boil and salt it generously. Trim the tough ends of the purple sprouting then cut into small pieces, each about 10-15g in weight. Have a bowl of iced water to hand.Put a deep pan of water on to boil and, when boiling, dunk the purple sprouting in. Leave for 2 minutes, then lift it out with a draining spoon and transfer to the iced water.When the water comes back to the boil, tip in the pasta and cook for about 9 minutes. Keep testing until it’s done to your liking. While it is cooking, peel the garlic, then crush to a paste with a good pinch of salt – I find a pestle and mortar easiest.In a wide saute or frying pan, warm the oil and garlic paste. You don’t want the garlic to colour, so stir as it warms. Roughly chop the cooked purple sprouting and add to the garlic.Drain the pasta and tip into the oil and sprouting, turning the ingredients over in the pan with a large spoon.Season the pasta with a little black pepper, then stir in the lemon zest and, if you wish, a little of the juice, then divide between two plates.Smoked haddock, leek mashView image in fullscreenSmoked haddock, leek mash.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverA perennial winter dinner in this house. I vary the mash, sometimes putting spring onions or parsley in, other times making it with waxy potatoes and olive oil for a silkier, sticky mash. A couple of spoonfuls of the smoke-scented milk in which you have poached the fish is quite pleasing trickled over the potatoes.Serves 2potatoes750g, largeleeks450gbutter75g, plus a little moresmokedhaddock450gmilk500mlbayleaves3peppercorns6chopped parsleyto finishPeel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces and boil them in deep, salted water till tender.While the potatoes are cooking, roughly chop and thoroughly wash the leeks. Warm the butter in a saucepan, add the leeks, then cover with a piece of baking parchment and a lid (this discourages browning). Let them cook, with the occasional stir, for about 15-20 minutes until soft.Drain the potatoes thoroughly then mash them with the softened leeks and keep warm.Place the haddock fillets in a shallow pan, cover with the milk and 100ml water and add the extra knob of butter. Add the bay leaves and peppercorns and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, cover with a lid and let the fish cook for about 12 minutes. Lift the fish out and drain briefly on kitchen paper.Place spoonfuls of mash on warm plates, then put a piece of fish on top and spoon over the buttery milk. Finish with the parsley.Pearl barley, mushrooms, thymeView image in fullscreenPearl barley, mushrooms, thyme.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverA dish of peace and calm. Just a hint of warmth from the dried chillies, deeply satisfying and made from mostly store-cupboard staples. I often use the cheaper broken dried mushrooms as an alternative to the more expensive dried porcini. That said, you only need 10g to impart a deep mushroom flavour to the stock. Pearl barley can take anything from 25-40 minutes to cook to tenderness. It is worth testing every few minutes, the ideal texture being both soft and satisfyingly chewy.Serves 4driedporcini10gpearlbarley250gonion1, mediumolive oil4 tbspgarlic2 clovesthyme leaves1 tspassorted fresh mushrooms250gtomato puree1 tbspplain flour1 tbspdried chilli flakes½ tspPut the kettle on. Tip the dried porcini into a heatproof bowl then, when the water is boiling, cover them with 500ml of boiled water and set aside.In a medium-sized saucepan, cover the pearl barley with twice its volume of water, lightly salt it, then bring to the boil. Lower the heat and let it cook for 30-35 minutes until it is tender and pleasingly chewy.Peel and roughly chop the onion. Warm the olive oil in a large pan, stir in the onion and let it cook over a moderate heat until pale gold in colour – a good 15-20 minutes. Peel and reduce the garlic to a paste, either by grating on a fine-toothed grater or mashing it with a pestle and mortar. Stir into the onion and continue cooking for a couple of minutes. Chop and add the thyme leaves.Finely slice any large mushrooms (king oyster, large flat or chestnut). Trim any smaller, fragile varieties (enoki, shimeji). Stir them into the onions and continue cooking for about 5 minutes until they start to colour. Stir in the tomato puree. Leave on the heat for 2-3 minutes, then introduce the flour. Add the dried mushrooms and their soaking water and bring to the boil.When the liquid boils, lower the heat, season with salt and pepper and stir in the chilli flakes. Simmer for 10 minutes then add the cooked pearl barley. Cook for a further 10-15 minutes, until the mushrooms are soft and silky and the sauce has thickened a little.Serve in shallow bowls.The Observer aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Broccoli and blue cheese are a classic combination, and with the crunch of hazelnuts and the creamy sauce, this feels like a special dinner, even though it takes just minutes to pull together. It serves two generously – we stretched it to three at lunchtime, so you may have enough for a lunchbox the next day.Orecchiette with purple sprouting broccoli, blue cheese and hazelnutsPrep10 minCook15 minServes2-350g blanched hazelnuts, toasted and roughly choppedSea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper200gorecchiette230g purple sprouting broccoli, roughly chopped75ml double cream100g stilton or your preferred blue cheese, crumbledJuice of ½ lemon½tsp chilli flakesIf the hazelnuts are not ready-toasted, pop them in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 10 minutes, then remove and cool before chopping.Bring a big pan of salted water to a boil, and cook the orecchiette for 10-12 minutes, or according to the packet instructions, adding the broccoli to the pot for the final two minutes of cooking.

It was a beautiful, lively occasion organised by Gillian’s family and friends, and held atRoom 71-73in north London, just a few streets from the house she and her partner, James, lived and worked in so prolifically for many years. There was food, of course, and much of it – a half-wheel of parmesan and fanned plates of prosciutto and salami – from the local delicatessen, to which Gillian was a devoted customer. Wine flowed, too, thanks toThe Little Wine Shop, also around the corner and another place to which Gillian and James were as devoted as the staff were to them: their last delivery arrived just a few weeks before Gillian died last year, aged 90.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Gillian’s sister, Joanna, spoke about their early life growing up in North Yorkshire and how Gillian was always a “greedy” girl. Gillian’s niece, Esther, remembered the colour, texture, tastes and possibilities that Aunty Gill brought into her life. Others then participated in a lively pass-the-mic: colleagues from the worlds of typography and publishing, some of whom had once been her students, as well as friends and collaborators from the worlds of translation, academia, art and food writing. The stories and memories were eclectic, but they all had one thing in common: the invitations to lunch and dinner. Everyone there, it seemed, had enjoyed (often countless times) Gillian’s hospitable good cooking: meals she would shop for locally or in Chinatown, prepare with precision and glee, and share, while also discussing the next meal.Another thing that came up again and again was the affection, from people in all her worlds, for Gillian’s masterly translation ofCastelvetro’s 17th-century treatiseon fruit and vegetables, which includes several pages on cabbage: savoy (both curly and not), green and white. I also have several emails in which Gillian and I discussed cabbage, and more specificallypes coj ocaponèt(stuffed cabbage) in Piedmont, which is traditionally filled with leftover roast meat, but is also a vehicle for whatever happens to be left over, which the other day was rice, vacuum-packed chestnuts and half a tub of ricotta.When serving in wide, shallow bowls, remember – and this is Gillian’s advice – to ladle a bit of the cooking liquid over the stuffed leaves. They don’t really need any accompaniment beyond some bread for mopping the juices and a salad of mixed leaves with lemon dressing, and maybe some grated parmesan. Enjoy, while also discussing the next meal.Cabbage stuffed with rice, chestnuts and cheeseServes41 large savoy cabbageSalt and black pepperOlive oil4 onions, peeled and finely diced50g diced bacon, or pancetta (optional)200g cooked rice100g cooked chestnuts,crumbled100g ricotta20g grated parmesan1 egg2 tsp freshly minced or dried herbs(I used a mix of oregano, sage and marjoram)1 glasswhite winePull 12 large leaves from the cabbage and set aside, then shred the rest of the head. Bring a pan of salted water to a boil and, working in batches, plunge the whole leaves in the water for a minute. Lift out, run under cold water, pat dry and lay flat on a tea towel (if any leaves have a particularly thick rib, pare away so the leaf sits flat).Try this recipe and many more of Rachel’s Roman adventures the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.In a frying pan, warm five tablespoons of olive oil and cook two-thirds of the onion and the bacon, if using, until soft. Add the shredded cabbage and cook, moving it around the pan, until the cabbage completely collapses. Working in a bowl, mix the rice, chestnuts, cheeses, egg, herbs and a few grinds of black pepper, then add the cooked, shredded cabbage and mix again.Spoon egg-sized amounts of the filling in the middle of each whole leaf. Bring up the bottom of each leaf to cover the filling, fold in the sides and roll forwards to form a neat enclosed bundle, securing each one with string or a toothpick.You want a heavy, low-sided pan that will hold the 12 rolls snugly in a single layer. Melt a generous knob of butter and a tablespoon of olive oil, then soften the remaining diced onion.Add the rolls, pour in the wine and a glass of hot water, then cover, reduce to a simmer and cook, with the lid slightly ajar, for 30-40 minutes, until the rolls are tender, and the juices thickened and slightly sticky. Ladle a bit of the cooking liquid over the stuffed leaves when serving.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodVegetablesMain courseWinter food and drinkCheeseLeftoversrecipesShareReuse this content"
