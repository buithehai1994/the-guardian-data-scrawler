What’s a bloke got to do to win the Nobel peace prize these days? I mean the much-coveted inaugural Fifa peace prize is all very well – The Donald is slated to win that one in perpetuity – but it’s the Scandi laureate that is the real deal. The one that people will remember. And what more could the US president have possibly done to secure the £1m prize last year than to end at least eight global conflicts. Including ones between countries that didn’t even know they were at war with one another. Still, the Albanians and the Azerbaijanis must be very relieved to have taken part in a war in which no shots were ever fired.But Donald Trump is nothing if not a trier. He wants that Nobel prize badly. So his new year resolution for 2026 has been to adopt the Donroe doctrine of selective regime change. Start a small war in order to prevent a much bigger one. A service to the rest of the world. I mean, no one much liked Nicolás Maduro – least of all most Venezuelans – so he won’t be much missed whenhe is kidnapped and thrown in a New York slammer.A few people might quibble that if the US was really cracking down on “narco-terrorism”, then The Donald might have goneafter the former Honduran president who had already been convicted in a US court.Though for some reason, Agent Orange chose to pardon him instead. Probably just an oversight. An easy mistake to make. After all only a diehard cynic would imagine the coup had anything to do with Venezuelan oil reserves. Keir Starmer will be kicking himself. All he had to do to keep his promise of reducing everyone’s energy bills by £300 was to invade Venezuela, remove Maduro and install a more amenable government.Fair to say that the US attack caught the entire world on the hop. And if it gave the Nobel committee plenty to think about ahead of this year’s deliberations, it also gave many global leaders a headache. Not least the UK prime minister. How to criticise the US without appearing to criticise the US? If the US can do this toVenezuela, what’s to stop The Donald from doing the same to us? In the new world order where American interests are all that matter, careless talk costs lives. The stars and stripes flies proudly over Downing Street.So for the past few days, Starmer has been on full sycophant alert. Refusing to say whether he thought the US had broken international law by its rapid-fire invasion and kidnap. Even though the UN charter is completely clear that international law has been broken, Keir’s mantra has been ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil’. He doesn’t know all the facts even though The Donald has been happy to share them with every visiting journalist. Trump has no qualms about what he has done. He’s thrilled to bits with himself.But Starmer has gone out of his way to be as uninformed as possible. Whenever any of his advisers try to get him up to speed, he interrupts and changes the subject. Basically none of this is any of our business, he says repeatedly. If the Americans want to invade Venezuela then it’s their shout. International law can be whatever The Donald wants it to be. And yes, it is completely different to Russia’s war with Ukraine and China’s claims on Taiwan. How so? Because it is. Stop asking difficult questions. International law varies depending on whether we like the country being invaded. What’s not to understand?Conveniently for Keir, the Tories also have taken to applying moral relativism to international law. The law can be whatever we need it to be at any given moment. All that matters is doing nothing that might upset the Americans. SoKemi Badenochhas also gone out of her way to take as little interest in the legal niceties. At times like these, a sensible politician learns to look the other way. And as Kemi herself has admitted, she hadn’t been entirely sure where Venezuela was on the map – somewhere in Africa maybe? – and she wasn’t in any hurry to find out. These things would work themselves out somehow. Far be it from her to cast judgment.Other politicians were a little clearer-eyed. Labour’s Emily Thornberry – along with the Lib Dems and other Labour MPs from the left of the party – were adamant that two separate things could both be true. You could dislike Maduro and be pleased to see the back of him and be concerned that his removal had broken international law. If the law doesn’t matter then it’s a free-for-all race to the bottom which will be won by the US, Russia and China. Weirdly,Nigel Faragewas also clear that international law had been broken. Though he seemed to think this was a good thing. A Brexit bonus was the destruction of a safe world order.Monday was also time to spare a thought for the hapless Mike Tapp. The junior Home Office minister who is the Alan B’Stard of the 2024 intake. A man who is quite happy to say and do anything he is told by Downing Street. Even if it makes him sound like a complete halfwit. At best. On Monday, he ventured into quarter-wit territory in an interview with Sophy Ridge on Sky News as part of the morning media round.What aboutGreenland? Ridge asked. What about it? Said Tapp. Ridge tried to talk him through it. After the success of the Venezuelan operation, Trump and his team were openly considering coups in Greenland, Cuba and a host of other countries. And Greenland was currently under the jurisdiction of the Danes. You could see the panic in Mike’s eyes. No one had given him a steer on Greenland and he wasn’t sure what to say. So he defaulted to his original brief not to say anything that might upset the Americans.‘Er,’ he said. It was like this. It wasn’t for the UK to do anything about Greenland. Greenland could look after itself. And if the Americans did invade the country it wouldn’t be so bad. I mean, what had the Danes ever done for Greenland? The country couldn’t get by on bacon and Lurpak indefinitely. A few more KFC franchises and a Walmart would cheer the country up. So bring it on. You could see the light dying in Mike’s eyes as he said this. It will be a while before he recovers.Sensing that throwing Greenland under a bus wasn’t quite such a good idea as first thought,Starmer rowed back a little in a later TV interview.He did have a line after all. And Greenland was it. But Venezuela was still America’s to do with as Trump chose. What a time to be alive. Happy new year everyone.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerKemi BadenochNigel FarageNicolás MaduroDonald TrumpGreenlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The march of technology, the rise of hybrid and remote working, and an increasing culture of presenteeism (working longer than contractually required, or when sick) have blurred the boundaries between work and leisure.Research byBusiness in the Community(BITC), a UK-based responsible business network, shows that 55% of employees feel pressed to respond to calls or check emails outside work, while high workloads drive two in five to work overtime. Yet switching off from work when you aren’t working (psychological detachment, to give it its scientific name) is vital not just for your health, but for productivity.“Empiricalstudieshave identified a positive relationship between psychological detachment – which includes refraining from job-related tasks as well as mentally disconnecting during nonwork time – and job performance,” says Sabine Sonnentag, a professor of work and organisational psychology at the University of Mannheim, Germany. “Conversely, a lack of psychological detachment is associated with negative mood and impaired wellbeing.”The irony is that the greater the level of work stressors – including an excessive workload, time pressures or conflict with colleagues – the harder it is to achieve psychological detachment, which increases the likelihood of an evening of rumination, or even sneaking off to open your laptop. Sonnentag calls this therecovery paradox: “Greater exposure to job stressors simultaneously calls for but prevents recovery,” she explains.View image in fullscreenEnd your working from home day with a cue to deactivate the stress reponse system – such as jumping around to loud music. Posed by model.Photograph: Getty Images/iStockphotoClaire Ashley, former GP and author ofThe Burnout Doctor, recommends ending each working day with the same specific act or routine. “Practising a daily ritual serves as a cue to deactivate the stress-response system,” she says. “I like to do some movement, other people might want to put on loud music and jump around, or do Wordle. Over time, it becomes like a Pavlovian response, signalling to your body that the work day is done.”People working remotely often put in longer hours compared with office-based workersCreating a clear division between work and leisure is especially important if, like40%of Britons, you now work either fully or partly from home. While hybrid or home working has advantages – avoiding the time, expense and stress of a commute, making your own lunch, greater flexibility around working hours – people working remotely often put inlonger hourscompared with office-based workers (though the researchers in this US study note that this could be due to more breaks and interruptions). In asurveyof more than 8,000 people who had shifted to remote working as a result of the pandemic, 52% said they regularly worked longer hours than before.“It can be really challenging when your home doubles as your workplace,” says Ashley. “You need physical, as well as mental, separation. Without a designated workspace on which you can close the door, it’s even more important to ‘clear your desk’ and put work things out of sight.”Before you do, however, it could be worth tying up loose ends. Astudyfrom Ball State University, Indiana, found that leaving work tasks unfinished, especially important ones, is associated with poor psychological detachment in the evening. This isn’t about pulling an all-nighter: “Taking a few minutes before you leave to note down some thoughts about how you will address the unfinished task the next day helps enable you to switch off,” says Sonnentag.Scheduling after-work activities is a good ploy for those who find it difficult to draw the working day to a closeScheduling after-work activities is a good ploy for those who find it difficult to draw the working day to a close. Arrangements that involve a commitment, financial or social – such as booking a fitness class, time in a pottery studio, or meeting up with friends – are particularly helpful. But don’t disrupt your downtime by checking in with work, warns Ashley. If muting notifications isn’t sufficient, take the relevant apps off your phone when you aren’t at work. Better still, have a separate work phone – with a voicemail greeting saying what your work hours are, or when you’ll be next checking it.View image in fullscreenEngaging in a hobby such as gardening or spending time with friends will help you to recover from work. Posed by models.Photograph: Getty ImagesGetting active is a good way to switch off after work. It was one of three successful strategies identified in a 2023studyon post-work recovery conducted at the Centre for Work, Organisation and Wellbeing at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. The other two were spending time with friends and family, and engaging in hobbies, such as sewing or gardening.Sonnentag, however, believes what we are thinking and feeling (the recovery experience) during any given activity, be it knitting, baking or meditating) is more important than the activity itself, when it comes to how effectively it helps us recover from work. “Ourresearchidentified four important recovery experiences for recuperation and unwinding,” she says. These are psychological detachment – as in forgetting about work (relaxation, mastery) and the successful completion of tasks or challenges that boost feelings of self-worth and autonomy, meaning a sense of control over how you spend your leisure time.Having options is particularly important if you’re trying to solve the recovery paradox, because “an activity that offers a recovery experience for one person may not be helpful to another”, Sonnentag says. The oft-suggested long, candlelit bath might be the last thing you need.Regardless of whether you work from home or not, the connectivity of the digital age ensures that work is never far from our fingertips, says Louise Cashman, a business psychologist and wellbeing manager at a large consultancy. “Constantly bombarded with notifications, there is a sense of an ever-increasing demand on our time and attention, a need to always be available.” This can take its toll. A recentstudyby the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University found that engaging with work email during leisure time was associated with poorer physical and psychological health.However, a compulsion to be on the end of the “electronic leash” when not at work isn’t a personal failing. It’s frequently driven by workplace culture. In the Manchester study, over a third of workers reported that their boss regularly emailed them outside normal working hours and a quarter said there was an expectation of responding to emails during leisure time.View image in fullscreenAlways being available to work doesn’t give you the rest you need and can lead to burnout. Posed by model.Photograph: Getty Images“We have a big problem with presenteeism in this country,” says Ashley. “It’s counterproductive. Being terminally ‘on’ prevents employees from getting the physical and mental rest they need and can trigger burnout.” While the prevalence of burnout in the UK peaked during and immediately after the pandemic, she says, “data shows thatone in five remain at high risk”.Cashman suffered burnout in her previous job as a GP. It was what led her to move into a career focusing on workplace wellbeing (a role, she says, that barely existed prepandemic). She is an advocate of theDramma modelfor workplace wellbeing – an acronym that stands for detachment, relaxation, autonomy, mastery, meaning and affiliation (neatly mirroring Sonnentag’s findings on recovery experiences).I couldn’t help noticing, while writing this piece, that Sonnentag and I were communicating out of hours. When I point this out, she says “working at the weekendper seisn’t necessarily a problem, it’s about defining the boundaries that work for you.”Cashman agrees. “With tech and workplace culture blurring the boundaries between work and nonwork time, we are tasked with creating our own. This may be putting an out of office reply on outside working hours. I even put one on if I’m having a particularly busy day or week – it helps take the pressure off and manages others’ expectations.”Communicating your boundaries clearly makes not just your life but others’ lives easier“Boundaries shouldn’t be perceived as shirking or making life difficult for others,” says Ashley. “In fact, communicating your boundaries clearly makes not just your life but others’ lives easier, as they know what they can expect of you.”Once you’ve established your work-related boundaries, you must stand by them. “It can be challenging,” says Ashley, “especially if you are a people pleaser – but it gets easier over time.”It’s tempting to frame work as an energy-sapping stress – something we do because we have to. But this disregards the fact that many people love their work. In a 2023 Randstad workmonitorreport, surveying more than 35,000 people in 15 countries, 48% of people said they would “quit their job if it was preventing them enjoying their life”, implying that the demands of the 21st-century workplace aren’t necessarily viewed negatively.If you live and breathe your job, is there any real need to enforce a boundary between work and play? Ashley believes there is. “Most cases of burnout begin with people loving their jobs,” she says. “Everyone needs downtime.”Sonnentag’sresearchshows that when we reflect positively about work during the evening – our role in general, or specific achievements or successes – it improves “affective wellbeing” (mood and positive thoughts); a benefit that is carried forward to the next working day.“However, even positive thoughts about one’s work can be exhausting in the end,” she says.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHow to have a better dayHealth & wellbeingMental healthWork & careersMeditationMindfulnessHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Where the Upside Down is concerned, it’s never overStuart HeritageMon 5 Jan 2026 07.38 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 07.56 ESTShareWe’ve all had a few days to sit with theStranger Thingsfinale now, and reaction has been mixed. For every hardcore fan who found themselves in floods of tears by the end, there was a disgruntled TikToker aggressively listing all the plot holes the episode left unfilled in its race to the finish line. In other words, how you felt about Stranger Things as a whole probably determined how you felt about the way it ended.Which, despite any qualms you may have about the finale – and we’ll get to those soon – seems like the best way anyone could possibly wrap up a series. There was no tonal pivot; no bleak, Dinosaurs-style parable; no “it was all a dream” St Elsewhere-style cop-out; no Blake’s 7-style final bloodbath. Stranger Things died as it lived – full of spectacle and sentiment (and a chronically unwieldy mythology, and way too many characters).By achieving this, Stranger Things managed to bat it straight down the middle. Will this final episode become as beloved as Breaking Bad, or as widely discussed as The Sopranos? Almost certainly not. But at the same time, it avoided the pitfalls that drove Dexter and Game of Thrones into the dirt.View image in fullscreenShe finally got something to do! … Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers with Noah Schnapp as Will in Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixLooking back, it did a couple of things exceptionally well. The first was that it managed to pare back the ludicrous sprawl that upended the previous episodes, which spread a seemingly infinite number of characters across a seemingly infinite number of locations, dimensions and dreamscapes. It was so bloated that nobody could ever get anything done because they had to keep reminding each other where they were and why.This represented much cleaner storytelling. It was a bunch of characters versus a massive crab, and the crab lost. Everyone got a moment in the spotlight; especially Winona Ryder, who got to lop off Vecna’s head after spending half a decade getting paid to stand in the margins and look befuddled. The final battle looked amazing and felt suitably high-stakes. Fans who have spent the last decade watching as Stranger Things became riddled with bloat must have been thrilled.The second big plus was remembering that this was initially a show about children. The finale was peppered with flashbacks to the cast pre-puberty – a particularly canny move. Since Stranger Things debuted, we’ve all watched as the young actors have grown and grown, physically and in terms of notoriety. Seeing flashes of them small and innocent, unaware of the tsunami of global fame about to hit them, was unquestionably very touching. Plus the 18-month time jump at the end gave everyone the chance to play closer to their own age for once. You can only imagine the tears of relief Caleb McLaughlin must have shed knowing he wouldn’t have to wear that flat-top wig for a few scenes.View image in fullscreenUnquestionably touching … Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas, Natalia Dyer as Nancy, Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin, Joe Keery as Steve, Charlie Heaton as Jonathan, Finn Wolfhard as Mike, Noah Schnapp as Will, and Maya Hawke as Robin in Stranger Things.Photograph: Netflix © 2025Then again, what was my most memorable moment of the finale? Probably the moment I glanced at a clock and realised it still had still 30 minutes to go.At that point we were already deep into the denouement, with every single character being given their own elegiac sendoff. Steve became a teacher. Dustin got to be relatively obnoxious during his graduation. Erica honed her bomb-making skills. Joyce and Hopper got engaged. The army politely snuck off and never bothered anyone ever again. And Eleven either did or didn’t die, depending on your personal preference.On and on it went, the endings piling up on top of each other so extravagantly that the actual meat of the episode became a distant memory. It made the last Lord of the Rings film look like the model of restraint. There were so many endings to this episode, I briefly considered pitching a ranking of them, before I realised this would require me to watch them all again, and honestly, who has time?View image in fullscreenDid she really die? … Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven with David Harbour as Jim Hopper in Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixBut, as punishing as it was, for the diehards it felt earned. After all, this is who the finale was for: the millions who took this weird little jumble of 1980s references, initially designed as a one-season wonder, and grew it into such a monster that new episodes literally broke Netflix.So, did Stranger Things stick the landing? Well, no, because in the big scheme of things this doesn’t count as a landing at all. We’re in 2026 now, and the biggest crime an entertainment corporation can commit is letting an established IP die. The Duffers have confirmed they are already working on one Stranger Things spin-off and, if that’s too far away, an animated series (Stranger Things: Tales from ’85) will be out this year. Put simply, abandon the concept of Stranger Things ending. While there’s still money to be wrung from it, that won’t be allowed to happen.Explore more on these topicsStranger ThingsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It followsEmpire’s Crossroads: A History of the Caribbean from Columbus to the Present Day, from 2014, andEl Norte: The Epic and Forgotten Story of Hispanic North America, published five years later. The subtitle to the new book indicates its roots in the first two:The 400-Year Fight to End Slavery in the Americas.“I was led by both my own curiosity and also a frustration,” Gibson said, of how she came to retell that four-century fight over 500 absorbing pages.“So much that is known about the rise of slavery, the system of slavery, and the end of slavery, tends to be in the English-speaking world. So the English-speaking historiography looks at the US, it looks at Jamaica, but there’s this whole other story.The books to look out for in 2026Read more“I’ve spent a lot of time in Cuba, so I write about the Spanish-speaking world and the Spanish empire, and then there’s slavery in Brazil, which is a whole other thing. And when you’re in the scholarship, it’s linguistically divided. I wanted to bring it all together. I wanted to see what it looked like.”Gibson is herself well-traveled: from the American south, she moved to London, wrote and edited forthe Guardian, then went to Cambridge for a PhD centered on the Haitian revolution of the late 18th century, an epochal event in the fight for freedom. Now based in South Korea, she refuses to stick to well-trodden paths.“There’s been a big historical turn,” Gibson said. “In the last 20 or 30 years there’s become a lot more interest in the movement by enslaved people to get their own freedom, versus white abolitionism, which for a long time, certainly in Britain, received a lot of attention.”The Great Resistance recounts such attempts for freedom. Most involve desperate violence. The book begins in nightmare.View image in fullscreenA beach at Long Haul Bay, Nevis Island, St Kitts.Photograph: Michael Runkel/Robert Harding/Getty Images“The road to freedom is lined with bodies,” Gibson writes. “Some lie in the darkest recesses of the sea, like the ‘hundred Men Slaves [who] jump’d over board’ from the Prince of Orange during a balmy evening in March 1737 … ‘resolv’d to die’,” at least 33 succeeding, “sunk directly down”.It happened in the Caribbean not far off Saint Kitts, then contested by Britain and France. The 360 enslaved people aboard, bound for Virginia, were from Bonny in what is now Nigeria.“It’s definitely a dark book,” Gibson said. “But I didn’t want to dwell too much on the violence inflicted on enslaved people, because I feel like there’s a lot of that in other books, and there’s also a critique about white voyeurism, of violence to Black bodies.“If you read books about plantation history, or the rise of slavery, it is a horrible, violent story. But so is the story of freedom. What I tried to do is focus on the actions and reactions of enslaved people trying to get to freedom. So jumping off a ship – that’s their choice. Or a conspiracy, a revolt that is violently suppressed, I show that within the context of what they’re trying to do, rather than the arbitrary and horrific violence meted out by the system.”Gibson considers the history of transatlantic slave trade but does not focus on it. She points out that her endnotes “can point people to more detailed books about the horror of the Middle Passage”, terrible voyages that took enslaved people from Africa. When the Prince of Orange plied the route, she notes, the ship’s captain did not record the names of those he transported or who jumped to their deaths.That “really stuck with” Gibson, because in “contemporary accounts of resistance they might name the ringleader or a few others, and then it’s just numbers: it’s just, ‘16 slaves hung’, often.“Sometimes they do put names so that they can compensate the enslavers, but I was always really struck because in academic practice now, there is a lot of discussion about archival silences. And I felt in this story the silences were really, really loud. Here are these people rebelling against the system and nobody knows their names. Nobody can be bothered to record their names. They don’t even know what their names are. They don’t even know what names they’ve been given.”Some namesareknown well.Nanny, the woman who led escaped enslaved people (“Maroons”) in Jamaica and forced a treaty with the British, in 1740.Denmark Vesey, who rebelled in South Carolina in 1822.Nat Turner, who fought back in Virginia in 1831. Black campaigners are present too: US giants such as Frederick Douglass, lesser-known names like Robert Wedderburn and Olaudah Equiano, campaigners in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries.Prominent figures outside the Anglosphere include Lourenço da Silva Mendonça, “a member of the royal family in Pungo-Andongo, a part of what was then the kingdom of Kongo”, who in the 1680s, under his European name, became “one of the earliest abolitionists from Africa”. Forced to Brazil, Mendonça returned to Europe to fight for freedom, ultimately making his case at the Vatican in Rome, “anticipat[ing] the contemporary struggle for human rights”.View image in fullscreenToussaint Louverture.Photograph: North Wind Picture Archives/AlamyAmong violent struggles, there is of course Haiti and its successful revolution against French rule, led byToussaint Louverture, a great figure of Black history. Born enslaved, as a free man Louverture “purchased at least one slave and, while leasing his son-in-law’s coffee plantation, oversaw 13 others”. As Gibson notes, the fight against slavery was never clean, “noble sentiments” often “giving way to economic realities”.Lesser-known cases include that of Mahommah Gardo Baquaqua, taken from modern-day Benin to Brazil in the 1840s, treated brutally, then taken to Rio and “almost bought by a ‘colored man’”. In a narrative of his life published in New York in 1854, after his escape, Baquaqua said he recounted that near-sale to “illustrate that slaveholding is generated in power, and anyone having the means of buying his fellow creature with the paltry dross, can become a slave owner, no matter his color, his creed or country.”Gibson found Baquaqua “in the course of researching this book. He’s not well known, like Frederick Douglass, like Nat Turner … We don’t have any records of his life. We don’t know what this guy was doing.” Like many of her subjects, he proved “very hard to track”.Well aware that readers “want simple narratives”, Gibson said the challenge of explaining horrendously complicated realities was something “really frustrating about being a historian right now. Publishing is grappling with nonfiction losing ground to ‘romantasy’ and escapism and stuff. If you want this book to be a really happy story, it isn’t. I didn’t even get into the afterlife of slavery. Just because the practice and the institution ends [with abolition in Brazil, in 1888] we’re living with the afterlives and that’s completely unresolved.”In the US, Gibson argues, one such lasting effect of slavery is found in societal violence.View image in fullscreenThe Great Resistance cover.Photograph: Atlantic Monthly Press“You needed a culture of violence to suppress slave revolts, to make people work, to stop runaways. I think there’s a legacy that has not been grappled with. Why do you think there are guns in America?Whodo you think they were used for? Initially, it wasn’t to kill bears out west. It was to suppress, it was to keep order in the east. First, it was to kill Native Americans, obviously. Then the need for guns to keep away the Brits [founding myth of US gun-rights lobby] was the least of the concerns.“One thing I learned in doing this book is thatthe Citadelin South Carolina [a leading military college] was the result of the fear around the Denmark Vesey revolt. There’s a statue to Denmark Vesey in this park in Charleston that is not very far from the Citadel. The founding of the Citadel was about, ‘Oh, we can never let this kind of conspiracy happen again.’”Another lasting factor in the history of slavery, in the Caribbean and South America in particular, is sugar: cultivated by Europeans using forced African and Indigenous labor every bit as brutally treated as were enslaved people in the cotton fields of the US south.To Gibson, sugar was “the cocaine of its day. No one needs sugar. Cotton, well, it’s a staple. You make clothes from it. But nobody needed sugar. Arguably, nobody really needed the main commodities of the Caribbean: sugar, coffee, chocolate, cacao, in some of the islands, and Mexico and South America, indigo. Indigo had industrial or dying uses, but if you look at the commodities, most are absolutely luxuries.“And this intersects with scholarship and increased awareness about commodities through history, and luxury goods, the rise of the consumer society. Sugar’s just poisonous, really, and we’re all addicted to it, and the world is getting obese because of it, and that’s what I find so extraordinary: all these people suffered so much for something no one needed. To me, if there’s a starting point of the modern world, that’s it.”The Great Resistance isout now.To support the Guardian, order your copy of the UK edition atguardianbookshop.com.

Decorated hoods fit snugly over their heads, blocking their vision to keep them calm.In a small glass room marked Elite Falcons Hall, four young birds belonging to an undisclosed Emirati sheikh are displayed like expensive jewels. Entry to the room, with its polished glass, controlled lighting and plush seating, is restricted to authorised visitors only.These falcons are granted Emirati passports,jet around the worldand have entire hospitals that specialise in their healthcare. Some cost more than luxury cars – anAmerican falconat the exhibition will sell for AED 350,000 (£71,000). The most prestigious birds travel in Range Rovers and Bentleys fitted out with a perch between the front seats.View image in fullscreenFalcons on display in Abu Dhabi. The traditional hunting birds have become symbols of wealth and prestige in the UAE.Photograph: Courtesy of ARIJFor thousands of years, people have hunted using falcons over the vast Arabian desert. In the UAE, however, this Bedouin tradition has evolved into a spectacle of wealth and prestige to meet the tastes of the modern Gulf elite. As falconry has become a multimillion-dollar international industry that stretches around the world, an investigation by the Guardian and Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) shows that it is fed by a shadow industry of the smuggling and illegal capture of wild birds.Vanishing chicksFar from the hot plains and glass skyscrapers of Abu Dhabi, in rural counties across the UK conservationists and police are reporting a troubling pattern. Peregrine falcon chicks are vanishing from remote cliff ledges and treetop nests unreachable without specialist climbing gear. Later, some of these chicks are ending up in deserts in the Middle East, having been issued with fabricated documents, according to police witness statements from people who bought them thinking they were legitimate.Hundreds of birds go missing each yearKevin Kelly, National Wildlife Crime UnitThe cold climate of northern Europe is considered the ideal for creating tough, fast birds, and British-bred birds from established lines carry additional prestige. Legally only captive-bred peregrine falcons can be traded. Birds cannot be taken from the wild, as they are strictly protected under theWildlifeand Countryside Act.Exclusive data shared with the Guardian and ARIJ by Royal Society for the Protection ofBirds(RSPB) investigations shows that from 2014 to 2023 there were 126 reports of nests being raided, 21 of which have been confirmed using camera footage, DNA work or eyewitness accounts. All are believed to be linked to the peregrine falcon trade.“There are hundreds of birds going missing each year,” says Kevin Kelly, head of the National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU).Demand for wild birds appears to be coming from two directions, experts and police say. The first is direct from falconers in the Middle East who want wild birds for racing. The second is from some breeding facilities that need them as parents to feed a booming appetite for hybrid falcons and legally exportable, captive-bred birds.At the Abu Dhabi exhibition, traders will happily discuss their desire for wild-caught birds – although they are not formally advertised, as the practice is illegal.View image in fullscreenA female wild peregrine about to be released in Scotland. For falcon racing, Scottish wild birds are sought after for their superior strength and speed compared with captive bred racers.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian“British falconsare in very high demand in the UAE because of their record in winning races, their purity of bloodline and their speed,” says one employee of a high-profile Emirati falconry body. He says most Emirati falconers prefer wild-caught falcons since “farm-bred falcons might come from mixed bloodlines, while wild-caught birds are pure and perform better”. This preference for wild-caught British falcons was echoed by four other farm owners and sellers, as well as two falconers interviewed at the exhibition.The demand for British birds has driven soaring exports. Last year, 4,000 peregrine or peregrine hybrids were exported from the UK to the Middle East, and this year the number rose to 5,000, according to the police. In 2023 (the last year data is available), 88% of all peregrine falcons exported out of the UK were sent to the UAE, according to data extracted from theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) database. It is not known how many of those exported birds are wild caught, but police have identified at least some that are.Wild birds held captiveTo feed the booming export demand, there has also been a huge growth in UK breeders. There are now about 160 breeding facilities in the UK, up from about 27 in the 1980s, according to NWCU. All of the facilities have links to the Middle East (either owned by a resident from the region or selling directly to a buyer there).There are a number of wild birds within captive breeding centres up and down the countryPC Gavin RossThe most valuable falcon for export is the gyr peregrine – known for its speed and strength – which has a peregrine falcon as the mother and gyr falcon as the father. The female offspring are infertile, which is why there is high demand for female peregrine falcons in breeding facilities. In 2024, 1,200 peregrine falcons were registered in captive breeding facilities, up from 750 in 2000, freedom of information (FoI) data shows.DNA techniques – which rely on volunteers sending in hundreds of samples from wild birds – prove that some of these birds are wild caught. “The DNA work shows there are a number of wild birds within captive breeding centres up and down the country,” says PC Gavin Ross, who has led thecrackdown on falcon thieves.View image in fullscreenPeregrine falcons are bred at facilities across the UK, in part to meet demand for the birds in the UAE.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesPolice don’t have the capacity to inspect all of the country’s facilities, but say more than half of the facilities they do investigate arenon-compliant, with offences ranging from non-registration of birds and false declarations of parentage to selling birds that have been taken from the wild.There were 27 physical inspections of facilities breeding peregrine falcons in 2023 and 2024, according to FoI data – a significant increase from previous years. During those checks, 15 wild birds were discovered and confirmed using DNA testing.A ‘minor’ issueThese findings have been disputed by some experts in the industry, who argue that the trafficking is minor or nonexistent. “In reality, the level of illegal take described by the NWCU is a handful of birds per year,” says Dr Nick Fox, director of International Wildlife Consultants (UK) Ltd, who has supplied the royal families of UAE and Bahrain with falcons.View image in fullscreenThis year 5,000 falcons were exported from the UK to the Middle East, with the majority going to the UAE.Photograph: Courtesy of ARIJ“Breeding falcons in the UK has increased hugely over the past 25 years as expertise has developed,” says Fox, who has an OBE for falcon conservation. “Basically we have succeeded in killing the market for wild birds.”The suggestion that Emirati falconers are actively seeking wild-caught British birds is false, says Julian Mühle, CEO of the International Association for Falconry andConservationof Birds of Prey (IAF). “Comments gathered informally at an exhibition do not reflect the established preferences in the region,” he says.Mühle says the discovery of wild falcons in breeding facilities “should not be interpreted as evidence of widespread criminality”. Instances of chicks being taken from wild nests “while serious, are extremely rare and, crucially, not linked to the legitimate falconry community”.Khaled Bin Soufan, a prominent falcon trader in the UAE, says there is “zero” smuggling of wild birds from the UK: “It is not allowed.”The Abu Dhabi’s International Hunting and Equestrian Exhibition did not respond to a request for comment.Threatened by greedWild peregrine falcons spend their lives soaring above cliffs and cathedrals up and down the UK, slicing through the cool air at breakneck speed. A few will swap that for a life of flying over golden deserts and sprawling glass cities. Yet many kept in captivity rarely – if ever – fly, according to Ross. Some who spend their lives in breeding facilities are “treated like battery chickens”, he says, fed supplements to produce up to 14 eggs a season.‘It’s soul destroying to find nests have failed’: inside the battle against Scotland’s falcon thievesRead morePeregrine falcons were on the verge of extinction in the UK in the 1950s until thebanning of insecticide DDTand stronger legal protection. Their return has been a conservation success story, with1,750 breeding pairsin the wild. Now they are threatened by greed, says Ross. “If a blind eye was turned to [the illegal taking of birds], the peregrine would again be under threat of extinction.”View image in fullscreenThe return of peregrine falcons in Britain is a rare conservation success story but some experts say nest raiding has increased in recent years.Photograph: Steve Taylor ARPS/AlamyThe population is now classed as stable, but some areas are more targeted than others. “Locally we’re seeing a decline in peregrine falcons,” says George Smith, who monitors 60 nests over an area of south-east Scotland. “When they disappear, the food chain gets wrecked.”Smith has been monitoring the birds for nearly 40 years. This year he believes that four nests containing at least 10 chicks in his area were raided for falconry, and that nationally about 100 are taken. He tries not to get too attached to the birds he monitors. “It’s pretty bad just now,” he says. “Nest raiding was bad in the early 70s, and now it has returned.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I am not guilty. I am a decent man,” Maduro said in Spanish during repeated attempts to speak over the judge.As he entered the courtroom, shackled at the ankles though not at the wrists, he looked toward the jury box. Before sitting down, Maduro told the public gallery “Happy new year!” in English.Maduro was dressed in orange slippers, a blue shirt on top of a neon orange shirt, and beige pants. He scribbled notes on a legal pad throughout the hearing.He faces four US federal criminal counts, including “narco-terrorism” conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy and possession of machine guns and destructive devices. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.He was first indicted in 2020, along with 14 members of his inner circle, as part of a sprawling drug-trafficking case against Venezuelan officials and Colombian guerrillas.Defence lawyer Barry Pollack made no immediate application for bail, but said he would later file a motion alluding to the “military abduction” he said his client was subjected to.Flores, the Venezuelan first lady was also captured in the pre-dawn raid on Saturday in which at least 40 people were killed, including civilians and Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel.Her lawyer, Mark Donnelly, said she sustained “significant injuries during her abduction” and required medical examination for “severe bruising” on her ribs.Flores, who had large Band-Aids on her temple and forehead, said, when she entered her own not guilty plea, she was “completely innocent”.The pair were earlier brought to the court under tight security from the notorious Metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn, whose previous residents include Jeffrey Epstein associateGhislaine Maxwell, Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, and the singer Diddy.The jail also once held the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted on drug smuggling charges in 2024 –only to be pardoned by Trump last month.Maduro and Flores were transferred to a helicopter for a brief flight to Manhattan thenescortedby heavily armed law-enforcement personnel into an armoured vehicle and transferred to the courthouse, where rival groups of Maduro’s supporters and opponents clashed outside.The surreal spectacle of the 63-year-old president of a sovereign foreign nation in a US courtroom, partially shackled and wearing a blue shirt on top of a neon orange prison scrub and khaki trousers, evoked the the 1991 trial of the Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega and the2006 public trialof Iraq’s leader Saddam Hussein.Thecriminal indictmentunveiled Saturday by US attorney general Pam Bondi echoed Trump’s claims that his unilateral military intervention in Venezuela was necessary to stem a flow of drugs into the US.“Maduro and his co-conspirators have, for decades, partnered with some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world, and relied on corrupt officials throughout the region, to distribute tons of cocaine to the US,” the indictment alleges.Strikes by theUS militaryon alleged “narco boats” in the months before Saturday’s raid in Venezuela have resulted in at least 110 deaths, leading some legal experts to question if the attacks amounted to war crimes.But Trump has also justified Maduro’s abduction as a way for the US to seize “stolen” oil from Venezuela, and promised that the US would “run” Venezuela for the foreseeable future while American energy companies take control of the country’srich oil reserves.In Venezuela, Maduro’s son Nicolás Maduro Guerra, an elected official, told the national assembly that the US had “kidnapped” his father.Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s deputy who was sworn in to succeed him on Monday, appeared to drop her initially defiant response to the attack,offering to work with the US, hours after Trump threatened that she could “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she did not bend to his wishes.Trump’s moves, meanwhile, sparked a global wave of revulsion, and fears that the bombing in Caracas – which he hasthreatened to repeatif Venezuela does not cooperate – could extend to action in other countries with which he is at odds, notably Colombia, Cuba and Iran. That would mark a return to past “naked imperialism” by the US in Latin America, Alan McPherson, a history professor at Temple University,told the Guardian.Tensions with Colombia ramped up further on Monday when its president, Gustavo Petro, said his country would “take up arms” if Trump acted on his threat of military action there.At Monday’s emergency meeting of the UN security council, Guterres, in a statement read out by a diplomat, said he was “deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability [in Venezuela], the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted”.He added: “I remain deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS attack on VenezuelaVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS militaryAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But the US president’s Venezuelan adventure, whisking its leader out of the country after a late-night raid, has pushed that cautious approach to its limits.The clues were all there. Ever since Trump confirmed that he had authorised the CIA to conductcovert operations in Venezuelaagainst drug traffickers – andblockaded oil tankers– the military campaign had been mounting.But despite the US president’s threats to oust Nicolás Maduro, some on the UK side had put them in the same “unbelievable” category as Trump’s promise to bring peace to Ukraine on his first day in the White House, orplans to develop a “Gaza Riviera”.When the dramatic raid did finally happen, with Trump saying theVenezuelan had been seizedfor “narco-terrorism”, the UK prime minister took 16 hours to respond publicly, and even then it was a masterclass in hedging his bets.“We regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime,” Starmer said, but then – as might be expected from a former human rights lawyer – reiterated his support for international law.The UK government has continued this approach since: say as little as possible that might offend Trump; leave it to the US to explain the legal justification for the move; and, in the words of one aide, “recognise that it’s not our fight”.Labour’s political opponents on its progressive wing – the Lib Dems and the Greens – have piled pressure on the government to condemn the US action.Downing Street gives short shrift to the idea – suggested most forcibly on its own side by Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee – that a lack of western condemnationmight embolden China and Russia.“Comparisons between the developments over the weekend and the full scale invasion of a sovereign, democratic state is a bad comparison,” Starmer’s spokesperson said.Even the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, took a stronger line, suggesting Trump had indeed violated international law by capturing Maduro (but adding that “it may be a good thing” if it made Russia and China think twice).The government is – apparently – unwilling to rock the boat when a multibillion-pound trade deal and peace in Ukraine are at stake. “We’re taking the realpolitik route,” one insider said.But some senior government officials, including in the Foreign Office, are uncomfortable at the extent of what they see as fence-sitting as the UK’s unreliable ally over the Atlantic wreaks yet more havoc on the international order.“Nobody thinks Maduro was a good guy, or that he should have been in power,” one said. “But effectively kidnapping a head of state to achieve regime change sets you on a dangerous path.”Some on the political side have also privately voiced concerns. “If we let this happen without condemning it then where does it stop? Colombia? Cuba? Even Greenland? Where does Trump strike next?” one minister questioned.Downing Street insiders – perhaps conscious of alarm over Trump’s actions among Labour MPs – insist the UK would take a more robust approach if a European ally were ever threatened.Starmer haspublicly backed the Danish prime ministerafter she demanded the US stop its threats to forcibly take over Greenland, which is largely autonomous but remains part of the Danish kingdom, for security and mineral resources.The foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, later told MPs: “The future of Greenland is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes – and no one else.”Starmer – who has been trying to call Trump since Friday night’s attack – is due to finally speak to the US president after a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” in Paris on Tuesday. Their tone is likely to be emollient.The prime minister has told colleagues that one day, there may come a time when he finally needs to take a tough stance against Trump – but this does not yet appear to be that moment.“Any decision like that comes with a choice,” Starmer told them, according to sources. “Are we willing to risk damaging our most important economic and national security partnerships as a result? We need to weigh up the cost to our own interests.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaKeir StarmerAmericasForeign policyDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroanalysisShareReuse this content"

Between 10,000 and 20,000 of them died or sustained a serious disability because of treatment delays linked to staff shortages, said Dr Sanjeev Nayak, a senior stroke specialist at Royal Stoke hospital.“It is heartbreaking to see the real and avoidable impact that workforce shortages have on patient outcomes. In my experience workforce shortages directly lead to avoidable disability and, in some cases, avoidable death,” said Nayak, a consultant interventional radiologist.“It is reasonable to estimate that around 10-20% of stroke patients each year are left avoidably dead or more disabled than they otherwise would have been because of delays in the system. Those delays are multifactorial, but workforce shortages – in stroke physicians, nurses [and other staff] – are a major, repeatedly identified contributor.“Given that stroke affects around 100,000 people a year in the UK, this translates into many thousands of patients annually whose outcomes could have been materially better with timely access to adequately staffed stroke teams.”Nayak pointed to the annual reports produced by the Sentinel Stroke national audit programme team based at King’s College London, which assess the NHS’s performance in England, Wales and Northern Ireland against official guidelines for stroke care.Itsmost recent reportfound that it took four hours and 11 minutes to get someone who had had a stroke to hospital in 2024-25, longer than in 2023-24 and more than 90 minutes longer than a decade ago.And just 46.5% of stroke patients last year were admitted to a specialist stroke unit within four hours of their arrival in hospital, about level with the previous year but down more than 10 percentage points on a decade ago.New research undertaken by BIASP has shown that longstanding gaps in the stroke medical workforce are getting worse, despite the ageing population and unhealthy lifestyles leavingmore people needing hospital treatmentafter a stroke.Its survey of the 100 hospitals in England that provide acute stroke care found that:70% of stroke units are short of at least one consultant in stroke care, and many are two down.53 of 84 hospitals that responded had vacancies for a total of 96 consultants.The NHS relies heavily on locum doctors to fill holes in the workforce caused by the difficulty in recruiting new consultants.10% of the NHS’s 423 substantive (permanent) consultants are due to retire in the next five years, exacerbating the existing shortage.Together the results revealed “a significant worsening in the workforce position in the NHS in England”, with more unfilled vacancies than previously thought, Werring said.The lack of consultants meant that some smaller hospitals did not have a senior specialist on duty around the clock to decide on the care of stroke patients who arrived in the evenings, overnight or at the weekend, said Dr Louise Shaw, BIASP’s current president.“That’s very unacceptable,” Shaw said. “All patients admitted to a hospital with an acute stroke should have access to an immediate stroke consultant opinion and advice on their care. And at the moment that’s not available.”Key stroke treatments such as thrombolysis (using clot-busting drugs) andmechanical thrombectomy– surgery to remove a blood clot from the brain – were extremely time-critical, Nayak said. “When services are understaffed, patients miss treatment windows altogether or are treated too late, resulting in far worse neurological outcomes that could have been prevented … Delays in specialist assessment or transfer to a thrombectomy centre can mean the difference between independent recovery and devastating, lifelong disability – or not surviving at all.”Werring said hospitals in rural, coastal and more deprived areas were most likely to have a shortage of stroke consultants.Patients were being denied “time-critical, life-changing” treatment because of staff shortages, the Stroke Association said. “We know harm is happening because there simply aren’t enough stroke specialist staff.”The situation revealed by BIASP’s audit threatens Labour’s chances offulfilling its pledgeto cut deaths from heart disease and stroke by 25% by 2035. Labour’splan for changelast year said: “We want to see fewer lives being lost to the biggest killers, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke, and suicide. This means diagnosing and treating patients earlier.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care (DHSC) is drawing up a plan, which will be published this year, to deliver the 25% ambition. England-wide guidelines say stroke patients should receive “seamless, joined-up care at every stage” of their NHS treatment.The DHSC did not respond directly to BIASP’s findings. A spokesperson said the NHS had 7,000 more doctors than the same time last year. “And our upcoming workforce plan will set out how we ensure the NHS has the right people in the right places, with the right skills to care for patients when they need it.“We are committed to improving stroke prevention, treatment and recovery, including by setting new national standards for how cardiovascular disease care should be delivered across the NHS.”The number of people in the UK who have a stroke is expected to rise from 100,000 to 151,000 a year by 2035, Stroke Association analysis has found.Explore more on these topicsStrokeHospitalsNHSHealthDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ofcom added that it would assess whether an investigation is necessary based on the company’s response.Meanwhile, politicians and women’s rights campaigners accused the UK government of “dragging its heels” by failing to enact legislation that was passed six months ago making the creation of such intimate images illegal.The trend, which went viral over the new year period, also prompted the European Commission to say on Monday that it was “very seriously” looking into complaints that Grok was being used to generate and disseminate sexually explicit childlike images.Concern began surfacing after a December update to Musk’s free AI assistant, Grok, made it easier for users to post photographs and ask for their clothing to be removed. While the site does not permit full nudification, it allows users to request images to be altered to show individuals in small, revealing items of underwear and in sexually suggestive poses.On Sunday and Monday, Grok users continued to generate sexually suggestive pictures of minors, with images of children as young as 10 created overnight. Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Musk’s children,complained thatthe AI tool generated a picture of her when she was 14 years old in a bikini.A picture of Stranger Things actor Nell Fisher was manipulated by Grok on Sunday in order to put her in a banana print bikini. Fisher is 14 years old. Many women have expressed fury onXafter discovering that their images had been undressed without their consent. Some pictures of women and children have been manipulated by the AI tool appear to have substances resembling semen smeared on their faces and chests.Researchers atAI Forensics, a Paris-based non-profit, examined 50,000 mentions of @Grok on X and 20,000 images generated by the tool, found over a week-long period between 25 December and 1 January. At least a quarter of the @Grok mentions were requests for the tool to create an image. Within those image generation prompts, there was a high prevalence of terms including “her”, “put”, “remove”, “bikini” and “clothing”.It found that more than half the images were of people in “minimal attire” such as underwear or bikinis, the majority being women who appeared to be under the age of 30. A minority of the images, or 2%, appear to show people aged 18 or under, AI Forensics added, with some images representing children under five years old. The researchers said most of the content was still available online and included requests to generate Nazi and Islamic State propaganda.Initially, Musk expressed amusement at the trend, posting the crying-with-laughter emoji on Friday in response to a picture of a digitally manipulated toaster wearing a bikini. He said: “Not sure why, but I couldn’t stop laughing at this one.” After global outcry at the harmful nature of the content, he posted later that “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”.An X spokesperson said: “We take action against illegal content on X, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.”An earlier statement from Grok announcing that it had “identified lapses in safeguards” and was “urgently fixing them” turned out to have been generated by artificial intelligence; it was not clear whether the company was actually taking action to fix safeguarding lapses.Regulators have been working for years on outlawing nudification apps on phones, with mixed success, but last month’s updates to Grok have mainstreamed the problem, making it simple to create and share intimate images of individuals with most of their clothes removed on one of the internet’s most popular platforms.While the creation of images involving children with their clothes removed is already illegal, the law surrounding the creation of deepfakes of adults is more complicated. UK campaigners succeeded in passing legislation last June that make it illegal to both create and request the creation of intimate images without a person’s consent, but the relevant provisions have yet to be implemented, meaning that the legislation is not currently enforceable. It is, however, already illegal to share these non-consensual deepfake images.Charlotte Owen, the Conservative peerwho championed the legislation, said: “The government has repeatedly dragged its heels and refused to give a timeline on when it will bring these vital provisions into effect. We cannot afford any more delays. Survivors of this abuse deserve better. No one should have to live in fear of their consent being violated in this appalling way.”A spokesperson said the government was committed to implementing the new offences of creating, or requesting, an intimate deepfake without consent as soon as possible, adding that sexually explicit deepfakes “are degrading and harmful … that is why we have legislated to ban their non-consensual creation, ensuring that offenders face the appropriate punishments for this atrocious harm.”GabbyBertin, the Conservative peer who has campaigned to regulate nudification technology, said the government needed to act swiftly because the current legislation “is always playing catch up”.Jess Asato, the Labour MP who has been campaigning for better regulation of pornography, said: “It is up to Elon Musk to realise this is a form of sexual assault and take appropriate action. It is taking an image of women without their consent and stripping it to degrade her – there is no other reason to do it except to humiliate.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It’s not an insult … because there is a growing sense of concern and alarm in the United States about the fact that Europe’s economic, relative economic decline as a share of the global GDP is a crisis.“There is a degree of alarm in Washington about the need for serious reforms in order to jolt the European economy back to life. We think it’s possible with the right reforms.”The changes the US was seeking, Helberg said, centred on the opportunity to “drastically simplify and reduce the regulatory burden in Europe”, which he claimed would free up talent and capital on the European continent and attract US investment.The US has repeatedly threatened not to lift50% steel tariffs on the EUif the bloc does not roll back on tech legislation hitting its billionaires including Elon Musk.Helberg said the bloc was falling way behind other leading economies such as the US and Washington desired a strong Europe to maintain the “historic 70-year plus of a transatlantic alliance”.Countries such as Italy and Germany are experiencing modest GDP growth. Germany recordedno growth in the third quarter of 2025, while it was projected to grow 1.3% in 2026 and 1.4% in 2027.Overallthe bloc’s own estimatesproject growth of 1.4% for 2025 and 1.5% in 2027.By comparisonthe US economy roseat an annualised rate of 4.3% in the third quarter of 2025, rebounding aftera contractionin the first three months of the year amid fears over the impact of Trump’s tariff strategy.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS national securityEuropeEconomicsEuropean UnionUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In December, the government published its funding plans for local authorities, which assumed most would raise council tax by the maximum amount.The increase in council tax in Derbyshire is expected to raise about £29m this financial year and will coincide with a new round of cuts worth £22m, according to its budget saving proposals.The savings do not appear to include significant job cuts, despite council leader, Alan Graves, pledging to do so after claiming the local authority was 20% overstaffed.The budget proposals report blames inflation, rising demand and the government’s new local government funding formula as having contributed to budgetary pressures.It states the council “being a rural shire county has suffered as a result of the reforms” and in order to “maintain funding levels there will be a need to set increases in council tax at the maximum permitted level”.The proposed increase in council tax has attracted criticism from opposition councillors in Derbyshire who accuse the party of “empty rhetoric”.Conservative opposition leader, Alex Dale, said: “It is now painfully clear that Reform’s promise to ‘cut your taxes’, plastered across leaflets and campaign material right across the county in last year’s elections, was nothing more than empty rhetoric.“Residents were sold a simple slogan, but the reality is that those promises were as worthless as the paper they were printed on.”Gez Kinsella, the leader of the Green group at the council, said the party had promised to “cut taxes and improve services”, adding: “Reform’s ‘moon on a stick’ promises are turning out to be as true as the previous Conservative administration fantasy economics.”Kinsella shared leaflets and letters she said Reform had distributed in Derbyshire before the local elections which pledged to “cut your taxes” and criticised rising council tax bills amid cuts to services.In March this year, Derbyshire councillor Martin Bromley also posted an image on Facebook which included the statement: “Say no to Labour … say no to increased council tax.”Reform UK said it never promised to freeze or reduce council tax during the election campaign and any pledges to reduce taxes were in relation to national policy.Similar criticisms have also been raised at other Reform-led councils.Leicestershire county council leader, Dan Harrison, declared the party would be able to “cut council tax” after the May local elections. However, just six months later, Harrison conceded that, although “a council tax freeze is our aspiration … conditions are unlikely to allow this for next year”.Reform took control of 10 local authorities and became the largest party in three others in May, with the party’s leader, Nigel Farage, promising to tackle “wasteful” spending as well as scrap net zero and diversity and inclusion initiatives.2:58‘Suck it up’: Exclusive footage reveals tensions inside Reform UK council – videoCouncils are legally required to ensure a balanced budget. The proposals put forward by Derbyshire council of an £838m budget for the upcoming year is about £38m below what the authority said it needs.Like the previous Conservative administration, Reform will have to rely on part of the authority’s reserves to support “ongoing budget pressures,” a move it acknowledges is “not financially sustainable”.The plans are expected to be considered by the council in the coming weeks.The cabinet member for council efficiency (Doge) at Derbyshire county council, John Lawson, said in response that next year’s council tax increase was still under review.“There is still work to do as we look at the numbers across the board. No decisions have been made as yet, and a final proposal will be put to cabinet to discuss at its meeting on 29 January,” he saidQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He departs after a power struggle with the hierarchy over transfer policy, with Amorim demanding his ­colleaguesin the recruitment department “do their job”following Sunday’s draw at Leeds.His immediate replacement is Darren Fletcher, who takes charge as interim head coach. The Scot, a former United midfielder and the ­current under-18s coach, will lead the side at Burnley on Wednesday and could remain in charge for Sunday’s FA Cup tie with Brighton.Manchester United’s flawed process: why Amorim appointment was doomed from the startRead moreUnited are yet to decide whether to appoint a permanent head coach for the remainder of the season or to do so in the summer. The process will be led by Jason Wilcox, the director of football, and Omar Berrada, the chief executive.If they decide on a temporary coach until the end of the campaign Fletcher would be an option. Another potential candidate is Michael Carrick, who was United’s caretaker manager for three games in 2021 from late November to early December, winning two and drawing the other.Regarding permanent replacements, Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner is understood to be of interest. While the Austrian deploys the same 3-4-3 formation at Palace as Amorim did, he has indicated a willingness to play a back four, so is more flexible than the Portuguese proved.Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola and the unemployed Enzo Maresca are two more candidates who might be considered. Thomas Tuchel came close to replacing Erik ten Hag in summer 2024 but as England manager would hope to still be leading the national team in July at the World Cup, which may be too late for United to appoint him.View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim challenged Jason Wilcox (left) and Omar Berrada (right) with his comments after Manchester United’s draw with Leeds.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAThose considered currently as ­outside prospects include Gareth Southgate, the former England ­manager, and Mauricio Pochettino, the USA head coach. Xavi, the former Barcelona coach, is open to the role but his limited English and lack of Premier League experience means he could be ruled out.Whoever does take over will have to work within the structure that gives Wilcox and Berrada a higher status regarding football policy than the head coach. Amorim’s frustration with this was a key component in his removal. The 40-year-old believed United were prepared to back him in the January transfer window should a major signing become available but said last Friday: “We have no conversation to have any change in the squad.”This strained his relationship with Wilcox and after the Leeds game he said: “I came here to be the manager ofManchester United– not to be the coach” – even though his title was head coach.United acted swiftly on Monday, saying: “WithManchester Unitedsitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.”Amorim was informed of the January transfer policy by Wilcox, with United reluctant to sanction any signings he targeted as these might not suit the next head coach, the hierarchy having lost confidence that he was the right long-term solution.Amorim’s refusal to adapt once the players had grown into his system caused concern because the club believed he agreed to do this when taking charge, while a reactive style also caused disquiet. Hisdownplaying of the academyand underwhelming comments about senior players, includingPatrick DorguandBenjamin Sesko, were not received well.Amorim indicated that pundits’ opinions had started to hold more sway than his own within the club. “If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club,” he said after Leeds.United’s stance is that Amorim was given 100% backing and was removed owing to a lack of progress and ­evolution. The £250m spent since he was appointed is pointed to as evidence of support. There is also an ­insistence that Amorim was in ­concert with the close-season ­strategy of signing three forwards rather than a midfielder.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Amorim was appointedon 1 November 2024 until June 2027, with a club option of an additional year. He oversaw United’s lowest Premier League finish – 15th – last season andlost the Europa League finalto Spurs.United endured a difficult start to this season and were knocked out of the Carabao Cupby the League Two club Grimsby. But United’s co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe backed Amorim in October, saying he should be judgedafter three years in charge.Until recently Amorim was wedded to his tactics, built around a back three, which brought success to Sporting in his previous job, saying“not even the pope”could make him deviate, but his approach has been widely questioned throughout his tenure.After his removal, the club are searching for their seventh full-time manager or head coach since Sir Alex Ferguson departed in 2013 after 26-and-a-half years in charge.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

On the other hand, there could be a cadre of AI illiterates who risk social disempowerment.Colligan, a leading expert in technology and its social impacts, told the Guardian AI literacy must become a universal part of education on a par with reading and writing to avoid a social divide opening up.“There is a world where you’ve got a big split between kids who understand, have that core knowledge and therefore are able to assert themselves and those who don’t,” said Colligan, whose charity is affiliated to the £600m British low-cost tech hardware startup of the same name. “And that could be really very dangerous.”View image in fullscreenPhilip Colligan says schoolchildren must learn how to code.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianHis warning was backed by Simon Peyton Jones, a computer researcher who led the creation of the schools national curriculum for computing in 2014, prior to the AI boom. He called for a new digital literacy qualification for all schoolchildren that would ensure they know how to use AIs in a critical way.“If it’s simply a black box, then [its actions] seem like magic,” he said. “If you know nothing about how the magic is working that is terribly disabling. I am very worried about students leaving school without having agency in the world.”Their comments came amid a fall in the number of children studying computing, with 2025 entries for a GCSE in the subject down across the UK. Today, three times more people take history and nearly double the number take biology, chemistry and physics. At the same time, use of AI systems nationwide has been surging – up 78% in the year to September, according topollingby Ipsos.Part of the belief that learning computing skills is becoming redundant comes from some of the big AI companies, which argue their systems are going to automate coding. Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, said in October that 90% of its own coding was automated using its Claude AI model. Meanwhile, 2025 was the year when“vibe coding” became a common phrase– capturing the idea that AIs would allow humans to build software by using natural language instructions rather than specialised code.View image in fullscreenSome politicians have questioned whether coding lessons are redundant.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianPolitical leaders such as Keir Starmer have also suggested coding is becoming redundant. As leader of the opposition in 2023, he said: “The old way – learning out-of-date IT, on 20-year-old computers – doesn’t work. But neither does the new fashion, that every kid should be a coder, when artificial intelligence will blow that future away.” It has created the idea that understanding the inner workings of a computer may be less relevant in the future.“I think they’re just overhyping the benefits,” said Colligan, whose charity works in schools across dozens of countries.“This message is leaking out that the kids don’t need to learn this stuff any more and that is not only flawed it is dangerous. We’re already talking to teachers in lots and lots of schools around the world, not just the UK, saying: ‘We can drop computer science now, right?’ That’s a problem.”He added: “All of us are going into a world where more and more of the decisions we encounter every day will be taken by automated systems. At the moment it’s what movie should I watch next or what song should I listen to? Fairly soon it’s going to be finance decisions, healthcare decisions, criminal justice decisions. If you don’t understand how those decisions are being made by automated systems, you can’t advocate for your rights. You can’t challenge them, you can’t critically evaluate what’s being presented to you.”In December, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who is now an AI investor, predicted that “we will move from staring at the internet, to living in the internet”.Colligan said: “My concern is there will be a gap between kids based on their socioeconomic background. Some kids who go to great schools, who are able to teach this stuff, will be in a much stronger position as citizens, whether or not they’re using technology for their job. Those kids who are in communities where they don’t have access to [AI literacy teaching] will be passively on the end of a whole load of automated decisions.”View image in fullscreenColligan says ensuring all children understand how AI works will prevent a social divide developing.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianIn the coding club, the seven- to 10-year-olds are taught how AIs work. The lessons were clearly having an effect on Joseph. He said he thought AI “will probably be good, but if lots of people believe it when it’s wrong it will have a bad impact on them”.He was not interested in letting the AI do the coding of the video games he planned to make. “It might do it differently to what you want,” he said. “It might also do it wrong and you need to know how to solve it … I’d like to be in charge of the AI. If the AI is in charge of us, we wouldn’t really be able to control what we’re doing and that would be bad.”Explore more on these topicsEducationAI (artificial intelligence)SchoolsComputingRaspberry PiCambridgeChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I can’t absorb that kind of hit.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianBuying to letAre UK buy-to-let landlords dying out – and should we care?Higher taxes and tougher regulations have led to the disappearance of tens of thousands of rental propertiesTom KnowlesMon 5 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareAs a buy-to-let landlord of 15 years, Neil France had a feeling things were about to get worse for him and his sector.“You’ll never lose votes for hammering a landlord. That’s the reality,” France, 68, said. “It used to be estate agents and bankers; now it’s landlords.”He was right. In a surprise move, Rachel Reeves announced in her November budget that from April 2027 tax due on the income people received from property would rise by two percentage points. The increase will mean that basic-rate taxpayers will pay 22% on any income they receive from a rented property, while higher-rate taxpayers will pay 42%, and additional-rate taxpayers 47%.“It will cost me an extra £2,500 a year,” said France, who owns seven properties in Merseyside and Essex, including three homes in Chelmsford, which are houses of multiple occupancy.“I can’t absorb that kind of hit. We’ve already been hammered by rising interest rates and other changes to the sector, and I’ve tried to feed that through gently to tenants. But I had to write to all of them and say I’ve had to do some recalculations and rents will be going up again from next year.”The buy-to-let landlord maynot quite be an endangered species, but being one is less lucrative than it used to be. Successive governments have tightened rules, forced into action by horror stories oftenants being charged extortionate rentsfor tiny, unsanitary homes, or beingabruptly evicteddespite having done nothing wrong. Squeezing out landlords was also intended to make it easier for first-time buyers to get on to the property ladder by reducing competition for one- and two-bedroom properties.Graph showing the share of homes bought by buy-to-let landlords in London and in Great Britain since 2012Higher interest rates have left many with thin margins and dwindling profitability. About 80% of buy-to-let mortgages are interest-only, while half of landlords in the UK receive less than £10,000 of profit annually, according toresearch from HM Revenue and Customs.Other costs for landlords have been rising, too. The requirement to make all rental homes have a minimum energy performance certificate rating of C by 2030 will require renovations for many, on top of the 170 regulations that landlords must now abide by. The recently passed Renters’ Rights Act will also bring in regulation changes that are likely to add to landlords’ bills.This comes on top of thewinding down of mortgage interest tax relief– the perk that allowed landlords to deduct mortgage expenses from rental income to reduce their tax bill, but which wasslashed by George Osborne during his tenure as chancellor. There is also the additional 5% stamp duty paid on the purchase of rental homes, and a reduction in the tax-free allowance for capital gains tax from £12,300 to £3,000.Generational shift as millennials make up half of new buy-to-let investors in England and WalesRead moreThe result has been a steady departure of landlords, with research from the estate agency Hamptons showing that the share of homes bought by a landlord in Britain dropped from 15.8% in 2015 to 10.8% in 2025. That is the lowest level since 2007, when Hamptons started collecting data.Separate analysis by Savills suggests that about 200,000 properties were removed from the rental market in the 12 months to the end of March.Lucian Cook, the head of residential research at Savills, said: “While the two percentage point tax increase in itself is not enough to tip landlords over the edge, it comes on the back of a series of changes that is likely to accentuate the next wave of smaller landlords saying: ‘You know what? It’s no longer worth the hassle.’”Philip Waters, 62, is planning to leave the sector after being a landlord in Norwich for 20 years, with four properties.“It’s just becoming far more difficult for private, smaller landlords – almost impossible. The government is clearly wishing for corporates and pension companies to run the rental sector,” he said.Ben Beadle, the chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said: “It beggars belief that the government thinks it is helping renters. Piling on further tax rises that will drive up rents, while keeping housing benefit rates frozen, is a one-way street to hitting low-income tenants the hardest.”But for many prospective first-time buyers struggling to get on to the property ladder, there is unlikely to be much sympathy for landlords.Policies appear to be working. A record 33% of all homes sold across Britain in 2025 went to first-time buyers, according to research from Hamptons.Aneisha Beveridge, the head of research at Hamptons, said: “In percentage terms, the proportion of first-time buyers has pretty much doubled from about 12% to 15% of all homes a decade ago to 33% today. So I think having a little bit less competition from investors has helped some first-time buyers.”Ben Twomey, the chief executive of Generation Rent, a non-profit campaigning group for private renters, said the threat of mass sales from landlords “should be taken with a large pinch of salt”.He argued that most landlords were able to absorb an increase in tax.Twomey added: “Regardless of costs, landlords find it all too easy to raise rents anyway when wages are rising and building new homes slows down. While the Renters’ Rights Act will stop landlords evicting tenants just to raise the rent, it will still be possible for landlords to force rents up in line with speculative adverts. Renters still need real protections from unaffordable rent increases.”However, many landlords and some economists argue the changes may soon become counterproductive. In England alone, there are still about 4.7m households (11 million people) who rent their home from a private landlord. Fewer landlords to cater to that market means greater demand and higher rents, the argument goes, which in turn makes it harder for someone to save for a deposit.That was the verdict of the Office for Budget Responsibility after the latest autumn budget. The OBR warned that the “successive eroding of private landlord returns” was likely to reduce the supply of rental property over the longer run, adding: “This risks a steady long-term rise in rents if demand outstrips supply.”Nor is homebuilding helping to fill the void, with Labour well behind on its target of building 1.5m homes by the end of the decade. Only 208,600 homes were built or converted to residential use in the year to March 2025, the smallest figure since 2016.The UK has a dwindling amount of social housing. Only 12,198 new social rent homes were built in England in the year to March 2025. Although this was the highest figure since 2013, there has still been a net loss of 180,000 social rented homes over the last 10 years, according to thehousing charity Crisis.Some of the shortage in rental properties is now being addressed by build-to-rent developments. These are typically high-rise apartment block developments bankrolled by institutional investors and purposely built for rent. Investors put just over £800m into UK build-to-rent properties in the third quarter, taking the nine-month total to £2.6bn, ahead of last year,according to Savills.However, the total size of the build-to-rent sector so far stands at just 298,000 homes.Beveridge, at Hamptons, said: “Build-to-rent makes up about 2% of all privately rented homes in Great Britain. So it is still very much in its infancy. It’s helping fill some of the gap but is nowhere near enough.”Explore more on these topicsBuying to letHousing marketPropertyRenting propertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plus it has an unusually buff posho. Strap in!Lucy ManganMon 5 Jan 2026 17.00 ESTShareHe is a Balliol man, a suave toff in a suit as sharp as his cheekbones. Unusually buff for a posho, but that is because he is played by Leo Suter, who was Harald Hardrada inVikings: Valhallauntil about 10 minutes ago and evidently still has protein shakes to use up.She is a working-class Norfolk lass (“Swaffham High, Swaffham Tech”) in sturdy boots and a utility vest who is in the last chance saloon, job-wise, because of her habit of mouthing off to her bosses. She is played by Sofia Barclay, best known as Dr O’Sullivan in Ted Lasso but not getting to use her comedy chops here, because you mustn’t be funny in front of Balliol men. They find it damn confusing and have to be taken off for a lie down.Together, they are Detective Inspector Tommy Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers in what is described as a contemporary update of the original novels by Elizabeth George. Now look – I know what you’re saying, but no. There has not, in fact, recently been a contemporary update. That was The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, starring Nathaniel Parker as the eponymous hero and Sharon Small as his scrappy sidekick, and it began broadcasting a quarter of a century ago and finished in 2008. I’m sorry. We are all so much older than we think. And yet, curiously, younger than we feel. I blame the years from Brexit to Trump for that.Anyway. Now we have paused briefly to shake our heads in disbelief, let us return to the fray. This new endeavour – not to be confused withEndeavour, the Morse spinoff on ITV that was notLewis, though the original Parker/Small show was designed to compete with both, so I hope that’s clear – is entitled simply Lynley. Which is as contemporary as all-get-out already, before the credits have even rolled.Havers is assigned to the new DI up from London. She is not looking forward to “playing nursemaid to some fresh-faced city boy who doesn’t know his arse from his elbow”. But wait. What is that coming up behind her? Is it a wardrobe that took a wrong turn at reception? No, it is her new, very tall, very experienced, very “This is my arse, this is my elbow and I have no trouble distinguishing the one from the other” new boss. Fortunately, she is too feisty – a word I feel in my very marrow was capitalised in the script – for mortification to endure long.View image in fullscreenFeisty … Sofia Barclay (DS Havers) with Leo Suter (DI Lynley) and Rosalyn Wright (Maia Saunders) in Lynley.Photograph: Jonathan Hession/BBC/Playground TVThey are soon investigating a body found on an island beach – a man apparently murdered by being biffed on the head. He is Guy Brouard (Dave Anders), a very rich man who owns the entire island and, it is gradually revealed, likes to get up to the kind of things you would expect a very rich man who owns an entire island to get up to. He also has a wife, Ruth (Wendy Nottingham), who is dying of cancer and is largely tended to by his all-seeing housekeeper, Valerie (Amanda Drew) and his groundsman, Paul (Angus Cooper), plus a son who is expecting to inherit the place. No spoilers, but the son is married to an attractive woman, there’s a comely female student on a dig he’s funding on the estate and Valerie’s young niece is also hanging around the place for the summer.You can see from this that a lot of plot is about to happen, in between Lynley dropping bits of Latin into the conversation at every opportunity, and it is paid out with a sure hand and at a steady pace. Everything happens for a reason, every Chekhovian gun from sex tapes to pottery shards goes off, every loose end is tied up. And whenever we need to be kept in narrative suspense for a bit, we get a glimpse into the private lives of the central pair. Lynley is on barely-to-no-speaks with his parents; he may have left some professional or personal trouble behind in the capital; and his love interest, Helen Clyde, will be played by Niamh Walsh but not yet. Oh, and his new boss (Daniel Mays) hates him for reasons as yet unspecified. It might be the Latin. It might be that they have genuine beef. Or maybe the boss just wants to look more like a wardrobe himself. Time will tell.Havers visits her parents frequently but there is clearly a secret sorrow plaguing them all. She’s only second lead, so I suppose there will be more on her later.Everything, in short, is as it should be – for fans of the books, for fans of the old series and for fans of undemanding telly.Deo gratias.Lynley aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV crime dramareviewsShareReuse this content"

Or you might spend a whole Tuesday afternoon socialising, and work late into the night to catch up.That’s just being disorganised.Not if you’re doing it on purpose. Then it’s microshifting.Why would you do it on purpose?To fit your work around your personal commitments, instead of the other way round.What personal commitments?You know, childcare, medical appointments, shopping, exercise, your other job.Sorry – your other job?Nearly 30% of hybrid workers have some kind of second job or side hustle, according to an Owl Labsreport on the future of working.I thought we were all supposed to be going back to the office full-time.That is, to an extent, still the reality: according to the report, office appearances are creeping up for hybrid workers – 34% are in the office four days a week,up from 23%in 2023.How does that square with microshifting being the future?The microshifting trend is being driven by employees. The report says workers would willingly sacrifice 9% of their annual salary for more flexible hours.Wow. When do we think microshifting will kick in?It’s happening now: 51% of employees already schedule personal appointments during traditional working hours. That rises to 61% for gen Z workers.Gen Z: still making it all about them.Microshifting isn’t just for the younger generation. Millennials also have commitments that may benefit from a more flexible employment schedule.I suppose if you’re getting the work done, it shouldn’t matter how undisciplined or selfish you are.With all the time saved by not commuting or sitting in an office with nothing to do, microshifting could even prove more productive than a traditional nine to five.How would we know?Good point.Do say:“The boundaries of the workday are being redefined, and employers would do well to adapt.”Don’t say:“We had something very like microshifting in my day.

So I videotaped my brother David running, jumping and climbing in a car park’Interviews byPhil HoadMon 5 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 17.13 ESTShareJordan Mechner, designerProgramming was very open back in the 1980s. You had to teach yourself, either from magazines, or by swapping tips. When you wrote a video game, you submitted it on a floppy disk to a publisher, like a book manuscript. In my freshman year at Yale university, I sent Deathbounce, an Asteroids-esque game for the Apple II computer, to Broderbund, my favourite games company. They rejected it, but took my next effort, Karateka, a side-scrolling beat-’em-up.I wanted to do a platform game next, inspired by 1984’s The Castles of Dr Creep, where you could throw switches that opened doors and closed traps. I thought it would be cool to combine those puzzle elements with the same kind of fluid rotoscoped animation as Karateka, which was unusually realistic for the time. The opening scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark was also a big inspiration; I wanted the same excitement, like you could die at any moment. I devised a story about a princess locked in a tower by an evil vizier – and you have one hour to save her. It came from an unconscious place: the game describes the hero as an adventurer from a foreign land, but I realised later I was echoing my family’s history as Jewish refugees.I started in October 1985, videotaping my brother David in the parking lot of our old high school,running, jumping, climbing: all the movements needed. But there was no animation software in those days, so I had to digitise everything manually. First, I photographed still frames of the videotape, got the films developed, then retouched the images in two-tone black and white – the only colours the digitiser could pick up. It took months.Everyone in the company knew this was a hitI moved to San Francisco a year later, to work in Broderbund’s offices. It was exciting being surrounded by real programmers, like Will Wright, who later made Sim City. I thought being there would make me more efficient – but finishing Prince of Persia ended up taking four years.After the character animation, I built the levels. But just avoiding traps wasn’t that much fun. My girlfriend at the time, Tomi Pierce, who was programming in the same office space, kept saying: it needs combat. But my animation was so fluid I had maxed out the Apple II’s 48K memory, which is less than the average email today. Out of desperation, I used a technique called byte-shifting to produce, without using any more memory, a polarised “dark” version of the prince: the Shadowman. After the player creates him by jumping into a mirror, he runs around stealing your potions and closing gates in your face. It was the opponent the game needed. So I reprogrammed everything to free up enough memory for the sword-fighting animations and some extra guards. I rotoscoped the combat moves from a six-second sequence in the 1938 film The Adventures of Robin Hood when you can see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in profile.The Apple II was dying as a platform by the time the game came out in 1989. But after it did well on other platforms in Europe and Japan it was rereleased on PC in the US and sales picked up. You wouldn’t get that second chance today. I was relieved, vindicated, happy. It created an action-adventure template for platform games that influenced the later 3D wave: Tomb Raider and Uncharted are its direct descendants.I helped adapt our own 3D follow-upPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time, into the 2010 movie with Jake Gyllenhaal. Just prior, I had spent all my savings on developing another game, The Last Express, an artistic folly that flopped commercially. So Prince of Persia ended up rescuing me too.Doug Carlston, publisherJordan was one of five or six independent developers working in our attic space. The problem for a lot of programmers is that they get 90% done, and don’t have the stamina to finish the last 10% – which is boring. Jordan’s finish quality was always superb; he’s a very detail-oriented guy. He would disappear for months at a time, though – I didn’t know it then, but he wanted a career in Hollywood.The time away was probably good for the game. I liked it a lot more than Karateka: the gameplay and the story were much stronger. It had an intangible quality: you kept thinking about it when you weren’t playing it. It was one of those times when everyone in the company knew they had a hit on their hands.Because it defined its own genre, its reputation needed to grow before it took off. Eventually, it went platinum and sold over 2m copies, which was a pretty big deal then. It was an outlier in the video games industry at the time in its use of animation, which was traditionally a Hollywood talent. The tools that were relevant to one industry were becoming relevant to the other, similar to how Pixar started out creating graphics software for Lucasfilm. It was a harbinger of film and technology getting closer.Jordan Mechner’s graphic novel Replay is out nowExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeGamesAction gamesAdventure gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Video: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianReverie gave way to giddy fun as I opened the umbrellas into the wind, then turned them against it. They had all performed well in normal, rainy conditions, but up here in high winds, many turned inside out in a flash. All of the lightweight, folding models inverted quickly, although some of the larger city and golf brollies resisted impressively, sending me stumbling while their frames and canopies held fast against the gusts.It was such good fun – and provided such good intel on these umbrellas. The testing convinced me that my highest-rated brolly,the London Undercover Classic, was a worthy winner, as its dual-layered canopy resisted the wind superbly. And it was reassuring to find that none of the brollies broke in high winds, though some of them clearly weren’t suitable for really bad weather.Another thing I learned is that a good umbrella is an investment. The models I rated most highly ranged from about £30 to well over £100, so I’d always advise checking for repairability and a decent guarantee before making the purchase.Of course, the personal value of a brolly multiplies through the years in hand and overhead. My most cherished umbrella will always be the Betty’s Tearooms-branded one that I inherited from my mum. It’s a lot like her: cosy, protective, and evangelical about coffee and cake.

For Mason there was the added baggage of Spurs’ 13-year trophy drought; for McFarlane, making his senior management debut, it was Chelsea’s astonishingly bad recent record against Manchester City. Four and a half years have passed since Chelsea last beat Guardiola’s side, when Thomas Tuchel’s team triumphed in the Champions League final, and a draw on Sunday took that winless run to 12 matches. But Enzo Fernández’s injury-time equaliser, combining withthe midweek upheaval at Stamford Bridge, made it a triumphant point, something Enzo Maresca didn’t achieve against City during his tenure.Taha HashimMatch report:Manchester City 1-1 ChelseaRuben Amorim sacked by Manchester United – live updatesRead more2Liverpool fail to shut up shopFlorian Wirtz was one of the positives forLiverpoolin their 2-2 draw with Fulham but the £116m summer signing was not happy despite scoring for the second time in three games. “I was happy that I scored but I’d rather take the three points,” Wirtz said. “It’s not what we want, we want more. We have to get better but it’s still a process.” To get more, though, Liverpool have to be more commanding. They keep letting games run out of control and Arne Slot seems short of solutions. Liverpool’s manager was not impressed with the defending that led to Harrison Reed’s equaliser. It was a stunning and unlikely strike from the Fulham substitute but Liverpool should not make the mistake of thinking they were the victims of misfortune. They almost let 2-0 leads slip against Wolves and Tottenham last month. The season will remain a struggle until they tighten up when ahead.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:Fulham 2-2 LiverpoolView image in fullscreenFlorian Wirtz was left frustrated despite scoring his second goal of the season.Photograph: David Cliff/EPA3Rice backs Gyökeres to fire for GunnersViktor Gyökeres hasn’t found his goalscoring touch for Arsenal yet, but Declan Rice insists the Sweden striker is still having a huge influence for the league leaders. Rice scored twice againstBournemouthas Mikel Arteta’s side completed a stirring comeback on the south coast, but Gyökeres has now gone 10 matches without finding the net from open play. His all-round performance was slightly improved against Andoni Iraola’s side and Gyökeres played an important role in Arsenal’s crucial second, even if he rarely looked like adding to his seven goals in 23 appearances so far. “It’s tough for him because defenders are so tight on him, and there’s no space for him at all,” said Rice. “All the boys are with him because of what he is doing for us, even though he hasn’t scored, how he is helping us as a team to press, hold the ball up. I think good things are going to come.”Ed AaronsMatch report:Bournemouth 2-3 Arsenal4United need Sesko to sharpen upWith Ruben Amorim starting nine defensive-minded players at Elland Road on Sunday afternoon, the onus naturally fell on the remaining two to lead Manchester United’s attack. Matheus Cunha’s fine form continued with the goal that earned the visitors a point, but Sesko’s travails continued. The Slovenian has scored just two goals since his big-money move to Old Trafford, and none since October. Granted, his service was limited on occasions and United’s attacking play was stunted by so many defensive players on the pitch, but Sesko struggled to make an impact once again, spurning a glorious chance to potentially claim all three points late on. As we enter the new year, there is justification to ask for more from a player who is yet to fully find his feet in the Premier League.Aaron BowerMatch report:Leeds 1-1 Manchester United5Le Fée leaves Spurs in a muddleRégis Le Bris made the brave decision to partner Granit Xhaka with Enzo Le Fée in midfield at Tottenham. The Frenchman was asked to play a deeper role than he is used to and acquitted himself well. With Spurs in the lead, though, Le Bris pushed Le Fée further forward in the second half and his performance was a delight. Picking up little pockets of space, the former Roma forward became a major factor in Sunderland’s push for an equaliser. After directing a header on to a post from Nordi Mukiele’s pass, Le Fée then created Brian Brobbey’s goal before Spurs knew how to stop it. A sharp first-time pass back into the striker’s path gave him a chance he could not miss. Sunderland have had plenty of success stories this season but, now he has adapted to the pace of thePremier League, Le Fée’s campaign keeps getting better.Billy MundayMatch report:Tottenham 1-1 SunderlandView image in fullscreenEnzo Le Fée caused Tottenham all sorts of problems.Photograph: Dalton Bowden/Shutterstock6Nuno wastes chance to bed in PabloEverything about West Ham’s defeat at Wolves was embarrassing, from start to finish. Nuno Espírito Santo left three available substitutions unmade, an indication of the confidence he has in his bench. The manager named his new signing, Pablo Felipe, among the substitutes but despite the chronic failings of his team, who failed to have a single shot on target, Nuno decided it would be unfair to send the new recruit on for his debut, having only arrived from Gil Vicente on Friday. Before this season the 22-year-old’s career was relatively nondescript but, after 10 goals in 13 league games in Portugal, the Hammers must harness his newfound confidence and hope he is not a Brazilian Michael Ricketts. West Ham are desperate for goals and Pablo needs to adapt quickly to the Premier League. It would have been a free hit for him at Molineux, especially with a crucial game at home to Forest on Tuesday. Joining in January is difficult but, if Nuno wants him to adapt, he will need to get the striker on the pitch as much as possible.Will UnwinMatch report:Wolves 3-0 West Ham7Miley makes another big statementLewis Miley dared Eddie Howe to drop him thanks to another outstanding performance out of position at right-back. Quite apart from excelling defensively, never misplacing a pass and creating Newcastle’s opening goal for Bruno Guimarães in Sunday’s 2-0 win againstCrystal Palace, the astonishingly mature 19-year-old midfielder raised the tone in an untidy game. With Tino Livramento and Kieran Trippier both fit again and ready to resume at right-back, the question will be whether Howe can find a place for Miley in central midfield against Leeds at St James’ Park on Wednesday night. “Lewis has been incredible,” said Newcastle’s manager, who may be tempted to rest Sandro Tonali against Daniel Farke’s team after the Italy midfielder was left bruised by some tough Palace challenges. “You wouldn’t know right-back isn’t Lewis’s natural position. He’s excelled in it. He’s doing a great job for the team.” Future Newcastle sides will surely be built around Miley.Louise TaylorMatch report:Newcastle 2-0 Crystal Palace8Is Dyche effect wearing thin at Forest?Sean Dyche’s initial impact atNottingham Foresthas been admirable, but do they have a Plan B? Forest are averaging a point a game since Dyche’s arrival in October (1.4 if Europa League games are included), but they have lost four in a row. Only once this season have they come from behind to win – against Leeds in November. Their counterattacking abilities remain, though are less effective than when Chris Wood (now injured) and Anthony Elanga (sold to Newcastle) were regulars last season. But they do still look well-organised when defending deep. Forest are generally compact, alert, combative and aligned when the scores are level, or they lead. But when the other team scores first, and they have to commit more players ahead of the ball, the game becomes more stretched. In Saturday’s 3-1 defeat at Villa Park, Forest were easily taken apart after giving the ball away; they cannot afford a repeat in Tuesday’s crucial trip to West Ham.Peter LansleyMatch report:Aston Villa 3-1 Nottingham ForestView image in fullscreenSean Dyche roars instructions from the sidelines, to no avail.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/Shutterstock9Thiago’s hot streak ends away-day bluesIt was hard to reconcile Brentford’s performance at Everton with a team in possession of one of the worst away records in the league, so controlled and dominant were Keith Andrews’s visitors, but despite seven losses on the road this season their ambitions might have to be revised. Asked what Brentford’s target for the second half of the campaign should be, Kevin Schade said: “The main goal is not to go down, obviously. Then I would say it’s not a goal but a dream we can achieve, if everything goes right, to qualify for Europe. For me, personally, to go to the World Cup, and I need good games for that and the team as well.” With Igor Thiago in such prolific form, Schade andBrentfordhave that platform. Schade said of his teammate: “He’s very important because we always had players like this, for example Ivan Toney, Bryan [Mbuemo] and Yoane Wissa before, and now him. The link-up play for the team gets better from game-to-game and this is what we need, not only him scoring.”Andy HunterMatch report:Everton 2-4 Brentford10Burnley lag behind promoted rivalsThere’s been a twisted sense of solidarity among the relegated clubs in the last couple of seasons. They’ve come up together from the Championship – and instantly gone down together, too. But Burnley’s journey this season has become increasingly lonely, with the other new boys,Sunderlandand Leeds, appearing safer and safer. As Daniel Farke’s side extended their unbeaten run to seven games and Sunderland made it five without defeat, Scott Parker was forced to confront a new low in Burnley’s loss to Brighton with just two points collected from their last 11 matches. Having praised his side’s application in defeat previously this season, this time there was just a series of glum admissions from the head coach, who pointed to an absence of belief among his players and said they didn’t deserve anything from the match. Six points from safety doesn’t sound too bad, but Parker’s analysis makes it feel pretty dismal.THMatch report:Brighton 2-0 BurnleyThis article was published beforeManchester United announced the sacking of Ruben Amorimon Monday.PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal2026482Man City2026423Aston Villa209424Liverpool204345Chelsea2011316Man Utd204317Brentford204308Sunderland202309Newcastle2042910Brighton2032811Fulham20-12812Everton20-22813Tottenham Hotspur2042714Crystal Palace20-12715AFC Bournemouth20-72316Leeds20-72217Nottm Forest20-141818West Ham20-201419Burnley20-191220Wolverhampton20-266Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballAston VillaNottingham ForestWolverhampton WanderersWest Ham UnitedBournemouthArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year Keir – and that’s a huge problemJohn McTernanThis weekend’s lengthy BBC interview was a great opportunity to show more vim and a new vision, but once again process and stock phrases won outJohn McTernan was political secretary to Tony Blair at No 10Mon 5 Jan 2026 06.42 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 11.54 ESTShareKeir Starmer kicked off the political new year with a fascinating and revealing45-minute-long interviewwith the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. The format was another sign of the No 10 comms team changing up its game – it was the nearest thing that public service broadcasting gets to anask me anything (AMA). Throughout the lengthy exchange the real Starmer was on show as he calmly and doggedly fielded all questions.And that was the problem. This wasn’t an attempt to reframe the political narrative for the coming year, nor was it a clear exposition of Labour’s “soft left” political economy – nationalisation, workers’ rights and the green transition. There was a complete absence of storytelling, just reliance on a handful of carefully practised phrases, the abiding sin of thisLabourgovernment: the elevation of tactics above strategy.Responding to questions about his own, and his government’s, deep unpopularity, Starmer planted himself firmly – and repeatedly – on a “five-year mandate” that he argued was “in the national interest” for him to see through. Growth was mentioned as a touchstone, but without any analysis of “growth for what or for whom”, even though distributional consequences are the modern religion of socialism. A variety of questions about voters’ frustrations met the same response: the country is “turning a corner”. The possibility that the Labour government is actually about to turn into heavy oncoming traffic hovered over the discussion of the coming May elections in Scotland, Wales, London and councils across England, our very own version of the US midterms. For the prime minister these were just local votes, not a national referendum.What was revealing wasn’t the bloodlessness of the prime minister’s language: no one is ever going to rise from their seat shouting, “Preach, brother, preach!” after any of Starmer’s performances. Instead, what was fascinating were the few flashes of passion. Asked about the real changes that people should feel during the coming year, he kept returning to “bearing down on child poverty”. And you could tell he meant it. Which is, at the very least, ironic given that he and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, only came to the conclusion that thetwo-child cap should be liftedwhen the parliamentary Labour party took direct political control of welfare policy.As we know from his airmiles, it’s geopolitics that really brings Starmer to life. He was willing to talk to Kuenssberg compellingly and at length about his achievements in bringing the UK closer to the European Union and his determination to continue deepening those relations. He showed a desire not just to engage in this discussion but also to argue for increasinglyaligning with the single marketin contrast with rejoining the customs union.View image in fullscreenLaura Kuenssberg interviewing Keir Starmer on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, 4 January 2026.Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PAThis, though, was “Not Here Keir”: the technocrat who is more suited to being a foreign secretary or a trade minister. The devil was in the details, and he was willing to go there. What there was no evidence of was a political argument in favour of this approach. The government was “quietly, seriously getting on with the diplomacy” and any changes would be “sovereign decisions” in the UK’s economic interests. Brutal, street-fighting politics was absolutely absent. The best reason to talk about the EU is that it is “punching the bruise” – it is the one subject that Nigel Farage and his fellow travellers, such as Robert Jenrick, are absolutely desperate to never ever discuss.There was passion, too, over defence and security. The need for European leadership in security, the cause of a “just and lasting peace” in Ukraine. But when this unlawful invasion was compared to the kidnapping and rendition of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, Starmer reverted to his inner securocrat who wanted to “establish all the facts” before commenting on the record. Again, a desperate lack of political antennae. It is an iron law that Donald Trump destroys all in his orbit. Yet, rather than distance himself from the US administration, the prime ministerchose to emphasise: “I do get on with President Trump.” A line that highlights London Labour activists’ wry observation that the Green party won’t need to do much campaigning this May, since “Keir Starmer is on the ballot”.In the end, what the prime minister effectively said was meet the new year, same as the old year. A politics of relentless process rather than any elevated purpose.The best way to summarise where we are would be to adapt former Labour prime minister Harold Wilson’s dictum “the Labour party is a crusade, or it is nothing”. For Starmer, “the Labour party is a PowerPoint presentation, or it is nothing”. We hoped for better, and still do.John McTernan is a political strategistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Clearly, something is going on hereMon 5 Jan 2026 12.23 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 14.26 ESTShareIt was the first real day of 2026: 2 January. There was already no shortage of mayhem, which is to say “news”, in the world but the papers were united around one talking point:The Traitorshas changed format and introduced a secret traitor. Looking at the coverage, you would not have been able to tell which tabloid you were reading; all were united in a single, harmonious, “Wow, can’t wait to see what happens”. Traitors-appreciation will brook no political division, no silos, no echo chambers; it is, genuinely – I’ve scraped all the available data in my head – the only enjoyable thing that no one has ever called “woke”. If the nation were a couple on the rocks, Traitors is the local Italian restaurant we would go to, to remember the good times, when garlic bread was still delicious and things were still funny. To say anything remotely critical about the format would just be needless, churlish – ought to be illegal, actually.Except, guys, one day we’re going to have a conversation about how perilous it is to be a person of colour on this show, and if we’re ever going to do that, sooner is better than later.Walk back through the early rounds of Celebrity Traitors: I’ve discredited myself on this subject, having predicted before it started that it wouldn’t work, because the contestants weren’t motivated by money and, being celebrities, they were all front to begin with. I was actually right, by the way – the lack of a cash incentive made them incalculably more stupid. They managed to banish five faithfuls before they found a traitor – not even in series one, when nobody really knew what they were doing, did a group come close to being so unsuccessful. I was wrong, though, to think that would make it any less compelling.Anyway, first to be banished was Niko Omilana, the 27-year-old YouTuber, and well before his fateful round table, everyone stopped talking to him. It made absolutely no sense; this is a man of baffling personal charm. You cannot watch him without smiling. In the 2021 London mayoral election, he won nearly 50,000 votes on a promise of turning McDonald’s outlets into social housing. Regarding his banishment, he mused aloud that maybe it was because he was an outsider – everyone else had been around the same kind of showbiz traps for years, and his scene was much younger, altogether different. Well, maybe.The Traitors review – ​this amazing new twist changes everythingRead moreSecond to be banished was Tameka Empson, the 48-year-old EastEnders actor and comedian, and who knows, she may have also suffered the curse of being a middle-aged woman. There seems to be some additional unconscious bias which means middle-aged women are considered annoying, and I hope I speak for all those of us in this demographic when I say: we are annoying on purpose. We are absolutely done with nonsense.Whoosh, almost no time has passed, a fresh, non-celebrity cast has appeared, and once again, it seems to be a risky old business not being white, especially if you’re Ross. All early banishments are a throw of the dice, since nobody has done anything or knows anything, but this was ridiculous. The 37-year-old personal trainer was in the crosshairs for reacting, for not reacting, for knowing things, for not knowing things, for defending himself, for not defending himself. Thank God there was someone even more suspicious: Judy, whose smoking gun was her manner, which didn’t sit right. A child liaison officer by profession, aged 60, yes, she definitely has the manner of someone who is done with nonsense. But you can’t make any solid inferences of treachery from that, it turns out.Traitors is still great; it’s still the charming little eatery of our collective psyche, and on no account should we stop going there. Nobody’s accusing anyone of conscious bias – but if theBBCrevealed in 10 years’ time that it wasn’t a gameshow at all, it was actually a social-experiment documentary about unconscious bias, I’d think: yeah, well played, that really worked.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A narrative is emerging that seeks to justify the US military intervention as a response to theNicolás Madurogovernment’s appalling human rights record.My office has long condemned serious human rights violations by the Venezuelan authorities. We have reported, monitored and warned about the situation inside Venezuela – most recently,just before Christmas. We have consistently called for an end to unfair trials, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, the persecution of political opponents and sweeping restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly. We have urged independent investigations and accountability. For many years, my team in Venezuela advocated for the release of human rights defenders, monitored trials and engaged with civil society and the opposition, as well as state institutions.Trump’s coup in Venezuela didn’t just break the rules – it showed there aren’t any. We’ll all regret that | Nesrine MalikRead moreOur detailed monitoring and reporting were intended to prompt action. When a state violates the human rights of its people, my office is among those who are charged with raising the alarm. It is up to the international community to use the lawful tools and mechanisms at its disposal, so that states respect their human rights obligations. These tools could include diplomatic leverage and investments in accountability. But these tools and mechanisms were not deployed effectively to influence the government ofVenezuela.Far from being a victory for human rights, this military intervention – in contravention of Venezuelan sovereignty and the UN charter – damages the architecture of international security, making every country less safe. It sends a signal that the powerful can do whatever they like, and weakens the only mechanism we have to prevent a third world war, namely theUnited Nations. No amount of deception and distraction can alter these facts.Beyond the legal arguments, history teaches us that while attempts at regime change may initially be greeted by relief, they often lead to massive human rights violations, dangerous chaos and protracted violent conflict.The human rights of Venezuelans are not a bargaining chip, or a point to be scored. I have visited Venezuela and spoken with its people, and I feel deeply for them at this moment. I feel for those waiting desperately for news about their loved ones; for families who have been separated; and for all those with empty places at their tables during this holiday season. Human rights need to be central to Venezuela’s future – not an afterthought, taking a back seat to negotiations around the exploitation of fossil fuels. The country’s future must be decided by its people.More broadly, human rights cannot be treated like an ideological ping-pong ball. We cannot afford for our rights to be instrumentalised: invoked when they’re convenient, and vilified when they’re not. I fear for people in the region and around the world who are deeply alarmed by what this breach in international law means for their own safety and security. This is not about choosing between unilateral intervention that runs contrary to international law, or ignoring years of human rights violations. We need more fidelity to human rights law around the world, not less.Venezuelan society needs healing. It needs justice to overcome polarisation and to repair its social and economic fabric. It does not need militarisation, violence or further uncertainty and instability.Above all, Venezuela needs the international community to stop paying lip service to human rights, and to stand up for the UN charter and for international law. The alternative will have terrible consequences around the world.Volker Türkhas been the UN high commissioner for human rights since 2022Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionUnited NationsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyNicolás MaduroTrump administrationAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

Venezuelahas vast oil reservesand used to produce more than three times as much volume as it does now. Therefore it should be a simple matter to upgrade the crumbling kit with an injection of dollars and watch the extra barrels and profits flow.That, roughly speaking, is the only clear part of Donald Trump’s plan for what happens next in Venezuela. “We’re going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure – the oil infrastructure – and start making money for the country,” he said at the weekend.The reality looks difficult. From the point of view of US oil companies, the invitation – or command – from the White House is not straightforward. The possible exception is Chevron since it is already inVenezuelavia a handful of joint ventures with the country’s state-owned oil company. If sanctions, quotas and government restrictions were now to clear, it could probably find ways to boost production efficiently. The 4% rise in Chevron’s share price said as much.But the initial kneejerk positivism in fellow US oil majors’ share prices is harder to understand. For those companies, the risk v reward calculations around re-entry are more complicated – and wholly unclear at this point. Look at analysts’ projections of what it would take to repair a decade of underinvestment in Venezuela’s oil industry and double production output to 2m barrels a day by the early 2030s: £115bn, reckons Rystad Energy.That is serious money, even for companies with the budgets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. That is doubly so if Trump is simultaneously trying to push down the price of a barrel of oil to $50 (from about $60 today), thereby capping long-term rewards.Boardrooms will want to know what, precisely, it means for the US to ‘run’ VenezuelaOne doubts Venezuela has suddenly jumped to the top of the average global oil company’s list of investment priorities just becauseNicolás Madurohas been removed. Boardrooms will also want to know what, precisely, it means for the US to “run” Venezuela, whether commitments can credibly be made for decades and what the fiscal regime for oil will be. None of those questions is likely to be answered soon. The Gulf of Mexico, Guyana, Brazil, and many other places, will continue to look easier venues for the big oily bets.“Even if the political environment backdrop was more predictable, in a world already awash with oil, the business case for significantly ramping up drilling in Venezuela is far from strong – particularly given the estimated high cost of extracting Venezuela’s “heavy” oil reserves,” said David Oxley, the chief climate and commodities economist at the thinktank Capital Economics.The title of his note – “Venezuela’s vast energy potential to remain untapped” – reflects an entirely plausible scenario. While one can see how output could get a short-term boost just by running operations better, a multi-decade project to unlock the “tremendous amount of wealth”, as Trump put it, is another matter. One is a short-term rebound; the other requires massive investment with long payback periods.None of which is to deny the geopolitical significance if the US effectively has control – or just heavy influence over – Venezuela’s oil industry and reserves. In the short term, merelyredirecting Venezuela’s exports to US refinerieswould change the shape of today’s market. China, now the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, would lose in that scenario.But big US oil producers’ instinct, probably, will be tosit on their hands. The prospect of $50 oil means most will be thinking about spending cuts, rather than investment spurges. Most have made promises to investors prefer share buy-backs over high-risk projects. And, as investment bank SocGen’s analysts put it, “the fact that Venezuela has nationalised the oil companies, not just once, but twice, will make the oil majors incredibly cautious about going back into the country.”An open question is how much pressure Trump could exert on the companies to spend “billions of dollars” regardless. But that is one uncertainty among many. Until the picture is clearer, do not expect a stampede.Explore more on these topicsOilEnergy industryDonald TrumpVenezuelacommentShareReuse this content"

But noise about its slow start is beginning to look like a ritual movies in the series must go through before the money pours inMon 5 Jan 2026 12.16 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 20.58 ESTShareFor a movie saga that is, on paper at least, the world’s most popular fantasy trilogy of all time, Avatar doesn’t half have its sceptics. Maybe it’s James Cameron’s po-faced belief that he’s making the sort of films that could save planet Earth from future environmental apocalypse. Or perhaps it has simply become the kind of cultural behemoth that invites opposition merely by existing. Either way, it’s fair to say not everyone has exactly been sobbing over the idea thatFire and Ashmight be the final time we get to see an Avatar film for the foreseeable future.Avatar: Fire and Ash review | Peter Bradshaw’s film of the weekRead moreUntil recently, this had seemed like a genuine likelihood. The Hollywood trades have been filled with reports that the saga would bedone and dusted if the new instalment fell short of expectations at the box office, while Cameron himself has been publicly talking aboutwhat happens if Avatar 4 and 5 don’t get made. Those who would rather chew on their own spleens than sit through six more hours of glowing eco-sermons ever again will have been quietly encouraged by last week’s relatively puny box-office opening for the new episode,reportedly just over $340m worldwide on debut.But then (as Avatar films tend to do) it began to pick up. After its third weekend in cinemas,it crossed $1bnand box-office analysts suggest it could now be on course to hit the $2bn mark achieved by both previous instalments. And even if that target turns out to be overambitious, the new episode will probably do well enough to get the next two films – which are already written (and in the case of 4, partly filmed) – properly greenlit.It is worth remembering at this point that Fire and Ash’s box-office pattern is not some unexpected quirk of the Avatar business model so much as its entire reason for still being in business. Cameron’s films have always opened steadily before picking up (albeit at glacial pace). They loiter in cinemas for months, steadily converting scepticism into grudging acceptance and then, eventually, into enormous piles of money. Avatar and Avatar: The Way of Water arerespectively the first and third-highest grossing films of all time. And yet the opening weekend panic is almost a ritual at this point, a bit like solemnly announcing that the tide seems worryingly low just before it comes roaring back in and soaks everyone’s trousers.Yet there is still the nagging sense that Cameron is waiting for the inevitable point where filmgoers lose interest. Part of the reason for this might be thatAvatardoesn’t seem to have a legion of hardcore fans in the way Star Wars and Marvel do: it’s as if the saga occupies a strange cultural blind spot, despite the minor counterargument that several billion people have paid to see it. Could it be that Avatar is simply cinema for the sort of people who don’t actually argue much about cinema online, a franchise powered less by geeky fandom than by the general public’s quiet, mildly awestruck acquiescence to the stereoscopic multiplex machine?View image in fullscreenIn the beginning … the human stars of 2009’s original Avatar; from left, Sam Worthington, Michelle Rodriguez, Sigourney Weaver and Joel David Moore.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarIf so, this might explain why every new instalment is treated as a referendum on Hollywood’s future. And yet for movies that basically stare you down earnestly and insist that you care about interconnected ecosystems, spiritual networks and the terrible consequences of industrial greed, it’s hard to argue more than a decade and a half in that they don’t have some serious staying power. The alternative though doesn’t bear thinking about. If Fire and Ash really had bombed,Cameron had been threatening to release the next two episodes as novels. Just imagine this: War and Peace but with phosphorescent flora, entire chapters devoted to Na’vi rituals, appendices and maps, possibly footnotes explaining the correct ceremonial use of body paint and humming.Avatar Fire and Ash: harmony is no longer guaranteed in James Cameron’s threequel – discuss with spoilersRead moreAt least now it appears we’ll be getting Avatars 4 and 5 in the format they were always intended to be presented in. The saga will continue to divide, confuse and mildly irritate people who would rather it didn’t exist, while quietly, relentlessly proving that seriousness, spectacle and very large blue aliens remain a potent commercial combination. Until, that is, we do this all over again when Avatar 4 comes out, at which point everyone will once more announce its imminent failure with the confidence of people who have learned absolutely nothing.Explore more on these topicsAvatarWeek in geekJames CameronScience fiction and fantasy filmsFilm industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s the good news: a great British toilet revolution could be on the wayEddie BlakeInspired by ministers and councils willing to spend a penny, architects are building beautiful, functional loos – a first step towards restoring civic prideMon 5 Jan 2026 09.03 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 10.27 ESTShareWhy do we have so few public toilets in UK cities? It’s hard to think of two more fundamental social needs than a) not being forced to relieve yourself on the street and b) not having other people relieve themselves on the street – yet the public toilet is an ignored and vanishing public amenity. The British Toilet Association reports that 40% of public toilets haveclosed since 2000– Victorian facilities in particular attract developers, not least because their dignified buildings endure: solidly built, centrally located and still embedded in the daily flow of the city. When maintenance costs are high and councils are struggling, it is easy to convert a sturdy urinal into a fancy bar or flower shop that brings in rent.Against this backdrop, a new wave of architects has begun to emerge who are reframing the problem and bringing new expression to the building type. They are supported by innovative councils and, sometimes, government grants. This may mark the start of a trend, driven by a convergence of conditions: growing public attention to access, the clear scarcity of toilet provision and a renewed sense of purpose within local authorities. These architects are emphasising not only public toilets’ necessity, but also the potential for public luxury.View image in fullscreen‘Old technologies to suit a modern world.’ Studio Weave’s public toilets in Woolwich, London.Photograph: Jim StephensonSome remarkable examples are inLondon. As director of Studio Weave, I’ve overseen two new public toilet buildings in the past year – one in Woolwich and one in Maida Hill – funded by the boroughs of Greenwich and Westminster respectively. Both projects were championed by forward-thinking council officers and local politicians who recognise the importance of such facilities and their role in civic life. Greenwich was successful in securing backing from the Department for Levelling Up’s Future High Streets Fund and, crucially, it was strongly supported during the public consultation. This meant that the council could ringfence spending on the public toilets, protecting them from overbearing cost-cutting measures.As an architect who designs public buildings, I can tell you that quality materials and vision are key. In cities, you are often dealing with a complicated underground spaghetti of gas pipes, sewers and cables. You may have to negotiate with local authorities that have no obligation to cooperate. And you’re working with Victorian infrastructure that almost never matches the drawings.We have to build toilets that are safe – perhaps with passive surveillance from nearby businesses – but that respect users’ dignity. We think about the way the doors open and who can see in and out, and we make sure there are no places to hide drugs or a knife. Our Woolwich toilets have high-quality traditional encaustic-tile flooring and oversized chimneys to enable passive ventilation – old technologies to suit a modern world. We like to incorporate shelter from the rain and sun, as well as drinking water and a place to sit down – those small public amenities that a council isn’t obliged to provide but will find hard to take away once they are incorporated into a solid building. Sometimes, we are lucky enough to work with a council that has money and a longer vision: for our project at Finsbury Circus, the City of London set a 100-year design life, demanding much higher-quality materials than most contemporary public buildings make do with.View image in fullscreenDK-CM’s Bruce Grove project, which has added a community room and cafe.Photograph: Emily Marshall/DK-CM ArchitectsColleagues in contemporary architecture have produced similarly strong work:DK-CM’s elegant refurbishment inBruce Grove(for Haringey borough) andHugh Broughton’s civic design in Westminster are distinguished by their architectural quality and thoughtful integration into the city. The Bruce Grove project has added a new community room and cafe to what was a dilapidated old public toilet building. The Westminster architects commissioned an artist to evoke the character of the local area.Delivering such projects means managing tight local authority budgets. It often requires cross-programming, such as adding cafes or storage facilities to offset maintenance costs through rent. These measures boost footfall, enhancing passive surveillance and therefore reducing antisocial behaviour. The result is a virtuous cycle: more users, less crime, less fear and ultimately even greater use.Local politicians know that visible public provision wins votes, yet in most UK councils, funding remains scarce. The projects above relied on the Mayor’s Fund, the Levelling Up Fund and small portions of local budgets – streams that have largely dried up. A bright civic future is therefore hard to imagine, even though investment in public toilets would probably pay for itself by revitalising public spaces and stimulating commercial activity.However, change may be coming – the government is offering positive news in itsPride in Place strategy, which will offer funding specifically for public toilets to local authorities. Earlier this year, theLondon Assembly calledon the government to make public toilets a statutory duty for local authorities. Perhaps the UK will follow the best practice ofthe Tokyo Toilet project, which brought talented architects to design safe, beautiful, accessible public restrooms – but also, importantly, has a well-funded maintenance programme. The project boasts that “toilets are a symbol of Japan’s world-renowned hospitality culture” – not a space that should be regarded as an afterthought or an embarrassment.Good architects should embrace the complex challenges of designing public architecture, whether that be libraries, museums or public toilets. It is possible to approach all these typologies with the same rigour and belief that good architecture will improve people’s lives. But this also requires political will. Ultimately, nothing is too good for the public. These buildings succeed not by hiding their function, but by dignifying it. They understand that good design doesn’t just manage waste, it redeems it. A public toilet can express democracy – evidence that a city still believes in itself enough to provide for its most basic, universal needs.It’s public toilets or barbarism.Eddie Blake is a director of the architecture practice Studio WeaveExplore more on these topicsArchitectureOpinionLocal governmentLondonPublic services policycommentShareReuse this content"

Refusing on Sunday to condemn the attack as a breach of international law, European Union member statescalledhopefully for “a negotiated, democratic, inclusive and peaceful solution to the crisis, led by Venezuelans”. The delusional nature of that response was laid bare as Mr Trumptoldreporters the same day: “We’re in charge.”So much for the restoration of democracy. The US president also repeated threats of further military action, should the repressive regime left behind when Nicolás Maduro was seized fail to do Washington’s bidding. As Mr Trump’s marginalising of the Nobel prize-winning opposition figurehead María Corina Machado illustrated early on, the will of Venezuelans is not on his list of priorities.Operation Absolute Resolvewas about exercising raw power to dominate a sovereign nation, and controlling Venezuela’s future oil production.Faced with such nakedly imperialist ambitions, and a brazen contempt for rules-based multilateralism, Sir Keir Starmer and his European allies need to do much better than cover their eyes and disingenuously shift the focus of discussion. Having initially emphasised the need for a democratic transition in Venezuela, the French president, Emmanuel Macron,saidon Monday that he “neither supported nor approved” the manner of Mr Maduro’s removal. Sir Keir, whoseevasionsand obfuscations on the matter up to now have been painful to witness, should do the same. When Emily Thornberry, the Labour chair of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee,warnsthat US actions in Venezuela will only embolden other global bullies to trash international norms, he must know that she is right.For their part, European governments urgently need to plan for a world in which the west, as traditionally conceived, is no longer a useful concept. The reluctance to criticise Mr Trump is partly about keeping the US president on side, at a crucial moment for Ukraine. It is true that without meaningful White House security guarantees for Kyiv in the future, Vladimir Putin’s ability to pursue his own revanchist project of regional domination would be hugely strengthened. But unchecked and unchallenged, “America first” expansionism is becoming a geopolitical menace in its own right.Along with the United Nations, Europe has a duty to push back against the subjugation of international law to the whim of rogue superpowers policing their “spheres of influence”. Its leaders must also ensure the rapid development of sufficient hard power to exert some influence of their own. They may have no choice: note Mr Trump’s renewedclaimson Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. In a radio interview, Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said that the US threat needed to be taken seriously. That such a statement can be sincerely and justifiably made is jaw-dropping.Regime change in Caracas came weeks after thepublicationof a bellicose national security strategy that pledged to “restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere”.Colombiaand Cuba have now been put on notice, and in Denmark, so has a Nato ally. With Washington in the vanguard, a dangerous new world order is forming at pace. Within it, Europe urgently needs to speak up for its values, while building the capacity to defend its own interests.Explore more on these topicsUS attack on VenezuelaOpinionVenezuelaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropean UnionKeir StarmereditorialsShareReuse this content"

Ministers are right to demand healthier food and promotionsMon 5 Jan 2026 14.04 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 18.25 ESTShareAfter years of wrangling, from this week new rules shield children in the UK fromjunk food advertisements. Those featuring processed food and drink products in 13 categories – including soft drinks with added sugar, crisps, chocolate and sweets – are now banned online, and can only be shown on broadcast TV after 9pm. In a month already strongly associated with the giving up of bad habits and turning over of new leaves, restraint on the part of advertisers has been made compulsory.Rising childhood obesity is the reason. Our exclusive report last week, on calls by doctors forchildren’s blood pressure testing, hammered home the dangers of obesity and the case for preventing it. The longer-term trend, both nationally and internationally, is widely recognised as alarming. Since the national child measurement programme was launched 20 years ago, the proportion of primary‑age children in England who are obese hasrisen from 17.5% to 22.1%(although since 2020-21, when a record proportion of children were obese or overweight, there has been some improvement).Obesity deepens inequality, with theprevalence of childhood obesity in the most deprived areasaround twice as high as in the wealthiest ones. The worse health associated with poor diet and excess weight, including type 2 diabetes and the risk of stroke, is thus added to other hardships. This concentration of obesity, and particularly its most severe forms, in the most deprived neighbourhoods is one reason why the new restrictions on advertising should be welcomed. As withgambling, smoking and other harmful consumer goods, the uneven impact of unhealthy processed foods, and the risks they present to already-vulnerable households, is arguably the single most damaging thing about them.While adults can be expected, in a liberal society, to take a share of responsibility for their choices – just as businesses run by adults should be expected to take responsibility for theirs – the same is not true ofchildren, who in many cases do not have the information, let alone the maturity, to make decisions about how much fat, sugar and salt to eat. For a Labour government, narrowing the gaps that restrict the life chances of disadvantaged children must always be a priority.Public debate about obesity has become dominated bynew weight-loss drugsto a remarkable extent. But in the UK they have been offered only to atiny minority of severely obese children– making it all the more essential that prevention and public health work around food are not disregarded. While the jabs’ long-term effects remain unknown, the importance of a healthy lifestyle is in any case not reducible to body weight but encompasses exercise and nutrition. In a wealthy country such as the UK, every child should have the chance to acquire such habits.Charities including Sustain havestrongly criticised concessionsgranted on the back of industry lobbying, including a decision that brand advertising will still be allowed as long as products aren’t displayed. They are right to be wary. Ominously, last year was a bumper year for sales of snack foods, and spending on billboard and poster sites, where rules are less strict, is already up. But while the new rules will not end childhood obesity – and should have been in place sooner – as with other half measures, they are much better than none at all.Explore more on these topicsHealthOpinionFoodAdvertisingObesityChildrenPovertyDiabeteseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Let me enlighten her: all those good things are overshadowed and obscured by the more conspicuous contemptible ones.This includes sucking up (other phrases are available) to a particularly changeable and untrustworthy head of a foreign state; appeasing the financial markets at the cost of unrelieved austerity for our public services; continuing to underfund and privatise the NHS, the single thing almost all of the electorate value most highly; approving sales of arms which he must be aware may be used for war crimes; selectively criminalising protest; equivocating towards our European friends; not only failing to call out but actively seeking to appease the far right; and,in short, not leading a Labour government.Dr Katy JennisonWitney, OxfordshirePolly Toynbee can’t understand why Starmer is so unpopular. How about the fact that he junked his platform policies shortly after members like me elected him. Or that he insulted my intelligence by declaring thatthere is no casefor Britain rejoining the single market or the customs union. Or his inept positioning on Israeli war crimes. And his reliance on the wrongheaded direction of Morgan McSweeney.Starmer is a poor communicator with no vision or apparent principles, and no one has any idea what he believes in.

Neither applies here. However illegitimate a government may be, regime change by invasion, occupation or foreign administration is unlawful. That rule exists precisely to prevent powerful states imposing political outcomes by force.Trump’s words amount to an admission of occupation. Under the Hague regulations and Geneva conventions, an occupying power may not assume sovereign authority, dictate political outcomes, or exploit natural resources. To do so constitutes pillage – a war crime. The UN secretary general has already warned that international law has not been respected.By contrast, Keir Starmer’s response – welcoming the end of Maduro’s regime while declining to condemn the use of force – risks treating legality as conditional on political approval, rather than as a binding rule. As a human rights barrister, whose legal opinion in 2015 was that the Iraq war was illegal as it had no UN resolution authorising it, he should know better.This matters far beyondVenezuela. The case against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine rests on the same principle: borders and governments cannot be changed by force. If Venezuela is treated as an exception, that principle collapses. International law cannot be selective.Hannah WalkerWymondham, LeicestershireI feel, and share, Nesrine Malik’s anger (Trump’s coup in Venezuela didn’t just break the rules – it showed there aren’t any. We’ll all regret that, 5 January). But what is the right response? Righteous indignation is all very well, but will do nothing to combat such hostile supremacy. The UK is in no position to confront any of these tyrannical superpowers and our choice of allies is limited. The principles of international law that have secured some kind of world order for the past 80 years are being openly ignored and the UN is toothless in the face of leaders who are so openly contemptuous of an ethos of collaboration and democratic freedom.The only possible route to an effective challenge to Trump et al is surely for Europe, with other nations around the world such as Canada, South Africa and Australia, to get its act together and form an alternative alliance with sufficient defence and trading powers to provide real opposition.But with Europe so divided, and resources so constrained, the pace at which that is progressing is alarmingly slow. That is where we need to be directing our anger, and we should use our democratic rights of protest (while we still have some) to bang our collective leaders’ heads together and push as hard as we can for such an alliance.Celia CashmanSheffieldWhy do you say Nicolás Maduro’s was “captured” by US troops? This seizure is better described as an abduction or a kidnap. If any country other than the US had invaded a foreign country, killing civilians in the process, and carried off the head of state, then that is how it would have been described.Charlie OwenLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

For the entirety of my life, Sir David has been a source of inspiration.“One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds,”the late American ecologist Aldo Leopoldonce wrote. For many of us who work daily in conservation and nature recovery, these words sadly ring true, and it can sometimes be hard to find the energy to stay positive.The magic that Sir David brings to us is his continued sense of wonder and passion for the natural world. That in itself is perhaps his greatest lesson. Despite the continued decline in biodiversity and our own hectic lives, we should all take a moment to observe and appreciate the world around us.Most of us will never travel to the places that Sir David has been to in his life, but we can all learn to take pleasure in the nature that surrounds us, from the fieldfares cackling every morning outside my window to the robin that follows me around the garden and the return of migrants in spring.Yes, nature needs our help. Yes, it is in decline. What Sir David so eloquently reminds us, though, is that we should never take it for granted or allow ourselves to forget that sense of pure wonder.Pete EtheridgeSway, HampshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Hearing this, the radar bleeped red – Amorim was clearly countenancing changing from a system he was quasi-obsessed with.Ruben Amorim sacked by Manchester United after losing power struggle over transfersRead moreAsked in September if Sir Jim Ratcliffe, United’s minority owner and head of football policy, had suggested a switch of shape, the 40-year-old said: “No one.Not even the popewill [make me] change. This is my job. This is my responsibility. My life. So, I will not change that.” Amorim’s inflexibility appeared baffling and naive. The evidence? Last season’s record low 15th-place finish in the Premier League and the equally pathetic 1–0 Europa League final capitulation to Tottenham. And for Wilcox and Omar Berrada, the chief executive, this lack of adaptability was a key factor in Amorim’s sacking, according to club sources.From the moment Amorim joined United in November 2024, Wilcox and Berrada both believed that once the players bedded in under the coach, there was an agreement from him to change the side’s configuration as well as style to an attack-focused approach in line with United’s storied heritage of the Busby Babes and Sir Alex Ferguson’s thrill-a-second teams. As an illustration, last week’s1-1 draw with Wolvesis pointed to at the club. Rob Edwards’ side arrived at Old Trafford with only two points and left with a further one after Amorim reverted to a 3-4-3 formation despite having switched to a 4-2-3-1 formation for Boxing Day’s 1-0 victory over Newcastle. And the mode was dour, rather than front-foot and on Wolves’ throat.Within United there was further consternation at Amorim’s downplaying of the academy; he recently criticised the 18-year-old defender Harry Amass for “struggling” on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, and pointed to Chido Obi, also 18, for not always starting for United’s under-21s side. Factor in how underwhelming comments about senior players, including Patrick Dorgu and Benjamin Sesko, were also not received well by United’s hierarchy, and this added to the critical mass that led to Monday’s removal.Zoom out, however, and the wider picture of Amorim’s axing shows a morass at the club for which Berrada and Wilcox are also responsible. As highly remunerated executives tasked with ensuring the right man is in place to lead United on the field, at the training ground and in public, questions have to be asked regarding how they got Amorim’s appointment and subsequent incumbency so wrong.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s leadership group includes (from left) Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox.Photograph: Jacob King/PAWilcox can be partly excused as Dan Ashworth was the director of football when Amorim arrived from Sporting 14 months ago. Yet as the then technical director charged with the team’s “game model”, he surely had a say in signing off the appointment. Ratcliffe also trusted him enough to interview potential replacements for Erik ten Hag in early summer 2024, when Berrada and Ashworth were yet to start their roles at the club.Club sources insist Wilcox regularly gave Amorim feedback regarding the team and that the Portuguese became less receptive to this, which circles back to Amorim’s performance on Friday, which presaged his scattergun, indiscreetpost-Leeds media conference on Sunday. It was tough not to read Amorim stating he came to United as the “manager” not “head coach”, could “move on” when his contract ended in “18 months”, and that if criticism from “Gary Neville” could not be ignored “we need to change the club”, as a premeditated back-me-or-sack-me move. If so, this was strategic from a man who had clearly filed the bad news about the change in the winter budget with other observations he gathered regarding the Wilcox-Berrada axis having serious reservations about him.These concerns were in place before Amorim’s outburst on Sunday, as underlined by the Guardian’s reporting in December regardingUnited’s reluctance to sell Kobbie Mainoo, who had long been out of favour under Amorim. The 20-year-old midfielder, currently injured, has yet to start in the Premier League this season but the hierarchy always believed he could convince a future head coach that he is worth a regular place. Mainoo will hardly be disenchanted, then, to see his nemesis depart.Manchester United fan’s view: ‘Amorim out was inevitable … but I wish club had kept faith’Read moreAmorim was backed via a £250m summer spend, primarily on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Sesko, and Senne Lammens. Missing from this list of three forwards and a goalkeeper is the midfielder Amorim’s squad dearly needed going into this season. Again United insist privately that Amorim was in full agreement with the decision to prioritise a trio of attackers over a holding player. Yet with Bruno Fernandes, a natural No 10, in situ, it seemed then – and very much still now – that only one of Cunha or Mbeumo were required, thus freeing funds for, say, Brighton’s No 6, Carlos Baleba, who had been a United target.All of the above added up to Amorim’s culling. He follows in the path of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, and Ten Hag in being a permanent No 1 unable to tame the hydra-headed beast that is United in the post-Ferguson era. He departs with a 39% win rate and a record of 1.24 points per game in Premier League matches, having lost more matches than he won in 2025, and tasting defeat in precisely a third of his games overall, the worst of any permanent United manager since Frank O’Farrell in the 1970s.When United kick off at Burnley on Wednesday, Darren Fletcher will be their caretaker manager. An unkind moniker his predecessor in the hot seat acquired was “Ruben Interim”. After being sacked after only 14 months in charge, the likable son of Lisbon survived barely longer than a temporary appointment.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimanalysisShareReuse this content"

Additionally, they need something to say to rights-holder broadcasters, who conduct separate interviews. Not many embrace the challenge; for some it is an entirely irritating aspect of the role, a distraction from the training pitch, especially when results are not going well.Some try to use their exchanges to their advantage, to build up pressure on those above to bend to their will. For his part, Amorim was strikingly honest with the media; it rarely felt like he was hiding things when asked a question. He produced respectful answers, even if they were detrimental to his own cause at times. The music was faced, with him receiving plenty of merited criticism and dealing with the consequences until the bitterest of ends.Head coaches and managers are the ones held accountable for results, sent out to conduct pre and post-match press duties after a disappointing performance. For many supporters and pundits alike, it is all the fault of the person who picked the players and tactics for a team’s failings – no one else can be blamed.In the modern game, however, as Maresca and Amorim have discovered to their cost, the head coach or manager is no longer the most important person at a football club and, as such, it is probably time those who actually wield the power also front up to the media.View image in fullscreenJason Wilcox (right) with Ruben Amorim at the F1 British Grand Prix in July.Photograph: Peter Powell/EPAChelsea’s co-sporting directors, Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, carried out an interview with the Daily Telegraph in 2024 and some internal media duties after joining the club in 2022. When Maresca was sacked their names did not appear on the statement, despite having triumphed the fact Maresca’s “ambitions and work ethic align with those of the club” when initially appointing him.Given that, they should surely comment on whether or not their recruitment efforts have played a role in Chelsea winning one of their past eight Premier League games.At United, Jason Wilcox, the director of football, also operates in the shadows. He made a rare journey into the light for in-house media after a run of three straight victories in October, enjoying a pleasant walk around the training ground in the sunshine, sending out a positive message.Ruben Amorim is gone, but Manchester United’s forever crisis rolls onRead moreThe minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is more open to carrying out media duties, but is not a football expert. Surely it would be better for those with the knowledge of the sport to attempt to control the narrative and for it to not always have fallen on Amorim’s shoulders to explain United’s failings, regardless of the weather.Clubs live and die by their recruitment, but those identifying the talent pass on the responsibility of whether they succeed or fail to others. Amorim did not sign Joshua Zirkzee, who clearly did not fit into his plans, but was made to discuss the Netherlands forward when it should have been those who scouted and negotiated the deal.Graham Potter and Nuno Espírito Santo arrived mid-season at West Ham to find unbalanced squads, having to work with what they had after repeated ill-judged signings over a sustained period. It was left to Nuno to apologise to fans on Saturday aftera desperate defeat to Wolves, not those who have overseen West Ham’s problems in the long term.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley, left, and Laurence Stewart, have rarely made public comments.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockIn the Bundesliga, sporting directors regularly address questions from the media. When Bayer Leverkusenparted ways with Erik ten Hag– Amorim’s predecessor at Old Trafford – after three games this season, Simon Rolfes fronted up in a statement and has since given interviews. A lesson there for his English counterparts.Football clubs, certainly at elite level, are professional businesses with supposedly clear strategies overseen by large teams. As such, it is not right that one person should be held accountable when things are going wrong, especially when trial by media leads to them and only them being found guilty of failure and, in the end, speaking out in such a way that they end up getting sacked.Explore more on these topicsFootballManchester UnitedChelseaRuben AmorimanalysisShareReuse this content"

His eagerly awaited dispatches were invariably packed with thought-provoking opinions on an assortment of topics, ranging from dead balls to Donald Trump. Below are excerpts from a cross-section of Rosenior’s thoughts during his three years with us, alongside a sense of what they tell us about the 41-year-old and how he could carry out his duties at Stamford Bridge. It is important to remember, of course, that Rosenior’s views may have changed in the intervening period.Liam Rosenior arrives in London to discuss taking over as Chelsea managerRead moreFans’ Bilic abuse has me questioning my desire to be a football manager, 26 Oct 2017“Everyone at the London Stadium as well as millions around the world saw the criticism, abuse and ridicule Slaven Bilic was subjected to last Friday night as we recorded a superb win over West Ham [then managed by Bilic]. What they didn’t witness was that same man standing outside the Brighton dressing room afterwards, waiting for each and every one of our players and coaches to offer congratulations and a warm handshake. A few minutes before I was sat behind the technical area while chants of ‘sacked in the morning’ and ‘you don’t know what you’re doing’ crashed down on Bilic from the stands and yet here he was in the quiet of the tunnel displaying a humility and courtesy which very few people could find in those circumstances and, for the first time in my life, I questioned my own ambition to be a manager.”Rest assured, Rosenior knows precisely what he is getting into at Stamford Bridge.We need a culture shift, not just Rainbow Laces, for players to come out, 23 Nov 2017“I had an experience some years ago where I heard a manager say: ‘If I found out one of my players is gay, they wouldn’t be playing in my team’ … If I was gay and in earshot of that remark from somebody in a position of power it would not only hurt me to the core but make me question whether football is ready to consider me an equal. I feel ashamed that our men’s game, followed and revered by millions of people, does not at the moment have a role model who feels comfortable enough to be openly gay and play a sport we all love.”Chelsea’s players can expect Enzo Maresca’s likely successor to take a dim view of dated macho dressing-room banter.Without action, we risk losing a generation of BAME coaches, 7 Dec 2017“I strongly believe the ethnic background of a coach doesn’t make a difference in their competence to do the job and nor does it influence their ability, so opportunities should be based solely on merit. However it is undeniable that players from ethnic backgrounds are vastly under-represented in high-level coaching positions. Coaching is more than just ‘knowing football’ – it is about having empathy and engagement with players while being able to relate them to them on a football, social and psychological level. In my career I’ve seen so many misunderstood young talents from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds struggle in our football culture and fall out of the game completely, where maybe a coach from a similar background could engage, empathise and motivate them to maximise their potential.”Do not be surprised to see Rosenior using his position to highlight the glaring under-representation of black managers and coaches in English football.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior, photographed in July 2017 during his playing days at Brighton.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianMichael Carrick, a canny midfield marvel who went underappreciated, 25 Jan 2018“When we show the next generation of young midfield players the art of receiving possession on the half turn, enabling your line of sight to open up the pitch so you know your next pass before you even receive the ball, there is no English player who has been as consistently good at this as Carrick. Nor one who has been able to play the ball quickly, with both feet, between the lines to attacking players with short incisive passes.”Michael Carrick’s status as a Rosenior hero highlights his penchant for midfielders who know how to take care of the ball.Give us a break: why a few days in the sun can be crucial for a season’s run-in, 22 Mar 2018“These trips can be crucial in terms of the rejuvenation of the physical capabilities of players – helping them to train and afterwards recover with the health benefits of Vitamin D from the sun. And perhaps more important is the opportunity for players to sit together, to have meals in a completely different environment and to have shared experiences as a group – something that, if done sensibly and within the boundaries of acceptable behaviour, can have remarkably positive results in the improvement of that vital, if intangible component, team spirit. I have been on mid-season breaks and sensed a complete change in the standard of performance both in training and matches.”Memo to Chelsea’s travel department: get a mid-season squad break in the sun sorted sharpish.Pragmatism and set plays could be decisive factor in World Cup success, 21 Jun 2018“The fact VAR has been incorporated for the first time has completely affected the way teams are defending corners and wide free-kicks, as is the fact more penalties are being awarded for shirt pulling and overly aggressive defending,. Psychologically you can see that defenders are more aware of this and I see this is leading to more and more chances coming from set plays, making the importance of organisation in these areas more crucial than ever.”These reflections made during the 2018 World Cup in Russia indicate quite clearly that Rosenior is a forward thinker, way ahead of thetactical curve and someone who will not underestimate the importance of free-kicks, corners and throw-ins during his time in west London.This is just the beginning, I promise you: an open letter to Donald Trump, 5 Jun 2020“You are the reason why my daughters – who are US citizens – ask me: ‘Why does the President hate black people? You are the catalyst for our future generations to impact lasting change, not only to your corroding country but countries all over the world, including here in the UK. You truly mirror the views and ideology of a group of people we must and will overcome.”Written against the backdrop of the USpresident’s attempts to crush protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd, Rosenior’s hope that Donald Trump might be an unwitting catalyst for overdue cultural global change was possibly a tad optimistic. Even so, he is clearly not thesort of manager who believesfootball and politics belong in separately-sealedboxes.Explore more on these topicsChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Celtic’s case, even the admission of an all-time blunder in hiring Wilfried Nancy would be unlikely to placate the masses. Remorse has not been forthcoming anyway. As Martin O’Neill’s return as manager was confirmed, office bearers took it in turn to express disappointment at the Nancy affair. Which was very good of them.Celtic do not have a monopoly on bad decision-making. It just currently feels as if that is the case. A club who have dominated in Scotland for more than a decade, who have vast resources and more scope to plan than others of much lower stature, should never have been seeking a fourth manager in one season. That they are points firmly towards a lack of strategy and direction. It is a preposterous situation. Celtic are lucky that O’Neill, 73, retains an appetite to work. He also ticks another box, that of being idolised in the stands.Wilfried Nancy sacked by Celtic after eight matches and 33 days in chargeRead moreIt took more than 40 days to hire Nancy,who duly lasted 33. He had no adequate credentials for this post and a one-dimensional outlook that failed even against moderate opposition in Scotland. Paul Tisdale, the head of football operations, is the sacrificial lamb. It was always extraordinary that an individual whose claim to fame is managing Exeter could be handed any degree of power at a club of Celtic’s size. Tisdale’s exit, like Nancy’s, will not trigger any tears. Far more intriguing is how Celtic ended up with such underwhelming personnel in key roles.A serious, functioning Celtic would have allowed Nancy to sign the new centre-forward and centre-back the team cravebefore Rangers visited. Available evidence suggests the outcome may have been no different – senior players were highly sceptical of Nancy from the outset – but this would have been a statement of intent. The decline of Celtic’s squad, once so rich in assets, is astonishing. Nancy needed to be pragmatic when instead he was an ideologue. His employers must have known thathiring a manager of this ilk in Decemberwould mean a significant January overhaul that suddenly has to take an entirely different form.Celtic’s season has been defined by statements rather than victories. The first, rambling in nature, blamed everything short of Magna Carta for woes in the summer transfer market. Brendan Rodgers wasberated in writing by Dermot Desmond, Celtic’s main shareholder, when departing in late October. The deeply personal nature of Desmond’s attack was classless, not least towards a manager who had delivered sustained success. Rodgers remains the highest calibre of coach Celtic could attract.Desmond’s son, Ross, caused furyat Celtic’s annual general meetingwith his defence of directors and criticism of fans. This occasion, brought to an unruly halt, was an embarrassment for all involved. When the chairPeter Lawwell resigned in Decemberdue to “abuse and threats”, Celtic’s followers were again placed in the spotlight. For Lawwell to walk away, the level of intimidation must have been severe. His interim replacement, Brian Wilson, joined Desmond Sr and the chief executive, Michael Nicholson, in welcoming O’Neill back. But missing, sorely missing, was proper detail of what led these people down the Nancy path. Without it, directors stand accused of replacing a manager simply because supporters are screaming in their faces.View image in fullscreenMartin O'Neill returns to Celtic for a second spell as interim manager this season following Wilfried Nancy’s dismissal.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAThose responsible for targeting Lawwell should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. He was an undoubted asset to the club. Yet there is a lingering danger that Celtic have confused extreme and outrageous behaviour with the attitudes of a silent majority. Plenty of sane, peaceful Celtic observers have legitimate concerns about the club’s direction. All those supporters want is for Celtic to be the best version of itself; instead, the club are staggering around in the dark. Nancy was a symptom of that. Someone, somewhere, has to act as the adult in the room and mend bridges between club and fanbase. It will not be Wilson, who has been on the board for two decades. O’Neill has enough on his plate. Celtic will never be in financial peril under Dermot Desmond but the Irishman or his son have to properly demonstrate they are progressive custodians for this football era.Celtic Park is a tired venue. This is a business which has a last reported £77m in the bank, which apparently finds it as difficult to upgrade facilities as it does to sign footballers. Nicholson makes himself available to nobody besides, very occasionally, an in-house media team. Celtic give the impression of being far too comfortable with being big fishes in a small pond.There are two bizarre elements to this. First, Celtic proved – in the exception to a recent rule – they could mix it with the best during last season’s Champions League. This offered reason to progress, not regress. A glitzy world beyond Scotland briefly seemed to appeal to a club otherwise obsessed with staying a few steps ahead of Rangers. It is also a reality that this hitherto miserable campaign is salvageable. Celtic could emerge from the league phase of the Europa League. A domestic double is feasible.Should these uplifting outcomes come to fruition, they would provide no justification for the pickle Celtic find themselves in. A reboot is desperately needed. An appropriate acknowledgment of failure around Nancy should be just the start.Explore more on these topicsCelticScottish PremiershipcommentShareReuse this content"

In the mixed doubles dead rubber, Neal Skupski and Olivia Nicholls defeated Despina Papamichail and Stefanos Sakellaridis 6-2, 3-6, 10-4.Emma Raducanu ruled out of United Cup opener in false start to new seasonRead moreRaducanu said she was frustrated with the defeat but satisfied with her performance: “Considering the circumstances, doubt whether I was going to play or not today, I’m pretty happy with how I was able to play a match of three sets,” she said. “Considering I played five, six games in practice, it is a big effort for me. I’m really proud of how I put myself out there, despite the scenario and situation.”In what has become a common theme in Raducanu’s career, the 23-year-old entered the stadium surrounded by doubts about her form and preparation after Sunday’s revelation that her foot injury had forced her off the court for most of the off-season.There were positives for Raducanu to take from the match – she moved well in the first two sets and as her competitive juices began to flow deep in the second set, she found her range, taking the ball early and producing some excellent shotmaking to force a third set against an impressive Sakkari. However, after giving herself a chance in the match, Raducanu flatlined in the final games while the Greek effortlessly maintained her intensity to close out her first win over the Briton in her fifth attempt.Later, Raducanu shed light on her physical struggles over the past five weeks. “I started hitting two weeks ago, so it’s been a good two and a bit months where I didn’t play. I did fitness. It’s been difficult to increase the load and add the unpredictability of the tennis. I think today, being able to produce that, having not played, is just giving me confidence to what I can do when I do practice more. I know now I just need to get my head down, keep working.”Raducanu had been hoping to follow up a solid 2025 season with a strong off-season. She said she simply had to accept her situation. “I think you have to just take it as it comes,” she said. “I went to Barcelona for two weeks, but wasn’t really able to play. I just did a lot of gym where I could, then started static hitting. I played my first points two days ago in practice. It’s been a very fast run path. Today was good exposure. Happy I spent two and a half hours out there and I’m OK right now. I just need to keep going. The season is still very, very young. Week one. There’s a long way to go.”Earlier Harris, ranked No 127, courageously took his big serve and forehand to Tsitsipas, serving excellently and constantly looking to dominate with his forehand. He pushed Tsitsipas throughout, but it was the Greek who served best and took control of the baseline in the final set tie-break to close out a much-needed win. “I’m glad that the level’s there against someone like that,” said Harris. “It gives me confidence going into the rest of the year. So yeah, no one likes to lose. I’ll take the positives, learn from the match, and hopefully come back stronger against good players again.”Explore more on these topicsTennisEmma RaducanunewsShareReuse this content"

There on the touchline, talk inevitably turned to his former roommate, housemate and teammate Joan García, now in goal for their greatest rivals. Carreras’s answer was just about audible over all the noise and then he was off again: he had something else to do before it all started, accepting a shirt marking his 100th game for Espanyol. Behind them as club legend Rafa Marañón presented it, the team captains lined up for a photo of their own with the first Catalan to referee this fixture in 80 years and, way off to the left out of shot, García clapped. Like everything else he did, except actually play, he did so discreetly.Joan and Jofre, both 24, have known each other “for as long as I can remember”, in Carreras’s words. Over four years, they shared a room at Espanyol’s residency on Carretera de Mataró in Sant Adrià del Besòs and then they shared an apartment. When García collected his award as Espanyol’s best player in 2023-24, and was handed a supply of sausages, Carreras also received an award – two different supporters’ clubs rewardingtwo different winners on the same day. When García started being noticed beyond Barcelona, Carreras declared his friend the world’s best. And when the summer heat got a bit much – and, boy, did it – García took refuge at Carreras’s. Now though they were opponents. And that, Carreras said, was “a bit strange”.European football: García back to haunt Espanyol as Barcelona go seven clearRead moreIt was also, it turned out, decisive: the difference in a derby that became even more about García than it was always going to be. What Carreras saw then, others saw on Saturday night when an astonishing performance from the goalkeeper he grew up with led Barcelona to a 2-0 victory, somehow unmoved amid all the mayhem. “In the end, that’s football,” Carreras had said, and in the end it was.Born in Sallent, 70km from Barcelona, García arrived at Espanyol’s residency shortly after his 15th birthday. Tall and daring, sometimes a little too daring, there was a touch of Casillas in his reflexes but with the physique and presence to dominate. Although he was as fast a learner as he was in the sprints where he left other keepers behind, it wasn’t always easy. There were two meniscus injuries. He had good goalkeepers ahead of him and early, isolated opportunities didn’t go well. His debuts, in 2021 in the cup and 2022 in the league, weren’t the kind you dream of. And yet, he would later say, it was probably better that way, a value in having errors to address and learning to live with them. Learning patience too.When Manolo González took over, the best thingthat happened to Espanyol in yearswas the best thing that could have happened to García too. That season insegundahe hadn’t played until March 2024; he played every game thereafter. Espanyol won promotion and in their first season back he was a revelation, salvation celebrated with the Espanyol badge brought to his lips.At which point, enter Barcelona. García had been at Espanyol a decade and his family were members: he knew leaving was one thing, natural enough, but that leaving forthemwas something else entirely, unforgivable. Speculation grew, the pressure too. “He feels Espanyol and I don’t think he will go there,” González said. “I’m not saying I’d cut off my hand if he did, but almost.” Yet in mid-June García became the first player to cross the Diagonal since Igor Korneev 31 years ago, although these days it’s not so much crossing the Diagonal as heading up it, beyond the city along the B20 and off at exit 16A towards Tarragona.Barcelona paid the buyout clause, nothing Espanyol could do. “I have to say goodbye to my home since I was 15,” García said, insisting that he would always “respect what I leave behind”, proud of leaving Espanyol inprimera. “I know it won’t be easy for everyone to understand,” he said, and he was right.View image in fullscreenJoan García plays in the derby, while Espanyol supporters hold flags picturing a red and blue rat.Photograph: Urbanandsport/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“Everyone chooses their path, what’s best for them,” Carreras said during Saturday’s warm-up and the money (€25m plus taxes) allowed Espanyol to renew Javi Puado’s contract, and keep Urko and Roberto, who were so vital in survival last season.Ty Dolan arrived too, and García’s replacement Marko Dmitrovic. Espanyol came into the derby in fifth having won five in succession. Which was one reason why Saturday’s meeting felt so big, a proper contest at last after two titles won and no games lost in 16 years at Espanyol, butthereason was García. Everything built around his return, the hostility supposedly awaiting him. “From love to hate, there’s often a single step,” El Mundo wrote. “More than a derby,” Sport called it, not exactly imaginatively. This, said Marca’s cover, was “a derby on fire”.Espanyol had put up nets to ensure that any missiles didn’t reach their former player, and called for calm. “Everyone is waiting for us to screw it up,” González lamented, so don’t let them. He also said that he remembered thepig’s head thrown at Luís Figo, so maybe hold off on the lessons in morality. “We’re not going to be coming with bunches of roses,” Espanyol’s coach said. “That’s normal; that’s rivalry.” Instead, Barcelona awoke with Espanyol posters up at bus stops and metro stations:Blue and white Barcelona, Anti-cule zone, the pride of Barcelona, Fucking Bar$a. They came with fake dollar bills, “Judas” García printed on them. They came with banners: one showed a beheading, most were emblazoned with rats. They carried cuddly rodents. They whistled García’s every move and literally called for his head.But García’s head is not for turning. However safe his hands and quick his feet, that might be the best part of him. Instead, he seemed to inhabit some place above the noise, the tension. “He’s a very calm guy; he prepared like always, very meticulous. He has so much confidence,” Jules Koundé said. García hadn’t said a word all week and didn’t now, yet he said it all. When Barcelona scored, Dani Olmo hitting a wonderful shot on 86 minutes and Robert Lewandowski adding a late second, he didn’t smile, didn’t react, but he had won.View image in fullscreenGarcía tips away another Espanyol effort.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersThe goals were fantastically set up by Fermin López but without García, Barcelona wouldn’t have got that far. A belting derby – the word “thanks” appeared 56 times in one 515-word report – was dominated by Espanyol, González proud of his team and his fans and unable to explain how they had lost. Except for, well,him. “Sorry, I’m not talking about Joan García,” he said, tired of having his words twisted. “What I think of Joan I’ve said here 50 times before.” What he had said was that just as Barcelona had Messi so Espanyol had García. And on Saturday night, for much of this season, that didn’t seem so far-fetched. His signing feels like a gamechanger, with 77% of shots stopped. Here, it was 100%. Seven from seven, five of them superb, on a night that was barely believable.“Mother of God almighty, what a goalkeeper!” Lamine Yamal posted. “Spectacular,” Fermin called him. “He’s amazing,” Olmo said. He had come “dressed as Superman” El Mundo Deportivo claimed, pants on the outside and everything. “Super Joan,” said Sport’s cover. He was “from science fiction”, El Periódico claimed. Poor Roberto could only look lost. Against a normal keeper, he might have had a hat-trick. They had been playing 20 minutes when he was clean through the first time, García stopping him. When the striker escaped after an hour, he did it again, twisting and launching at his feet. There was a flash at the near post, a swoop towards the far post. Another save led to an incredible stop that doesn’t even count as his but might just be the best. Seeing he couldn’t reach the rebound, García shoved Gerard Martín in the back, sending his own central defender flying in to block.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowRayo Vallecano 1-1 Getafe, Celta Vigo 4-1 Valencia, Osasuna 1-1 Athletic Club, Elche 1-3 Villarreal, Espanyol 0-2 Barcelona, Sevilla 0-3 Levante, Real Madrid 5-1 Real Betis, Mallorca 1-2 Girona, Alavés 1-1 Oviedo, Real Sociedad 1-1 Atlético MadridWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But it was one from a Pere Milla header, shifting in the air, throwing his arms out and somehow pushing over from a yard, that will linger longest, as good as any stop you’ll see. “That save’s one of the most important and lovely this season,” Koundé said; even more eloquent were the reactions of three opponents. Dolan was already celebrating; Carlos Romero stood in disbelief, waggling his fingers like he had trapped them in a drawer; Milla shook his head, approached García and gave him a gentle fist bump. Respect, you bastard. Seen that somewhere before.At the full-time whistle, sheet somehow kept clean, Dmitrovic – who made an astonishing save of his own – embraced him. “He’s a great kid,” the new Espanyol goalkeeper said. “He’s having a great season, even better than last year, which I didn’t know was possible. Another at this level and he’ll be the best in the world. I wish him all the luck in the world, except when we meet again.”As the two goalkeepers pulled apart and García headed towards the tunnel where his former flatmate waited, Hansi Flick grabbed him in a bear hug. “We didn’t deserve this win, I’ll be honest,” Barcelona’s coach said. “I have to say thank you to Joan García. His body language, his confidence, it’s fantastic, he gives us positive energy. I know he appreciates a lot and doesn’t forget everything that happened here: Manolo trusted him. He’s playing for us now and it’s unbelievable.”PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona1933492Real Madrid1924453Villarreal1718384Atletico Madrid1917385Espanyol183336Real Betis186287Celta Vigo184268Athletic Bilbao19-8249Elche1812210Getafe18-92111Sevilla18-52012Osasuna18-31913Alaves18-61914Rayo Vallecano18-71915Real Sociedad18-41816Mallorca18-61817Girona18-171818Valencia18-131619Levante17-91320Oviedo18-1912Explore more on these topicsBarcelonaLa LigaEuropean club footballEspanyolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nigeria, for at least two decades, have been a team that huffed and puffed, struggled with the weight of their own history and expectation, seemed always less than the sum of their parts. Even as they won the tournament in 2013, or got to the final in 2024, the sense of effort was palpable. Nothing came easily to them. They’re not meant to be a side who canter through last-16 ties.But on a foul night in Fez, though, the rain leaching across the stadium, Nigeria, inspired by Ademola Lookman, produced a performance of emphatic attacking quality and effectively had the game won with two goals before the half hour. Lookman put them ahead after 20 minutes with his third goal of the tournament, a typical finish into the top corner after a clever cutback from Akor Adams. Five minutes later, it was Lookman’s cross that Victor Osimhen turned in to make it 2-0. The same combination added a third two minutes into the second half, and whatever sliver of hope remained forMozambiquewas vanquished for good. Adams smashed in a fourth from yet another Lookman assist.Egypt 3-1 Benin (aet): Africa Cup of Nations last 16 tie – as it happenedRead moreFor Nigeria, some things remain always the same. The bonus dispute that led to the players refusing to train two days before their World Cup qualifying playoff against DR Congo seems to have faded away, but their coach Éric Chelle revealed shortly before the tournament that he has not been paid for three months. There have been the familiar rows as well about media access, a constant sense of background grumbling and disharmony.But on the pitch, it’s been a refreshingly unusual story. This has been a free-flowing Nigeria. They scored eight goals in winning all three group games but looked extremely open at the back, failing to keep a clean sheet. The win over Tunisia was perhaps the best example of that as Nigeria raced into a 3-0 lead only to be left clinging on as they conceded twice in the final 16 minutes. This, though, was a far more complete performance.It was, admittedly, only against Mozambique, who were playing in the knockout phase for the first time in their history and were outclassed. But it was far more impressive than Egypt’s performance earlier in the day: the Pharaohs needed extra time to see off Benin.They eventually won 3-1,Mohamed Salahgetting the third late in extra time, the first time he has scored three times in a single Cup of Nations. But this is still a side that is better in potential than in reality. Plenty of champions have developed as the tournament goes on but Egypt have a lot of improving to do if they are to add an eighth Cup of Nations title.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah seals Egypt’s place in the quarter-finals with their third goal.Photograph: Jalal Morchidi/EPAWhether Nigeria have sufficient defensive discipline against better sides remains open to question. But they certainly have the attacking capacity. Lookman, all pace and darting thrusts, a fine finisher and a fine crosser, and a player capable of scoring from range, has had an excellent tournament, operating as a No 10 behind Osimhen and Akor. Osimhen remains a top-class centre-forward, his movement and hold-up play exemplary. The way he took his first goal, getting over an awkward bounce to guide in a deft jab, was indicative of his intelligence as a finisher. It’s probably only his injury record that prevented any major western European club signing him in the big-man summer just gone; he remains at Galatasaray.Alex Iwobi is a player who divides opinion in Nigeria, in part because he’s been asked to play in pretty much every midfield role for the national team, creating a confused set of expectations. Here, on the left of the midfield three, his composure, positional play and distribution were highlighted, and he links up notably well with Lookman, who tends to drift left. With Brentford’s Frank Onyeka on the right of the midfield three, though, that leaves Wilfred Ndidi to shoulder a significant amount of the defensive burden.It’s a very attacking way of playing, very different to Chelle’s Mali side and very different to the Nigeria who ground their way through World Cup qualifying. This Nigeria is almost unrecognisable from the stodgy team beaten on penalties by DR Congo in that World Cup qualifying playoff. It’s an unsettling change. The relative underachievement of Nigeria in the Cup of Nations – just three titles for by far the most populous African nation, and one with a deep footballing tradition – is supposed to oppress their players, to hand them the heaviest shirts on the continent. And yet here they are playing with a gleeful abandon.Will it bring them the fourth title they have desired for so long, pulling them level with their great rivals Ghana? The defence remains a doubt. But they have the firepower and, for the first time in a long time, there is a simple pleasure in watching their attempt.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Nigeria football teamMozambiqueMohamed SalahEgypt football teamAfrica Cup of NationsBenin football teammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That was described by the family’s lawyers as “totally unacceptable, for a hearing due to start on 5 January”.A lawyer representing Sheffield United said the club “rejects wholeheartedly any suggestion of non-compliance”. The coroner agreed that the club had complied with what had been asked of them chronologically.The new date for the inquest may be pushed back further after Cusack’s former manager at Sheffield United, Jonathan Morgan, told the court he was unsure whether his wife had booked a holiday for early July, which would clash with some of the proposed dates. Morgan will be on a list of more than 20 people called to give evidence.The coroner said Morgan, who appeared at Chesterfield town hall via video link, must contact her office within 24 hours to clarify his holiday dates and that he would need to provide evidence if any holiday had been booked. In the meantime a 29 June start date was set, with up to two weeks allocated to complete the inquest.Morgan said he would be representing himself during the proceedings, despite repeatedly being reminded of offers of legal support and the options available to him, for example from a union such as the League Managers Association.Dean Armstrong KC, representing the family remotely on a video call, accused Sheffield United “for reasons that are frankly beyond us” of ignoring their requests to meet a specific timeline despite repeated emails sent in autumn 2025, adding with regards to the receipt of 699 pages on 15 December: “The family found themselves, already at the most difficult time in their lives, having to go through material at Christmas – we regard that as unacceptable. It’s upsetting. It’s clearly had an impact on the family’s health.”Joseph O’Brien KC, representing the club, rejected Armstrong’s words, saying via video: “His criticism of Sheffield United was wholly misplaced. We are very clear we have complied with everything that was required and within the spirit of trying to keep the hearing of 5 January as a live hearing.”It was agreed on Monday that no evidence is to be submitted after a deadline of the middle of May, six weeks before the new date, in an attempt to avoid a repeat and further delays.Armstrong described the delays as “extremely disappointing” because the “family are very keen to progress matters as soon as possible” and described it as a “hugely difficult time for them”.The coroner, Sophie Cartwright, said sorry multiple times to the family for the timeline and turned directly to speak to the Cusack family, saying: “You have been in my thoughts, particularly over Christmas.”Explore more on these topicsSheffield United WomenWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

And may him have mercy on you.”It is the second time in less than 12 months that the 26-year-old has been subjected to such abuse and Northumbria police have confirmed they have initiated an investigation that will involve their officers working in conjunction with the UK Football Policing Unit.“We are disgusted by racist abuse received by Joe Willock on Instagram on Sunday evening,” Newcastle said. “Following our win over Crystal Palace, Joe received several direct messages from an Instagram account that included racial slurs and deeply disturbing threats of violence towards Joe and his family. Sadly, Joe has faced this before. Each time we have acted quickly to support him and this has been our immediate priority again.“We have swiftly reported this material to the police and we will fully support any investigation to identify the person responsible and hold them accountable, wherever they are.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As Newcastle emphasise, the police are likely to hit brick walls unless Meta are prepared to reveal the private information needed to identify the Instagram user. “This can only happen with meaningful action from Meta, Instagram’s owners,” said Newcastle. “We urge Meta to give the police all the information they need to identify the perpetrator, and to do so quickly.“Removing content and applying message filters in not enough. Social media companies must do more to protect users and support the prosecution of those who seek to break the law on their platforms. We stand firmly with Joe and anyone else who faces this kind of abuse.”Richard Offiong, the campaign coordinator for Show Racism the Red Card, a leading anti-racism educational charity, said there was an urgent need for social media companies to do far more to stop racist abuse across their platforms.“Strong measures are needed to identify perpetrators quickly, remove harmful content and ensure those responsible face real consequences. Education, accountability and robust enforcement must go hand in hand if we are serious about tackling racism.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedMetaRacenewsShareReuse this content"

I think it speaks volumes that the prime minister has chosen not to come to this house to explain his decision.”View image in fullscreenLaw enforcement officials move Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, out of a helicopter in Manhattan on Monday.Photograph: Adam Gray/ReutersEd Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator, but that does not give President Trump a free pass for illegal action.”Starmer delivers masterclass in hedging his bets after Venezuela raidRead moreThe former Conservative foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned that the entire future of Nato could be at risk if western allies did not face down American threats to launch an attack onGreenlandnext.“If the new US approach extends to the annexation of Greenland – the sovereign territory of a Nato member – itcould mean the end of the alliancewith disastrous consequences.“So how much planning is going on at the Foreign Office to actually make sure such a disaster doesn’t happen? We understand the discussions between allies have to be in private, but what it looks like from the outside is that Europe is weak and divided.”The MPs’ frustrations were voiced after a tense day of international diplomacy in which Cooper spoke to both her US counterpart, Marco Rubio, and María Machado, the prominent Venezuelan opposition politician.Cooper told the Commons she had stressed the importance of international law in her conversation with Rubio, but would not say whether she saw the US action as illegal, saying it was for Washington to set out its justification.US foes and allies denounce Trump’s ‘crime of aggression’ in Venezuela at UN meetingRead moreStarmer spent much of the day preparing for a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” – the group of countries that are prepared to contribute to the long-term security of Ukraine. That group has been keen to keep Washington on side as it prepares for the possibility of a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.The prime minister said on Monday he wanted to “establish the facts” before passing judgment on whether Trump broke international law with the attack on Caracas.He did however mount arobust defenceof Denmark after Trump reiterated suggestions the US could annex Greenland.“Denmark is a close ally in Europe, it is a Nato ally,” he said. “It’s very important the future of Greenland is for the kingdom of Denmark and for Greenland, and only for Greenland and the kingdom of Denmark.”Those comments came hours after the Home Office minister, Mike Tapp, attracted criticism for refusing to say that the UK would defend Denmark over the future of Greenland.In broadcast interviews earlier on Monday, Tapp refused to directly criticise the idea of a US takeover of Greenland, telling Sky News: “Diplomacy is delicate, which means we’re not here to give a running commentary in the news.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpYvette CooperNicolás MaduroEmily ThornberryEd DaveyGreenlandnewsShareReuse this content"

I will stay in the system to carry out operations that continue to inflict maximum damage on the enemy. A strong, modern intelligence service is key to our state’s security.”Zelenskyy said that Malyuk, who was responsible for last year’s daring destruction of Russia’s strategic bombers,known as Operation Spiderweb, would be reassigned to overseeing unconventional warfare.He said: “I had a meeting with Vasyl Maliuk. I thanked him for his combat service and proposed that he focus on this line of work specifically.“There must be more Ukrainian asymmetric operations against the occupier and the Russian state and more solid results in eliminating the enemy.“This is where Vasyl is at his strongest, and this is exactly what he will continue to do within the Security Service of Ukraine.”Malyuk was lauded last June when a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles emerging from lorries struck strategic bombers on airfields deep inside Russia, causing an estimated $7bn in damage.His agency has also been credited with a series of assassinations of senior members of Russia’s military command.He had reportedly refused to stand down after a meeting with Zelenskyy on Saturday, prompting a range of voices, including the commander of Ukraine’s drone operations to call for his retention.It was argued that Malyuk’s removal would make Ukraine’s security services less effective. He reportedly rejected offers of a new role within the Foreign Intelligence Service or the National Security and Defense Council, which coordinates Ukraine’s security efforts with the president’s office.There remains confusion as to why Zelenskyy wanted Malyuk’s removal. The president has claimed that he needs fresh faces around him after four years of war.The Ukrainska Pravda newspaper, which boasts of sources close to Malyuk, reported that the spy chief’s dismissal was an act of revenge orchestrated by Andriy Yermak, the president’s former chief of staff.Yermak’s apartment was searched as part of an anti-corruption operation in November. He subsequently resigned, although he was never formally accused of wrongdoing.Others within the government believe that Zelenskyy has an eye on the next presidential election and is keen to clear the decks of prominent and popular figures.Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who had been talked up as a possible successor to Zelenskyy, was dismissed from his position as head of Ukraine’s army in 2024.He was appointed as ambassador to the UK where he has kept a low profile.Malyuk has been temporarily replaced by Maj Gen Yevhen Khmara, who was head of the SBU’s elite Alpha special operations unit.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It said 29 protesters, four children and two members of Iran’s security forces have been killed.The semiofficial Fars news agency reported late Monday that some 250 police officers and 45 members of the Guard’s all-volunteer Basij force have been hurt in the demonstrations.A switch in the system of foreign exchange subsidies announced by Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, may lead to a short-term rise in food prices, but is intended to be ameliorated by a new system of direct subsidies to consumers. Previously the subsidies were given to those importing products from abroad through exchange rate subsidies. But the decade-old system was wide open for corruption and leakage.Official figures released on Monday showed that inflation had reached 52.6% in December. Inflation, and a collapse in the value of the rial, led to the protests that began in Tehran’s bazaar, but have now spread to more than 100 towns and cities, including many smaller towns. Police were seen entering the University of Birjand in the south-east of Iran, arresting students inside one of the largest universities in the east of Iran.The promise of economic reforms were made as the head of Iran’s judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said the period of “concessions and appeasement” to the protesters were over. Ejei accused the United States and Israel of openly and officially supporting the “chaos” in Iran and said that because of this support, “the rioters should know that if concessions were made in previous periods, there will be no more such concessions and appeasements”.Donald Trump again vowed the US would come to the defence of the protesters if they were attacked, vowing that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters” the US “will come to their rescue”. The Iranian foreign ministry accused Trump of “psychological warfare” on the Iranian people.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Tehran on 29 December.Photograph: undefined/APBut leaders of the Reform Front – the movement with which Pezeshkian is associated – demanded action against those in the security services accused of chasing and firing on protesters inside the Imam Khomeini hospital in Malekshahi, Ilam province.Azar Mansouri, writing on the X social network, described the incident as “a disaster”. She urged: “As soon as possible and with justice, address the tragedy that occurred in Malekshahi, Ilam. Identify the perpetrators, introduce them to the public, and bring them to justice so that this wound can heal a little.”According to reports on social media, security forces had opened fire on protesters.Understanding the scale of this latest round of protests has been difficult. Iranian state media has provided little information about the demonstrations. Online videos offer only brief, shaky glimpses of people in the streets or the sound of gunfire. Journalists in Iran also face limits on reporting in general such as requiring permission to travel around the country, as well as the threat of harassment or arrest by authorities.But the protests do not appear to be stopping, even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday said “rioters must be put in their place.”On Monday António Guterres, the secretary general of the UN, called on Iran to respect demonstrators’ right to “protest peacefully”.Guterres “underscores the need to prevent any further casualties”, his spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said. “He also calls on the authorities to uphold the right of freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly” and that “all individuals must be allowed to protest peacefully and express their grievances”.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claimed the protests had expanded dramatically, adding: “We may well be at a defining moment, a moment when the Iranian people take their destiny in their own hands.” Many such predictions have been made in the past, only for the theocracy to survive.Iran’s future may turn on whether within the confines of continued US economic sanctions, policymakers can find enough room for manoeuvre to tackle corruption, stabilise the currency, reduce inflation and remove the levels of state intervention holding back industrial production. The frequent industrial shut downs caused by electricity and water shortages is also hampering production.In remarks on 1 January, Pezeshkian said he was abolishing the system of preferential foreign exchange rates, a complex system of distorting subsidies that he said fuelled corruption and failed to help the poor. Pezeshkian explained: “We are not removing subsidies, we are delivering them to the final consumers.”Fatemeh Mohajerani, his spokesperson, said on Monday: “It is evident that by ending or reducing subsidised and preferential official foreign currency exchange rates, the prices of some items will rise.”Revisions to the budget being examined by the parliament include pay rises of up to 43% instead of 20%, a cut in value-added tax to 10% from 12%, and the allocation of $8.8bn in subsidised foreign exchange to curb price rises for basic goods.The budget will earmark funds for guaranteed wheat purchases to supply bread and for adjusting pensioners’ salaries.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is about five metres deep and measures about eight metres by eight metres, according to the State Emergency Service.No injuries have been reported but the area has been cordoned off, with the public warned to avoid the site.The North East Link’s website shows that the project’s two boring machines, named Zelda and Gillian, are located north of the oval.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe construction consortium delivering the infrastructure project, Spark, has taken control of the site to undertake assessments, Banyule city council said on Tuesday morning.The council, which takes in Heidelberg, said it was aware of a sinkhole at the reserve and warned people to avoid the area until further notice.“For everyone’s safety,VictoriaPolice have cordoned off the affected area,” the council said in a social media post on Monday evening.Last February, an 18-metre deep sinkhole that emerged near Zelda and Gillian, close tothe worksite at Lower Plenty, halted tunnelling on the project.The two boring machines are operated 24 hours a day by a crew of up to 20 people, the project’s website says.The North East Link will connect the Eastern Freeway at Bulleen with the Metropolitan Ring Road at Greensborough.The road will stretch 10km and include 6.5km of tunnels.The government estimates the North East Link will take about 15,000 trucks off local roads each day and reduce travel times by up to 35 minutes.It is expected to open in 2028.A North East Link spokesperson said it was aware of a surface hole in Heidelberg, which “is in the vicinity of our tunnelling operations”.“The area has been secured and crews are closely monitoring the site and surrounding areas – and we strongly advise people to avoid the area while investigations into the cause are under way,” the spokesperson said.“No injuries have been reported and there is no immediate threat to the community or residential properties.”Explore more on these topicsVictoriaMelbourneShareReuse this content"

Essentially, all I ever heard from was people objecting to them.” That was the view of a former UK MP who took part in new research that reveals how significantly British and Belgian politicians underestimate the public’s support for climate action.From solar power and energy efficiency to meat taxes and frequent flyer levies, the politicians consistently failed to appreciate people’s appetite for policies that tackle global heating. The misapprehension has real world consequences: those politicians were less willing to vote for or speak up for those policies, according to the study.The good news was that when a group of the politicians were told the true level of polling support for some policies, this improved their estimates of support for other green policies. However, it did not correct the underestimates completely, indicating that the information the politicians used to form their views of public opinion are misleading.“Based onrecent research, I think some of these issues with the information environment has to do with a rightwing bias where the voices of conservative leaning members of the public tend to be overrepresented, for a range of systemic reasons,” says Lisa-Maria Tanase, an academic at the University of Cambridge who led the research. “They tend to be more privileged, educated and politically engaged segments of society.” Anti-climate disinformation from lobby groups also contributes, she says.A huge89% majority of the world’s people want stronger actionto fight the climate crisis, studies have shown, but are trapped in a self-fulfilling “spiral of silence” because they mistakenly believe they are in a minority. Making people aware that their pro-climate view is, in fact, by far the majority could unlock a social tipping point and help push leaders into the climate action so urgently needed,experts have said.‘Spiral of silence’: climate action is very popular, so why don’t people realise it?Read moreHowever, while the views of the public have been widely studied, relatively little was known about the extent to which lawmakers underestimate support for climate action. To address this, Tanase surveyed 100 current UK MPs, broadly reflecting the current political spread in parliament, and more than 600 Flemish politicians in Belgium.The UK MPs were asked in early 2025 to estimate the level of public support for green policies and their answers were compared with an Ipsos poll of the public that asked the same questions. When asked about a tax on frequent fliers and taxes to reflect how environmentally friendly products are, the MPs thought only a minority supported them, when a majority actually did: the MPs underestimated support by about 15 percentage points.They also underestimated public support for a tax on red meat and dairy products by 18 percentage points and for grants or loans to help people to make their homes more energy-efficient by seven.Graphic showing the extent to which UK politicians underestimate support for green measuresEven when told that the members of the public surveyed had also received a clear description of the personal costs of the climate policies, MPs still significantly underestimated support. “They are perhaps overly pessimistic about the impact of costs” on public support, said Tanase. She was recently awarded a PhDfor the research, which is in the process of being published in a prominent journal.“We saw these misperceptions had direct consequences on climate policy progress,” Tanase added. “Our data showed that when the UK MPs believed there was insufficient support for some of the policies, they were less willing to speak up in support of the policy. In the Belgian case, they were less likely to vote for the policy in the local parliament.”Tanase also interviewed former UK MPs: “They said one of the key barriers to them implementing stronger climate action is the fact that the public, in their opinion, was simply not ready. Due to these misperceptions, even willing politicians who want to do more felt their hands were tied.”The much larger group of Belgian politicians meant that Tanase could test whether revealing the true level of public support helped change their misperceptions by a statistically significant amount. In this experiment, the politicians’ answers were compared with those from a poll by the University of Antwerp. Both the politicians and members of the public were from Flanders, a region in north Belgium.For policies to increase taxes on short-haul airline tickets and to prevent local authorities blocking windfarms, the Belgian politicians also thought only a minority of the public supported them, when in fact a majority did, underestimating the support by about 25 percentage points. Similar results were found for subsidising solar panels and pricing products according to their environmental impacts.When the politicians were informed of the true level of support, their estimates of support for further green policies they were asked about were 10 percentage points higher than those in a control group. However, even after these interventions, the politicians still underestimated public support by about seven percentage points, so the misperceptions were not dispelled completely.Graphic showing the extent to which Belgian politicians underestimate support for green measures“The interventions are competing in an information environment where the politicians are being bombarded with conflicting information and loud opposition,” Tanase said. They told her that in gauging public opinion, they most trusted direct interactions with citizens from their constituencies and their letters, a finding supported byearlier research. “The people more likely to engage with politicians are very specific types politically – they don’t necessarily represent the majority,” she said.Underestimating support for climate action limits political decision making, study saysRead moreOne senior policymaker Tanase spoke to said: “It is plausible that politicians are influenced by the fact that they hear much more from those who stand to lose from green policies than from those who stand to gain.” Other studies have found politicians tend tooverrate the public popularityofrightwing policies.Furthermore, said Tanase: “There is intentional disinformation – there’s a lot of people who have an interest in climate support being muted. There’s a lot of fake news and sensational headlines that we hear and that the MPs will also hear.”Tanase has already engaged with policymakers in the UK and EU, and prompted a study of perception gaps among MPs in Denmark. She said increasing awareness of the problems in the information environment can make people – including politicians – less vulnerable to misperceptions.“Showing there is stronger support than assumed could give encouragement that there is public backing [for climate action] and that it’s politically viable,” she said.Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsThe 89% projectClimate crisisRenewable energyEnergyMeat industryAirline emissionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is also the setting of a swathe of wooded land known asLa Petite-Nation, which, although not far from the cities of Montreal and Ottawa, remains relatively untouched.That, however, is to change with the arrival of a controversial graphite mine with financing from the Pentagon.Lomiko Metals, a company based in British Columbia, is planning to build an open-air graphite mine in La Petite-Nation. Once operational, the mine will produce 100,000 tonnes of graphite per year for 15 years.Since the mine was first announced eight years ago, many residents have opposed the project over environmental concerns and fears it will threaten the growing eco-tourism economy. Open-air graphite mines produce dust emissions that can pollute the air and water.The opposition only became more pronounced once the United States became involved.“At first, the project was sold to us as a green one, for energy transition,” said Louis St-Hilaire, the president of the La Petite-Nation Lakes Protection Group, a coalition of 10 lake protection associations in the region that oppose the mine. While there was apprehension towards the project, residents also understood the importance of needing graphite to produce lithium-ion batteries.View image in fullscreenThe Riviére de la Petite Nation (Little Nation River), Quebec, Canada.Photograph: Andrei Filippov/AlamyThen, in 2024, the Pentagon announced it would invest $8.3m in the project through the Defense Production Act investment programme, which aims to ensure the availability of resources needed for national defence.That came alongside a$20m grantto build a cobalt refinery in Ontario – the first large investment since the second world war – and $6.4m to build a bismuth and cobalt project in the Northwest Territories. “Suddenly, the main big investor is the American army, who need a lot of graphite,” said St-Hilaire. “People want that even less.”David Pharand, the mayor of Duhamel, one of the towns near the mine, said: “It’s like David taking on Goliath. We thought it was going to be a lost cause, but the army’s involvement really got residents to care even more about stopping the mine.”In August 2025, a referendum showed that 95% of the people in the communities surrounding the mine opposed the project.The US involvement in the project comes as Washington seeks to end its dependence on China for critical minerals, said Ben Steinberg, the spokesperson for the Battery Materials & Technology Coalition, a trade group. The military needs graphite not just to produce batteries, but for use in military components that need extreme heat resistance and durability. Most graphite, both natural and synthetic, is produced in China.“China has the ability to suppress and manipulate the graphite market,” said Steinberg. “[So] we have all the interest in the world to be working, between the United States andCanada, to exploit this resource and utilise it for all these important things.”The relationship between Canada and the United States, however, has become more fraught than it was when the funding was first announced by the Biden administration. Canadians have not forgotten about Donald Trump’s threats to turn the country into the 51st state. To Jean-François Desmarais, who leads one of the groups opposing the mine, allowing the American military to exploit Canadian resources feels ironic. “They’re coming in to get minerals to put in their weapons, to annex us?”It remains unclear how the ongoing trade disputes between Canada and the United States will impact mining collaborations. The Trump administration has also moved away from prioritising renewable energy, although Steinberg said he did not believe that would impact Pentagon funding. “When it comes to critical minerals, the majority of the projects that were done in the Biden administration will continue if the projects are viable,” he said.And despite local opposition, the mine project is still moving ahead. While the provincial government has stated that it will not fund the project given the lack of social acceptance to the mine, the federal government has shown no signs of pulling its funding. Lomiko Metals has already started processing samples from the site.But local communities are still working on alternative projects that focus on sustainable development. “We have a wildlife reserve and a provincial park right here, and they are getting more and more visitors every year,” said Pharland. “I think people don’t understand why we would hurt this growth in favour of a mine that will run out of resources in 15 years.”Lomiko Metals did not respond to requests for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

A number of flights have been cancelled and several rail services are experiencing disruption.Affected areas are expected to experience heavy snowfall and travel disruption, with reports of depths reaching 34cm in Loch Glascarnoch in the Scottish Highlands, while Dyce in Aberdeenshire and Altnaharra in Sutherland, recorded 27cm of snow, according to the Met Office. The agency has warned that rural communities could become cut off as a further 10cm of snow may accumulate in low-lying areas, with up to 20-30cm settling on higher ground.Transport across Scotland is expected to be severely affected. Network Rail Scotland has warned that heavy and drifting snow is likely to prevent trains from running until at least midday on routes including Aberdeen-Dundee, Aberdeen-Inverness, Inverness-Wick/Thurso and Inverness-Kyle of Lochalsh.Yellow weather warnings have been issued for parts of England,WalesandNorthern Ireland, including the east coast and south-west, with much of Wales expected to experience cold and icy conditions.

Loganair cancelled flights from Aberdeen and Inverness after heavy snowfall, while Liverpool John Lennon airport said at 8am that its runway was closed due to wintry conditions and that some flights were subject to delays and cancelations.The extreme cold has led to travel disruption between the UK and the rest ofEurope. Eurostar has advised passengers planning to travel between London and the Netherlands to postpone their journeys, as services beyond Brussels had been cancelled.In Northern Ireland, 186 schools have closed, affecting thousands of pupils, amid widespread travel disruption. The government website NI Directprovided a listof the affected schools.The principal of St Patrick’s and St Brigid’s College in Claudy, County Derry, said ice, snow and weather warnings made it too risky to open on Monday. “It is very, very bad,” Philip McCullagh told BBC Radio Ulster. “It will take a long time for us to clear our site but also the footpaths as well. It’s as bad as I’ve seen it.”Several flights were cancelled at Belfast City and Belfast international airports. Translink, which operates public transport services in NorthernIreland, warned of delays to bus routes, with some services operating on main roads only.The Police Service of Northern Ireland advised motorists to take extra care: “Clear your windscreen of ice and snow before you set off on your journey, and remember to slow down and increase the distance between you and the vehicle ahead.”In Ireland, yellow weather warnings for ice and snow have been issued across all counties, with Met Éireann warning of “treacherous travel conditions”.View image in fullscreenSnowy train tracks in Whitby, Yorkshire, on Saturday.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThe UK Health Security Agency has also issued amber warnings for all areas inEngland, which will remain in force until 10am on Friday.The Scottish transport secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said: “We’ve already seen challenging conditions and freezing temperatures, with more snow and ice on the way for the same areas.“For many, Monday marks a return to work from the festive break. If you have to travel then please ensure your vehicle is winter-ready and have a winter kit in your car. Follow Police Scotland travel advice. If you can delay your journey until the amber warning has expired, please do so.“I’d also like to thank all the frontline staff such as gritter drivers, chainsaw gangs, police officers and many others who have been out working in dreadful conditions these past few days and over the next 48 hours.”The RAC has advised to drive only if making essential trips. Its spokesperson, Rod Dennis, urged drivers to take extreme care, especially on roads that had not been gritted and to allow extra time to fully de-ice and de-mist vehicles, leave plenty of space behind the vehicle in front and to allow more time to stop.He added that, given the risk of breakdowns in freezing conditions, drivers should carry “warm, waterproof clothing, sturdy footwear, a hot drink in a flask, and a power bank to keep your phone charged”.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherScotlandWalesEnglandIrelandEuropeNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

It means that public-sector employees whose work is managed by the Scottish government will get a day off, with the decision at the discretion of other employers.Scotland men’s national team will play their first fixture against Haiti on Sunday 14 June, with a kick-off at 2am UK time. This will be followed by other late-night starts at 11pm, including against Brazil, who beat Scotland 2-1 in Scotland’s last World Cup outing back in 1998.The significant time difference, as well as the expense of tickets precluding travel for many fans, has prompted industry calls for extended pub opening hours and fan zones on the days Scotland are playing.Swinney said: “Scotland qualifying for the men’s World Cup was a remarkable achievement and a landmark moment, and the reaction to the dramatic win against Denmark reminded us all what football means to the country.“This year, we want to make the most of this huge opportunity for Scotland and ensure as many people as possible have the opportunity to celebrate the team’s success.“Not only is this an historic sporting event, it’s also a chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, create tourism interest within the country and to make cultural and sporting connections.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandWorld Cup 2026World CupJohn SwinneynewsShareReuse this content"

Your actions totally disrespect the memories of all those persons who have fallen.“It’s a sad reflection upon you that you chose to do such a thing on a very difficult day for so many.”The court heard that Carley, of Harlech, in north Wales, had worn a uniformmeant to resemble that of a Royal Navy admiral, despite never holding such a rank in the armed forces, at a Remembrance Sunday event in Llandudno on 9 November 2025.Carley had attended the event in a uniform he later told police had been legitimately issued to him as a cadet years ago, but that he had customised it with medals bought online and rear admiral rings he had paid a tailor to add.At the event, Carley had been seen walking in formation to the war memorial, saluting the memorial and walking away. Suspicion arose after photos and videos of Carley dressed as an admiral appeared online, despite Llandudno town council, which organises the event, confirming no one of that rank had been due to attend the ceremony.According to James Neary, prosecuting, Carley wore medals from conflicts such as Iraq and Syria, and had even approached organisers to introduce himself and chat. He also walked alongside a genuine veteran of the armed forces while they laid a wreath.When police approached Carley he was reported to have told the arresting officers: “I’ve been expecting you.” He later told them he had faked his seniority as a member of the armed forces because he wanted a sense of “belonging and affirmation” and claimed that “anything I did was done with the utmost respect”.Mark Haslam, Carley’s lawyer, described the case as “very sad” and claimed that Carley had “ongoing” mental and physical health issues, and that he had been “publicly humiliated” for his actions.“He wanted to be a part of the proceedings, but he accepts through me that his way of playing a part was totally inappropriate,” Haslam told the court.“He should never have been in that position, wearing the uniform or the medals. He has accepted that from the outset.“He seriously underestimated the anxiety, anger and distress that his actions have caused a large number of people. He no longer does so.”Explore more on these topicsWalesRemembrance DayMilitaryRoyal NavynewsShareReuse this content"

He also indicated not guilty pleas.He was granted conditional bail to appear at Oxford crown court on 5 February, where he will be asked to formally enter pleas to the charges.Spencer-Churchill, the former Marquess of Blandford, became the 12th Duke of Marlborough after inheriting the title from his father, John Spencer-Churchill, who died in 2014 aged 88. He married Edla, his second wife, in 2002 but they separated in 2024.Blenheim, the family’s ancestral home, is Winston’s Churchill’s birthplace.The duke does not own the 18th-century baroque palace and estate, which was given by Queen Anne to the first Duke of Marlborough in 1704.

It may take one or two years for the tragic consequences to become clear, but this is like asking farmers in North Dakota to grow pineapples. It won’t work and can’t end well,” he said.The revised vaccine schedule will look similar to that of Denmark’s, though there are a few differences.“Because this is coming from HHS, the public, who is only so hooked into this, will say that ‘maybe these aren’t such a big deal. I can reasonably choose not to get a vaccine, and it’s burdensome to get a vaccine, so great,’” Offit said. “Now we’ll just see this continue to worsen.”The US is on the cusp of losing its measles elimination status amid the biggest outbreak in three decades. There have been more tetanus cases in the past year than more than in a decade, and more pertussis deaths than the US has seen in years.Nearly 300children died from the flu last year, and several more have died this flu season.The fact that Kennedy is changing the recommendation for the flu vaccine “in the midst of a very bad flu season tells you who he is, which is someone who is so virulently anti-vaccine that he’s willing to ignore all the harm that is occurring around him”, Offit said.Donald Trump in December ordered changes to the immunization schedule to be more like peer countries. ​​Trump directed Kennedy and the CDC to review vaccine recommendations from “peer, developed countries” and “update the United States core childhood vaccine schedule to align with such scientific evidence and best practices” from them.”This move, experts note, puts the US out of step with other nations which routinely recommend the shots.The announcement could open up the US government for lawsuits from parents who are no longer able to access the vaccines, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine law expert at UC Law San Francisco.The decision was not made in a transparent way, she said, and the advisory committee on immunizations hasn’t been consulted. The change will likely bring confusion among providers and parents, Reiss added: “The fact that we’ll see some providers follow this in some way will decrease vaccine coverage.”Officialssaythe vaccines would still be covered by key programs such as Vaccines for Children, a federal program that provides vaccines to more than half of all kids in the US. Continuing to cover the program makes it less likely that parents will sue on the grounds of being affected by an arbitrary and capricious decision, Reiss said.Previously, officials have said that vaccines under shared clinical decision-making would also still qualify for the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which settles claims for rare but major side effects from most vaccines.But Offit doubted that Kennedy would follow through on that promise.‘She has no expertise’: the US medical community girds for Tracy Beth Høeg’s tenure at the FDARead more“I don’t believe him,” he said. “I think that his goal ultimately is to shake up the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program so he can continue to make himself and his personal injury lawyer friends richer.”Reiss noted that there is “legal uncertainty on whether vaccines that are under shared clinical decision making are covered by VICP”. She believes vaccines could not be removed from the compensation program without going through the usual rule-making process.“But Kennedy isn’t necessarily law-abiding on this, so he might try to do it anyway,” she said, before noting that a change like that could force vaccine makers from the US market and significantly decrease access to shots.Reiss also said she’s worried about “political pressure on states to remove recommended vaccines from school mandates”. The federal government has never mandated vaccines for any children. Instead, those decisions are made at the state and local level. Officials could pressure states to change their school vaccine recommendations now that they are not fully recommended by US health agencies.“There’s a number of funding sources that they could tie to remove school vaccine mandates if you want federal funding,” Reiss said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The building had before then served as the Palestinian mission to the UK.The embassy’sflag-raising ceremony on 22 Septemberwas attended by MPs, ambassadors and a couple of hundred members of the public. Last month,Zomlot called for “comprehensive protection” of the embassyafter it was targeted by masked men waving Israeli flags and union jacks. The building was defaced with stickers such as “I love the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]”, according to images captured by security cameras.On Monday, Zomlot said Britain’s recognition of the Palestinian state was the result of “100 years of relentless struggle”, but added that he felt “the shadow that hangs over us today” as people in Gaza were “living in hell”.Gaza’s health ministry says 422 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire took effect in October after two years of conflict. Most of the territory is in ruins, with its population of more than 2 million people living mainly in makeshift homes or damaged buildings in areas where Israeli forces withdrew.Monday’s ceremony also heard from Obaidah, a 14-year-old Palestinian refugee wounded during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza last year and evacuated to the UK for medical treatment.Saying he hoped one day to become a Palestinian ambassador, Obaidah added: “Having the embassy in the United Kingdom is very meaningful. It is a place where our people are seen, where our voices are heard, and where our hope for justice and dignity lives.”Explore more on these topicsPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policyLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Eighty-three people were still in hospital being treated for severe burns.View image in fullscreenFlags at half-mast at Eynard Palace in Geneva on Monday.Photograph: Salvatore Di Nolfi/EPAThe last of the 40 people who died in the fire – who included 21 Swiss nationals, nine French citizens including two with dual nationality, six Italians, and one person each from Belgium, Portugal, Romania and Turkey –were identified on Sunday.Authorities have not yet released the names of the victims, although several have been publicly identified by their families. They were between 14 and 39 years old, but were overwhelmingly young: 20 were minors, and the average age was 19.The bodies of five of the six dead Italian nationals were being repatriated on Monday. Four Swiss police officers carried each coffin on to an Italian transport plane in the military area of Sion airport, about 16 miles (25km) from Crans-Montana.The plane was due to land at Milan airport late on Monday, where the bodies of Achille Barosi and Chiara Costanzo from Milan, Giovanni Tamburi from Bologna and Emanuele Galeppini from Genoa would be received by officials and relatives.It would then fly on to Rome with a coffin containing the body of Riccardo Minghetti, the Italian government said. The sixth Italian victim, Sofia Prosperi, lived inSwitzerlandand would be buried there.View image in fullscreenThe coffin of Riccardo Minghetti arrives in Italy on Monday.Photograph: Francesco Fotia/AGF/Shutterstock“We have pledged to do everything we can, in conjunction with Swiss authorities,” said Gian Lorenzo Cornado, Italy’s ambassador to Switzerland. “We will follow the investigation closely so the truth is known as quickly as possible and justice served.”Pressure was mounting for answers as to how the fire could have happened. Authorities are investigating the bar’s owners, the French nationals Jacques and Jessica Moretti, on suspicion of crimes including homicide by negligence.The married couple have not so far been placed under arrest and are not seen as a flight risk, the public prosecutor has said. But the Swiss tabloid Blick on Monday demanded to know “why the couple running the bar are still free”.‘It has hit us very hard’: grief grips Crans-Montana as police identify more victimsRead moreIn a social media post, Italy’s far-right deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, said there had been a failure to ensure the bar’s basement was safe, adding that “in civilised Switzerland, the prison gates will have to open for quite a few people”.Tages-Anzeiger, another Swiss newspaper, said questions remained to answered about age checks at the bar, the soundproofing material used in the basement and the standards governing the use of the sparklers, so-called “Bengal fountains”.Jacques Moretti has said Le Constellation had been checked three times in 10 years and that everything had been done according to the rules, and local officials in Crans-Montana have said no concerns had been raised or defects reported.The municipality has given investigators all documents relevant to the investigation and joined the criminal proceedings as a civil party. “This will allow [the town council] to actively contribute to establishing all the facts,” it said.The town will hold a memorial ceremony on Friday honouring the victims. The French government said on Monday that the president, Emmanuel Macron, would attend.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsCrans-Montana fireSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He was 75.Schumacher’s daughter, Emily Joy Schumacher, confirmed Monday that her father died on 29 December. She did not provide the cause of death.Schumacher produced such varied biographies as Francis Ford Coppola: A Filmmaker’s Life; Crossroads: The Life and Music of Eric Clapton; and Dharma Lion: A Biography of Allen Ginsberg – a prominent beat generation poet and writer.Other biographies included Mr Basketball: George Mikan, the Minneapolis Lakers & the Birth of the NBA and Will Eisner: A Dreamer’s Life in Comics. Eisner was one of the earliest cartoonists to work in US comic books and was a pioneer of the graphic-novel concept.Though he was born in Kansas, Schumacher lived most of his live in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He studied political science at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, but left the school just one credit short of graduating, his daughter said. He gravitated toward writing at a young age, she said, and basically built two writing careers – one focused on biographies and another on Great Lakes lore.Living on the shores of Lake Michigan in Kenosha, Schumacher produced accounts of how the freighter Edmund Fitzgerald sank during a storm on Lake Superior in 1975; a November 1913 storm that claimed the lives of more than 250 Great Lakes sailors; and how four sailors fought to survive on Lake Michigan after their ship sank in a storm in 1958.Emily Joy Schumacher described her father as “a history person” and “a good human”. She said he worked longhand, filling countless flip notebooks and later transcribing them on a typewriter. She said she still remembers the sound of the keys clacking.“My dad was a very generous person with people,” Emily Joy Schumacher said. “He loved people. He loved talking to people. He loved listening to people. He loved stories. When I think of my dad, I think of him engaged in conversation, coffee in his hand and his notebook.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsWisconsinnewsShareReuse this content"

Modella said in a statement that the climate on UK high streets was “extremely challenging” and data suggested “an alarming drop-off in pre-Christmas footfall”.It said administration was the “only option” for both Claire’s and The Original Factory Shop, and it had started insolvency proceedings for both chains.‘I wanted it all’: Claire’s shoppers on what the store has meant to themRead moreThe investment group has 154 Claire’s stores after buying about half the UK chain from administrators in September last year. It is understood that the advisory firm Kroll is lined up to handle the proposed administration, which would affect about 1,350 jobs at the accessories and ear-piercing chain.The 140-store cut-price homewares chain The Original Factory Shop, which was bought by Modella less than a year ago from the private equity group Duke Street Capital, has filed a notice with the high court to appoint administrators. About 1,200 jobs are at risk.The move, under which the advisory firm Interpath would be appointed, gives the company 10 days’ protection from creditors while negotiations on its future continue.Modella said on Monday: “This has been a very tough decision. We have worked intensively in an effort to save both businesses, having made last-ditch attempts to rescue them, but neither has a realistic possibility of trading profitably again.“A combination of very weak consumer confidence, highly adverse government fiscal policies and continued cost inflation is causing many established and much-loved businesses to suffer badly.”The likely administration comes only six months after a restructure under which The Original Factory Shop’s head office and distribution centre shifted from Burnley to Bolton and it agreed rent cuts on a number of stores.The company has been struggling for some time and made a £5.6m pre-tax loss in the year to 31 March 2024 as sales slid 1% to £117.5m despite high inflation in 2023 and into 2024.Modella snapped up Hobbycraft in August 2024 and closed a number of outlets in a restructure last spring.The decision to call in administrators at Claire’s and The Original Factory Shop, first reported by Sky News, emerged just days after the small upmarket fashion chain LK Bennettfiled an application with the high courtto appoint an administrator to the business, which employs about 280 staff.Retailers are facing higher costs and a tough consumer environment as household budgets have come under pressure from higher energy and food bills, while concerns about the economic and global political environment have prompted those with spare cash to increase their savings.A warm autumn and start to the winter has also affected fashion retailers in the UK with the latest Worldpanel by Numerator UK clothing survey, previously known as Kantar, indicating fashion sales fell 1.4% in the four weeks to 7 December.This week the leading UK fashion retailers Next and Marks & Spencer will reveal how they have fared. Their superior online service teamed with a large chain of high street outlets mean they are likely to have taken share in a tough market.Explore more on these topicsRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t fully agree, but I get it | Devi SridharRead moreNovo, which is known for its hit Wegovy and Ozempic injections for obesity and diabetes respectively, said the launch “opens new possibilities for the more than 100 million Americans living with obesity”.Self-paying patients can buy the pill for $5 (£3.70) a day, or $149 a month, for the starting dose of 1.5mg. Apart from being more affordable, the new version is expected to have wider appeal by being needle free and easier for the patient to fit into their routine.The 4mg dose will also be available for $149 a month until 15 April, then $199, while the highest doses cost $299 a month. Patients with insurance pay from $25 a month.Matt Weston, a pharmaceutical analyst at UBS, said the price was lower than expected. US list prices for weight-loss jabs are about $1,000 a month or more, although Novo Nordisk started selling its Wegovy injection at $349 a month to cash payers in November.Novo Nordisk’s share price rose by more than 4% on Monday on news of the launch, but is still down by 44% over the past year amid fierce competition from US rival Eli Lilly’s jabs Mounjaro and Zepbound.The Danish company, once the most valuable in Europe, hopes the pill will help it claw back market share after itissued several profit warnings,cut thousands of jobsand appointed new management last year.Both Novo and Eli Lilly have reduced prices of their jabs for people buying them for cash, rather than using health insurance.The Wegovy pill has only been approved in the US so far. The starting dose is now available at more than 70,000 US pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as some telehealth providers including Ro, LifeMD and Weight Watchers. The higher doses will become available later this week.Cash-paying patients will also be able to buy the starting dose of the pill for $149 a month on Donald Trump’s direct-to-consumer website TrumpRx.Eli Lilly isworking on its own anti-obesity pilland, if approved, had planned to cap higher doses at $399 a month for cash-paying patients.“We know there are people who are interested in addressing their weight but have been waiting on the sidelines for a medicine that was right for them,” said Ed Cinca, the senior vice-president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk.“For many of them, that wait is over as we can now offer the powerful efficacy of Wegovy in a once-daily pill that demonstrated about 17% weight loss, if all patients stayed on treatment.”The UK’s medicines regulator is reviewing the company’s application for its Wegovy pill and is expected to make a decision on whether to approve it before the end of the year.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Policymakers will need to redouble efforts to address this problem.”Unemployment in the UK has reached the highest level outside the Covid pandemic in a decade, with the headline rate hitting5.1% in Octoberas employers held back on hiring before Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget.Business leaders have said tax increases and a rising living wage are among contributing factors deterring employers from taking on staff.Starmer says closer ties with EU single market preferable to a customs unionRead moreExperts have warned for several years that Britain has been held back by so-called “zombie firms” – companies which barely make enough money to cover their costs but just about stay in business – preventing the allocation of resources to more productive sectors of the economy.Economists have suggested that low interest rates in the years since the 2008 financial crisis contributed to this, as cheap borrowing costs helped debt-laden companies to stay afloat.Businesses have come under pressure from 14 consecutiveBank of Englandrate increases betweenDecember 2021andAugust 2023, designed to tackle inflation. While the Bank has since cut the base rate six times – from a peak of 5.25% to 3.75% – firms’ operating costs remain higher than before the Covid pandemic.In a sign of the pressure, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned in a separate report that business confidence slumped to the lowest level in three years in the final quarter of 2025.In a survey of more than 4,600 firms carried out between 10 November and 8 December – straddling Reeves’s 26 November budget – the lobby group found that tax was the biggest business concern, followed by inflation.Fewer than half (46%) of companies said they expected increased turnover over the next 12 months, while nearly a quarter (24%) expected a decrease. Only 19% had increased investment and 27% had scaled back plans.David Bharier, head of research at the BCC, said: “Our data shows more clouds have gathered over business confidence, and the outlook for SMEs in 2026 is unsettled.”The Resolution Foundation said there were early signs that Britain’s productivity growth was being boosted by “creative destruction”, whereby newer and better firms, products or processes replace older, less-efficient, ones. Adoption of artificial intelligence technologies could also be playing a role, it said.However, it said the short-term impact from job losses would be “hugely difficult,” and urged the government to focus on supporting living standards.“Amidst this change one thing that isn’t changing enough is disposable income growth, which is set to grow at mediocre rates for the rest of the parliament,” Curtice said.“We must hope – but more importantly act – to ensure that 2026 is a turning point year for lifting living standards too.”Explore more on these topicsUnemploymentSmall businessResolution FoundationRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

As Eric Roth plunges into theatre, he talks about classic westerns, being sacked by Robert Redford – and why writing for Martin Scorsese is a dreamRyan GilbeyMon 5 Jan 2026 11.16 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 14.34 ESTShareEric Roth chuckles into his bristly silver beard when I refer to him as the new kid on the block, but that doesn’t make it any less true. His debut play, an adaptation of the 1952 western High Noon, is about to receive its world premiere, and the fact that he turned 80 last year is neither here nor there. “Maybe I’m theoldnew kid on the block,” he concedes from his home in Los Angeles. His baseball cap bears a picture of a typewriter, as though there could be any doubt that he has writing on the brain.Admittedly, Roth is more experienced than the typical first-timer. Behind him lies not so much a hinterland of a career as an imposing mountain range, all of it in movies. He won an Oscar in 1995 for writing Forrest Gump: he’s the one you can credit (or blame) for lines such as: “Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re going to get.”I loved working with Robert Redford. One of the loneliest men I’ve ever metHis own CV has something of the chocolate box about it, mixing chewy toffees – Michael Mann’s whistleblower drama The Insider, Steven Spielberg’s Mossad thriller Munich – with bonbons like David Fincher’s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, in which Brad Pitt is born elderly and ages backwards, and recent versions of A Star Is Born and Dune. All earned him Oscar nominations. Film or play, the pleasure is the same. “I love to put one word in front of the other,” he says. “See if I can get the right one.”View image in fullscreen‘A little more human’ … Billy Crudup and Denise Gough in rehearsals.Photograph: Johan PerssonHis swerve into theatre was sparked by the realisation that non-musical westerns were a rarity on stage. “I thought, ‘What better vehicle than this parable?’” Directors agreed: Ivo van Hove was attached at one point; Thea Sharrock is now in the saddle. Most actors, Roth tells me, were wary of stepping into the cowboy boots of Gary Cooper, the film’s star. Cooper played Will Kane, the marshal trying frantically to rustle up a posse on his wedding day, having learned that a vengeful outlaw is due back in town on the noon train. Billy Crudup was undaunted, though. His interpretation of Will, says Roth, is “a little more human. Not that Gary Cooper wasn’t human but he maintained that mask. Now we learn more about Will and his fears.” Denise Gough plays his wife, a pacifist Quaker urging him to flee with her rather than stand firm.The film served as an allegory for life during the US anti-Communist witch-hunts of the early 1950s. Its screenwriter Carl Foreman was blacklisted for refusing to name names. “It’s about cowardice and courage,” says Roth. “There’s a lot of cowardice in America right now, with people voting against their own interests. Incipient racism is being fostered by the actions of our leaders. High Noon applies to that but also to other eras, like the people who had the courage to hide Jews during the second world war.”View image in fullscreen‘Farcical novel’ … Roth picks up his Oscar for adapting Forrest Gump.Photograph: Michael Caulfield/APRoth has often expressed a preference for adapting imperfect or mediocre source material. He called the original novel of Forrest Gump “farcical”, dismissed Benjamin Button as one of F Scott Fitzgerald’s poorer works, and was bored by Dune when he read it in his teens. He knows where I’m going with this. “That’s an unfair question,” he grumbles good-naturedly, acknowledging that High Noon is an exception. Adapting it was “1,000% a challenge. It’s the pinnacle of what a western could be.”He also found himself navigating the demands of theatre. “Movies are written in closeup. In my first version of High Noon, I wrote the stage direction, ‘He shuffles his feet.’ The director asked me, ‘And how are we seeing this from the balcony?’” A sprinkling of Bruce Springsteen songs will further distinguish play from film. “They’re anachronistic, which makes for an interesting combination.”Thankfully, the stage version retains the picture’s structural asset: it unfolds in real time as the townsfolk prepare anxiously for the noon showdown. In that sense, it continues the writer’s fascination with temporal compression and elasticity. Forrest Gump and Benjamin Button span decades; the CGI-heavyHere, which reunited Roth with the Gump gang (director Robert Zemeckis, stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright), whizzed through millions of years from prehistoric times to the pandemic. Few cared. “We thought we had something special, but the critics were nasty and nobody showed up.”One of Roth’s as-yet-unfilmed ideas revolves around a widow who is given the chance to relive her late husband’s final 24 hours. “As the day wears on, it gets more and more touching, until finally he leaves his boots downstairs and goes up to bed – and you know he’s gone. Kevin Costner bought it, and every year I keep hoping he’s going to make it.”If I said to Martin Scorsese, ‘Why don’t we do this movie backwards?’ he’d say, ‘Let’s try it! Keep writing!’Would he trust Costner after the actor-director made such a dog’s dinner of The Postman, one of Roth’s earlier screenplays? “You really are a rat, boy!” he says with a rueful laugh, then explains what happened: he wrote the script, about a postal worker roaming a dystopian America, as a vehicle for Tom Hanks – only for Costner to buy it and commission a rewrite. “I’d given it a sardonic quality. It was like Gulliver’s Travels. Kevin made it very earnest and serious.” It won five Golden Raspberry awards, AKA Razzies, including, as Roth cheerfully reminds me, Worst Screenplay.Being rewritten comes with the territory but that doesn’t make it any easier to take. “It can be bruising,” admits Roth. His departure from The Horse Whisperer was especially painful, and came after he had moved in with the film’s director and star, Robert Redford, to work on the script. “We got up at nine and he’d say, ‘I think I’ll go for a jog.’ Then he’d be back at 10.30 and say, ‘I’ll have a little something to eat.’ Then it’s noon and he’s got calls to make. It’d be 2.30 before we started work.“I don’t want to speak ill of him because he’s gone now but I wish he had been a little braver with the movie. I loved working with him, and I found him fascinating. One of the loneliest men I’ve ever met. But I knew one day he’d look in the mirror and not want to see me there.” Sure enough, Roth was replaced. “That day, I was giving a keynote address at the Austin film festival. I thought to myself, ‘You fucking fraud. You just got fired!’”View image in fullscreenRobert De Niro, left, and Leonardo DiCaprio in Killers of the Flower Moon.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/APSwings and roundabouts. Roth has done more than his share of rewriting other people, including uncredited work on everything from Ridley Scott’s Black Hawk Down to Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival. It would be remiss to spend time in his company and not canvas his opinions on the Who’s Who of auteurs who have called on his services. The word is that Mann is the toughest cookie in Hollywood.“Michael gets upset when he thinks people are stymieing him creatively,” he says. “He’s hard on crews. I keep telling him not to be. He wants to get it perfect. Nobody’s tougher than David Fincher, but I’ll work with him till I die. His obsessive nature probably makes him a better director. On Mank, he would shoot 40 takes of an actor walking across a room. I’d ask him, ‘Why are you doing so many takes?’ He’d say, ‘He hasn’t done it right yet.’”View image in fullscreenWriting on the brain … Roth watches rehearsals.Photograph: Justine MatthewThat couldn’t be more different from Martin Scorsese, with whom Roth wrote Killers of the Flower Moon, a sorrowful thriller about the Osage tribe members in 1920s Oklahoma who are swindled and murdered for the oil discovered on their land. “Marty lets you do anything. If I said, ‘Why don’t we do this movie backwards?’, he’d say, ‘Let’s try it! Keep writing!’”Roth currently has his plate full working on a Sydney Sweeney thriller (I Pretended to Be a Missing Girl) and a real-life mafia drama for Scorsese (Midnight Vendetta), as well as being an executive producer on Mann’s Heat 2. “I haven’t done any writing on it, but I probably will,” he says, in the casual manner of someone accustomed to helping friends with their DIY.It is High Noon, though, that brings the brightest gleam to his eye today. “It’s made me feel 22 again,” he says. “Theatre is like this little village. Everybody’s fighting for the most creative way to tell the story. I’m not used to being treated with such respect. They won’t cross a ‘t’ without asking me. Whereas in the movies, they’ll go, ‘Who gives a shit what Eric Roth thinks?’”High Noon is at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, until 6 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreWesternsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A woman is killed, a man grievously injured, and a letter is sent to the news media. The killer gives himself a name –this is the Zodiac speaking–and provides a message written in code. So we start with three mysteries: the man, his motives and his message. The third is quickly cracked; the first hypothesized, but never definitively proven. But it’s the why of it all – why a man would kill at least five seemingly random people, and why we as a culture still care – that will require more significant investigation.‘Pure euphoric escapism’: why Adventureland is my feelgood movieRead moreWhen it was first released more than 18 years ago, David Fincher’s Zodiac was considered a bit of an also-ran. Over two and a half hours long, it depicts the search for the Zodiac killer, who spent the late 60s terrorizing California’s Bay Area, as a series of bad leads and dead-ends, and concludes without definitively proving anything. It flopped at the box office and was not nominated for even a single Oscar.Yet, to the great concern of my friends and loved ones, Zodiachas become my go-to rewatch. When I have nothing much to do, I might put on 20 or 30 minutes, and watch Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr) and San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) attempt over years to untangle clues, allusions and near-misses knotted around the identity of the Zodiac killer.To tell the truth, I find it all a bit comforting. Now, there is obviously quite a lot to disturb here: a mother with child trapped in a moving car, a daylight attack by a man in a leather mask. But contra Fincher’s clinical reputation, Zodiac is a film of surprisingly light pleasures. The dialogue is zippy, the performances closer to His Girl Friday than Seven. I could spend five hours visiting various police precinct evidence rooms, or listening to the long chain of variously balding character actors as they list off Bay Area place names: Napa, Vallejo, Lake Berryessa.James Vanderbilt’s screenplay provides the viewer with a near-constant uptake of new information, a series of puzzle pieces that nearly fit together, but not quite. This enlists the viewer in the act of investigation, placing them on a level with the characters in their collective attempt to parse relevant information from chaff. Only deep in the runtime, and years into the story, do you realize that this exploration will likely never reach its destination.For Fincher, as for his characters, the search for the Zodiac transmutes into a kind of quest, a vocation that calls out to particular niche obsessives – puzzlers, codebreakers, meaning-makers – and turns the film into something far more expansive than your typical serial killer tale. Whether dramatized or documented, the modern true crime story tends to be intensely over-determined, bending all evidence towards an established conclusion. But Zodiac is a process movie where the clues keep coming but never quite add up, and the search can never come to a definitive ending. There are always more messages, more references, more threads to be pulled, leading its collection of journalists, detectives and obsessives down tangents that might consume literal years of their lives, and yield little but a persistent fascination.Zodiac is, at its heart, a story of the persistent attraction of mystery, where the slow unspooling of surprising facts, incidental details and seeming revelations can become an infinite churn and can even swallow up a life. It touches on the detective story, the newspaper movie and the contemporary paranoiac obsession with lining up the endless stray impressions of daily life into something neat, comprehensible and, most of all, meaningful. In particular, Graysmith’s quest begins with an attempt to safeguard his children, and ends up endangering them. Yet he never considers dropping it, not even when mysterious strangers are calling the house late into the night to breathe over the line. The confidence of the search, the surety of Graysmith’s belief that he will somehow, someday know – the stakes here are existential, though the danger is long in the past and all violence is entirely self-inflicted. To give up the search would be to give up the work of his life, a choice he (and we) never seriously consider.Every time I watch Fincher’s film, I too become convinced that I will find, somewhere in its weave of suggestion and incident, the solution to the Zodiac killings, much as some people believe they will find mysteries of the universe in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The constant unspooling of new information, the new leads, new possibilities, draws me onward, deeper into the puzzle, until the story dissipates and no conclusion arrives. A few weeks, a couple months, a year or two passes, and I take the disc off my shelf, and keep on with the search.Zodiac is available on Netflix and Paramount+ in the US, Amazon Prime in the UK and HBO Max in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsDavid FincherMy feelgood movieJake GyllenhaalChloë SevignyRobert Downey JrMark RuffaloThrillersDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now in his 90s, the older man muses on the inevitability of death, all while looking back on his painful upbringing asa Wayuu Indigenous person. His voiceover, laid over the sight of lush forest and babbling brooks, recalls a cruel separation from his mother and his ancestral land, forced by Catholic invaders. This sense of fracture resonates throughout the family lineage. Jacanamijoy too speaks of his feelings of loss caused by generational trauma.Against such emotional and geographical disconnects, the film looks to dreams – and even the afterlife – as a possible space for reconciliation and healing. José Agustín’s mother has long passed, yet he often sees her in his nocturnal reveries, filled with all-consuming longing. The film’s sensorial soundscape, which builds a symphony out of natural sounds, further enhancing this metaphysical atmosphere. It is as if the presence of José Agustín’s mother, along with the souls of other Indigenous people, are embedded on the land itself, despite the efforts of colonial occupiers to erase their culture. In a beguiling moment, as the old man envisions his own burial, the film conjures the imagined voice of his deceased mother, welcoming him into another realm of existence.Mesmerising as it is, Jacanamijoy’s film is not simply about the abstract. The documentary also accentuates acts of care as the Wayuu community rallies around José Agustín as he approaches old age. There are closeups of hands: bathing, lighting ceremonial candles, and even preparing a tomb for his resting place. In a powerful message of resistance, Jacanamijoy captures how Indigenous culture survives against all odds, both on this Earth, and in the afterlife.Dreams Travel With the Wind is on True Story from 9 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIndigenous peoplesColombiaCatholicismAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is the land of razzle-dazzle and high ideals, of jazz music, Bogart and Bacall, Harriet Tubman and Hamilton, a nation that was anti-colonialist and pro-liberty from its conception, whose Declaration of Independence states that “all men are created equal”. Why, then, does this same country so often produce clown-show politics, racism at home and abroad, and imperial ambitions, latterly in Greenland and Canada? Why does it regularly show contempt for the world order it helped create? Why did it once again electDonald Trump?These contradictions have kept an army of journalists, White House-watchers and soothsayers in business for generations. Alistair Cooke, perhaps the greatest British exponent of the genre, interpreted the country via the minutiae of everyday life, observing people at the beach, say, or riding the subway. Stourton, another BBC veteran, who first reported from Washington in the Reagan years, takes almost the opposite approach. He looks at Trump and Trumpism through the run of history, arguing in a series of insightful essays that the 47th Potus is not an American aberration but a continuation, an echo of dark and often neglected aspects of the country’s past. Trump, he concludes, is “as American as apple pie”.Stourton, who currently presents Radio 4’s religious and current affairs programme Sunday, takes six key aspects of Trump and Trumpism and sieves the history of the republic, looking for precursors or parallels. Broadly speaking, the categories are religion, imperialism, immigration, tariffs, political persecution and the way in which the president wields power. Appropriately, given Stourton’s expertise, he kicks off with an exploration of American faith.It is baffling for those of us who live outside Trumpland that Christian nationalists form a major component of the Maga faithful. How can anyone purport to follow Christian values and still align themselves with someone so obviously venal, corrupt and immoral? In search of an answer, Stourton spools back to colonial America, and to John Winthrop, who landed at Salem, Massachusetts, in 1630, at the head of a group of 700 English Puritan settlers. It was Winthrop who famously described the new religious colony he intended to found as “a city upon a hill”, an image since borrowed by US presidents from JFK to Reagan to Barack Obama. Winthrop served for many years as governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where he and his co-religionists happily sentenced dissenters to whipping, banishment and even execution. This was justified, in Winthrop’s view, because the state existed to uphold divine laws, and if its earthly methods needed to be brutal, so be it.The modern parallel is clear. Christian nationalists will support Trump as long as he helps them return divinely founded America to the Christian state it once was: he’s delivering on his side of the bargain through actions such as appointing the supreme court justices who overturned Roe v Wade. Seen through the lens of early puritanism, the alliance makes far more sense than it does in the context of the constitution, whose guarantees of religious freedom only arrived a century and a half later.There are precedents in US history for almost all of Trump’s actionsThis tension – between an enlightened US and its illiberal alter ego – runs through Stourton’s book. In the 20th century, for instance, US presidents liked to define the nation as anti-imperialist, which gives the impression that Trump’s present-day coveting of Canada and Greenland is the anomaly. But territorial expansion was a key aim of the US for much of the 19th century. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 set the template. Thomas Jefferson acquired 530m acres from Napoleon, including land that makes up part or all of 15 modern-day US states. The country doubled in size overnight. Of course these lands were not France’s to sell: their true owners included an estimated half-million Native Americans. But Jefferson’s deal set the tone for a “century of confiscation” and ethnic cleansing that was to come.Four decades later, the US government made another massive grab for land, forcing Mexico to cede more than half of its territory, including modern-day California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona and New Mexico, and parts of Colorado, Wyoming and Oklahoma. In all, there were around 20 episodes of American expansion in the 19th century, including two attempts to annex Canada. The US “resorted to absolutely every trick in the book to achieve its ambitions”, according to Stourton, including real-estate deals, bribery, treaties, diplomatic sharp practice, bullying, ethnic cleansing and conquest. “The outcome always came first,” he writes, “the means mattered less.”There are precedents here for almost all of Trump’s actions. Summary arrests and deportations? Attacks on the “fake news” media? In 1798, John Adams signed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which allowed him to imprison or banish foreigners without trial, and banned “false and malicious” writings against the president and the government. Contempt for judges and the law? See Andrew Jackson, Potus number seven, a “monster”, according to Stourton, and a hero to Trump. Jackson refused to implement a supreme court verdict he disagreed with, allegedly saying of the chief justice: “John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!” Tariffs? President William McKinley raised import duties to around 50%, a “Trumpian level”, with disastrous consequences for the Republican party. Muslim migrant bans? Stourton refers us again to Winthrop, whose regime inflicted punishment based on the identity or sect to which a person belonged, and required strangers wanting to reside in Massachusetts to get permission.Occasionally, the attempts to find historical precedent feel a little stretched. The weakest may be the link Stourton draws between Trump’s use of the state to punish his enemies and the McCarthyite witch-hunts of the 1950s. There are similarities in the way government processes are abused, but these feel very different. Trump, the most powerful man in the country, is motivated by a desire for personal retribution: he orders the prosecution of people he thinks have slighted or wronged him. Joe McCarthy, who never rose higher than the status of junior senator, had no history with many of his targets, but attacked them opportunistically, because he loved the spotlight.On the whole, though, Made in America is a pithy, entertaining and informative intellectual exercise. Stourton makes a persuasive case that Trump is a logical outcome of American history, a modern representative of the illiberal, imperialist streak inUS politicsthat stands in sharp contrast to the more familiar values of the constitution. He set out to prove that you cannot understand Donald Trump without understanding America’s past, he tells us. What he found in the end was that “you cannot understand America without understanding Trump”.Non-Americans should hardly take solace from Stourton’s conclusion that Trump is an American phenomenon. As Cooke is once supposed to have remarked, “The British especially shudder at the latest American vulgarity, and then they embrace it with enthusiasm two years later.”Made in America: the Dark History that Led to Donald Trump by Edward Stourton is published by Torva (£20).

Unfortunately for her, morality in 2015 is rigid and cynical, and instead of having the affair, Cora spends 10 years overthinking it, fantasising about it and discussing it with her potential lover, Sam – a playgroup dad who is “chief storytelling officer” at a mortgage start-up (yes, that’s his job title. They all have absurd jobs). The book presents itself as a comic take on the classic adultery novel and a send-up of a narrow, self-conscious group of downwardly mobile New Yorkers. I’d call it the midlife adultery story our entire generation deserves: a propulsive, witty takedown of insufferable hand-wringers who’ve managed to ruin even sex. Honestly, I couldn’t put it down.Cora and her husband Eliot are smug, overeducated Brooklynites who, with rents rising and children growing, have moved reluctantly upstate. Caught in the “gruelling all-the-time-ness” of parenthood, they have desk jobs, two children, a persistent mushroom growing under their bathroom tiles that they lack the energy and money to sort out. They hang out with other smug, overeducated Brooklynites who have fled the city to drink negronis out of mason jars and judge each other closer to nature. But if Cora is lonely here, it’s not because of her fussy, lifeless lens but because her new neighbours are “dull and vain, duller and vainer than they were back in the city”. Eliot is high-minded and oblivious. He eats popcorn as she scrubs the oven and says he doesn’t wish to possess her. Cora imagines herself trying to survive with Eliot in the woods, washing clothes on a stone while he searches for chanterelles. She longs for drama, a bit of depravity, a lover who will beg, and worship, and “growl at the feet of the woman’s excellence”.The trouble is that she’s as high-minded and rigid as Eliot, and incapable of that kind of abandon herself. It’s “too much to ask her to be passionate” (about work, she says, but really about everything). Her feelings for Sam are “bland, liking-adjacent”. She wants “to get fucked into the astral plane and not think about her life for a second”. (I mean, who doesn’t?) But, for years, Sam refuses while Cora pines. She imagines an alternate timeline alongside her real life, where instead of bills and school pickups, she has sex and hotels and Sam. When her fictional romance fizzles, she imagines “a French guy named Baptiste” who joins Sam in helping her out of the bath, “nothing for her to do, no tasks, no obligations, except to be worshipped like someone’s teenage wife, who’d died improbably of TB”.I loved this razor-sharp, hilarious, finely observed novel, written with such withering exactitudeWhen they finally do give in to temptation, the sex is sad, without much play or complicity. It isn’t the sepia-toned romance she dreamed up for 10 years. Cora puts on a slinky dress and Sam “stoically eat[s] her out in their hotel room” before dinner. One imagines that Cora wants to slip inside a James Salter novel, where sex is sordid and confusing, where the power dynamics are unequal, and everyone misbehaves, and nobody keeps score.Throughout the novel, Somers hints at the root of Cora’s problem: she has such cutting wit, but so little joy. “The shabbiness of real life,” Cora thinks, “you had to admire its consistency.” Of Sam’s erotic photo, Cora complains, “he has clenched his abs and made sure he was hard, but has not cleared the frame of Crocs”. You’re not meant to look at the Crocs, Cora! Since the event that killed their fun was parenthood, one worries about what these idiots are doing to their children. When Cora’s daughter asks about sex, the adults fumble. They start with babies then acknowledge that sex isn’t always about babies. Eliot mentions a penis then concedes that one isn’t required. Finally, he lands on, “you know genitals?”Beneath the story runs the subtle undercurrent of familiar middle-age questions: do our lives have meaning? Where do we go after death? These themes are more explicit in Cora’s imagined conversations. Reading these exchanges, I wondered what lesson Cora and her cynical lot would take from their disappointing dramas. Would Cora grow more open to life’s imperfect joys, its corny pleasures? When Eliot asks about her affair in the middle of a podcast about rope, Cora thinks “every serious exchange is undermined by its particulars”. Some might say enhanced. But that’s not Cora, and Somers doesn’t give her character false epiphanies, or stretch her where she is unable to go.I loved this razor-sharp, hilarious, finely observed novel, written with such withering exactitude. It is absolutely aware of itself, spare and brimming with subtext: a portrait of an anxious, loin-girding generation in middle age, chronically embarrassed at ourselves, at once afraid of and desperate for sensation. Or maybe that’s just the New Yorkers. Let’s say it is.Dina Nayeri’s novel A Happy Death is forthcoming in 2027. The Ten Year Affair by Erin Somers is published by Canongate (£18.99).

It’s even rarer when that performance takes place barely a week after the players first met. But that’s the seemingly impossible ask for the teenagers of the National Youth Orchestra, whose annual cycle begins in earnest just after Christmas, building up to a three-city UK tour before term. It’s a bracing start to the year for anyone whose post-festive achievements have been largely sofa-based.Indeed, 2026’s Shimmer programme is less festive glow than urban heat-haze, inviting us into the sun-bleached Spanish streetscapes of Debussy and Ravel, wriggling with dances, festivals and life.Premiered in 1910, the imagined Spain of Debussy’s Ibéria is a delicate, pointillist affair – a collage of muted colours and scents. Some works swell with the extra weight of NYO’s doubled – often tripled – forces, but while conductor Alexandre Bloch kept his huge ensemble absolutely controlled (this is, after all, Spain through unmistakably Gallic eyes) there was still a sense of painting extra layers on a watercolour. Rhythms juddered, the sinuous scale that stretches out an inviting hand in the first movement often smudged.View image in fullscreenCellist Inbal Segev with the National Youth Orchestra and conductor Alexandre Bloch.Photograph: Chris ChristodoulouIt was a similar story with Ravel’s Rapsodie Espagnole, which was at its best in the swirling rhythms and celebratory release of the final movement: caution finally flung to the wind, brass snarling and rasping, woodwind shooting skywards like fireworks.Two contemporary works saw the ensemble come into their own. The Bernstein-brash, neon blare of Karim Al-Zand’s 2006 City Scenes introduced new swagger, a cheeky little phrase hopping around the orchestra like a sonic Artful Dodger, and strings and harps a gleaming foil to streetwise brass and woodwind. The contrast with Anna Clyne’s radiant, Rumi-inspired DANCE (2019) – a cello concerto in all but name – was thrilling. AccompanyingInbal Segev’s crooning, coaxing cello, the orchestra mirrored her shifting moods: now a courtly baroque group, now a klezmer or jazz band – leader Aki Blendis and principal cello Charlotte Shlomowitz each duetting stylishly with Segev.Add in an opening group riff on Autumn Leaves (introducing the bassoon and tuba solos we never knew we needed) and a spirited encore of Rossini’s William Tell Overture (punchline: sung not played), and we had some sense of the breadth of what these teenagers have begun this week. By August, they’ll be flying.The Shimmer tour continues on5 January at Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry, and 6 January at the Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Schwartz was 24 when it became a Broadway hit in 1972 but many of the evergreen lyrics reveal an old soul. “Cats fit on the window sill, children fit in the snow,” observes its eponymous hero. “So why do I feel I don’t fit in anywhere I go?”Pippin’s framing as a musical erected by a band of travelling players fits this fringe venue well. The stage is sparsely decorated and the arriving performers offer a ramshackle narrative conjured from – and constantly on the verge of vanishing into – thin air, thanks to tricks from magic consultant Martin T Hart in a production directed and choreographed by Amanda Noar.In Roger O Hirson’s book, Pippin is portrayed by a player essaying the role for the first time. Noar heightens the character’s naivety by having the lead actor, Lewis Edgar, plucked as if from the audience, dragooned into the show by the authoritarian Leading Player (Emily Friberg). She casts a spell on him with her brightly painted talons and similarly wields control of a marionette-like ensemble who exude slinky mischief in the opener, Magic to Do.View image in fullscreenBeguiling … Emily Friberg in Pippin.Photograph: Inigo Woodham-SmithThe seductive charm of that song is the keynote of a production that never quite captures the musical’s prevailing malevolence, despite a beguiling performance by Friberg who stalks the stage. The pair of songs about battle, War Is a Science and Glory, should chill in their vaudeville grotesquerie, as should Bob Fosse’s choreography for a routine dubbed “the Manson trio”, referring to the cult leader’s manipulative powers of control.The Fosse flash – isolated hips, flickering fingers – is often present here but the dark undercurrent of the time in which Pippin was written is mostly missing, despite costume designer Hannah Danson’s blend of the 1970s with AD780. However, counterculture optimism shines through, especially with Simple Joys – performed with hula hoops flying across the stage – and the gentle protest song Morning Glow, richly delivered to its crescendo by Edgar under Simon Jackson’s golden lighting and backed by musical director Harry Style’s industrious five-piece band.View image in fullscreenA hero on a quest for meaning … Lewis Edgar, aloft, as Pippin.Photograph: Inigo Woodham-SmithTraditionally, largely due to Hirson’s often leaden book, Pippin can be an annoying and over-earnest hero on his quest for meaning – the character is the major flaw in his own story. But Edgar succeeds in making him more of a rebel against his father (Oliver Wood), even if the overall characterisation remains rather disjointed.‘Magic to do – just for you’: the miracle of Stephen Schwartz’s musical PippinRead moreIf Pippin is the tale of a boy becoming a man, one of its highlights is grandmother Berthe (Clare Brice) in her rousing solo No Time at All, seemingly growing younger with each line. Elsewhere, Helena Caldas gives us a simpering but sly Fastrada (Pippin’s stepmother) and Mia Quimpo makes a strong professional debut as the antithetically pure Catherine, offering a life stripped of pageantry. There is plenty of weird magic and simple wonder, even if you miss the wickedness.AtUpstairs at the Gatehouse, London, until 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsStephen SchwartzFringe theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Flipping through the jazz section on a visit to his local record store a few years ago, artist Kye Potter found a battered tape by American pianist and composer Jessica Williams. It looked every bit the quintessential DIY release. “The labels had come off the tape,” he says. “It was home-dubbed, with photocopied notes, a little bit of highlighter to accentuate the artwork, and released on her own label, Ear Art.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As a collector and occasional producer particularly interested in the American musical avant garde after John Cage, Potter was intrigued by a tape called Prepared Piano. Yet it seemed unusual from Williams, who was best known for making sparkling jazz in the straight-ahead tradition of Thelonious Monk and Errol Garner. If the west coast jazz circuit knew her as a musical experimenter – for her concerts,she requested pianos without the cover to make it easier to reach inside andstrum the strings– it was a facet that rarely made it to her records.“I’d never heard anything like it,” Potter says of the tape. So he emailed Williams to see if any more records existed. She sent back four recordings of prepared piano from the mid 1980s – two live, two made in the studio. And though she had long since retired from playing publicly, she also included some recent work. “She sent me probably 15 or 16 synth tapes – full releases,” says Potter.View image in fullscreenPrepared precursor … John Cage changing the tuning of his piano by placing coins and screws between the strings in 1949.Photograph: New York Times Co./Getty ImagesPotter worked with Williams during the Covid pandemic to put together Blue Abstraction, an album of prepared piano pieces that was released on artist Matt Connors’sPre-Echo Pressin late 2025. But Williams died in 2022, part way through the project. She was 73. “She was struggling physically and financially,” Potter says. Williams had been public about her difficulties after spinal surgery in 2012, meaning she could no longer tour, and a cancer diagnosis in 2017. “But I think her personality, strength, self-confidence and the calmness she found through having a spiritual practice all came out in conversation.”In later electronic, groove-focused releases such as Blood Music (2008) – defiantly tagged “NOT JAZZ”on the genre-sceptic’s website– and the two Virtual Miles releases (2006 and 2007), you hear a pianist trying to break free of expectation. Blue Abstraction, with its intriguingly altered piano reverberations, reveals that that impulse stretched back decades. Rather than a homogenous piano sound, the instrument creates many different sonic evocations: what could becimbaloms, gamelan, distant church bells, animals rattling around cages, and little machines spluttering into life. It has a tremendously urgent energy, monumental roars collapsing into snarling, highly punctuated riffs.Tortoise’s Jeff Parker tells me he is a fan of this “gorgeous, diverse, exploratory and nuanced” record. Jessika Kenney, a vocalist and composer who has worked with Sarah Davachi and Sunn O))), heard Williams play while studying in Seattle in the 1990s, and was drawn to the intensity of her music, but knew little of her surreal-sounding prepared piano until this release. Not long after seeing Williams live, she went to Indonesia, seeking “surrealism in the improvisational vocals of the Javanese gamelan”, she recalls. “Now that seems completely natural as a connection with her. I only wish it was known to me then.”Jessica Williams: Blue Abstraction – videoWilliams’ prepared sounds have technical precursors: think of John Cage’s prepared pianos, or the radical techniques of American eccentricHenry Cowell. What’s striking is how successfully she fuses these new sounds with her own bluesy vocabulary at the keyboard. The language rarely departs from that she developed in a discography stretching to more than 80 albums, meaning the new psychedelically coloured sounds are powered by the fizzy energy of an improviser in full control. It’s thrilling stuff.View image in fullscreenTireless experimenter … Jessica Williams in Oakland, 1986.Photograph: PRWilliams had always experimented with the piano. “I hit the notes, and I saw colours,” she told NPR’s Terry Gross in 1997. She received her first upright piano in 1954. On Currents, the long-running blog she kept (miraculously preserved by the Internet Archive), she told the story of her first “disassembling” – “as I’ve done forallpianos”, she noted: Williams took off a panel from below the piano’s keyboard, and placed it on the floor beside her stool. “I needed a drummer, and that left foot became the hi-hat foot,” she wrote.Williams originally studied classical piano at the Peabody Conservatory. Early encounters with the classical repertoire led her to Rachmaninov; she took his famous Prelude in C minor to her piano teacher, who scolded her for improvising a section. But he saw her potential: the next week, he brought her Dave Brubeck to play. She learned his Take Five within a week.Brubeck would latercall Williams“one of the greatest pianists I have ever heard”, and McCoy Tyner was similarly impressed. Williams’ 2004 Grammy-nominated album Live at Yoshi’s, Vol 1, shows her deep absorption in jazz history, plus her trademark playful pianistic wit. Nevertheless, despite her long journeys to educate herself in the genre – first, to the hipper sounds of Coltrane, Miles and Dolphy, before working her way back to Monk and Garner to Fats Waller and James P Johnson – she quickly became disillusioned with the jazz world.After moving from Philadelphia to San Francisco, Williams met the great Mary Lou Williams when the latter played a week at the Keystone Corner. Buoyed up by the elder pianist’s advice (“Don’t ever let anyone stop you”), she became a strident, public critic of her scene: of the meagre pay, the jazz “boys’ club”, the “jazz hang” – namely smoking and drinking as the primary means of getting gigs – and of a corporate industry riding on the coattails of struggling artists.“I am continually disappointed at the reality of the ‘jazz world’ and its inability to organise, communicate and stand up for a set,any set, of core values,” she wrote in the liner notes to her 2008 release Deep Monk. Similarly, the writing on her blog is wide-ranging, unflinching, expressly political and feminist, though she rarely discussed her experiences as a transgender woman. As John Corbett noted recently in German magazine JazzPodium: “To add to the sexism … that chased her from her preferred musical arena for a period, imagine what kind of inhumane bullshit she must have endured as a trans woman in the jazz scene of the early 80s.”View image in fullscreenUnlinching … Jessica Williams.Photograph: Peter Symes/RedfernsThe 10 best jazz albums of 2025Read moreWilliams’ career arced towards self-sufficiency. After time in the bustling Bay Area scene, she moved through smaller cities such as Sacramento and Santa Cruz, settling in Portland in 1991, moving smaller still, to Yakima, Washington State, in the 2010s. Williams saw early on the huge potential of the internet “to change human consciousness beyond anything experienced during the Industrial Revolution”,as she wrote, and also to help establish herself as an independent artist. By the late 90s, she used her own website to blog, run another record label, (Red and Blue Recordings), ship records, and maintain a mailing list of dedicated fans, who attended concerts –often given in people’s homes.Even after she sold her piano to pay for her spinal surgery and retreated from performing publicly, she continued to make music: not jazz (“when it stopped being fun playing jazz, I stopped doing it,” she wrote in 2018) but on synthesisers. “That makes me happy – as a hobby.” After her death, some in the online jazz community remarked that her passing had gone virtually unnoticed. Now, there’s a sense that a Williams revival may be beginning. For starters, Potter and Conners are contemplating a more blues-focused prepared piano project. “Music just flowed out of Jessica her whole life,” says Potter. Even in death, the sense is she’s not quite finished.Blue Abstraction Prepared Piano Project 1985–1987 is available viaWorld of Echo MusicviaPre-Echo PressExplore more on these topicsMusicJazzfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Art – paintings super-aware of emotion in a landscape – was her first and last love, and her serious talent.Photograph: Laura KellyPaintingObituaryMolly Parkin obituaryArtist, writer, fashion editor and raconteur whose bohemian lifestyle inspired her bonkbuster novelsVeronica HorwellMon 5 Jan 2026 12.46 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 14.26 ESTShareThough she accomplished much else, Molly Parkin has died, at the age of 93 after suffering from Alzheimer’s, as an acknowledged artist, which is what she had really wanted from life. She had passed through fashion, journalism, writing fiction and nonfiction, notoriety and foulmouthed fame, on television and off, plus more than 50 dwelling places, two husbands, and encounters with men beyond enumeration.But art – paintings super-aware of emotion in a landscape – was her first and last love, and her serious talent. A male artist living so expansively could expect to be appreciated for surviving into old age, the loss of muse and money, the bottles and the cigarettes, the energy invested in the constant pursuit of sex and in telling the world about it. For a woman to have stayed that course is still novel – and quite something for a girl from the Welsh valleys.The particular valley was the Garw in south Wales, where she was born in the mining village of Pontycymer, the younger daughter of Reuben Thomas, who had a hopeless fancy to be an artist. Her mother, Ronnie (Rhonwen, nee Noyle), played the organ in chapel. Molly loved the landscape; the darkness was at home, where, from infancy, her father sexually abused her. She had his attention, mostly for the wrong reasons; when the family moved to Dollis Hill in northLondon, he took her to hang about stage doors, thinking he could pimp her to actors; he also took her to the National Gallery to meet great paintings. The abuse, with beatings, and the attention ended with adolescence.View image in fullscreenMolly Parkin with a portrait by Darren Coffield at the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 2010.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyAfter she fell off a bicycle in her teens, she was absent from Willesden grammar school for months, up in her bedroom, painting, which set her on course, in 1949, for a scholarship to Goldsmiths College, London, then another to Brighton College ofArt.The stories she repeatedly told of what happened next, of seeking a sugar daddy, of Louis Armstrong swooping on her in a jazz club (she could not go off with him because she had to be at Silverthorne school, in Elephant and Castle, to teach the next morning), of the actor James Robertson Justice, 30 years her senior, moving on her knickers at the Ivy, sound different when you know about the abuse, but she did not reveal that secret, released by therapy, until her 2010 memoir, Welcome to Mollywood.Through decades of raconteuring, she boasted that those encounters had been the start of a wild sex life. She was Robertson Justice’s unkept mistress until her father’s death in 1956, when she realised that he and the actor had been around the same age, and she dropped him.Soon, in 1957, she met, at a party, the well-bredMichael Parkin, in advertising and TV production, who proposed within weeks. Her paintings, selling well in the West End, already collected by the Tate and Brighton Museum, paid for the house in Old Church Street, Chelsea, where they had two daughters, Sophie and Sarah, and lived until the day she found the hotel receipt that proved her husband’s latest infidelity, threw him out, and, paintbrush in hand, amended the street sign outside to read “No Parkin”.Her gift with the brush went with him, for she lost all inspiration to paint just at the point when she had to fund the household singlehandedly. First she made hats forBarbara Hulanicki’s label, Biba, then made clothes for her own enterprise, The Shop, in nearby Radnor Walk. At a 1965 dinner party she sounded off to Clive Irving, editorial director of IPC magazines, about her art-trained view of colour in clothes. He invited her to be fashion editor of his new magazine, Nova, where Parkin arrived knowing less about mags than the many secretaries assigned to assist her.For 18 months, Parkin and Nova’s art director Harry Peccinotti broke all the tenets of fashion journalism. Parkin had no interest in Paris collections, advocated for medium-price British labels, and photographed clothes abstracted into page decoration. When the advertisers’ expectation of an annual issue with editorial pictures of furs and jewellery was explained to her, she photographed the pelts and the rocks on the office roof. Readers liked her ideas about visual imperfection (her ideal of a model had been shaped by Rubens’ paintings), advertisers did not, and in 1967, she was out.View image in fullscreenMolly Parkin with her husband Patrick Hughes. They moved to Cornwall in 1975, later divorcing in 1981.Photograph: Des E Gershon/AlamyParkin met with even less approval as, briefly, fashion editor of Harpers & Queen, but her ramshackle approach suited newspapers; she moved to theSunday Timesin 1969, and picked up a press award in 1971. Soon after, she lost patience with the frock business, and left to be a freelance, writing for both Men Only and Spare Rib, among a shelf of other magazines. She was already a rare raucous voice among the few female celebs on TV chatshows.After years of serial, often trophy, men (many bored her – she spent tedious hours spankingJohn Mortimer), she had married the artist Patrick Hughes in 1969, and he and his three sons by a previous marriage joined her daughters in needing the financial support earned by her prolific pen. The couple moved in 1975 to Cornwall for its cheapness, eventually settling among artists in St Ives. Parkin was by then a novelist, and claimed the outline for her first book, Love All (1974), was only picked up because the publisher’s secretary liked her comic erotic style.Hughes was invited to work in New York in 1979, and they moved in to the Chelsea hotel in Manhattan, also an artists’ colony. Parkin remembered it for a boozy sociability that developed into actual orgies, with herself and the rock hostessAnita Pallenbergas non-participants, poking at everyone with sticks to get on with it. The often combative marriage to Hughes ended in divorce in 1981.Parkin went back to London, where, courtesy of Pallenberg, she moved into the Rolling Stones’ house in Chelsea for a couple of years, throwing weekend parties, and writing improperly where she could; eight larky bonkbusters in all, plus a fictional version of her marriage break-up, and a volume of poetry. And she turned to performance, as a comic with her own show at the Edinburgh festival, 1984-87; Dublin festival banned her act for obscenity.Parkin returned to her familiar Chelsea Arts Club, Colony Club and Ronnie Scott’s as alcoholism submerged her. Nadir and redemption came after a several-day bender in 1987, when she ended in a gutter outside Smithfield meat market, where pubs opened through the night. As she told it, the voice of her Gawr grandmother came to her: “That’s it, cariad, you’ve had your last drink.” She joined Alcoholics Anonymous that week. Her return to painting took four months.Constructing a sober life was tough. Parkin had mismanaged what money and property she had, and faced a bill for income tax. In 1998, she returned to Pontycymer and there declared bankruptcy, then rented a London houseboat, and moved for a while to a home in southern India, with 35 monkeys in its trees.In 2002, she arrived, destitute, threatened by cancer (the tumour proved benign), at the housing desk in Kensington and Chelsea town hall, where she was offered a one-bedroom flat with mini-garden on the ground floor of theWorld’s End estatein Chelsea. Parkingrabbed it, planted trees, and made it her studio and home, obscuring the lewder paintings when officials visited.In cheerful ruination, she became an institution, welcomed in 2011 toDesert Island Discs, amused that her old sexual energy had converted to active creativity. Her paintings sold again. In 2012 the queen awarded her a civil list pension for services to the arts. True to form, she derided its smallness. It was swiftly upped.Sophie, Sarah and three grandchildren survive her.Molly Noyle Parkin, artist and writer, born 3 February 1932; died 5 January 2026Explore more on these topicsPaintingArtWalesLondonMagazinesSunday TimesAlcoholismobituariesShareReuse this content"

We don’t think twice about athletes having psychological support, so why should artists have to feel mentally tortured to give their best performances?” she asked.Therapeutic support is fast becoming widespread: the Actors’ Trust, in partnership with the British Association for Performing Arts Medicine, now offers mental health support for artists suffering stress and burnout linked to emotionally challenging material.Wellbeing in the Arts, which works to improve the mental health of the arts and creative sector, has welcomed the change. But research underlines how urgent such support has become: the Film and TV Charity’s most recent wellbeing survey found that 84% of UK actors suffer work-related stress or anxiety, with one in four considering leaving the industry as a result. In theatre, similar studies point to persistently high levels of depression, financial instability and emotional overload.“Too many artists still labour under the belief that suffering is essential for creative excellence and artistic authenticity,” said Lou Platt, the founder of Artist Wellbeing. “Suffering is often part of the creative process, but you don’t have to be tortured to make great art.”‘Raise the questions. Don’t provide the answers’: composer Jake Heggie on 25 years of Dead Man WalkingRead moreSince the #MeToo movement, directors have increasingly stepped back from the once celebrated practice of pushing artists to breaking point – a method openly embraced in the eras of Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Francis Ford Coppola.Liz Counsell, the executive director of Dan Daw Creative Projects, which recently produced Outlier at the Bristol Old Vic and the Battersea Arts Centre, celebrated that shift.“As well as being wrong, the ‘tortured artist’ isn’t a safe or reliably productive way to create art,” said Counsell.“If an artist is still processing trauma, then it’s quite likely they’ll get to a certain point with a work and then shut down,” she said. “But if they’ve had time with a specialist therapist, they’re far more likely to be able to push further and explore more deeply than they otherwise would.”Yet many artists are still made to endure suffering as if it were simply part of the job, said Platt.“When actors are asked to act out sexual violence, domestic abuse, war and systemic injustice night after night for weeks on end, the trauma can bury itself deeply,” she said.“We frequently talk to artists who are so disturbed by either the subject they’re tackling or the conditions they’re working in that they have to take medication just to cope,” she added.But if you remove the suffering, do you destroy the art? Forplaywright Sophia Griffin, the opposite is true. Far from being the kernel of genius from which creativity springs, she argued, trauma can throttle it.“I’ve used wellbeing practitioners for the past four years, and had I not, I can honestly say that my work would not have been as strong or as emotionally true as it has been,” she said.Griffin recently suffered writer’s block when writing a play for the Bush Theatre in London. “It was only by working with an expert that I realised I was subconsciously resisting tapping into painful things I’d buried or not confronted in myself,” she said. “Realising that freed me up to write the work.”Stories such as that, said Platt, are evidence that artists don’t need to be tortured to be brilliant. “With therapeutic help, artists can still access those emotional pathways they draw their creativity from,” she said. “They simply find they’re able to use their lived experience in service of the art, rather than letting the art use them.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthEnglish National Opera (ENO)ActingOperaTheatreHealthTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not exactly. “Colds are more common in the winter, but it’s almost certainly correlation, not causation,” saysJohn Tregoning, a professor in vaccine immunology at Imperial College London.One marginal factor is that UV light can kill viruses. Sneezing outside in the summer, for example, may expose viral droplets to sunlight, which can deactivate the virus, while faster evaporation causes it to desiccate. But the main driver is behavioural: in colder months, we spend more time indoors with poorer ventilation and in closer contact with others.Data from the Covid-19 pandemic shows how much human contact matters: many other viruses largely disappeared because people weren’t interactingIs it true that… you should take vitamin C when you’ve got a cold?Read more“Different cold and flu viruses peak at different times in the winter,” says Tregoning, the author ofLive Forever? A Curious Scientist’s Guide to Wellness, Ageing and Death. “Rhinovirus spikes when kids return to school and spread germs around in small classrooms. RSV – another cold virus which is serious in elderly people and babies – peaks around new year.”Data from the Covid-19 pandemic shows how much human contact matters: many other viruses largely disappeared during lockdown because people weren’t interacting. One strain of flu evenbecame extinct due to lack of spread.That said, extreme cold can affect your susceptibility to viruses. “If you were cold all the time, losing calories and exhausted, you’d be more prone to infection,” Tregoning says. Studies also show that rhinoviruses grow a little better at cooler temperatures, and the body’s ability to defend against viruses is slightly reduced in colder air.The most effective protection? Vaccination against winter viruses such as flu and RSV. “Vaccines don’t just prevent infection – they also have wider benefits, likereducing the risk of heart attacks,” he says.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …HealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Taking care of him had been the thing that got her out of bed in the morning, and with him gone, the 76-year-old felt she’d lost her purpose.That is, until she found organizing.Inflatable frogs and ice scrapers: nine innovative ways Americans protested against Trump in 2025Read moreShortly after Gus’s death, she came across an op-ed about a new group called Third Act, focused on mobilizing older adults to protect democracy and confront the climate crisis, and figured she might as well reach out. Though the former public school educator had never been involved in any political organizing or activism before, she soon found herself serving as a volunteer coordinator at Third Act, setting up more than 120 Zoom calls over the course of 10 months to welcome people who were new to the organization and help them figure out how to plug in.At a stage of life when many people find themselves increasingly lonely, isolated and aimless, Ritter Hall began to feel more connected than ever, both to her sense of purpose and to other people. “It’s been the biggest joy of my life,” she said.View image in fullscreenLani Ritter Hall with her late husband, Gus, in 2017.Photograph: Courtesy of Lani Ritter HallRitter Hall isn’t the only one who’s had this experience: across the country, activists, organizers, mutual aid workers and volunteers are setting out to change the world for the better – and finding that the connections they make and the larger purpose they connect to often helps make their own lives better, too. From twentysomethings who celebrated “Friendsgiving” together after meeting as canvassers forZohran Mamdani, to millennials who have stayed friends since volunteering at reproductive healthcare clinics a decade ago, to elders like Ritter Hall, the country is full of people with these kinds of stories.In the context of a society so fractured that former surgeon general Vivek Murthy declared a “loneliness epidemic” – in which civic engagement and participation in social activities has been in decline for decades – movement-building spaces are offering people unique opportunities to connect to others and a sense of purpose.“Mainstream culture says you have to be productive, you have to be good enough, attractive enough, social enough – you have to be all of these things to be acceptable,” said Gabrielle Gelderman, a “movement chaplain” focused on offering spiritual and mental health support to organizers. “Movement spaces can offer a radical alternative to that, where you belong and you have something to offer, regardless of who you are, where you come from, the language you use. That’s deeply profound for people to feel a part of a community in that way.”Fighting injustice and finding communityLoneliness isn’t what prompts most people to join social movements – a desire to right something that’s wrong in the world is often where involvement starts. For Ritter Hall, seeing Roe v Wade overturned, and wondering whether other rights protected by the 14th amendment, such as same-sex and interracial marriage, might come under fire, activated her like never before.“My Gus was African American. I’m white. I was just so appalled at the thought that somebody would say that what Gus and I had had for more than 40 years could be possibly thrown out, or that other people would be denied that opportunity to have such a wonderful marriage,” she said. “It was time for me to step up and try to do something for our democracy.”But many like Ritter Hall find that by trying to push back against injustice, a sense of community also comes along the way, with relationships that can offer a compelling reason to stay involved. Emmanuel “Juni” Taranu, an organizer with the St Louis Palestine Solidarity Committee in Missouri, has likewise found movement spaces to be powerful for relationship-building. With a birth family that doesn’t see eye to eye with them about the genocide of Palestinians, Taranu has built deep, familial bonds with other people organizing on behalf of Palestinian life and dignity. One such bond is with a Palestinian American couple that Taranu looks to as mentors, whom they now consider family.View image in fullscreenRitter Hall, right, with fellow Third Act Ohio member Mary Beth Naim at the Workers Over Billionaires protest in Bainbridge, Ohio, on 1 September 2025.Photograph: Courtesy of Lani Ritter Hall“We go out to dinner together, to comedy shows, celebrate birthdays together,” said Taranu. That’s possible, they say, because there’s a deep trust that comes from working together around shared values. With the foundation of solidarity that comes from fighting for the same things, those relationships are able to take root in a deeper way.Ritter Hall has noticed her organizing relationships develop similarly. She now Zooms with some friends just to chat about their families and what they’ve been up to in their gardens. She accompanies others to nearby protests. “For the first time in my life, at 76 years old, I was out in the street protesting with a sign in front of a bank in downtown Cleveland,” she said with a laugh.According to Dr Tangela Montgomery, a psychologist and assistant professor at the University of Buffalo, this connection between community and values sets movement spaces apart from purely recreation-focused social groups. “The most amazing thing that I think activism does for the individual is give them a sense of community. If you think of someone who has a minority identity and is being oppressed, that sense of community literally can be life-saving for some people,” she said. “Seeing the group as a movement, seeing the group as a body that can change something for the better – that’s different from just sitting and having a beer with people every Saturday.”That’s not to say that getting involved in these kinds of groups is without inherent challenges. Montgomery’s research, which often focuses on queer people of color, has found that “high-risk activism” – the kind of actions you could get arrested for – can have negative mental health outcomes for participants. It makes sense: putting yourself on the frontlines means you’re “more likely to get beat up by a police officer” or ICE agent, she said, which isn’t good for anyone’s mental health. Gelderman adds that, like any organization created by human beings, movements can go awry when they push participants to self-sacrifice to the point of burnout or overwhelm.View image in fullscreenRitter Hall with Third Act staff at a conference in Minnesota in 2023.Photograph: Courtesy of Lani Ritter HallBut both practitioners would argue that’s not a reason to avoid organizing so much as it is a reason to make collective care a core value. Many organizers also strategize together about whom to send to the frontlines and whom to involve in other ways, so that particularly vulnerable members of a community don’t end up in the highest-risk situations. While police confrontations in the street or being chained to a pipeline might draw the most attention, other forms of movement-building, such as talking to neighbors about voting for a certain candidate or starting a union in the workplace, can yield powerful results.‘Weapons of mass construction’: the US ‘craftivists’ using yarn to fight back against TrumpRead moreMary Holzman-Tweed, a 48-year-old in Queens, New York, knows that relationships that arise from movement work aren’t always easy. An alcoholic who was looking for a way to heal after hitting rock bottom, she involved herself in a local mutual aid effort to build and run a food pantry during the height of pandemic lockdowns as a way to try to give back to her community. She saw isolation as part of her problem, but living with “extreme” social anxiety in combination with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects her mobility, made connecting with others – especially without alcohol – a challenge.Getting involved in the food pantry, which started out of the trunk of a volunteer’s car, was not an always-painless ticket to easy relationships. With anything that works on a consensus basis, she said, “you’re not going to like everyone you work with. They’re not all going to be your besties. But the thing that it teaches you about is how to get the work done outside that.”For her, learning to work with other people – even when it’s difficult – for the sake of something she believes in has been life-altering. The relationship skills she built through working for the food pantry have given her more confidence in other social settings, too, and now she joins local poetry readings, craft nights and book clubs, all of which she traces back to her initial involvement in the food pantry. Now, after nearly 25 years of living in her neighborhood, she feels known there in a way she never did before.“I went from being extremely isolated, and really only a recognizable face at my local bar, to walking down the street with my partner at a street festival and barely being able to move five steps before someone’s calling out my name,” she said.Five years later, Holzman-Tweed is still involved in the food pantry, and she’s proud that it’s outlasted the acute crisis that birthed it. To anyone who’s considering getting involved in a new way in a mutual aid or organizing project, she said: don’t be afraid to take the leap and start finding ways to care for your neighbors.“We have to go out and touch people, because we never know what’s going to save us,” she said.Explore more on these topicsProtest (US)Building powerActivismProtestLonelinessCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As we start a new year, the focus is back on balance, and these dishes offer both nourishment and flavour, while also being ideal for making ahead. The overnight oats are a source of fibre, the muffins are high in protein and the pie is a source of both.Pear and ginger overnight oats (pictured top)Prep5 minCook10 minSoakOvernightServes4120g rolled oats1 tsp ground cinnamon4 small pears,2 grated, 2 to garnishSalt120ml freshly squeezed orange juice(from 3-4 small oranges)2 balls stem ginger, finely chopped, plus 1½ tbsp syrup from the jar200g greek yoghurt, plus extra to serveSliced pistachios, to serve (optional)In a small bowl, mix the oats, cinnamon, grated pears and a pinch of salt. In a second bowl, stir the orange juice, chopped stem ginger and ginger syrup, then stir this and the yoghurt through the oat mix. Cover and chill overnight, either all in one bowl or in individual portions (once made, the oat mix will keep in the fridge for up to five days).In the morning, top a portion of the oats with a small spoonful of yoghurt and half a sliced pear; sliced pistachios and/or a drizzle of stem ginger syrup also make nice additions.Tortilla, spinach and sesame pieView image in fullscreenThis makes a pretty large pie, which you can absolutely halve, if you like; it freezes and reheats well, too.Prep45 minCook1 hrCool1 hrServes9-12For the spinach filling400g spinach, thoroughly washed and dried3 spring onions,trimmed and thinly sliced1 small leek,trimmed, washed and thinly sliced½ tbsp flaky sea salt½ bunch fresh dill,leaves pickedBlack pepperFor the potato filling700g white onions, peeled and thinly slicedFlaky sea salt120ml olive oil700g baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 3mm-thick slices3 medium eggs,thoroughly whisked1 lemon,juiced, plus the grated zest of ½ lemonFor assembly270g pack filo pastryOlive oil,for brushing25g white sesame seeds, to garnishHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line a roughly 37cm x 27cm metal or enamel baking tin with greaseproof paper, making sure it overhangs on each side.Put the spinach spring onions and leek in a colander in the sink, sprinkle with the salt, then toss and leave for 15 minutes. Using your hands, scrunch the spinach, onions and leeks together, squeezing out as much moisture as possible as you do so, then mix in the dill and season with black pepper.Meanwhile, sweat the onions and two teaspoons of flaky salt in the olive oil on a medium heat for about 15 minutes, until fully softened and starting to turn a little golden. Add the sliced potatoes and another teaspoon of flaky salt, gently stir to combine, then cover the frying pan and leave to cook for 15 minutes. Take off the heat and leave to cool a little, then mix in the eggs, lemon zest and juice.Layer two or three sheets of filo in the base of the lined baking tin, brushing each one with olive oil before adding the next. Tip in the potato mix, spread it out evenly, then top with the spinach mix. Make a lid for the pie with another two or three sheets of filo, again brushing each one with olive oil as you lay them in, then trim the edges with scissors. Brush the top of the pie with olive oil, sprinkle liberally with sesame seeds, then bake for an hour, turning up the heat if it’s not browning enough. Remove, leave to cool for an hour or so, then slide the pie out of the pan and on to a large board (use the paper overhang to help you).The pie will keep for up to three days in the fridge, but it’s also excellent frozen and reheated gently. To serve, use a serrated knife to cut it into portions.Corn, cottage cheese and dill muffinsView image in fullscreenPrep20 minCook35 minMakes6 large muffins100gpancettaor bacon lardons(optional)40g unsalted butter120g plain flour½ tbsp baking powder¼ tsp fine sea salt¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda150gcorn kernels, fresh or frozen2 spring onions, trimmed andthinly sliced2 tsp finely chopped fresh dill100ml buttermilk, or 85ml milk mixed with 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice1 large egg1½ tbsp maple syrup150g cottage cheeseHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line six or seven holes of a 12-hole muffin tin with muffin cases (or squares of greaseproof paper).Put the pancetta, if using, in a cold pan, set it over a medium heat, then leave the lardons to render their fat and turn golden. Add the butter and, as it melts, use a spatula to scrape down the pan, picking up all the browned bits. Set aside to cool slightly.Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and bicarb, then add in the corn, spring onions and dill, and toss to combine.In a jug, whisk the buttermilk, egg and maple syrup, then stir through the cottage cheese.Add the wet ingredients to the dry and whisk just until combined. Fold in the melted butter (with or without the crisp pancetta), then divide the mix between the lined muffin tin holes. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until golden and cooked through.The muffins will now last for three to four days, stored wrapped and at room temperature.Alexina Anatole is the author of theSmall Wins Substackand Sweet: The Secret to the Best Desserts, published by Square Peg at £27.

At that pointHMRCtold me it couldn’t find my NI number on its system and insisted on issuing me with a temporary one.I’ve been trying on and off since 2015 to get my original number back and have spent hours on hold to HMRC. I’ve sent letters and visited the HMRC offices, to no avail. I was recently told I might have to wait 86 weeks for a response.The urgency now is that I need to submit my state pension forecast application, and it is distressing to be told that I am “deceased”.JHCounty Clare, IrelandAn NI number is supposed to be for life. It’s a crucial part of modern identity and the consequences, if it goes astray, could include identity fraud or compromised tax and pensions status. I’m therefore astounded by HMRC’s insouciance.I asked it how this came to be, and how you can be brought back to life. HMRC’s response was shocking in that it managed within five days to do what it had seemingly failed to achieve in 10 years – it gave you a call, an explanation and a solution.It transpires that in 1991 it issued you with a number that already belonged to someone else. How you managed to double up for those six working years without the mistake being detected, I can’t fathom and HMRC will not say. It claims that too much time has elapsed for it to investigate how the error occurred. A decade of that time was wasted by its own inexcusable delays.Only now, with the threat of a headline prodding its behind, does it tell you to apply for a new NI number from the Department for Work andPensions. Once you have this, HMRC will retrieve and merge the personal information relating to your previous two numbers.Given its current service record and the complexity of disentangling your employment records from the deceased stranger, I have low confidence that this will happen seamlessly and soon.HMRC has offered you a pitiful £250 in compensation.

Follow these steps to stay cleanSarah SloatMon 5 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 19.03 ESTShareEnvironmentally friendly and convenient, reusable water bottles areon the rise. But on social media, people seem confused about how to clean them, and posthorrifyingpictures ofmold growing inside.Water sourced from a municipal water supply is likely very clean, explains Kelly Reynolds at the University of Arizona, who studies water quality and disease transmission.‘Let them’, creatine and fibermaxxing: the biggest wellness trends of 2025Read moreBut bacteria and viruses can make their way into a water bottle via our hands and saliva. “The water bottle itself is just the perfect environment for bacteria to grow,” says Reynolds. “It’s a little incubator.”Keeping your water bottle clean comes down to hygienic practices – but these might not be as obvious as you think. For example, in astudyof 30 people, 27 regularly replenished their water bottles without washing or rinsing them.Here’s what experts recommend.How to clean your reusable water bottleWash your hands – and wipe down your phone:Before you even get to the water bottle, you should wash your hands.“The source of the water bottle’s contamination is probably your hands,” says Reynolds.But frequent hand washing could also be moot if you don’t also wipe down your phone at least weekly, using a clothslightly dampenedwith soap and water. Cell phones collectviruses and bacteria; someresearchsuggests that at least 68% of phones are contaminated with at least some type of microorganism.Wash the bottle with soap, bleach or vinegar:Rinsing your water bottle with just water is not enough to break down biofilm, explains Reynolds.You have a few options. One is a diluted bleach rinse, either in the sink or in the dishwasher, says Reynolds. For the former, fill the sink with water, add a capful of bleach, and let the bottle sit in the mixture for a minute or two. Then rinse your bottle thoroughly with clean water. Note: use gloves, andnever mix bleachwith any other cleaners or disinfectants.Basic dishwashing soap is another alternative. Use a brush to scrub the walls of the bottle. The more crevices, bumps and lumps, the more likely “bacteria can get a stronghold and multiply”, says Reynolds. But beware anti-microbial soap, which “does not have a place in a household, period”, says Kellogg Schwab, an environmental health and engineering professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. These soaps can fuel antibiotic resistance.‘More complicated than it needs to be’: how to start hosting partiesRead moreCleaning with vinegar can reduce biofilms too, says Schwab.If you have a dishwasher, check the water bottle for the “dishwasher-safe” label first. Be aware that washing plastic in the dishwasher canrelease microplastics.Hot water can be better than cold:The difference between using cold or hot water can be minimal, but hot is generally preferred because it is better for achieving a good soap lather, Schwab says. Lather time canpositively influencewashing efficacy.Don’t forget the lid, mouthpiece or straw:These parts are frequently the most contaminated because they can trap moisture. Thus, it can be easier for micro-organisms to build up, says Schwab, who recommends using a bottle brush for these areas.Let the water bottle dry completely:Without moisture, bacteria have a harder time growing, Reynolds says.Wash regularly and sensibly:It’s generally a good routine to wash and rinse daily.“You’re not going to eat out of the same dirty cereal bowl every day,” says Reynolds. “So why would you drink out of a dirty water bottle every day?”Certain conditions increase the risk of contamination, making it important to consider our habits when regularly cleaning your water bottle. For instance, leaving it in a hot environment such as your car or window ledge allows bacteria to grow more quickly.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section'If you can see or smell something, it’s too late:Bacterial growth won’t necessarily harm you immediately, but it can cause buildup of a slimy, gel-like matrix called biofilm, explains Schwab.Biofilm can stick to surfaces like the sides of a water bottle. “Signs of biofilm could be taste and odor,” explains Schwab. “There may be a kind of musty odor that’s just not enjoyable.”If it grows for long enough, biofilm will become visible, much like mold growing in a shower. But if you can see it, you may be contending with millions to billions of micro-organisms, says Reynolds. Generally, it could take as little as a hundred micro-organisms to make you sick, she adds.“If you can see or smell biofilm, you have way too much already,” she explains. “That’s not a hygienic situation.”Bacteria are the majority of microorganisms in a biofilm, but there’s also a chance offungi, algae and viruses, says Schwab.Choose your bottle wisely:Metal and glass water bottles are more inhibitory to bacterial growth and biofilm development than plastic, explains Schwab.Regardless of the material, you must wash any water bottle regularly. “At a certain point, the bacteria can overcome a threshold of any material,” says Reynolds.What happens if you don’t clean your water bottle?Bacteria can easily grow in a moist microclimate, such as a water bottle. For example, under optimal conditions, E coli can double its population every20 minutes.How to start … anything: expert tips for trying something newRead moreReynolds and her team recently conducted a survey at a water refill station, asking people if they would allow the water in their reusable bottles to be tested. The results aren’t published yet, but early analysis suggests the water from the refill station itself was clean. The dregs of water left in bottles? Not so much. About half of the samples were contaminated with bacteria, and 10% contained E coli.In Reynolds’ 2022studyanalyzing different water sources, E coli was found in refillable water containers. Reusable bottles cleaned with soap and water had lower levels of E coli than those rinsed only with water.Drinking water that contains E coli can cause symptoms such as stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea. The risk of disease is not typically severe; still, “routine maintenance is simply good hygiene”, says Reynolds.It’s also important to clean your water bottle if you’ve been sick, because you can reinfect yourself, says Reynolds. We can build immunity to some organisms, but it’s still best practice to clean the bottle before reuse.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’d heard of people running across Africa, or the length of New Zealand, and the idea of embarking on an epic journey propelled only by my own two legs was compelling. I had just turned 50, and some might have said I was having a mid-life crisis, but I preferred to envisage it as a sort of pilgrimage – a journey in search of meaning and connection. And the obvious place to traverse, for me, was the land of my ancestors: Ireland.Most summers as a child, my Irish parents would take us “home” to Ireland, to visit relatives, sitting on sofas in small cottages, a plate of soda bread on the table, a pot of tea under a knitted cosy. Having been there many times, I thought I knew Ireland, but, really, I knew only a tiny fragment.Many days I ran alone, often through a rolling landscape of farms, cows staring at me over hedgesAnd so I concocted a mad plan to run around the entire island of Ireland. I’d start in Dublin, the birthplace of my mother, and run down through the Wicklow mountains, all the way to Cork in the far south, before making my way up theWild Atlantic Way, up past Galway, the birthplace of my father, home of the Finns, up to Donegal in the north, on through Northern Ireland, and then south to finish back in Dublin. A mere 1,400 miles. And along the way, I’d get to know Ireland more intimately.It took me just under 10 weeks, averaging over 20 miles of running a day, while my wife and 15-year-old son travelled around in a motorhome, meeting me each evening with food and our home on wheels.Many days I ran alone, often through a rolling landscape of farms, cows staring at me over hedges, the roads dotted with new-build houses picked straight, I was told, from a book calledBungalow Bliss.View image in fullscreenThe writer runs along Castlegregory Beach on the Dingle peninsula in the south-west of Ireland.Photograph: Marietta d’ErlangerOften, though, people would come out to run with me. Those were the easiest days, when the miles would slip by unnoticed, like water under a boat, the chat being the wind in our sails. Ireland is known for its warm welcome, it’s a national cliche, but we found ourselves regularly invited into people’s houses for food, or offered a bed for the night.One evening the fuse in our motorhome blew, which meant we had no water pump. And I hadn’t yet showered. I found a hardware shop that was long closed for the day, and I did something I wouldn’t dream of doing at home in England: I knocked on the door. It just seemed that in Ireland you can do that sort of thing. Sure enough, a man opened it, not at all put out, and found me the right fuse in his shop drawer. He didn’t even charge me.Often people would come out to run with me. Those were the easiest days, when the miles would slip by unnoticed, like water under a boatVirtually every town or village we stopped in had a pub seemingly lost in time, wood-panelled walls covered in random objects and pictures, a happy buzz emanating from people sitting in their cosy nooks. We learned to look for the handwritten sign in the pub window: “Trad session tonight.” It was never a performance, as such, but just whoever turned up that evening, sitting in one corner, playing their fiddles, guitars and accordions, chatting among themselves between songs.View image in fullscreenThe author ran past Eagles Rock in County Leitrim.Photograph: ShutterstockIreland has a lot of space. I hesitate to call it wild space, as it is one of the least biodiverse countries in the world, with barely any remaining natural forest. But I would often find myself running all day up and over mountains, or along stretches of coastline, without meeting a single other person. One memorable day, I ascendedKnocknadobar in Kerry, one of Ireland’s many “holy mountains” (of whichCroagh Patrickin Mayo is the most famous). These are known pilgrimage routes, and along the trail were 14 crosses with depictions of Jesus signifying the 14 Stations of the Cross. Despite not being religious, as I made my way up the mountain in the rain, the story of Jesus struggling on, being whipped each time he dropped his cross, picking it up and carrying on, began to resonate with my own struggle, and I felt it pushing me on.What burden was I carrying, I began to wonder. I’d been in a low mood all that day, grumbling about the weather, the long roads, the endless running. But I decided to put all that down, and instead be grateful for where I was; that I was able to be out here; that my body was healthy and strong enough to do this. And in that moment – I kid you not – the clouds parted, and below the swooping drop of the mountain the sea appeared. I felt my spirits lift as I raced to the top and down the other side. To complete the sense of the entire day being an allegory in itself, at the bottom I found myself in a tropical garden, complete with palm trees and waterfalls, the day now warm and humid, basking in sunshine.View image in fullscreenThe writer takes a rest outside a traditional cottage.Photograph: Adharanand FinnHad I emerged from the mountain into paradise? Not quite. It turned out it was the RHS award-winningKells Bay House and Gardens.One of Ireland’s hidden gems is theBeara peninsula, straddling Cork and Kerry, and one of the most spectacular sections of theBeara Waytrail is the path from Adrigole toGlengarriff. Here, the mountains are pointy and lush, like something from a Japanese painting. The trail also passes through a rare section of native Irish forest in theGlengarriff nature reserve, and ends at the beautifulBlue Pool, a tidal harbour complete with a purpose-built bathing area.Alas, I arrived as the tide was out, so there was no chance of a cooling dip, but I did find many other swimming spots on my run around Ireland. Of course, there were some stunning beaches, such as the white sands ofDerrynane Beachin Kerry that, on a less windy day, could pass as a tropical beach in the South Pacific. I also found myself dipping in numerous lakes and waterfalls, such as the serene Poulanassy waterfall in Kilkenny.I came away feeling that I had been taken in and looked after by IrelandNorthern Irelandalso has some wonderful coastline, and I was lucky to have two days of glorious sunshine as I ran along the north Antrim coast. The Giant’s Causeway is truly one of the most extraordinary landscapes, but there are other, less explored sections of coast, such as the area around Ballintoy Point, a fantastical array of rocky outcrops and hidden sandy coves. I don’t know if it was the power of the evening light on a late summer evening after 20-odd miles of running, but as I passed through it, I wanted to lie down on the grass and never leave.View image in fullscreen‘Virtually every town or village we stopped in had a pub seemingly lost in time.’Photograph: Marietta d’ErlangerRunning as much as I did, I never dwelt long in any one place, and while I saw so much, my experiences were, by their nature, mostly fleeting. It felt as though I was getting an impressionistic image of Ireland. And the impression I got was of a country at ease, in no big rush to be anywhere else, letting the world in for a cup of tea and a chat, and a bit of music.As for my own journey, and my sense of pilgrimage, I had set off not knowing if I could even run that far. There were times of struggle, and moments of transcendence, but most of all I came away feeling that I had been taken in and looked after by Ireland. The last day, headed into Dublin, I was joined by about 30 runners from across the country and we sang Molly Malone at the tops of our voices as we ran alongside the River Liffey, finishing at Ha’Penny Bridge, much to the bemusement of passing tourists. And then afterwards, we all went to the pub, where I enjoyed a Guinness.Adharanand Finn has written three books on running:Running with the Kenyans;The Way of the Runner; andThe Rise of the Ultra Runners(published by Guardian Faber)Explore more on these topicsIreland holidaysNorthern Ireland holidaysRunning holidaysFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Given that I’m someone who likes to have backup plans for my backup plans, my initial response was panic. Now what? I wandered aimlessly from room to room, grumpily tidying away random items.Noticing for the first time in weeks that most of myhouseplantswere critically ill, I decided to give them a spa day. I moved the worst cases to a south-facing windowsill and painstakingly removed the (many) dead leaves. For good measure, I organised a triage box containing plant food, a mister and a watering can. I might have got carried away and ordered a “beautifying leaf shine” too.View image in fullscreen‘My botanical A&E session instilled a soothing sense of nesting’ … Pottering at home can aid rest.Photograph: Dmitrii Marchenko/Getty ImagesIt’s a funny thing, isn’t it, how we often hurtle through life fuelled by busyness and adrenaline, secretly yearning for rest. But when the opportunity finally arises, it feels uncomfortable. Somehow, though, my botanical A&E session instilled a soothing sense of nesting. It was getting dark and, feeling weirdly smug, I went round replacing the missing bulbs in various lamps and turned the lights down low. Snoozing on the sofa under an electric throw and half listening to a podcast, I spent the rest of the day in this dozy state. After dinner, I decided to have an early night. I slept better than I had in ages.Despite the palpable benefits, my initial reluctance to slow down is not unusual.Researchhas shown that people often underestimate the extent to which they will enjoy inactivity. There’s a tendency for human beings to prefer to do something, even something unpleasant, than the alternative. This was proved to an extraordinary degree by Harvard University psychologistswhose studyrevealed that given the choice between sitting alone with their thoughts for as little as six to 15 minutes or giving themselves an electric shock, participants preferred to be zapped.There is always something to occupy us; we are connected all the time. The opportunity to do nothing rarely arisesSo why is it that so many of us have an aversion to idleness? “It’s not even an aversion, I think it probably doesn’t even occur to a lot of people,” saysGabrielle Treanor, author ofThe 1% Wellness Experiment.“Nowadays there is always something to occupy us. We are connected to everything all the time,” she says. “So the opportunity to do nothing rarely arises.” Social media, for one, is constantly bombarding us with ideas for new things to do. “We’re inspired by ways to do up our house or places to visit or new things to try. It’s easy to feel that life offers endless possibilities. We try to cram everything into our days.”A lot of us are all too aware of the extra things we feel we ought to be doingThere’s another factor: guilt – particularly about appearing to be lazy. Increasingly, being busy carries a sense of status and moral superiority. “Many of us grew up with the phrase ‘the devil will find work for idle hands’,” says Treanor. “And a lot of us are all too aware of the extra things we feel we ought to be doing. We’re trying to live up to the idea of being a great parent, a great son or daughter, a great colleague or employer, a great friend. All that combined is pretty weighty and it makes it impossible to be OK with doing not very much at all, even for a little while.”Of course, one person’s idea of doing nothing is another’s concept of a busy afternoon. I have an office mate who regularly skulks off to a quiet corner for a mid-afternoon siesta. Meanwhile, a neighbour of mine often talks about having spent the weekend doing “nothing much” before cataloguing a long list of fitness classes, brunches and catching up with work deadlines.The art of doing nothing: have the Dutch found the answer to burnout culture?Read moreMany of us simply fear boredom. Sandi Mann is a psychologist at the University of Lancashire and author ofThe Science of Boredom. Her research revealed that boredom, far from being a bad thing, can make us more creative. A group of participants was given the tedious task of copying out numbers from a telephone directory. At the end, they were asked to come up with as many uses as possible for a plastic cup. They performed better than the control group. But then a second group were given a much duller assignment, to simply read the numbers aloud, and they did even better at creative brainstorming.“When we are bored, our brain is frantically searching for neural stimulation, and everyone has a different level that’s optimal for them,” says Mann. “So when we’re bored, and there’s nothing to do, and we can’t meet the level of neural stimulation that we need externally, our brains will kind of search internally, within our own minds for it, and that’s why we start mind wandering and daydreaming. These two states have been linked to creativity.”The reason is that when the brain zones out, it has access to the default mode network. “It’s not like night dreaming, but we are still in this kind of semiconscious state which allows the brain to make connections and come up with ideas that it wouldn’t have done when more awake,” says Mann.When we’re alert and fully rational, our critical, judging mind is ruling the show. Or as Mann puts it: “If you’re daydreaming, you haven’t got that inhibition, that voice in your head saying, ‘Don’t be silly, that’s a ridiculous idea!’ Instead, our minds are free to roam outside the box looking for things we wouldn’t necessarily come up with when we are more conscious.”View image in fullscreen‘Simply sit and watch the world go by’ … Doing nothing is good for you.Photograph: Justin Paget/Getty ImagesMann goes as far as to suggest we should schedule activities that allow us to be productively unproductive into our daily routines, especially if we have got a conundrum we want to solve. “You want to do something that uses up the least amount of cognitive load as possible. Going for an aimless walk is good (as long as you know where you’re going). Or, find somewhere to lie down and simply stare up at the clouds or somewhere to sit and watch the world go by.”She warns against confusing mindless pursuits with mindful ones though. “Watching TV, or swiping and scrolling online, doesn’t boost creativity. Quite the contrary. They engage the brain and stifle daydreaming. Similarly with writing, doodling or drawing: these activities do still take up some cognitive load. However, with the latter, say you’re in a really boring work meeting, those would be really good activities to try.”Ah yes, work. This is one area where doing nothing is obviously a bad idea. Karoline Schubert at Friedrich Schiller University Jena has studied the impact of corporate idleness. She cites American research that shows the average worker is idle for more than a fifth of the working day waiting around for tasks. This could range from a call centre operator waiting for the phone to ring to anyone logging in and waiting for a computer update to load. Her paperWhat to Do When There Is Nothing to Dolooks at how we might best harness this dead time.“What we know is that idle time at work tends to have negative effects. It can reduce people’s wellbeing and their performance. It is linked to boredom, which is not surprising, but also to fatigue. It’s not just frustrating or dull, it actually drains people’s mental resources,” she says.Schubert’s research revealed that there was a big difference between anticipated downtime and unexpected stretches of doing nothing. “In some jobs, downtime happens a lot. We interviewed one woman who typically had about six hours of it in an eight-hour work day. So she went to work expecting that. She made the best of it, offering to help colleagues, watering the office plants and even learning a new language.”If you want to get better at being productively unproductive, there are strategies. “See it as an experiment and bring some lightness and play into it,” suggests Treanor. “Especially if you are someone who feels panicky when your phone battery is running out, wondering how you are going to spend your time. I think a lot of us on a long train journey will have the sensation of wondering how on earth we are going to pass the time. It’s fear of the unknown.”Try removing your headphones when you are out walking … You are more likely to notice your thoughtsRather than setting yourself up for failure by pledging to take 2o minutes of staring into space every morning, Treanor suggests starting small. “If you walk the dog every day wearing headphones or chatting to a friend, remove a layer. Try going without. You are more likely to notice your thoughts even though you are still doing something. Or play a game of noticing something new on each walk, even if it’s only a new shop or the way a little kid is skipping along the road.”If you’re feeling really brave, she suggests going cold turkey and sitting doing nothing for two minutes. “Be proud of yourself for having a go. Acknowledge that it’s really hard and uncomfortable. You don’t have to judge yourself for not enjoying it. Next time you could try for longer.”That’s a lovely idea, which I will certainly try sometime. But right now, I’ve got some plants to resuscitate.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHow to have a better dayHealth & wellbeingMental healthMeditationMindfulnessPsychologyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here it is again with the solution.Middle managementAndy, Bea, and Celine have a jar of ten cookies. They will take turns putting their hands in the jar to take out cookies for themselves. Andy is first, then Bea, then Celine. On each turn, they can take as many as they like.They agree to the following conditions:1) No one wants to end up with the most, or the least number of cookies. (To have the most looks greedy, to have the least looks lame.) Finishing with joint most, or joint least, is as undesirable as finishing with most or least.2) They want as many cookies as possible. (Always better to have as many cookies as you can.)If condition 1 has priority over condition 2, but both are desirable, how many cookies does each friend end up with?The friends are not allowed to communicate or form alliances. They do not need to take all the pieces, and one or more could take nothing. Assume that they are acting rationally and in their best interests.SolutionAndy will take 4 cookies, Bea takes 6, Celine is left with none.WorkingsSay Andy takes 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 cookies. He will end up having the most cookies, which fails condition 1. So he doesn’t do that.Say Andy takes 5 cookies. Bea will take 4, which means she will end in the middle and Andy still fails condition 1. So he doesnt do that either.Say Andy takes 4 pieces. Bea cannot fulfil condition 1. (If Bea takes, 1 or 2 , then Celine takes 3 and Celine wins. If Bea takes 3, Celine will take 3, and both have joint-least. If Bea takes 4 or more she will have the most, or joint most, cookies.) So, Bea realises her best outcome is to fulfil condition 2. She takes all the remaining cookies, and Celine is left with 0.If Andy wins by taking 4 pieces, he is not going to take any less pieces – since that falls foul of condition 2. He wantsbothto be middle, and to have as many cookies as possible. So he takes 4 pieces.I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzle. Live long and prosper.

I am not guilty. I am a decent man,” Maduro said in Spanish during repeated attempts to speak over the judge.As he entered the courtroom, shackled at the ankles though not at the wrists, he looked toward the jury box. Before sitting down, Maduro told the public gallery “Happy new year!” in English.Maduro was dressed in orange slippers, a blue shirt on top of a neon orange shirt, and beige pants. He scribbled notes on a legal pad throughout the hearing.He faces four US federal criminal counts, including “narco-terrorism” conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy and possession of machine guns and destructive devices. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.He was first indicted in 2020, along with 14 members of his inner circle, as part of a sprawling drug-trafficking case against Venezuelan officials and Colombian guerrillas.Defence lawyer Barry Pollack made no immediate application for bail, but said he would later file a motion alluding to the “military abduction” he said his client was subjected to.Flores, the Venezuelan first lady was also captured in the pre-dawn raid on Saturday in which at least 40 people were killed, including civilians and Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel.Her lawyer, Mark Donnelly, said she sustained “significant injuries during her abduction” and required medical examination for “severe bruising” on her ribs.Flores, who had large Band-Aids on her temple and forehead, said, when she entered her own not guilty plea, she was “completely innocent”.The pair were earlier brought to the court under tight security from the notorious Metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn, whose previous residents include Jeffrey Epstein associateGhislaine Maxwell, Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, and the singer Diddy.The jail also once held the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted on drug smuggling charges in 2024 –only to be pardoned by Trump last month.Maduro and Flores were transferred to a helicopter for a brief flight to Manhattan thenescortedby heavily armed law-enforcement personnel into an armoured vehicle and transferred to the courthouse, where rival groups of Maduro’s supporters and opponents clashed outside.The surreal spectacle of the 63-year-old president of a sovereign foreign nation in a US courtroom, partially shackled and wearing a blue shirt on top of a neon orange prison scrub and khaki trousers, evoked the the 1991 trial of the Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega and the2006 public trialof Iraq’s leader Saddam Hussein.Thecriminal indictmentunveiled Saturday by US attorney general Pam Bondi echoed Trump’s claims that his unilateral military intervention in Venezuela was necessary to stem a flow of drugs into the US.“Maduro and his co-conspirators have, for decades, partnered with some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world, and relied on corrupt officials throughout the region, to distribute tons of cocaine to the US,” the indictment alleges.Strikes by theUS militaryon alleged “narco boats” in the months before Saturday’s raid in Venezuela have resulted in at least 110 deaths, leading some legal experts to question if the attacks amounted to war crimes.But Trump has also justified Maduro’s abduction as a way for the US to seize “stolen” oil from Venezuela, and promised that the US would “run” Venezuela for the foreseeable future while American energy companies take control of the country’srich oil reserves.In Venezuela, Maduro’s son Nicolás Maduro Guerra, an elected official, told the national assembly that the US had “kidnapped” his father.Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s deputy who was sworn in to succeed him on Monday, appeared to drop her initially defiant response to the attack,offering to work with the US, hours after Trump threatened that she could “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she did not bend to his wishes.Trump’s moves, meanwhile, sparked a global wave of revulsion, and fears that the bombing in Caracas – which he hasthreatened to repeatif Venezuela does not cooperate – could extend to action in other countries with which he is at odds, notably Colombia, Cuba and Iran. That would mark a return to past “naked imperialism” by the US in Latin America, Alan McPherson, a history professor at Temple University,told the Guardian.Tensions with Colombia ramped up further on Monday when its president, Gustavo Petro, said his country would “take up arms” if Trump acted on his threat of military action there.At Monday’s emergency meeting of the UN security council, Guterres, in a statement read out by a diplomat, said he was “deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability [in Venezuela], the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted”.He added: “I remain deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS attack on VenezuelaVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS militaryAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Before sitting down, Maduro told the public gallery “Happy new year!” in English.His wife, Cilia Flores, followed shortly after, and she had two large Band-Aids on her face; on the temple and forehead. Maduro was dressed in a blue shirt on top of a neon orange shirt, in khaki pants, and Flores’s jailhouse clothing reflected a similar color scheme.Maduro and Flores were present for their arraignment in a narco-terrorism case brought by Donald Trump’s justice department. They both put on headphones, as they were provided live English-to-Spanish translation of the proceedings. Maduro sometimes glanced down at his indictment and, at various points, scribbled on notebook paper.Hellerstein made a joke about being short, and how “modern electronic equipment hides the judge”. Proceedings started in earnest with an exchange of greetings that did little to hint at the enormous significance of the events playing out in the room.“Good morning, Mr Maduro,” Hellerstein said. Maduro gestured in response.9:48Can Trump really run Venezuela? | The LatestAs Hellerstein summed up the charges in this indictment, Maduro could be seen shaking his head slightly, as if in disagreement with the allegations. Hellerstein asked him to confirm his name, as is routine at these proceedings.Maduro said “I amNicolás MaduroMoros” and then launched into a diatribe about his political position, insisting that he was president of the constitutional republic of Venezuela. “I am here, kidnapped since 3 January,” he said. “I was captured in my home.”Hellerstein told Maduro that there would be a time and a place to make these arguments. He asked again: are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?”“I am Nicolás Maduro Moros,” he said again. Maduro said he had the charging papers in his hand for “the first time” and did not need them read in court, as he wanted to do that on his own.Maduro’s demeanor while standing could be described as subtly defiant. Sometimes Maduro rested his knuckles on the table. For a few moments, Maduro’s hands were clasped as if in prayer, but with his index fingers pointing forward, in Hellerstein’s direction.He entered a fulsome not guilty plea shortly thereafter – voicing both asoy inocenteand ano soy culpable.After Maduro sat down, the beleaguered leader’s defense attorney made a mouth with his hand and shook his head.This was an apparent warning from his lawyer. Maduro needed to keep his diatribes to himself.Then came Flores. She described herself as the first lady ofVenezuela.No culpable, she said,completamente inocente. “Not guilty, completely inocente.”What’s in the US criminal indictment against Nicolás Maduro?Read moreAt one point not long after, Maduro had yet another thing to say in court. “I would like to make a request, your honor,” he said.Maduro did not want anyone taking his notes away, as he wanted them. “Can I have my notes?” The prosecution said they would work with jail officials to make sure he has his notebooks.Neither Maduro nor his wife requested bail at this point, but reserved the right to request pre-trial release at a later time. He and his wife’s attorneys did request medical care for them.Flores’s attorney said that during “her abduction” she suffered “multiple” injuries, including a potential rib fracture.Hellerstein scheduled a conference in the case for 17 March. When Maduro got up to exit, he tucked a pen into his notepad. A US marshal noticed and took the pen from him.Someone from the audience shouted out – accusing Maduro of being an illegitimate president. As Maduro stepped through the door into a hallway, he insisted: “I’m a kidnapped president – a prisoner of war!”Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS attack on VenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS politicsVenezuelaAmericasNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the US president’s Venezuelan adventure, whisking its leader out of the country after a late-night raid, has pushed that cautious approach to its limits.The clues were all there. Ever since Trump confirmed that he had authorised the CIA to conductcovert operations in Venezuelaagainst drug traffickers – andblockaded oil tankers– the military campaign had been mounting.But despite the US president’s threats to oust Nicolás Maduro, some on the UK side had put them in the same “unbelievable” category as Trump’s promise to bring peace to Ukraine on his first day in the White House, orplans to develop a “Gaza Riviera”.When the dramatic raid did finally happen, with Trump saying theVenezuelan had been seizedfor “narco-terrorism”, the UK prime minister took 16 hours to respond publicly, and even then it was a masterclass in hedging his bets.“We regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime,” Starmer said, but then – as might be expected from a former human rights lawyer – reiterated his support for international law.The UK government has continued this approach since: say as little as possible that might offend Trump; leave it to the US to explain the legal justification for the move; and, in the words of one aide, “recognise that it’s not our fight”.Labour’s political opponents on its progressive wing – the Lib Dems and the Greens – have piled pressure on the government to condemn the US action.Downing Street gives short shrift to the idea – suggested most forcibly on its own side by Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee – that a lack of western condemnationmight embolden China and Russia.“Comparisons between the developments over the weekend and the full scale invasion of a sovereign, democratic state is a bad comparison,” Starmer’s spokesperson said.Even the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, took a stronger line, suggesting Trump had indeed violated international law by capturing Maduro (but adding that “it may be a good thing” if it made Russia and China think twice).The government is – apparently – unwilling to rock the boat when a multibillion-pound trade deal and peace in Ukraine are at stake. “We’re taking the realpolitik route,” one insider said.But some senior government officials, including in the Foreign Office, are uncomfortable at the extent of what they see as fence-sitting as the UK’s unreliable ally over the Atlantic wreaks yet more havoc on the international order.“Nobody thinks Maduro was a good guy, or that he should have been in power,” one said. “But effectively kidnapping a head of state to achieve regime change sets you on a dangerous path.”Some on the political side have also privately voiced concerns. “If we let this happen without condemning it then where does it stop? Colombia? Cuba? Even Greenland? Where does Trump strike next?” one minister questioned.Downing Street insiders – perhaps conscious of alarm over Trump’s actions among Labour MPs – insist the UK would take a more robust approach if a European ally were ever threatened.Starmer haspublicly backed the Danish prime ministerafter she demanded the US stop its threats to forcibly take over Greenland, which is largely autonomous but remains part of the Danish kingdom, for security and mineral resources.The foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, later told MPs: “The future of Greenland is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes – and no one else.”Starmer – who has been trying to call Trump since Friday night’s attack – is due to finally speak to the US president after a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” in Paris on Tuesday. Their tone is likely to be emollient.The prime minister has told colleagues that one day, there may come a time when he finally needs to take a tough stance against Trump – but this does not yet appear to be that moment.“Any decision like that comes with a choice,” Starmer told them, according to sources. “Are we willing to risk damaging our most important economic and national security partnerships as a result? We need to weigh up the cost to our own interests.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaKeir StarmerAmericasForeign policyDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroanalysisShareReuse this content"

I hope that by eating auspicious tuna, as many people as possible will feel energised.”The 510.3m yen price at the new year auction was the highest since comparable data started being collected in 1999. The previous record was 333.6m yen for a 278kg bluefin in 2019 after the market moved from its traditional Tsukiji area in central Tokyo to a more modern facility. The top bidder last year paid 207m yen for a 276kg bluefin.Shortly after this year’s auction, the tuna was butchered and turned into sushi for Kimura’s restaurant chain, selling for about 500 yen (£2.40) a roll.“I feel like I’ve begun the year in a good way after eating something so auspicious as the year starts,” 19-year-old Minami Sugiyama told Agence France-Presse from a table at a Kimura restaurant in Tsukiji.Fellow customer Kiyoshi Nishimura agreed. “Even without dipping it in soy sauce, there’s sweetness. And the richness, the texture – it just makes you feel happy,” said the 40-year-old Shinto priest.New year tunas commanded only a fraction of their usual top prices during the pandemic as restaurants scaled back operations.Explore more on these topicsJapanFoodFishRestaurantsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Heavy snowfall hit parts of eastern and central Europe on New Year’s Eve, notably in Poland and Ukraine, with similar conditions across the Alps on the first few days of the year.The cold is likely to continue this week as an Arctic air mass sinks south across Europe, pulling temperatures well below the seasonal average outside south-east Europe. Temperatures are expected to fall widely by about 5C (41F) below average, with some areas – such as parts of central and north-eastern Europe – up to 10C lower than the norm. When wind chill is taken into account, it will feel even colder.InSouth Korea, the cold air mass brought snow, with Jeju island experiencing the greatest disruption. Flights and ferries were cancelled due not only to snow amounts, which reached more than 9cm in Jeju City, but also because of strong winds and significant wind shear.Corsica was also struck by remarkably strong winds. Gusts of about 60mph battered the heavily populated town of L’Île-Rousse, while gusts approaching 100mph were recorded in the Cap Corse region, a peninsula in the north-east of the island.Although the Mistral wind regularly affects Corsica, the current atmospheric setup is not a textbook Mistral event. High pressure positioned in the Atlantic, farther north than usual, drove stable cold air southward acrossFrance. At the same time, a low-pressure system developed in the Gulf of Genoa.The contrast between these two systems funnelled cold air through the confined constraints of the Rhône valley, causing it to accelerate rapidly in a Venturi-like fashion. The wind then burst over the Gulf of Lion, curved eastward around the base of the low-pressure system and was directed towards the Balagne and Cap Corse regions of Corsica.Explore more on these topicsEuropeWeather trackerSouth KoreaFranceAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

No one has been charged criminally with regard to the allegations in the lawsuit.Global e-casino Stake has dismissed the claims as “nonsense” and said it was “not concerned” about the lawsuit.Two women in the US state Virginia have filed a class action seeking US$5m from e-casino Stake.com, the celebrities and another Australian internet personality for alleged breaches of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) and consumer protection laws.Stake.com, a Curacao-licensed global e-casino, is officially banned in dozens of countries including the US, Australia andthe UK.Its American arm, Stake.us, does not allow users to gamble directly with real money. Wagerers play with e-tokens – some are provided for free while others can be purchased and withdrawn as cryptocurrency.The class action, filed on Wednesday, alleges Stake.us’s anonymised design enabled Drake to fund purchases of automated streams, artificially inflating his royalties and popularity on music streaming platforms, including Spotify.Court documents allege Drake and Ross hid the financing from public view by transferring gambling winnings via Stake’s anonymised tip system to an Australian man, named in court documents as George Nguyen, who allegedly operates the online accounts grandwizardchatn**** and Grandavious.A Stake spokesperson said on Monday US time: “For the record, Stake.us does not have a tipping function that could be used in this way. This is a nonsense claim and we are not concerned about this lawsuit.”Nguyen, who has posted promoting Drake and the gambling platform, allegedly traded between the Stake proceeds, cash and cryptocurrency to pay bot vendors for artificial music streams on behalf of Drake and Ross.The lawsuit alleges Drake transferred millions of dollars as part of the scheme, including in the form of $100,000 and $10,000 tips to Ross. The lawsuit also alleges public posts, chat logs and leaked communications prove Nguyen’s role.The class action claims the scheme dates back to 2022 and “remains an ongoing and imminent threat of racketeering activity”. Drake, Ross and Nguyen were contacted for comment.The suit also alleges Stake, with Drake and Ross, deliberately misled consumers to believe the platform was legal and harmless.The lead plaintiffs, Tiffany Hines and LaShawnna Ridley, alleged they suffered serious harm after Drake’s promotions encouraged them to gamble on Stake. The platform had financially harmed users by encouraging them to gamble illegally and leaving them vulnerable to addiction, the class action claimed.A Missouri man in October brought a similar case against Stake, Drake and Ross, which Ross at the time dismissed as “bullshit”.Stake.us faces lawsuits in other US states claiming it has operated illegally. Responding to an August case brought by the Los Angeles city attorney, Stake’s Australian parent company, Easygo, told The Australian: “We reject allegations that have been made in the media in relation to this potential claim and will vigorously defend this and all such claims.”Since 2022, Drake has promoted Stake on Instagram and on Kick, the Easygo-owned livestreaming platform, including a post in June revealing he had gambled $124.5m and lost $8.2m in a month.“Gotta share the other side of gambling… Losses are so fried right now,” he captioned the story post.“I hope I can post a big win for you all soon.”The rapper in December promoted hours-long livestreams on Kick with a post captioned: “Can we end my roughest gambling year on a good note?? I want to MAXWIN and share 10% of it with you. Go to Stake to find out how you can enter to win that pot.”The lawsuit alleges Stake has paid Drake $100m a year and provided free gambling credit to the rapper and Ross.Ross, a 25-year-old internet personality andprofessional livestreamer, moved to a rival e-casino, Rainbet, and quit Stake in 2025, telling viewers he would continue streaming on Kick due to his friendship with its 30-year-old founderEd Craven.Craven, hailed by Forbes as Australia’s youngest billionaire with an estimated $2.8bn fortune (A$4.2bn), co-founded Kick in Melbourne in 2022 with Bijan Tehrani after their success with Stake. The platformdrew regulatory attentionin August after hosting a livestream during which a man died in France.In Australia,Gambling Help Onlineis available on 1800 858 858.

Because Australians deserve no less.”Ley said the opposition was prepared to support a crackdown on hate speech laws but was yet to be briefed on the details of the legislation.The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said while the calls for a royal commission “come overwhelmingly from a good place” they would not shift the government’s position.Chalmers reiterated the focus was on “urgent and immediate” steps, which included the new hate speech and gun laws, Dennis Richardson’sreview of intelligence and security agencies, responding to Jillian Segal’s antisemitism review and assisting the looming state-based royal commission in NSW.“The government is taking a number of steps. We know that the world is watching, because what happened at Bondi last month was such a horrifying event, and the urgent and the immediate actions that we are taking are really important when it comes to us learning from and responding to this attack,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsAnthony AlbaneseBondi beachBondi beach terror attackSussan LeyCoalitionGun controlnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not an insult … because there is a growing sense of concern and alarm in the United States about the fact that Europe’s economic, relative economic decline as a share of the global GDP is a crisis.“There is a degree of alarm in Washington about the need for serious reforms in order to jolt the European economy back to life. We think it’s possible with the right reforms.”The changes the US was seeking, Helberg said, centred on the opportunity to “drastically simplify and reduce the regulatory burden in Europe”, which he claimed would free up talent and capital on the European continent and attract US investment.The US has repeatedly threatened not to lift50% steel tariffs on the EUif the bloc does not roll back on tech legislation hitting its billionaires including Elon Musk.Helberg said the bloc was falling way behind other leading economies such as the US and Washington desired a strong Europe to maintain the “historic 70-year plus of a transatlantic alliance”.Countries such as Italy and Germany are experiencing modest GDP growth. Germany recordedno growth in the third quarter of 2025, while it was projected to grow 1.3% in 2026 and 1.4% in 2027.Overallthe bloc’s own estimatesproject growth of 1.4% for 2025 and 1.5% in 2027.By comparisonthe US economy roseat an annualised rate of 4.3% in the third quarter of 2025, rebounding aftera contractionin the first three months of the year amid fears over the impact of Trump’s tariff strategy.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS national securityEuropeEconomicsEuropean UnionUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Harmondsworth is one of two detention centres close to Heathrow airport in London.The asylum seekers, who come from a variety of conflict zones including Sudan, Afghanistan and Iran, accuse the Home Office of subjecting them to arbitrary detention, denial of legal representation, inadequate medical care, degrading treatment and severe psychological harm. They say they came to UK “in the pursuit of safety, dignity and a chance to live a peaceful life”.They are calling on the UN and human rights groups to urgently investigate conditions that people detained for deportation under the “one in, one out” scheme are held in.The report’s circulation coincides withnew government powerscoming into force to seize mobile phones carried by people who arrive in the UK on small boats to examine them for information about people smugglers. One offence that under the new powers could lead to a sentence of up to five years in jail is “collecting information that is of use to those planning an illegal crossing”, which could include checking the weather forecast to identify favourable times to cross the Channel.Despite a series of measures to tackle people-smuggling gangs using small boats to bring asylum seekers to the UK since Labour came to power, 2025 had the second-highest number of crossings on record withmore than 41,000 peoplereaching the UK on small boats.According to the UN’s International Organization forMigration(IOM), the number of deaths among those in northern France hoping to reach UK was significantly lower than in 2024 despite the increase in crossings. More than 36,000 crossed in 2024 and at least 85 deaths were recorded, while 36 deaths were documented in 2025.The first return flight toFranceof 2026 under the “one in, one out” scheme is due on Wednesday. According to the most recent figures issued by the Home Office, 193 people have been sent to France in the first three months of the scheme, while in turn 195 have been brought here legally. This represents less than a quarter of the 803 people who crossed the Channel in small boats in a single day on 20 December.According to the report, detainees say they were not given sufficient time to rest, recover or receive psychological support following traumatic journeys and their Home Office interview, with some not having seen or spoken to their families since detention began.They add that along with not receiving adequate medical treatment for a range of physical ailments, the psychological impact of detention has been profound. The report states: “Many detainees are young adults between the ages of 17 and 30. Detainees report widespread depression, anxiety, insomnia, and emotional breakdowns.“There have been multiple incidents involving individuals experiencing severe mental health crises, including self-harm attempts. Detainees report being placed in isolation or disciplinary units. This environment has created constant fear, despair, and uncertainty, with detainees expressing that they feel dehumanised and invisible.”The detainees say their treatment since arriving in the UK violates fundamental principles of human rights, dignity and due process and amounts to being punished for seeking protection. “The authors of this report ask not for privilege, but for fairness, humanity, and freedom. They ask to be seen, heard, and treated as human beings,” the report states.The UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, said: “In line with our mandate, UNHCR can play a constructive role in supporting the development and implementation of international arrangements concerning the transfer of refugees and asylum seekers – including the UK–France pilot.“We welcome ongoing engagement with both governments aimed at ensuring that any such arrangements uphold international protection standards, are viable at scale, and ultimately contribute to strengthened refugee protection and the rights‑based management of movements. In the UK, this includes visits to the immigration removal centres and ongoing dialogue with the Home Office.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We do not recognise the claims relating to conditions at Harmondsworth. We regard the welfare of people detained in our care as being of utmost importance.“Protecting the UK border is our top priority. Our landmark one in, one out scheme means we can now send those who arrive on small boats straight back to France – striking at the heart of the criminal gangs’ business model.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeFranceMigrationRefugeesLondonHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

I will stay in the system to carry out operations that continue to inflict maximum damage on the enemy. A strong, modern intelligence service is key to our state’s security.”Zelenskyy said that Malyuk, who was responsible for last year’s daring destruction of Russia’s strategic bombers,known as Operation Spiderweb, would be reassigned to overseeing unconventional warfare.He said: “I had a meeting with Vasyl Maliuk. I thanked him for his combat service and proposed that he focus on this line of work specifically.“There must be more Ukrainian asymmetric operations against the occupier and the Russian state and more solid results in eliminating the enemy.“This is where Vasyl is at his strongest, and this is exactly what he will continue to do within the Security Service of Ukraine.”Malyuk was lauded last June when a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles emerging from lorries struck strategic bombers on airfields deep inside Russia, causing an estimated $7bn in damage.His agency has also been credited with a series of assassinations of senior members of Russia’s military command.He had reportedly refused to stand down after a meeting with Zelenskyy on Saturday, prompting a range of voices, including the commander of Ukraine’s drone operations to call for his retention.It was argued that Malyuk’s removal would make Ukraine’s security services less effective. He reportedly rejected offers of a new role within the Foreign Intelligence Service or the National Security and Defense Council, which coordinates Ukraine’s security efforts with the president’s office.There remains confusion as to why Zelenskyy wanted Malyuk’s removal. The president has claimed that he needs fresh faces around him after four years of war.The Ukrainska Pravda newspaper, which boasts of sources close to Malyuk, reported that the spy chief’s dismissal was an act of revenge orchestrated by Andriy Yermak, the president’s former chief of staff.Yermak’s apartment was searched as part of an anti-corruption operation in November. He subsequently resigned, although he was never formally accused of wrongdoing.Others within the government believe that Zelenskyy has an eye on the next presidential election and is keen to clear the decks of prominent and popular figures.Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who had been talked up as a possible successor to Zelenskyy, was dismissed from his position as head of Ukraine’s army in 2024.He was appointed as ambassador to the UK where he has kept a low profile.Malyuk has been temporarily replaced by Maj Gen Yevhen Khmara, who was head of the SBU’s elite Alpha special operations unit.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It said 29 protesters, four children and two members of Iran’s security forces have been killed.The semiofficial Fars news agency reported late Monday that some 250 police officers and 45 members of the Guard’s all-volunteer Basij force have been hurt in the demonstrations.A switch in the system of foreign exchange subsidies announced by Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, may lead to a short-term rise in food prices, but is intended to be ameliorated by a new system of direct subsidies to consumers. Previously the subsidies were given to those importing products from abroad through exchange rate subsidies. But the decade-old system was wide open for corruption and leakage.Official figures released on Monday showed that inflation had reached 52.6% in December. Inflation, and a collapse in the value of the rial, led to the protests that began in Tehran’s bazaar, but have now spread to more than 100 towns and cities, including many smaller towns. Police were seen entering the University of Birjand in the south-east of Iran, arresting students inside one of the largest universities in the east of Iran.The promise of economic reforms were made as the head of Iran’s judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said the period of “concessions and appeasement” to the protesters were over. Ejei accused the United States and Israel of openly and officially supporting the “chaos” in Iran and said that because of this support, “the rioters should know that if concessions were made in previous periods, there will be no more such concessions and appeasements”.Donald Trump again vowed the US would come to the defence of the protesters if they were attacked, vowing that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters” the US “will come to their rescue”. The Iranian foreign ministry accused Trump of “psychological warfare” on the Iranian people.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Tehran on 29 December.Photograph: undefined/APBut leaders of the Reform Front – the movement with which Pezeshkian is associated – demanded action against those in the security services accused of chasing and firing on protesters inside the Imam Khomeini hospital in Malekshahi, Ilam province.Azar Mansouri, writing on the X social network, described the incident as “a disaster”. She urged: “As soon as possible and with justice, address the tragedy that occurred in Malekshahi, Ilam. Identify the perpetrators, introduce them to the public, and bring them to justice so that this wound can heal a little.”According to reports on social media, security forces had opened fire on protesters.Understanding the scale of this latest round of protests has been difficult. Iranian state media has provided little information about the demonstrations. Online videos offer only brief, shaky glimpses of people in the streets or the sound of gunfire. Journalists in Iran also face limits on reporting in general such as requiring permission to travel around the country, as well as the threat of harassment or arrest by authorities.But the protests do not appear to be stopping, even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday said “rioters must be put in their place.”On Monday António Guterres, the secretary general of the UN, called on Iran to respect demonstrators’ right to “protest peacefully”.Guterres “underscores the need to prevent any further casualties”, his spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said. “He also calls on the authorities to uphold the right of freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly” and that “all individuals must be allowed to protest peacefully and express their grievances”.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claimed the protests had expanded dramatically, adding: “We may well be at a defining moment, a moment when the Iranian people take their destiny in their own hands.” Many such predictions have been made in the past, only for the theocracy to survive.Iran’s future may turn on whether within the confines of continued US economic sanctions, policymakers can find enough room for manoeuvre to tackle corruption, stabilise the currency, reduce inflation and remove the levels of state intervention holding back industrial production. The frequent industrial shut downs caused by electricity and water shortages is also hampering production.In remarks on 1 January, Pezeshkian said he was abolishing the system of preferential foreign exchange rates, a complex system of distorting subsidies that he said fuelled corruption and failed to help the poor. Pezeshkian explained: “We are not removing subsidies, we are delivering them to the final consumers.”Fatemeh Mohajerani, his spokesperson, said on Monday: “It is evident that by ending or reducing subsidised and preferential official foreign currency exchange rates, the prices of some items will rise.”Revisions to the budget being examined by the parliament include pay rises of up to 43% instead of 20%, a cut in value-added tax to 10% from 12%, and the allocation of $8.8bn in subsidised foreign exchange to curb price rises for basic goods.The budget will earmark funds for guaranteed wheat purchases to supply bread and for adjusting pensioners’ salaries.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The building had before then served as the Palestinian mission to the UK.The embassy’sflag-raising ceremony on 22 Septemberwas attended by MPs, ambassadors and a couple of hundred members of the public. Last month,Zomlot called for “comprehensive protection” of the embassyafter it was targeted by masked men waving Israeli flags and union jacks. The building was defaced with stickers such as “I love the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]”, according to images captured by security cameras.On Monday, Zomlot said Britain’s recognition of the Palestinian state was the result of “100 years of relentless struggle”, but added that he felt “the shadow that hangs over us today” as people in Gaza were “living in hell”.Gaza’s health ministry says 422 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire took effect in October after two years of conflict. Most of the territory is in ruins, with its population of more than 2 million people living mainly in makeshift homes or damaged buildings in areas where Israeli forces withdrew.Monday’s ceremony also heard from Obaidah, a 14-year-old Palestinian refugee wounded during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza last year and evacuated to the UK for medical treatment.Saying he hoped one day to become a Palestinian ambassador, Obaidah added: “Having the embassy in the United Kingdom is very meaningful. It is a place where our people are seen, where our voices are heard, and where our hope for justice and dignity lives.”Explore more on these topicsPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policyLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

So far, 990 people have been arrested and at least 20 killed, according to HRAI.Among the minors reportedly killed was Mostafa Falahi, a 15-year-old from the city of Azna, in central Iran. The Oslo-based Hengaw Organization for Human Rights said Falahihad been killed when security forcesopened fire on protesters on 1 January. The group also reported the death of another minor, 17-year-old Rasul Kadivarian, who was killed along with his 20-year-old brother, Reza, on 3 January when security forces fired directly on protesters in the city of Kermanshah.A third child, a 17-year-old whose death was reported by state media in the city of Qom, in central Iran, has also been confirmed by human rights groups, who said their identity had yet to be verified.Skylar Thompson, deputy director of HRAI, told the Guardian the group had documented the killings, as well as the arrests of at least 44 children.“These numbers provide clear evidence that youth are present throughout the ongoing protests. The indiscriminate targeting of a civilian population must be widely condemned as a violation of international law, especially with the clear illustration of children present,” Thompson said.During the Woman, Life, Freedom protests in Iran in 2022more than 500 people were reportedly killed,including at least 60 children, some as young as eight years old.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a witness from the district of Malekshahi, in Ilam, western Iran, said crowds over the weekend had been chanting anti-government slogans and demanding the release of protesters already detained.‘We never stopped protesting’: Iran’s youth take freedom fight undergroundRead more“We then gathered in front of a government building. That was when the forces opened fire on us. It felt as if they were shooting at enemies or armed groups. I felt like I was in a war zone. I saw several people injured, and I believe some were killed on the spot. We tried to take the wounded to hospitals and prevent government forces from arresting injured protesters,” the witness said.Human rights groups reported late Saturday and Sunday night that the security forces had raided and attacked the Khomeini hospital in the city of Ilam, western Iran, where injured protesters had been taken.Awyar Shekhi from Hengaw, said: “State forces are firing directly at gatherings and protests without regard for whether those targeted are children or adults. The crackdowns are brutal: teargas and military-grade weapons are being used, and detainees are severely beaten before being transferred to undisclosed locations.”Another witness from Qom said the security forces could see there were teenagers and children among the protesters, “but that didn’t stop them from firing pellets, teargas and gunfire. The whole situation is only getting more deadly.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRights and freedomProtestIranMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Old-regime bumper stickers, mugs with Assad’s face, T-shirts on which Russian and Syrian flags faded into each other – it all had to go.A year later, the weathered tourist shop on the boardwalk of the Syrian coastal city of Tartous has entirely new products. The shelves are lined with the new three-star Syrian flag, mother-of-pearl jewellery boxes engraved with revolutionary slogans, and pictures of rebel fighters killed during the country’s 14-year civil war.“Business is slow these days. Tourists and travellers used to come before but now it’s slowed down. We just need more security and things will improve,” said Ali, 48, the owner of the shop.Ali’s old customers – Russian soldiers from nearby military bases, American war influencers and Lebanese tourists – have disappeared. Only the faded Cyrillic on the storefront hints at the shop’s past hawking regime wares.View image in fullscreenThe Jarjour vineyard above Tartous is one of Syria’s few wine producers.Photograph: Ahmed Fallaha/The GuardianA year after the fall of the 50-year-long Assad dynasty and its replacement by an Islamist-led government, Syrians are renegotiating the symbols and culture that once defined their country. Statues of Hafez al-Assad have been toppled and bulldozed and the portraits of his son Bashar that once plastered across every billboard, office and classroom now survive only as defaced remnants, if at all.The pace of change has been blistering. The sudden collapse of the Orwellian security apparatus that controlled all facets of life and the arrival of the new government has left Syria in a state of cultural flux.For Syria’s vineyards, some of the oldest in the world, the change has been bewildering. Shadi Jarjour, the owner of the Jarjour winery in the hills above Tartous, said the most immediate impact of the fall of the Assad regime was an end to ceaseless harassment from corrupt government officials.“You never knew what excuse they would come up with to mess with you, it was never comfortable,” he said. “Once, we didn’t have the right stamp on our papers and were threatened with three years in prison, but then the regime fell.”View image in fullscreen‘We are waiting to see what the new laws will be,’ said Shadi Jarjour.Photograph: Ahmed Fallaha/The GuardianJarjour, one of Syria’s few wineries, sits on a hilltop overlooking sloping hills dotted with olive trees. Groups of tourists and diplomats often come to the quaint brick building, which has wine tanks on the bottom floor and a bed and breakfast on the top floor.Business was growing prior to the fall of the Assad regime. Under Assad, alcohol was legal to produce and sell, and the seeds of a wine culture in Syria began to take root, Jarjour said, as consumers expanded their palettes past generic red wines. The family moved their winery to Tartous and started to produce in greater quantities, making up to 50,000 bottles a year.Jarjour and his family were anxious after the fall of the regime, wary of how Syria’s new rulers would view a winery. The core of Syria’s new government is made up of former members ofHayat Tahrir al-Sham(HTS), the Islamist rebel group that led the rebel offensive that toppled the Assad regime.The government assured Jarjour that it did not want to interfere in his business and asked the winery to keep its doors open. But despite these private assurances, the government has seemingly not made up its mind when it comes to the treatment of alcohol in Syria.Jarjour can produce wine but due to a lack of a clear law concerning the sale of alcohol in the country he cannot sell it. “I haven’t sold anything since December 2024. If a law isn’t published in the next month or so, I will have almost two years of losses,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe winery can still produce wine but cannot sell it in Syria.Photograph: Ahmed Fallaha/The GuardianThough no formal restrictions exist on the import of alcohol, Syrian border guards regularly search personal luggage for alcohol and pour it out if found. Bars have been raided and arbitrarily closed across the capital city, Damascus, under the justification that they do not have a licence to serve spirits, and there is no route to renew licences. After an outcry, most bars were reopened and continue to serve alcohol.One bar owner explained how he had to close his bar at the request of authorities, who told him to visit a government office in a few weeks. The official allowed him to reopen, only telling the owner that he had had to be taught a “little lesson” for staying open during the holy month of Ramadan, something that is not an offence under Syrian law.Nonetheless, a party scene still thrives in Damascus, with rooftop raves and house parties aplenty. At one techno party, an off-duty member of the General Security Service danced euphorically, exclaiming that he was having the best night of his life as he experienced his first rave.The residents of the cosmopolitan capital braced themselves when men with long beards and Kalashnikovs descended upon its streets last December, wary of how the Islamists might reshape the city’s character. But it may yet be Damascus that reshapes them.View image in fullscreenThe Jarjour winery usually hosts tourist groups and diplomats but is facing ‘almost two years of losses’ if a law is not published soon, its owner said.Photograph: Ahmed Fallaha/The GuardianSyrians are still revelling in their newfound freedom, putting on plays about the brutality they suffered under the Assad regime and playing revolutionary songs that once could have earned them a spell in prison. But they are also learning how to interact with the new authorities, and the authorities are learning how to reign over a country, not a province.Some Syrians at first fell back on instincts learned from their five decades of autocracy, replacing portraits of Assad with images of Syria’s new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa. Syrian authorities quickly banned such hero worship, at least in such a brazen manner, and the pictures of Sharaa disappeared. It was an early glimpse of the quiet tug-of-war between Syrians and their new rulers as they feel out the boundaries of expression and texture of culture in the post-Assad era.Despite the uncertainty, Jarjour is still optimistic. He wants to expand the winery to widen its market within Syria, and then start exporting bottles one day, hoping for it to become a global brand that represents his country.“We are waiting to see what the new laws will be, and we hope it comes soon so we can get back to work,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I think it speaks volumes that the prime minister has chosen not to come to this house to explain his decision.”View image in fullscreenLaw enforcement officials move Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, out of a helicopter in Manhattan on Monday.Photograph: Adam Gray/ReutersEd Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator, but that does not give President Trump a free pass for illegal action.”Starmer delivers masterclass in hedging his bets after Venezuela raidRead moreThe former Conservative foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned that the entire future of Nato could be at risk if western allies did not face down American threats to launch an attack onGreenlandnext.“If the new US approach extends to the annexation of Greenland – the sovereign territory of a Nato member – itcould mean the end of the alliancewith disastrous consequences.“So how much planning is going on at the Foreign Office to actually make sure such a disaster doesn’t happen? We understand the discussions between allies have to be in private, but what it looks like from the outside is that Europe is weak and divided.”The MPs’ frustrations were voiced after a tense day of international diplomacy in which Cooper spoke to both her US counterpart, Marco Rubio, and María Machado, the prominent Venezuelan opposition politician.Cooper told the Commons she had stressed the importance of international law in her conversation with Rubio, but would not say whether she saw the US action as illegal, saying it was for Washington to set out its justification.US foes and allies denounce Trump’s ‘crime of aggression’ in Venezuela at UN meetingRead moreStarmer spent much of the day preparing for a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” – the group of countries that are prepared to contribute to the long-term security of Ukraine. That group has been keen to keep Washington on side as it prepares for the possibility of a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.The prime minister said on Monday he wanted to “establish the facts” before passing judgment on whether Trump broke international law with the attack on Caracas.He did however mount arobust defenceof Denmark after Trump reiterated suggestions the US could annex Greenland.“Denmark is a close ally in Europe, it is a Nato ally,” he said. “It’s very important the future of Greenland is for the kingdom of Denmark and for Greenland, and only for Greenland and the kingdom of Denmark.”Those comments came hours after the Home Office minister, Mike Tapp, attracted criticism for refusing to say that the UK would defend Denmark over the future of Greenland.In broadcast interviews earlier on Monday, Tapp refused to directly criticise the idea of a US takeover of Greenland, telling Sky News: “Diplomacy is delicate, which means we’re not here to give a running commentary in the news.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDonald TrumpYvette CooperNicolás MaduroEmily ThornberryEd DaveyGreenlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Ofcom added that it would assess whether an investigation is necessary based on the company’s response.Meanwhile, politicians and women’s rights campaigners accused the UK government of “dragging its heels” by failing to enact legislation that was passed six months ago making the creation of such intimate images illegal.The trend, which went viral over the new year period, also prompted the European Commission to say on Monday that it was “very seriously” looking into complaints that Grok was being used to generate and disseminate sexually explicit childlike images.Concern began surfacing after a December update to Musk’s free AI assistant, Grok, made it easier for users to post photographs and ask for their clothing to be removed. While the site does not permit full nudification, it allows users to request images to be altered to show individuals in small, revealing items of underwear and in sexually suggestive poses.On Sunday and Monday, Grok users continued to generate sexually suggestive pictures of minors, with images of children as young as 10 created overnight. Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Musk’s children,complained thatthe AI tool generated a picture of her when she was 14 years old in a bikini.A picture of Stranger Things actor Nell Fisher was manipulated by Grok on Sunday in order to put her in a banana print bikini. Fisher is 14 years old. Many women have expressed fury onXafter discovering that their images had been undressed without their consent. Some pictures of women and children have been manipulated by the AI tool appear to have substances resembling semen smeared on their faces and chests.Researchers atAI Forensics, a Paris-based non-profit, examined 50,000 mentions of @Grok on X and 20,000 images generated by the tool, found over a week-long period between 25 December and 1 January. At least a quarter of the @Grok mentions were requests for the tool to create an image. Within those image generation prompts, there was a high prevalence of terms including “her”, “put”, “remove”, “bikini” and “clothing”.It found that more than half the images were of people in “minimal attire” such as underwear or bikinis, the majority being women who appeared to be under the age of 30. A minority of the images, or 2%, appear to show people aged 18 or under, AI Forensics added, with some images representing children under five years old. The researchers said most of the content was still available online and included requests to generate Nazi and Islamic State propaganda.Initially, Musk expressed amusement at the trend, posting the crying-with-laughter emoji on Friday in response to a picture of a digitally manipulated toaster wearing a bikini. He said: “Not sure why, but I couldn’t stop laughing at this one.” After global outcry at the harmful nature of the content, he posted later that “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”.An X spokesperson said: “We take action against illegal content on X, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.”An earlier statement from Grok announcing that it had “identified lapses in safeguards” and was “urgently fixing them” turned out to have been generated by artificial intelligence; it was not clear whether the company was actually taking action to fix safeguarding lapses.Regulators have been working for years on outlawing nudification apps on phones, with mixed success, but last month’s updates to Grok have mainstreamed the problem, making it simple to create and share intimate images of individuals with most of their clothes removed on one of the internet’s most popular platforms.While the creation of images involving children with their clothes removed is already illegal, the law surrounding the creation of deepfakes of adults is more complicated. UK campaigners succeeded in passing legislation last June that make it illegal to both create and request the creation of intimate images without a person’s consent, but the relevant provisions have yet to be implemented, meaning that the legislation is not currently enforceable. It is, however, already illegal to share these non-consensual deepfake images.Charlotte Owen, the Conservative peerwho championed the legislation, said: “The government has repeatedly dragged its heels and refused to give a timeline on when it will bring these vital provisions into effect. We cannot afford any more delays. Survivors of this abuse deserve better. No one should have to live in fear of their consent being violated in this appalling way.”A spokesperson said the government was committed to implementing the new offences of creating, or requesting, an intimate deepfake without consent as soon as possible, adding that sexually explicit deepfakes “are degrading and harmful … that is why we have legislated to ban their non-consensual creation, ensuring that offenders face the appropriate punishments for this atrocious harm.”GabbyBertin, the Conservative peer who has campaigned to regulate nudification technology, said the government needed to act swiftly because the current legislation “is always playing catch up”.Jess Asato, the Labour MP who has been campaigning for better regulation of pornography, said: “It is up to Elon Musk to realise this is a form of sexual assault and take appropriate action. It is taking an image of women without their consent and stripping it to degrade her – there is no other reason to do it except to humiliate.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He was 75.Schumacher’s daughter, Emily Joy Schumacher, confirmed Monday that her father died on 29 December. She did not provide the cause of death.Schumacher produced such varied biographies as Francis Ford Coppola: A Filmmaker’s Life; Crossroads: The Life and Music of Eric Clapton; and Dharma Lion: A Biography of Allen Ginsberg – a prominent beat generation poet and writer.Other biographies included Mr Basketball: George Mikan, the Minneapolis Lakers & the Birth of the NBA and Will Eisner: A Dreamer’s Life in Comics. Eisner was one of the earliest cartoonists to work in US comic books and was a pioneer of the graphic-novel concept.Though he was born in Kansas, Schumacher lived most of his live in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He studied political science at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, but left the school just one credit short of graduating, his daughter said. He gravitated toward writing at a young age, she said, and basically built two writing careers – one focused on biographies and another on Great Lakes lore.Living on the shores of Lake Michigan in Kenosha, Schumacher produced accounts of how the freighter Edmund Fitzgerald sank during a storm on Lake Superior in 1975; a November 1913 storm that claimed the lives of more than 250 Great Lakes sailors; and how four sailors fought to survive on Lake Michigan after their ship sank in a storm in 1958.Emily Joy Schumacher described her father as “a history person” and “a good human”. She said he worked longhand, filling countless flip notebooks and later transcribing them on a typewriter. She said she still remembers the sound of the keys clacking.“My dad was a very generous person with people,” Emily Joy Schumacher said. “He loved people. He loved talking to people. He loved listening to people. He loved stories. When I think of my dad, I think of him engaged in conversation, coffee in his hand and his notebook.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsWisconsinnewsShareReuse this content"

The cancellations “are not reflective of Hilton values”, the spokesperson said.“We are investigating this matter with this individual hotel, and can confirm that Hilton works with governments, law enforcement and community leaders around the world to ensure our properties are open and inviting to everyone,” the spokesperson said.In a later statement, a Hilton spokesperson said the company was in contact with the hotel in question, and that it has apologized for its team’s actions.2025 was ICE’s deadliest year in two decades. Here are the 31 people who died in custodyRead more“They have taken immediate action to resolve this matter and are contacting impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated,” Hilton’s spokesperson said. “Hilton’s position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination.”Everpeak Hospitality, the owner of the hotel, said it had “moved swiftly to address this matter” and that it was “inconsistent” with hotel policy.“We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted,” Everpeak said in astatement.Google reviews for what is believed to be the hotel location in question, in an outer suburb ofMinneapolis, lit up on Monday afternoon with a mix of one- and five-star reviews, some calling the hotel “un-American” and others praising it for not hosting ICE.Protesters haveralliedoutside hotels in Minnesota and other places around the country where ICE agents are staying, making noise late into the night to disrupt their sleep and calling on hotels not to allow agents to stay on their properties.Federal officials in recent weeks have portrayed Minnesota’s Somali community as a hotspot for fraud involving millions of federal dollars intended for social services. Immigrant-rights advocates have accused the administration of using the fraud investigations as an excuse to target Somali immigrants more broadly.Shares of the hotel chain were down 1.5% in afternoon trading.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinnesotaMinneapolisTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Some of them live today in buildings affected by the US attack that ultimately led to Maduro’s capture and extraction from Venezuela by US military force, Flores said.View image in fullscreenA man from Venezuela argues with people in support of Nicolás Maduro outside court in New York on 5 January 2026.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty Images“The fact that Maduro is in court means justice is being served.

Venezuelans need to decide who they want as president.”Across the street from the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan, on the other side of the protest area that was divided up by a group ofNew YorkCity police officers, was activist Izzy McCabe, 21. She had arrived that morning all the way from Seattle, Washington.View image in fullscreenPeople protest against Nicolás Maduro outside court in New York City on 5 January 2026.Photograph: Heather Khalifa/APMcCabe is a member of the Freedom Road Socialist organization, a fringe communist group dating to the 1980s.McCabe attended the International People’s Assembly for Sovereignty and Peace of Our Americas in Venezuela, an annual gathering of socialist organizations, a few weeks ago, along with thousands of delegates from countries around the world.“I spoke with Venezuelans in Venezuela and they are committed to resisting US imperialism because they love their country. They want to stay in control of the destiny of their country,” said McCabe.She added: “I am here to protest against US intervention and to remind people that there are international laws that need to be respected.”At a playground across the street filled with protesters, Pedro Reyes recounted how he was shot at by the authorities in Venezuela more than a decade ago for protesting against relatives losing their jobs.“He [Maduro] deserves to be detained and to pay for what his regime did to me, my family and my friends,” said Reyes in Spanish.After the incident, Reyes said, he migrated along with his wife and first child to Argentina. In 2021, they crossed the US-Mexico border and asked for asylum in the US and were still awaiting a resolution for their case. The Guardian was not able immediately and independently to verify details of Reyes’s account.“Let’s be honest, we are happy that Maduro was detained, but this happiness is momentary. There are people still associated with Maduro in Venezuela and as long as they stay, the country will not be free,” he said. “What guarantees that we will be safe, that my children will be safe if we go back? Nobody,” he added.A statement was issued from the group Venezuelans and Immigrants Aid, a community-based organization that assists Venezuelan asylum seekers in New York.“For many Venezuelans in the diaspora, the primary concern was, and still is, the safety of our families inside Venezuela. People feared that relatives could face harassment, detention, or retaliation for expressing dissent, or simply for having family members abroad who speak publicly about the situation,” the statement said.“There were also serious humanitarian worries. The collapse of the public health system meant that illness could quickly become life-threatening. Economically, families have been unable to survive on local incomes: the official minimum wage amounts to only a few dollars per month, while basic living costs exceed hundreds of dollars, forcing many in the diaspora to support entire households from abroad.”Many demonstrators waved Venezuelan flags. Some carried signs saying “Free President Maduro”, “USA, Hands off Venezuela” and “No war for Venezuelan oil”, others had signs saying: “Thank you, President Donald Trump”.With emotions running high and opinions around the world running freely, many protesters among the diaspora that had gathered in lower Manhattan kept their counsel on the geopolitics of it all but said in talking to the Guardian: “If you want to know what is happening in Venezuela, ask a Venezuelan.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkVenezuelaProtest (US)US attack on VenezuelaNicolás MaduronewsShareReuse this content"

These sprawling industrial hubs, owned by major US oil companies, stand ready to emerge as some of the major victors of Donald Trump’sswoop on Venezuela.In some ways, these refineries are a relic of another time; built to process the heavy, unctuous crude imported from Latin America before the boom in lighter US shale oil emerged earlier this century.Venezuelan oil is particularly dense and sticky. The high-sulphur crude more closely resembles a semi-solid tar than the far clearer liquids produced in US shale heartlands, making it more difficult to extract and process into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and feedstock for the chemicals industry. But it is exactly what many refineries in the US were built to treat.As a result, the US remains a major importer of crude to feed its refineries, despite being one of the biggest oil exporters in the world. Access to Venezuelan crude at an attractive price could play an important role in sating Trump’s appetite for cheap energy to fuel the “reindustrialisation” of the US economy.View image in fullscreenIn the late 1990s US imports of Venezuelan crude reached almost 2m barrels a day.Photograph: Carlos García Rawlins/Reuters“Most of Venezuela’s crude supply is heavy, sour oil, which if you’re a US refiner is one of the most ideal grades of crude you could ask for,” said Janiv Shah, a vice-president at Rystad Energy, a global consultancy.“At the moment, US refineries import heavy crude into the Gulf states via pipeline from Canada and there are also heavy crude options from Colombia and Mexico. But securing Venezuelan crude would be in addition to these, and the geographic proximity of Venezuela helps too.”It could help to safeguard the US oil industry, which has struggled despite support from the White House againstthe steepest decline in global oil pricessince before the 2020 pandemic, made worse by the economic impact of Trump’s trade war.US refineries support about 3m jobs despite employing only about 80,000 people at their sites. The industry has the highest job “multiplier” of any industry in the US – meaning that for every direct job in the sector more than 45 further roles are supported, according to a study by Oxford Economics. This reflects the industry’s “exceptionally high labour productivity and large economic footprint”, which is often rooted geographically in states loyal to Trump.But duringNicolás Maduro’s presidency, imports of Venezuelan crude to the US refineries fell as the South American nation’s industry suffered from neglect and corruption, and US sanctions against the regime took effect.Venezuela oil exports chartIn the late 1990s US imports of Venezuelan crude reached almost 2m barrels of oil a day, more than half of the South American country’s output. At the end of last year US imports from Venezuela were just 135,000 barrels a day.This suggests that US refineries could readily receive an extra 1m barrels a day from Venezuela, according to analysts at Energy Aspects, helping the US to reduce its reliance on more expensive imports of heavy crude from Canada.This could divert Venezuela’s cheaper heavy oil exports away from China, which has absorbed most of the country’s crude since the US imposed sanctions on its exports as repayment on the billions in financial support extended to the Venezuelan government over recent years.These imports represent a small fraction of China’s oil consumption, which could be easily replaced from other sources. However, the US intervention will force its global rival to pay a higher price for energy at a time both major economies are chasing the cheapest energy possible to fuel economic growth.“This is part of Trump’s view that almost any issue can be solved by making the cost of energy cheaper so that prices for consumers across the economy fall too,” Shah said. “It is also Trump flexing the US’s muscles on the global stage against one of its greatest global rivals. China could source crude from elsewhere, but this move is politically symbolic.”The gamble is a long game, with no guarantee of success. Returning Venezuela’s crude production to 3m barrels of oil a day would require 16 years of work and investment totalling $185bn (£137bn), according to figures from Rystad Energy, a global consultancy.View image in fullscreenThe Deer Park oil refinery in Houston, Texas. The US remains a major importer of crude, despite being one of the biggest oil exporters.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAt least $30-35bn of international capital would need to be committed in the next two to three years to make this scenario plausible, Rystad said. “This could only be financed by international oil companies, which will consider investments in Venezuela only if they have full confidence in the stability of the country’s systems and its investment climate for international oil and gas players,” it added.The global oil market responded to Trump’s plan to extract a“tremendous amount of wealth”from Venezuela’s oil industry with significantly less drama than the events of recent days.Less than 48 hours after Trump called for America’s biggest oil companies to reignite Venezuela’s struggling oil industry, the global oil market barely budged. The international benchmark rose slightly to just over $60.50 a barrel on Monday morning, after briefly falling below $60 a barrel late last year, although shares in the US oil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil rose by more than 3% and 6% respectively.Venezuela oil reserves chart“A rapid recovery in Venezuelan oil production in the short term is highly unlikely,” said Jorge León, the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad. “Years of chronic underinvestment have severely eroded oil infrastructure, much of the skilled workforce has left the country, and ongoing political instability continues to undermine operational confidence.“Even under a more constructive political scenario, rebuilding output would require significant time, capital, and institutional stability, making it difficult for international companies to justify new investments in Venezuela at present.”Explore more on these topicsOilVenezuelaCommoditiesAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Still, the decision shocked those inside and outside the company. The network has said the segment, aboutabuses at the Cecotprison in El Salvador, will air at a later date, likely this month. (The segment did not air on Sunday’s edition of 60 Minutes, though another piece reported by Alfonsi did.)Who is Bari Weiss, the new editor-in-chief of CBS News?Read more“This clumsy editorial interference endangers 60 Minutes’ role as CBS’s flagship public interest broadcast and as the news division’s most profitable franchise,” according to an early draft of the letter,which was originally slated to be sent on Saturday. “The crown jewel of the network you recently acquired now faces a crisis of credibility and trust.”While the letter received nearly 200 signatories, including many veteran journalists as well as prominent individuals in the entertainment industry, the organizers have shelved it for now – “giving the staff at CBS News an opportunity to continue doing the good work they do”.One signatory listed was former 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman, who was blocked by the network from publishing an exclusive interview with a tobacco industry whistleblower in the mid-1990s. That incident was cited in an email Alfonsi sent to colleagues protesting Weiss’s decision to pull the piece as “political”.Alfonsi’s email was a rare rebuke of company management that could be seen by some as insubordination. It also served as the first open airing of grievances that many network staffers have expressed anonymously for weeks and months about Weiss. (Alfonsi did not respond to an email seeking comment.)“I’ve known and worked with Sharyn Alfonsi for nearly 20 years, and I trust and support her completely,” Rome Hartman, a former 60 Minutes producer who left the network last year, said in an interview. “I don’t know Bari Weiss at all, and I don’t pretend to know why she did what she did with this piece. Sharyn’s explanation to her colleagues of what happened is clear and compelling. I can’t say the same about Weiss’s explanations so far.”Hartman said he doubts the open letter to Ellison will help, considering that Weiss seems to be accomplishing the mission he gave her.While Weiss successfully pulled Alfonsi’s segment, it was too late for the Canadian television network Global TV,which aired it, providing an easy basis for comparison if and when the segment airs on CBS.“Anyone with network TV experience could have warned her that holding that story would have been like walking the plank,” a former CBS News reporter said. “Once you promote it, there are very limited circumstances under which you hold it, including it being false. That wasn’t the case. But I think it’s also true that it wasn’t moving the story forward and it could have included the administration’s perspective. So I think there was blame to go around.”We are a prideful newsroom, and she’s rubbing people the wrong wayA CBS News stafferIn addition to a chorus of criticism from liberals, Weiss has faced blowback from stars of the conservative media world who are normally aligned with her anti-woke, anti-cancel culture political alignment. One of Weiss’s first big moves wasa 13 December town hall with Erika Kirk, the widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, thatfailed to attract major advertisersandperformed weaklywith viewers.“Bari Weiss wants to couch herself as Erika’s protector, Erika’s defender,” Megyn Kelly said atan event held recently by Kirk’s organizationTurning Point USA. “Bari doesn’t know anything about Erika. Bari Weiss has never been to a Turning Point event.”During the town hall, Kelly said: “Bari Weiss tried to play both super-important VIP executive and super-fabulous star anchor at her new network, CBS.”Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has also spoken dismissively about Weiss. “I’m not too worried about Bari Weiss taking over the world,”he said on a recent episodeof his streaming show, criticizing her support for Israel. “I don’t care how many billionaires hand her news organizations because she’s obedient to their preferred country. She’s still an idiot – sorry.” (He said, however, that she’s “very charming and very energetic”.)Journalists at CBS News say that Weiss still has not laid out a clear strategy for how she wants the network to change and adapt, though she is expected to do so as soon as this week, sources say.“I’m constantly confused by what her definition of ‘making news’ is,” a second current CBS News staffer said. “It seems like she only cares about big names saying controversial things. That’s not the same as newsworthiness.”In recent weeks, she has infrequently joined the network’s daily editorial calls – though she spoke up on 22 December to address the 60 Minutes controversy and seemed to criticize some of her employees. “The only newsroom I’m interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues,” she said, according to an audio recording of her remarks. “Anything else is absolutely unacceptable.”Other than that, “we don’t hear from her very often”, the CBS News staffer said.Some see that as a good thing, however. “We are a prideful newsroom, and she’s rubbing people the wrong way,” a third network staffer said.With Weiss in charge, there have also been internal cultural clashes on issues that align with her worldview, including a previously unreported 6 November blow-up among staffers about language choices when writing about transgender individuals. A prominent correspondent at the network wrote in an email viewed by the Guardian that CBS “should refrain from adopting terminology advocated by the movement”,referring to guidancefrom the Trans Journalists Association’s stylebook about how to use the phrase “biological sex”. A producer responded angrily to the correspondent, writing: “It’s a TJA style ‘guide’ – that’s what I’m trying to do. Guide us to better coverage.”Despite negative headlines about her tenure, it’s still extremely early in Weiss’s career at the network and she will surely have a long runway to prove out her vision – whatever she determines that to be.“She’s trying to affect a deep cultural change at that network, and that is probably one of the toughest challenges in media,” said Catherine Herridge, a former CBS News investigative journalist. “I still think that if anyone can do it, she probably can. She’s very tough, she’s very smart, and this is monumental what she’s trying to do.”The network’s journalists have also churned out scoops in recent days, despite the distractions. CBS Newswas first to reportearly on Saturday that the Trump administration was responsible for the explosions that were reported in Venezuela.Weiss will have another opportunity for a programming win on Monday, when her revamped evening news show, anchored by Weiss favorite Tony Dokoupil, will officially launch – though the first CBS News staffer said the run-up to the launch has been “chaotic”. (Weisshad attempted to recruit star anchorsfrom rival networks, including Fox heavyweights Bret Baier and Dana Perino, but discovered they were locked into long-term contracts.)View image in fullscreenTony Dokoupil will anchor CBS’s revamped evening news show.Photograph: Julio Cortez/APAs a promotion for the debut, CBS News sent Dokoupil to New York’s Grand Central Station, where he found few travelers who could pronounce his last name – or who seemed to know who he was.Dokoupil was set to begin the show with a 10-city, 10-day tour across the country, but due to the US military action in Venezuela he anchored a special edition of the show on Saturday night and will anchor from New York City on Monday – instead of Miami. The episode featured a lengthy interview with secretary of defense Pete Hegseth that was booked by Weiss. The cross-country tour, which had raised cost concerns among staffers at a time when they are bracing for further corporate layoffs, will resume later this week, according to the network. (Weiss was expected to join Dokoupil on some of the stops.)While CBS News declined to make Dokoupil available for an interview,he published a message to viewerscriticizing “legacy” media for excessively relying on academics, “elites” and “advocates” – “and not the average American”. Larry Sabato, an elections expert at the University of Virginia,mockingly replied in a post on X: “Absolutely! You wouldn’t want ‘academics and elites’ who have actually studied a subject to outweigh the off-the-cuff opinions of village idiots.”Responding to skeptical messages on social media, Dokoupil told one critic who unfavorably compared the network’s current iteration with the days of legendary CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite: “I can promise you we’ll be more accountable and more transparent than Cronkite or anyone else of his era.”Bari Weiss defends decision to pull 60 Minutes episode on El Salvador prisonRead moreUndeterred by the lackluster response to the Erika Kirk town hall, the network recently announced an event series called Things That Matter, which will include town halls featuring the vice-president, JD Vance, and the Maryland governor, Wes Moore, though it’s unclear whether Weiss will be among the CBS News personalities who moderate them. There will also be debates on issues like gender and religion, all sponsored by Bank of America.Despite the protests of some employees and a lot of racket on social media platforms such as Bluesky, ultimately the only person who matters is Ellison, who has shown no disillusionment with Weiss’s performance.If anything, she might even double the size of her role in the near future if Ellison is successful at acquiring theassets of Warner Bros Discovery, including CNN, a prospect that has worried some staffers at the cable network.The irony of the 60 Minutes dust-up is that Weiss and her bosses had recently received something of an endorsement from one of the show’s veteran correspondents.When accepting an award in Washington DC on 12 December, Scott Pelley acknowledged it’s “early” but said: “What I can tell you is we are doing the same kinds of stories with the same kind of rigor, and we have experienced no corporate interference of any kind.” Some on social media chimed in at the time that Pelley might be speaking too soon.While some have suggested that CBS News journalists who oppose Weiss’s tenure might head for the exits, that seems unlikely, particularly at a time when television jobs are hard to come by. “I know the mood is to stay and fight,” the first CBS News staffer said, with some hoping they may be able to outlast Weiss’s tenure.Explore more on these topicsCBSUS television industryUS televisionTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The organization was tasked with distributing $500m worth of funding annually to NPR, PBS and its network of local broadcast stations.Trump and his conservative allies have long criticized PBS and NPR. Plans to cut funding for public broadcasters wereoutlinedin Project 2025, therightwing manifestofor a second Trump administration, and by May of last year, Trump had sent a memo to Congress demanding it take action to cut the CPB’s funding.“For years taxpayers have been on the hook for subsidizing [NPR and PBS], which spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news’,” the memosaid. In July, Trumpwroteon social media that any Republican who voted against funding cuts “to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or endorsement”.The Republican-controlled Congress would go on to cut $1.1bn in funding from CPB, forcing the organization toshut downoperations in August.Local public broadcasting stations have beenessentialfor news deserts in parts of the country where traditional media, especially newspapers, have shut down in recent decades.Over halfof the 544 public radio and TV stations that received CPB funding were considered rural, giving 99% of Americans access to public media.The cuts to federal funding have inspired donors from across the country to go on a“rage-giving” spree, sending $70m in donations to public broadcasters over the last year. But it’s unclear how long the broadcasters can survive on donations alone: oneanalysisestimates that 15% of local stations are at risk of closing in three years because of the cuts.In a statement, Ruby Calvert, chair of the CPB’s board of directors, said that she is “convinced that public media will survive, and that a new Congress will address public media’s role in our country because it is critical to our children’s education, our history, culture and democracy to do so.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS public radioPBSUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

And the Ravens are still going backwardsJohn Harbaugh has spent nearly two decades leading Baltimore. But his failure to get the most out of his quarterback is a fireable failingOliver ConnollyMon 5 Jan 2026 06.34 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 06.38 ESTShareThere are losses, and then there are those defeats that show us exactly who a team are.The Steelers’ 26-24 win over the Ravenson Sunday night was the latter. It wasn’t just a loss; it was a referendum. The game was vintage, grubby, beautiful AFC North football. A rivalry game with a playoff place on the line. Big plays. Dumb decisions. Cris Collinsworth making unintelligible noises on commentary. In the final three minutes, four plays swung the win probability by more than 40 percentage points.The Steelers, missing DK Metcalf and Darnell Washington, scored on four of their five second-half drives, three of them touchdowns, with Aaron Rodgers finding Calvin Austin for a 26-yard score with 55 seconds left. Baltimore, by contrast, couldn’t get out of their own way until Lamar Jackson strapped on his cape, completing seven of his final nine passes, throwing two touchdowns and convertinga ridiculously clutch fourth-down striketo Isaiah Likely with 21 seconds left and the season on the line.It should have been the defining moment of Baltimore’s year. Instead, they botched it. With 12 seconds remaining and a timeout in hand, the Ravens took a knee. They had plenty of time to churn out an extra five or 10 yards, to turn the 44-yard field goal attempt into a chip shot and kill the clock. But John Harbaugh chose safety. Rookie kicker Tyler Loop missed the kick wide right. The Steelers celebrated a division title and the AFC’s No 4 seed. Baltimore went home.It was classic Harbaugh. He has spent years skirting the edge of something great without ever quite stepping into it. The Ravens have been waiting to make The Leap for four seasons. They have lost in the wildcard round, the divisional round and the conference championship. Now, in a wide-open AFC, they haven’t even made the dance. Their record with Jackson in the playoffs stands at 3-5. They haven’t cashed in on his prime, and the failures are starting to blur together.For years, Harbaugh’s strategic vision – which is vital in win-or-go-home games – has dimmed. The best coaches store up sneak attacks for specific opponents, pick on weak spots until they gush blood and go to creative lengths to hide the deficiencies on their own rosters. Being late finding the right countermove can cost you a game, a playoff berth or a championship. The margin for error is that small, and Harbaugh doesn’t seem to have the goods. And in the biggest moments, his teams play tight.ESPN’s Adam Schefterreported on Sundaythat Harbaugh’s future is “up in the air.” That’s fair. He has overseen 18 seasons of mostly sustained success in Baltimore and won a Super Bowl in the 2012 campaign. But that was a long time ago. And the disappointments since then far outstrip the highs.This season wasparticularly cruel. An early injury crisis crushed the team on both sides of the ball. Jackson spent the season playing through various injuries. Nnamdi Madubuike, the linchpin of the team’s pass-rush, missed the bulk of the year with a neck injury. Harbaugh barely got to coach the version of the team he envisioned. But it’s also the second wasted year with the Jackson-Henry backfield combination, with poor plans along the offensive line and on defense.The Ravens alsolooked unprepared on defense. Harbaugh promised changes in the middle of the season and the team traded edge-rusher Odafe Oweh to the Chargers for safety Alohi Gilman. The defense, able to push Kyle Hamilton closer to the line of scrimmage, got back on track. Getting healthier certainly helped, too. From Week 9 onwards, Baltimore’s defense ranked seventh in success rate and ninth in defensive EPA per play. But it was too late. And in crunch time, the Ravens defense fell apartagain,giving up a late touchdown drive to a Steelers team with no timeouts and a dysfunctional group of wide receivers in 60 seconds.Harbaugh deserves credit for breathing new life into his tenure. It’s easy to say Jackson has carried his coach, but it was Harbaugh who believed in the quarterback before the rest of the league woke up to his talent. The partnership peaked for two years, with Jackson falling a single vote short of back-to-back MVPs last season. Anyone suggesting Harbaugh is a dolt must reckon with his 180 wins, his pre-Jackson Super Bowl ring and Jackson’s 2023 and 2024 seasons.But partnerships, like teams, can grow stale. Next season will be year nine for Harbaugh and Jackson, and they look further away now than they did when they last missed the postseason, in 2021. Jackson has just two years left on his contract – and there are rumors oftension between the head coach and quarterback.A jolt of something –anything– new is what the Ravens need.If Harbaugh is let go, the hottest name will be Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, who spent his early coaching career in Baltimore. If the Ravens step outside the familiar, they could pair up Jackson with an offensive mind with fresh ideas, whether that’s Mike McDaniel, Klint Kubiak or Kliff Kingsbury.Harbaugh has been the model of consistency – before and after his Super Bowl win. But when you’re working with a once-in-a-lifetime quarterback, consistency is not enough. Failing to reach the Super Bowl, let alone win one, becomes a fireable offence. The Ravens are talented. They are close. But close has become the problem. When your season ends with a knee and a missed kick, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the moment finally passed Harbaugh by.MVP of the weekView image in fullscreenSeattle safety Nick Emmanwori makes a tackle during Saturday’s win over San Francisco.Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesNick Emmanwori, S, Seahawks.It felt fitting that Seattleclinched the NFC’s No 1 seedin the most Seattle way possible: playing suffocating defense. The 49ers were in scorching form coming into the winner-takes-the-top-spot contest – they had put up at least 37 points in three straight games. None of that mattered on Saturday. Seattle’s defense restricted the 49ers to a solitary field goalin a 13-3 victory, holding Kyle Shanahan’s offense to its third-worst success rate of the season.Emmanwori proved to be the difference-maker again. Seattle are loaded with stars across their defense, but Emmanwori ties the three levels together. He posted the highest pressure rate (40%) of any Seattle pass-rusher, led the team in run stops (three) and gave up just 28 yards on seven targets in coverage. Without Emmanwori, the Seahawks’ defense would be great. With him, it is special. Because of his size, speed, versatility and intelligence, the Seahawks can get to defensive looks that few others in the league can replicate. It’s hard to think of another rookie who has stepped into the league and shouldered Emmanwori’s workload on a league-leading defense.The reward is significant. Barring a Super Bowl return to Levi’s Stadium in February, the Seahawks won’t be packing a suitcase for the rest of the season. And they will enter the postseason as the NFC’s most complete team. Their defense is the best in football, they top the charts on special teams and their run game has finally come alive. If Sam Darnold can stay within himself – a fairly substantial “if”, even now – Seattle should make it back to San Francisco.Video of the weekMyles Garrett gets the record.pic.twitter.com/wQ3NabSA3c— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet)January 4, 2026He did it! Myles Garrett wrapped up his brilliant campaign by breaking the league’s single-season sack record. His 23rd sack of the year, against Cincinnati in the fourth quarter, pushed him past Michael Strahan and TJ Watt for the top spot. And he did so in a way only he can: Garrett crossed the line of scrimmage 0.23 seconds after the snap, the fastest get-off on any sack this season, according to Next Gen Stats.It was a strange game overall for Garrett. He abandoned other responsibilities and focused almost exclusively (and understandably) on the record. But Cincy were equally focused on stopping him from chasing history. He faced a double team or chip block on 42% of his pass-rushes, the highest rate in a game this season, with Joe Burrow also shaving almost half a second off his average time to throw. Eventually, though, Garrett got home.There will be some whining about extra games, circumstances, or, if you’re Zac Taylor,the post-sack celebrations. None of it sticks. Garrett picked up the record in 432 pass-rushing snaps, 100 fewer than Strahan and almost 200 fewer than Watt during their record-breaking years. He will finish the season with another Defensive Player of the Year award and a cool note on his Hall of Fame plaque.View image in fullscreenIt was another season of disappointment for the Jets.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APStat of the weekZero.The Jets have managed the unthinkable: they completed a 17-game season without intercepting a pass. Yes, you read that right. Zero. They’re the first team inNFLhistory to go a full season without an interception.It is hard to overstate how impossible thatshouldbe. Jalyx Hunt, the Eaglesedge-rusher,has three alone this season. Eventually, a tipped ball or a dumb quarterback decision goes your way. Not for these stanktastic Jets. They finished the season 3-14 after being pounded by thebackupBills 35-8.It’s the kind of historical anomaly that should get any coach fired. Making a coach one-and-done is brutal. But Aaron Glenn has done nothing in his single season in charge to prove he has the makings of even a competent head coach. His game management has been poor, the team’s offense devoid of ideas and the defense, Glenn’s calling card, has been uncompetitive. Over the last five weeks of the season, the Jets’ average point differential was minus-26.8. There’s losing, and then there’s quitting. The Jets’ players look like they chose the latter over the final months of the season. When that happens, the coach should be toast. Although even without Glenn the team would still be stuck with bumbling owner Woody Johnson, who has overseen a Jets playoff drought that stretches back to the 2010 season.Elsewhere around the leagueView image in fullscreenCam Little celebrates his 67-yard field goal during the first half of Sunday’s game against the Titans.Photograph: John Raoux/APThe Panthers fell into the NFC South title despite trying to throw it away. They’d already lost to Tampa Bay on Saturday, then waited as Atlanta beat New Orleans 19-17 on Sunday in a game that existed mostly to decide someone else’s fate. If someonehadto win the NFC South, then it was only right that it came in a sloppy game filled with blocked punts, fumbles, interceptions and mistakes. Everyone was playing for someone else in Atlanta, which pretty much summed up the division. It ended dumb because it had been dumb all along. The Panthers took a three-way tie at the top of the standings, clinching the No 4 seed in the NFC with an 8-9 record.Jags kicker Cam Little hit a 67-yard field goal against the Titans on Sunday like it was nothing – it was probably good from 73 yards. It was the second-longest field goal in NFL history, the longest ever made outdoors and a timely reminder that Little will be a unique weapon for Jacksonville in tight postseason games. This is not a one-off. Little has already hit from a record 68 yards this season anddrilled an unofficial record 70-yarder in the preseason. Kickers are now so damn good that it makes you wonder if the league should change rules. Narrow the goalposts? Create a “field goal zone”? Or just delight in seeing someone do something that feels superhuman?For the final quarter of the season, the Colts gave us a fun storyline. Philip Rivers’ return was a joy, but it masked a brutal end-of-year slide. They lost 38-30 to the Texans on Sunday, ending the year at 8-9. At one point, they were six games over .500 yet still finished with a losing record, the first team in the Super Bowl era to do so. Despite the collapse, the Colts have already announced that coach Shane Steichen and GM Chris Ballard will return next season.With a 34-17 win over the Cowboys on Sunday, the Giants are 8-30 in their last 38 games. Four of those eight wins have come in Week 17 or 18, when they’ve long been eliminated from playoff contention and are playing only for draft positioning. Dallas understood the assignment, benching their starters to bolster their slot in the draft order. The Giants did what they do: win a meaningless January game to slip from the No 2 slot to No 5 in this year’s draft.The top of the draft order is now set. The top 10: Raiders; Jets; Cardinals; Titans; Giants; Browns; Commanders; Saints; Chiefs; Bengals. The last time the Raiders held the No 1 overall pick was in 2007, when they drafted one of the biggest busts in NFL history, LSU quarterback JaMarcus Russell. Good luck, Fernando Mendoza!The playoff bracket is also set. In the AFC wildcard round, the Texans (No 5 seed) face the Steelers (4); the Chargers (7) play the Patriots (2); and the Jaguars (3) take on the Bills (6) while the No 1 seed Broncos get a bye. In the NFC, the Seahawks are the No 1 seed and skip to the divisional round. In the wildcard round, the Rams (5) play the Panthers (4); the Packers (7) face the Bears (2); and the 49ers (6) are up against the reigning champion Eagles (3).No one was happier on Sunday than the league’s head office. It was a record-breaking year for turnarounds and parity, the fuel of the league. Five teams made the playoffs who were coming off 11-plus losses last season (the Patriots, Jaguars, Bears, Panthers and Niners). Four division winners came off 12-plus loss seasons. Two 13-win teams lost 13 games a year ago. There were three worst-to-first division champs (Patriots, Bears, Panthers). The league sells hope, not football. And nothing will sell like the idea thatyourteam is on the verge of challenging next season.Explore more on these topicsBaltimore RavensNFLPittsburgh SteelersUS sportsSeattle SeahawksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He departs after a power struggle with the hierarchy over transfer policy, with Amorim demanding his ­colleaguesin the recruitment department “do their job”following Sunday’s draw at Leeds.His immediate replacement is Darren Fletcher, who takes charge as interim head coach. The Scot, a former United midfielder and the ­current under-18s coach, will lead the side at Burnley on Wednesday and could remain in charge for Sunday’s FA Cup tie with Brighton.Manchester United’s flawed process: why Amorim appointment was doomed from the startRead moreUnited are yet to decide whether to appoint a permanent head coach for the remainder of the season or to do so in the summer. The process will be led by Jason Wilcox, the director of football, and Omar Berrada, the chief executive.If they decide on a temporary coach until the end of the campaign Fletcher would be an option. Another potential candidate is Michael Carrick, who was United’s caretaker manager for three games in 2021 from late November to early December, winning two and drawing the other.Regarding permanent replacements, Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner is understood to be of interest. While the Austrian deploys the same 3-4-3 formation at Palace as Amorim did, he has indicated a willingness to play a back four, so is more flexible than the Portuguese proved.Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola and the unemployed Enzo Maresca are two more candidates who might be considered. Thomas Tuchel came close to replacing Erik ten Hag in summer 2024 but as England manager would hope to still be leading the national team in July at the World Cup, which may be too late for United to appoint him.View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim challenged Jason Wilcox (left) and Omar Berrada (right) with his comments after Manchester United’s draw with Leeds.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAThose considered currently as ­outside prospects include Gareth Southgate, the former England ­manager, and Mauricio Pochettino, the USA head coach. Xavi, the former Barcelona coach, is open to the role but his limited English and lack of Premier League experience means he could be ruled out.Whoever does take over will have to work within the structure that gives Wilcox and Berrada a higher status regarding football policy than the head coach. Amorim’s frustration with this was a key component in his removal. The 40-year-old believed United were prepared to back him in the January transfer window should a major signing become available but said last Friday: “We have no conversation to have any change in the squad.”This strained his relationship with Wilcox and after the Leeds game he said: “I came here to be the manager ofManchester United– not to be the coach” – even though his title was head coach.United acted swiftly on Monday, saying: “WithManchester Unitedsitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.”Amorim was informed of the January transfer policy by Wilcox, with United reluctant to sanction any signings he targeted as these might not suit the next head coach, the hierarchy having lost confidence that he was the right long-term solution.Amorim’s refusal to adapt once the players had grown into his system caused concern because the club believed he agreed to do this when taking charge, while a reactive style also caused disquiet. Hisdownplaying of the academyand underwhelming comments about senior players, includingPatrick DorguandBenjamin Sesko, were not received well.Amorim indicated that pundits’ opinions had started to hold more sway than his own within the club. “If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club,” he said after Leeds.United’s stance is that Amorim was given 100% backing and was removed owing to a lack of progress and ­evolution. The £250m spent since he was appointed is pointed to as evidence of support. There is also an ­insistence that Amorim was in ­concert with the close-season ­strategy of signing three forwards rather than a midfielder.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Amorim was appointedon 1 November 2024 until June 2027, with a club option of an additional year. He oversaw United’s lowest Premier League finish – 15th – last season andlost the Europa League finalto Spurs.United endured a difficult start to this season and were knocked out of the Carabao Cupby the League Two club Grimsby. But United’s co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe backed Amorim in October, saying he should be judgedafter three years in charge.Until recently Amorim was wedded to his tactics, built around a back three, which brought success to Sporting in his previous job, saying“not even the pope”could make him deviate, but his approach has been widely questioned throughout his tenure.After his removal, the club are searching for their seventh full-time manager or head coach since Sir Alex Ferguson departed in 2013 after 26-and-a-half years in charge.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

For Mason there was the added baggage of Spurs’ 13-year trophy drought; for McFarlane, making his senior management debut, it was Chelsea’s astonishingly bad recent record against Manchester City. Four and a half years have passed since Chelsea last beat Guardiola’s side, when Thomas Tuchel’s team triumphed in the Champions League final, and a draw on Sunday took that winless run to 12 matches. But Enzo Fernández’s injury-time equaliser, combining withthe midweek upheaval at Stamford Bridge, made it a triumphant point, something Enzo Maresca didn’t achieve against City during his tenure.Taha HashimMatch report:Manchester City 1-1 ChelseaRuben Amorim sacked by Manchester United – live updatesRead more2Liverpool fail to shut up shopFlorian Wirtz was one of the positives forLiverpoolin their 2-2 draw with Fulham but the £116m summer signing was not happy despite scoring for the second time in three games. “I was happy that I scored but I’d rather take the three points,” Wirtz said. “It’s not what we want, we want more. We have to get better but it’s still a process.” To get more, though, Liverpool have to be more commanding. They keep letting games run out of control and Arne Slot seems short of solutions. Liverpool’s manager was not impressed with the defending that led to Harrison Reed’s equaliser. It was a stunning and unlikely strike from the Fulham substitute but Liverpool should not make the mistake of thinking they were the victims of misfortune. They almost let 2-0 leads slip against Wolves and Tottenham last month. The season will remain a struggle until they tighten up when ahead.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:Fulham 2-2 LiverpoolView image in fullscreenFlorian Wirtz was left frustrated despite scoring his second goal of the season.Photograph: David Cliff/EPA3Rice backs Gyökeres to fire for GunnersViktor Gyökeres hasn’t found his goalscoring touch for Arsenal yet, but Declan Rice insists the Sweden striker is still having a huge influence for the league leaders. Rice scored twice againstBournemouthas Mikel Arteta’s side completed a stirring comeback on the south coast, but Gyökeres has now gone 10 matches without finding the net from open play. His all-round performance was slightly improved against Andoni Iraola’s side and Gyökeres played an important role in Arsenal’s crucial second, even if he rarely looked like adding to his seven goals in 23 appearances so far. “It’s tough for him because defenders are so tight on him, and there’s no space for him at all,” said Rice. “All the boys are with him because of what he is doing for us, even though he hasn’t scored, how he is helping us as a team to press, hold the ball up. I think good things are going to come.”Ed AaronsMatch report:Bournemouth 2-3 Arsenal4United need Sesko to sharpen upWith Ruben Amorim starting nine defensive-minded players at Elland Road on Sunday afternoon, the onus naturally fell on the remaining two to lead Manchester United’s attack. Matheus Cunha’s fine form continued with the goal that earned the visitors a point, but Sesko’s travails continued. The Slovenian has scored just two goals since his big-money move to Old Trafford, and none since October. Granted, his service was limited on occasions and United’s attacking play was stunted by so many defensive players on the pitch, but Sesko struggled to make an impact once again, spurning a glorious chance to potentially claim all three points late on. As we enter the new year, there is justification to ask for more from a player who is yet to fully find his feet in the Premier League.Aaron BowerMatch report:Leeds 1-1 Manchester United5Le Fée leaves Spurs in a muddleRégis Le Bris made the brave decision to partner Granit Xhaka with Enzo Le Fée in midfield at Tottenham. The Frenchman was asked to play a deeper role than he is used to and acquitted himself well. With Spurs in the lead, though, Le Bris pushed Le Fée further forward in the second half and his performance was a delight. Picking up little pockets of space, the former Roma forward became a major factor in Sunderland’s push for an equaliser. After directing a header on to a post from Nordi Mukiele’s pass, Le Fée then created Brian Brobbey’s goal before Spurs knew how to stop it. A sharp first-time pass back into the striker’s path gave him a chance he could not miss. Sunderland have had plenty of success stories this season but, now he has adapted to the pace of thePremier League, Le Fée’s campaign keeps getting better.Billy MundayMatch report:Tottenham 1-1 SunderlandView image in fullscreenEnzo Le Fée caused Tottenham all sorts of problems.Photograph: Dalton Bowden/Shutterstock6Nuno wastes chance to bed in PabloEverything about West Ham’s defeat at Wolves was embarrassing, from start to finish. Nuno Espírito Santo left three available substitutions unmade, an indication of the confidence he has in his bench. The manager named his new signing, Pablo Felipe, among the substitutes but despite the chronic failings of his team, who failed to have a single shot on target, Nuno decided it would be unfair to send the new recruit on for his debut, having only arrived from Gil Vicente on Friday. Before this season the 22-year-old’s career was relatively nondescript but, after 10 goals in 13 league games in Portugal, the Hammers must harness his newfound confidence and hope he is not a Brazilian Michael Ricketts. West Ham are desperate for goals and Pablo needs to adapt quickly to the Premier League. It would have been a free hit for him at Molineux, especially with a crucial game at home to Forest on Tuesday. Joining in January is difficult but, if Nuno wants him to adapt, he will need to get the striker on the pitch as much as possible.Will UnwinMatch report:Wolves 3-0 West Ham7Miley makes another big statementLewis Miley dared Eddie Howe to drop him thanks to another outstanding performance out of position at right-back. Quite apart from excelling defensively, never misplacing a pass and creating Newcastle’s opening goal for Bruno Guimarães in Sunday’s 2-0 win againstCrystal Palace, the astonishingly mature 19-year-old midfielder raised the tone in an untidy game. With Tino Livramento and Kieran Trippier both fit again and ready to resume at right-back, the question will be whether Howe can find a place for Miley in central midfield against Leeds at St James’ Park on Wednesday night. “Lewis has been incredible,” said Newcastle’s manager, who may be tempted to rest Sandro Tonali against Daniel Farke’s team after the Italy midfielder was left bruised by some tough Palace challenges. “You wouldn’t know right-back isn’t Lewis’s natural position. He’s excelled in it. He’s doing a great job for the team.” Future Newcastle sides will surely be built around Miley.Louise TaylorMatch report:Newcastle 2-0 Crystal Palace8Is Dyche effect wearing thin at Forest?Sean Dyche’s initial impact atNottingham Foresthas been admirable, but do they have a Plan B? Forest are averaging a point a game since Dyche’s arrival in October (1.4 if Europa League games are included), but they have lost four in a row. Only once this season have they come from behind to win – against Leeds in November. Their counterattacking abilities remain, though are less effective than when Chris Wood (now injured) and Anthony Elanga (sold to Newcastle) were regulars last season. But they do still look well-organised when defending deep. Forest are generally compact, alert, combative and aligned when the scores are level, or they lead. But when the other team scores first, and they have to commit more players ahead of the ball, the game becomes more stretched. In Saturday’s 3-1 defeat at Villa Park, Forest were easily taken apart after giving the ball away; they cannot afford a repeat in Tuesday’s crucial trip to West Ham.Peter LansleyMatch report:Aston Villa 3-1 Nottingham ForestView image in fullscreenSean Dyche roars instructions from the sidelines, to no avail.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/Shutterstock9Thiago’s hot streak ends away-day bluesIt was hard to reconcile Brentford’s performance at Everton with a team in possession of one of the worst away records in the league, so controlled and dominant were Keith Andrews’s visitors, but despite seven losses on the road this season their ambitions might have to be revised. Asked what Brentford’s target for the second half of the campaign should be, Kevin Schade said: “The main goal is not to go down, obviously. Then I would say it’s not a goal but a dream we can achieve, if everything goes right, to qualify for Europe. For me, personally, to go to the World Cup, and I need good games for that and the team as well.” With Igor Thiago in such prolific form, Schade andBrentfordhave that platform. Schade said of his teammate: “He’s very important because we always had players like this, for example Ivan Toney, Bryan [Mbuemo] and Yoane Wissa before, and now him. The link-up play for the team gets better from game-to-game and this is what we need, not only him scoring.”Andy HunterMatch report:Everton 2-4 Brentford10Burnley lag behind promoted rivalsThere’s been a twisted sense of solidarity among the relegated clubs in the last couple of seasons. They’ve come up together from the Championship – and instantly gone down together, too. But Burnley’s journey this season has become increasingly lonely, with the other new boys,Sunderlandand Leeds, appearing safer and safer. As Daniel Farke’s side extended their unbeaten run to seven games and Sunderland made it five without defeat, Scott Parker was forced to confront a new low in Burnley’s loss to Brighton with just two points collected from their last 11 matches. Having praised his side’s application in defeat previously this season, this time there was just a series of glum admissions from the head coach, who pointed to an absence of belief among his players and said they didn’t deserve anything from the match. Six points from safety doesn’t sound too bad, but Parker’s analysis makes it feel pretty dismal.THMatch report:Brighton 2-0 BurnleyThis article was published beforeManchester United announced the sacking of Ruben Amorimon Monday.PosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal2026482Man City2026423Aston Villa209424Liverpool204345Chelsea2011316Man Utd204317Brentford204308Sunderland202309Newcastle2042910Brighton2032811Fulham20-12812Everton20-22813Tottenham Hotspur2042714Crystal Palace20-12715AFC Bournemouth20-72316Leeds20-72217Nottm Forest20-141818West Ham20-201419Burnley20-191220Wolverhampton20-266Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballAston VillaNottingham ForestWolverhampton WanderersWest Ham UnitedBournemouthArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They said they were aiming to offer representation for players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport.One of the goals made clear along the way was to become a full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements like those that exist in team sports, although that has not happened.Djokovic said on X on Sunday that he had “ongoing concerns regarding transparency, governance, and the way my voice and image have been represented”.The PTPA filed a class-action lawsuit in March against the women’s and men’s tours, the InternationalTennisFederation and the sport’s integrity agency, accusing the organisations of “systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare”. The four grand slam tournaments were later added as defendants.Djokovic was not listed as a plaintiff when the suit was filed; Pospisil and other players were.That is because, Djokovic said in March, “I want other players to step up.”The lawsuit argues that players should gain access to more earnings, saying that the governing bodies that oversee the four Grand Slam tournaments – Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open and the Australian Open – and other professional events “cap the prize money tournaments award and limit players’ ability to earn money off the court.”Djokovic said on Sunday he “will continue to focus on my tennis, my family, and contributing to the sport in ways that reflect my principles and integrity. I wish the players and those involved the best as they move forward, but for me, this chapter is now closed.”Explore more on these topicsNovak DjokovicTennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Instead, his 16-18 record was not enough to save his job after a year that began with optimism the Falcons would reach the playoffs for the first time since 2017.NFL roundup: Falcons’ win over Saints throws NFC South title to PanthersRead more“I have great personal affinity for both Raheem and Terry and appreciate their hard work and dedication to the Falcons, but I believe we need new leadership in these roles moving forward,” owner Arthur Blank said in a statement.“The decision to move away from people who represent the organization so well and have a shared commitment to the values that are important to the organization is not an easy one, but the results on the field have not met our expectations or those of our fans and leadership. I wish Raheem and Terry the absolute best in their future pursuits.”The Falcons finished with four straight wins and in a three-way tie for first place in the NFC South, but the surge came after the team had already been eliminated from playoff contention. Carolina won the division on the basis of a superior record in divisional games.Blank attended Morris’s postgame news conference and hugged the second-year coach afterward. Asked whether he expected to return, Morris said: “You know, my expectation is always to be back, right?” He then looked at Blank and added: “I’m going to coach this football team as long as he allows it.”When asked whether he had discussed his job status with Blank, Morris said: “You can’t worry about those things. The boss is sitting right there. This is a business. Those decisions will be made at the proper time.”Fontenot was hired as general manager before the 2021 season.

This has long been one of his least favourite parts of the job, a fact he scarcely bothers to conceal. Occasionally everyone has to sit and wait while he sends a text. He leaves as soon as he is legitimately able. But there is of course a silver lining: if he’s sitting in the hot seat, it means he’s won.“Youse are probably all bored of seeing me now,” he said. “But I’m going to be here for many more years.” And frankly, while the going is this good, why not? Asecond world titlein a row, a 10th major trophy in just 21 attempts, the first ever £1m prize in the sport. Barry Hearn wants to get that up to £5m within the decade on a wave of Saudi investment. He’s 18 years old. Nobody in the sport is remotely as good as him. The boy is fresh andthe boy is hungryand the boy is greedy.‘The Glastonbury of sport’: Luke Littler effect takes darts to new heightsRead more“I want to put down a legacy here,” he said not long afterbeating Gian van Veenin an embarrassingly one-sided world final. “I want to win so many trophies. There’s so many years left. We don’t stop here. We keep going.”If he looked exhausted 12 months ago, emotionally and physically drained afterdefeating Michael van Gerwento scale the summit for the first time, by now he has become luxuriously accustomed to the sensation. This in itself may be the shrillest warning to the chasing pack: if they thought it was hard dethroning Littler when he merely wanted to win, try doing it when he brusquely expects to.Van Veen was simply the latest challenger to singe in the heat of battle: the debilitating awareness that 15-dart legs on throw may not be good enough, that this 96 or 127 shot will probably have to go, that your 200-point lead in the leg is by no means impregnable. The 23-year-old from the Netherlands may just be the second best player in the world on current form, coming into the final on a wave of confidence, and Littler pretty much denuded him.“If you leave a double after 12 darts, most of the time you can’t even come back, because he’s that good,” said Van Veen. “Leave a finish after nine, and if you miss, that’s it. Leg gone. That’s what Luke Littler does to you.” This is what Phil Taylor used to do to you too, and in his comportment and aggression Littler is quite possibly the closest the sport has seen to Taylor since he won his last world title in 2013.Off the oche, of course, there are clear differences between them in age, temperament and approach. Taylor was the consummate workaholic; Littler practices only as much as he needs to stay match-sharp. Taylor harboured a lifelong obsession with money; for Littler it remains a minor concern, despite the fact that on Saturday night he earned in 43 minutes almost as much as Taylor accumulated in the course of winning 16 world titles.View image in fullscreenPhil Taylor dominated darts for over two decades, winning 16 world titles.Photograph: Steven Paston/PAWe can probably surmise how Taylor secretly feels about that. But at least he can comfort himself with the fact that his record tally will never be beaten. Right?Right?Yet when the question of catching Taylor was put to Littler, you could see the cogs whirring. “Obviously it’s so far away,” he said. “What’s it, 14 to go? Another 15, 16 years, I’d say.”He might not even have been joking. Cards on the table, and feel free to loop back to this page in a couple of decades if we’re all still around. I think Littler gets to five world titles quite quickly. Perhaps even seven or eight with a fair wind. He may then eke out another couple over the subsequent years. But 16 – seriously, no. The argument against rests not with Van Veen, nor with Luke Humphries or Josh Rock or whomever else might emerge to challenge him in 2026, but in a curiously circular way with Littler himself.There is a 15-year-old kid called Tergel Khurelkhuu currently living in the Mongolian Embassy in Kensington, his travel and lodgings being footed by the Mongolian government. He’s been spending the past few months playing London leagues and youth competitions. Last summer he became the first ever Asian player to hit No 1 in the junior world rankings. He’s already posting averages of over 90. Maybe he makes it as a pro, maybe he doesn’t. But he’s indicative of an accelerating trend: the next Luke Littler could quite frankly emerge from anywhere, and at any time.He might not even have picked up a dart yet: the JuniorDartsCorporation world championship runner-up Kaya Baysal from Burnley has been playing seriously for barely two years. He may not even be a he: beyond the rapidly improving Beau Greaves keep your eye on 16-year-old Zehra Gemi of Turkey, the current Lakeside girls’ champion. Go on darts TikTok and you will find countless live streams of gifted teenagers chucking gilded arrows to an audience of about nine. This is a revolution Littler helped to catalyse, and the irony is that one day it will almost certainly devour him.Saturday night saw the retirements of the announcer John McDonald and the referee George Noble, two legends of the darting establishment. It felt fittingly symbolic that their last match should be the youngest ever world championship final. The world series lands in Saudi Arabia later this month. The world championship will move to the larger Great Hall at Alexandra Palace at the end of this year. Darts feels like an old house being stripped down and renovated at a furious rate, demolished and rebuilt until it is barely recognisable from its original form. Littler’s place at the peak may never have seemed more impregnable. But far below, the waters are rushing.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipLuke LittlerDartscommentShareReuse this content"

Additionally, they need something to say to rights-holder broadcasters, who conduct separate interviews. Not many embrace the challenge; for some it is an entirely irritating aspect of the role, a distraction from the training pitch, especially when results are not going well.Some try to use their exchanges to their advantage, to build up pressure on those above to bend to their will. For his part, Amorim was strikingly honest with the media; it rarely felt like he was hiding things when asked a question. He produced respectful answers, even if they were detrimental to his own cause at times. The music was faced, with him receiving plenty of merited criticism and dealing with the consequences until the bitterest of ends.Head coaches and managers are the ones held accountable for results, sent out to conduct pre and post-match press duties after a disappointing performance. For many supporters and pundits alike, it is all the fault of the person who picked the players and tactics for a team’s failings – no one else can be blamed.In the modern game, however, as Maresca and Amorim have discovered to their cost, the head coach or manager is no longer the most important person at a football club and, as such, it is probably time those who actually wield the power also front up to the media.View image in fullscreenJason Wilcox (right) with Ruben Amorim at the F1 British Grand Prix in July.Photograph: Peter Powell/EPAChelsea’s co-sporting directors, Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, carried out an interview with the Daily Telegraph in 2024 and some internal media duties after joining the club in 2022. When Maresca was sacked their names did not appear on the statement, despite having triumphed the fact Maresca’s “ambitions and work ethic align with those of the club” when initially appointing him.Given that, they should surely comment on whether or not their recruitment efforts have played a role in Chelsea winning one of their past eight Premier League games.At United, Jason Wilcox, the director of football, also operates in the shadows. He made a rare journey into the light for in-house media after a run of three straight victories in October, enjoying a pleasant walk around the training ground in the sunshine, sending out a positive message.Ruben Amorim is gone, but Manchester United’s forever crisis rolls onRead moreThe minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is more open to carrying out media duties, but is not a football expert. Surely it would be better for those with the knowledge of the sport to attempt to control the narrative and for it to not always have fallen on Amorim’s shoulders to explain United’s failings, regardless of the weather.Clubs live and die by their recruitment, but those identifying the talent pass on the responsibility of whether they succeed or fail to others. Amorim did not sign Joshua Zirkzee, who clearly did not fit into his plans, but was made to discuss the Netherlands forward when it should have been those who scouted and negotiated the deal.Graham Potter and Nuno Espírito Santo arrived mid-season at West Ham to find unbalanced squads, having to work with what they had after repeated ill-judged signings over a sustained period. It was left to Nuno to apologise to fans on Saturday aftera desperate defeat to Wolves, not those who have overseen West Ham’s problems in the long term.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley, left, and Laurence Stewart, have rarely made public comments.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockIn the Bundesliga, sporting directors regularly address questions from the media. When Bayer Leverkusenparted ways with Erik ten Hag– Amorim’s predecessor at Old Trafford – after three games this season, Simon Rolfes fronted up in a statement and has since given interviews. A lesson there for his English counterparts.Football clubs, certainly at elite level, are professional businesses with supposedly clear strategies overseen by large teams. As such, it is not right that one person should be held accountable when things are going wrong, especially when trial by media leads to them and only them being found guilty of failure and, in the end, speaking out in such a way that they end up getting sacked.Explore more on these topicsFootballManchester UnitedChelseaRuben AmorimanalysisShareReuse this content"

Which was very good of them.Celtic do not have a monopoly on bad decision-making. It just currently feels as if that is the case. A club who have dominated in Scotland for more than a decade, who have vast resources and more scope to plan than others of much lower stature, should never have been seeking a fourth manager in one season. That they are points firmly towards a lack of strategy and direction. It is a preposterous situation. Celtic are lucky that O’Neill, 73, retains an appetite to work. He also ticks another box, that of being idolised in the stands.Wilfried Nancy sacked by Celtic after eight matches and 33 days in chargeRead moreIt took more than 40 days to hire Nancy,who duly lasted 33. He had no adequate credentials for this post and a one-dimensional outlook that failed even against moderate opposition in Scotland. Paul Tisdale, the head of football operations, is the sacrificial lamb. It was always extraordinary that an individual whose claim to fame is managing Exeter could be handed any degree of power at a club of Celtic’s size. Tisdale’s exit, like Nancy’s, will not trigger any tears. Far more intriguing is how Celtic ended up with such underwhelming personnel in key roles.A serious, functioning Celtic would have allowed Nancy to sign the new centre-forward and centre-back the team cravebefore Rangers visited. Available evidence suggests the outcome may have been no different – senior players were highly sceptical of Nancy from the outset – but this would have been a statement of intent. The decline of Celtic’s squad, once so rich in assets, is astonishing. Nancy needed to be pragmatic when instead he was an ideologue. His employers must have known thathiring a manager of this ilk in Decemberwould mean a significant January overhaul that suddenly has to take an entirely different form.Celtic’s season has been defined by statements rather than victories. The first, rambling in nature, blamed everything short of Magna Carta for woes in the summer transfer market. Brendan Rodgers wasberated in writing by Dermot Desmond, Celtic’s main shareholder, when departing in late October. The deeply personal nature of Desmond’s attack was classless, not least towards a manager who had delivered sustained success. Rodgers remains the highest calibre of coach Celtic could attract.Desmond’s son, Ross, caused furyat Celtic’s annual general meetingwith his defence of directors and criticism of fans. This occasion, brought to an unruly halt, was an embarrassment for all involved. When the chairPeter Lawwell resigned in Decemberdue to “abuse and threats”, Celtic’s followers were again placed in the spotlight. For Lawwell to walk away, the level of intimidation must have been severe. His interim replacement, Brian Wilson, joined Desmond Sr and the chief executive, Michael Nicholson, in welcoming O’Neill back. But missing, sorely missing, was proper detail of what led these people down the Nancy path. Without it, directors stand accused of replacing a manager simply because supporters are screaming in their faces.View image in fullscreenMartin O'Neill returns to Celtic for a second spell as interim manager this season following Wilfried Nancy’s dismissal.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAThose responsible for targeting Lawwell should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. He was an undoubted asset to the club. Yet there is a lingering danger that Celtic have confused extreme and outrageous behaviour with the attitudes of a silent majority. Plenty of sane, peaceful Celtic observers have legitimate concerns about the club’s direction. All those supporters want is for Celtic to be the best version of itself; instead, the club are staggering around in the dark. Nancy was a symptom of that. Someone, somewhere, has to act as the adult in the room and mend bridges between club and fanbase. It will not be Wilson, who has been on the board for two decades. O’Neill has enough on his plate. Celtic will never be in financial peril under Dermot Desmond but the Irishman or his son have to properly demonstrate they are progressive custodians for this football era.Celtic Park is a tired venue. This is a business which has a last reported £77m in the bank, which apparently finds it as difficult to upgrade facilities as it does to sign footballers. Nicholson makes himself available to nobody besides, very occasionally, an in-house media team. Celtic give the impression of being far too comfortable with being big fishes in a small pond.There are two bizarre elements to this. First, Celtic proved – in the exception to a recent rule – they could mix it with the best during last season’s Champions League. This offered reason to progress, not regress. A glitzy world beyond Scotland briefly seemed to appeal to a club otherwise obsessed with staying a few steps ahead of Rangers. It is also a reality that this hitherto miserable campaign is salvageable. Celtic could emerge from the league phase of the Europa League. A domestic double is feasible.Should these uplifting outcomes come to fruition, they would provide no justification for the pickle Celtic find themselves in. A reboot is desperately needed. An appropriate acknowledgment of failure around Nancy should be just the start.Explore more on these topicsCelticScottish PremiershipcommentShareReuse this content"

This reflects the disruption to Palace’s season if Guéhi does depart and their need to replace the 25-year-old.Pep Guardiola rues Manchester City injury crisis after Gvardiol and Dias blowRead moreCity’s interest comes after Josko Gvardiol sustained a tibial fracture, or a shinbone break, on his right leg in Sunday’s1-1 draw with Chelseaat the Etihad Stadium. The club said the 23-year-old will have surgery. While they did not put a timeline on his absence, he is likely to be out for an extended period.Rúben Dias was also injured in the game, though his prognosis is yet to emerge, and with John Stones already absent through persistent injury, Pep Guardiola is without three frontline centre-backs. As the physical robustness of a fourth, Nathan Aké, is also a concern, City have moved to target Guéhi.View image in fullscreenJosko Gvardiol after suffering a broken shinbone in Sunday’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAYet as the player is a free agent in the close season whether he would choose to move now is unclear – a sizeable signing-on fee would be lost if so. As a first choice in Thomas Tuchel’s England team Guéhi also needs to be sure of consistent playing time before this summer’s World Cup.Beyond City, Guéhi remains of interest to Liverpool, and he is also admired on the continent, with Bayern Munich and Real Madrid among potential suitors.Regarding Gvardiol, a City statement read: “The defender will have surgery later this week and assessment remains ongoing to ascertain the full extent of the injury and expected prognosis. Everyone at the club wishes Josko a speedy recovery.”The Croatia international said he would “fight every day to return stronger”, adding on X: “This is a hard moment, but it will never define me.

His eagerly awaited dispatches were invariably packed with thought-provoking opinions on an assortment of topics, ranging from dead balls to Donald Trump. Below are excerpts from a cross-section of Rosenior’s thoughts during his three years with us, alongside a sense of what they tell us about the 41-year-old and how he could carry out his duties at Stamford Bridge. It is important to remember, of course, that Rosenior’s views may have changed in the intervening period.Liam Rosenior arrives in London to discuss taking over as Chelsea managerRead moreFans’ Bilic abuse has me questioning my desire to be a football manager, 26 Oct 2017“Everyone at the London Stadium as well as millions around the world saw the criticism, abuse and ridicule Slaven Bilic was subjected to last Friday night as we recorded a superb win over West Ham [then managed by Bilic]. What they didn’t witness was that same man standing outside the Brighton dressing room afterwards, waiting for each and every one of our players and coaches to offer congratulations and a warm handshake. A few minutes before I was sat behind the technical area while chants of ‘sacked in the morning’ and ‘you don’t know what you’re doing’ crashed down on Bilic from the stands and yet here he was in the quiet of the tunnel displaying a humility and courtesy which very few people could find in those circumstances and, for the first time in my life, I questioned my own ambition to be a manager.”Rest assured, Rosenior knows precisely what he is getting into at Stamford Bridge.We need a culture shift, not just Rainbow Laces, for players to come out, 23 Nov 2017“I had an experience some years ago where I heard a manager say: ‘If I found out one of my players is gay, they wouldn’t be playing in my team’ … If I was gay and in earshot of that remark from somebody in a position of power it would not only hurt me to the core but make me question whether football is ready to consider me an equal. I feel ashamed that our men’s game, followed and revered by millions of people, does not at the moment have a role model who feels comfortable enough to be openly gay and play a sport we all love.”Chelsea’s players can expect Enzo Maresca’s likely successor to take a dim view of dated macho dressing-room banter.Without action, we risk losing a generation of BAME coaches, 7 Dec 2017“I strongly believe the ethnic background of a coach doesn’t make a difference in their competence to do the job and nor does it influence their ability, so opportunities should be based solely on merit. However it is undeniable that players from ethnic backgrounds are vastly under-represented in high-level coaching positions. Coaching is more than just ‘knowing football’ – it is about having empathy and engagement with players while being able to relate them to them on a football, social and psychological level. In my career I’ve seen so many misunderstood young talents from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds struggle in our football culture and fall out of the game completely, where maybe a coach from a similar background could engage, empathise and motivate them to maximise their potential.”Do not be surprised to see Rosenior using his position to highlight the glaring under-representation of black managers and coaches in English football.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior, photographed in July 2017 during his playing days at Brighton.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianMichael Carrick, a canny midfield marvel who went underappreciated, 25 Jan 2018“When we show the next generation of young midfield players the art of receiving possession on the half turn, enabling your line of sight to open up the pitch so you know your next pass before you even receive the ball, there is no English player who has been as consistently good at this as Carrick. Nor one who has been able to play the ball quickly, with both feet, between the lines to attacking players with short incisive passes.”Michael Carrick’s status as a Rosenior hero highlights his penchant for midfielders who know how to take care of the ball.Give us a break: why a few days in the sun can be crucial for a season’s run-in, 22 Mar 2018“These trips can be crucial in terms of the rejuvenation of the physical capabilities of players – helping them to train and afterwards recover with the health benefits of Vitamin D from the sun. And perhaps more important is the opportunity for players to sit together, to have meals in a completely different environment and to have shared experiences as a group – something that, if done sensibly and within the boundaries of acceptable behaviour, can have remarkably positive results in the improvement of that vital, if intangible component, team spirit. I have been on mid-season breaks and sensed a complete change in the standard of performance both in training and matches.”Memo to Chelsea’s travel department: get a mid-season squad break in the sun sorted sharpish.Pragmatism and set plays could be decisive factor in World Cup success, 21 Jun 2018“The fact VAR has been incorporated for the first time has completely affected the way teams are defending corners and wide free-kicks, as is the fact more penalties are being awarded for shirt pulling and overly aggressive defending,. Psychologically you can see that defenders are more aware of this and I see this is leading to more and more chances coming from set plays, making the importance of organisation in these areas more crucial than ever.”These reflections made during the 2018 World Cup in Russia indicate quite clearly that Rosenior is a forward thinker, way ahead of thetactical curve and someone who will not underestimate the importance of free-kicks, corners and throw-ins during his time in west London.This is just the beginning, I promise you: an open letter to Donald Trump, 5 Jun 2020“You are the reason why my daughters – who are US citizens – ask me: ‘Why does the President hate black people? You are the catalyst for our future generations to impact lasting change, not only to your corroding country but countries all over the world, including here in the UK. You truly mirror the views and ideology of a group of people we must and will overcome.”Written against the backdrop of the USpresident’s attempts to crush protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd, Rosenior’s hope that Donald Trump might be an unwitting catalyst for overdue cultural global change was possibly a tad optimistic. Even so, he is clearly not thesort of manager who believesfootball and politics belong in separately-sealedboxes.Explore more on these topicsChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nigeria, for at least two decades, have been a team that huffed and puffed, struggled with the weight of their own history and expectation, seemed always less than the sum of their parts. Even as they won the tournament in 2013, or got to the final in 2024, the sense of effort was palpable. Nothing came easily to them. They’re not meant to be a side who canter through last-16 ties.But on a foul night in Fez, though, the rain leaching across the stadium, Nigeria, inspired by Ademola Lookman, produced a performance of emphatic attacking quality and effectively had the game won with two goals before the half hour. Lookman put them ahead after 20 minutes with his third goal of the tournament, a typical finish into the top corner after a clever cutback from Akor Adams. Five minutes later, it was Lookman’s cross that Victor Osimhen turned in to make it 2-0. The same combination added a third two minutes into the second half, and whatever sliver of hope remained forMozambiquewas vanquished for good. Adams smashed in a fourth from yet another Lookman assist.Egypt 3-1 Benin (aet): Africa Cup of Nations last 16 tie – as it happenedRead moreFor Nigeria, some things remain always the same. The bonus dispute that led to the players refusing to train two days before their World Cup qualifying playoff against DR Congo seems to have faded away, but their coach Éric Chelle revealed shortly before the tournament that he has not been paid for three months. There have been the familiar rows as well about media access, a constant sense of background grumbling and disharmony.But on the pitch, it’s been a refreshingly unusual story. This has been a free-flowing Nigeria. They scored eight goals in winning all three group games but looked extremely open at the back, failing to keep a clean sheet. The win over Tunisia was perhaps the best example of that as Nigeria raced into a 3-0 lead only to be left clinging on as they conceded twice in the final 16 minutes. This, though, was a far more complete performance.It was, admittedly, only against Mozambique, who were playing in the knockout phase for the first time in their history and were outclassed. But it was far more impressive than Egypt’s performance earlier in the day: the Pharaohs needed extra time to see off Benin.They eventually won 3-1,Mohamed Salahgetting the third late in extra time, the first time he has scored three times in a single Cup of Nations. But this is still a side that is better in potential than in reality. Plenty of champions have developed as the tournament goes on but Egypt have a lot of improving to do if they are to add an eighth Cup of Nations title.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah seals Egypt’s place in the quarter-finals with their third goal.Photograph: Jalal Morchidi/EPAWhether Nigeria have sufficient defensive discipline against better sides remains open to question. But they certainly have the attacking capacity. Lookman, all pace and darting thrusts, a fine finisher and a fine crosser, and a player capable of scoring from range, has had an excellent tournament, operating as a No 10 behind Osimhen and Akor. Osimhen remains a top-class centre-forward, his movement and hold-up play exemplary. The way he took his first goal, getting over an awkward bounce to guide in a deft jab, was indicative of his intelligence as a finisher. It’s probably only his injury record that prevented any major western European club signing him in the big-man summer just gone; he remains at Galatasaray.Alex Iwobi is a player who divides opinion in Nigeria, in part because he’s been asked to play in pretty much every midfield role for the national team, creating a confused set of expectations. Here, on the left of the midfield three, his composure, positional play and distribution were highlighted, and he links up notably well with Lookman, who tends to drift left. With Brentford’s Frank Onyeka on the right of the midfield three, though, that leaves Wilfred Ndidi to shoulder a significant amount of the defensive burden.It’s a very attacking way of playing, very different to Chelle’s Mali side and very different to the Nigeria who ground their way through World Cup qualifying. This Nigeria is almost unrecognisable from the stodgy team beaten on penalties by DR Congo in that World Cup qualifying playoff. It’s an unsettling change. The relative underachievement of Nigeria in the Cup of Nations – just three titles for by far the most populous African nation, and one with a deep footballing tradition – is supposed to oppress their players, to hand them the heaviest shirts on the continent. And yet here they are playing with a gleeful abandon.Will it bring them the fourth title they have desired for so long, pulling them level with their great rivals Ghana? The defence remains a doubt. But they have the firepower and, for the first time in a long time, there is a simple pleasure in watching their attempt.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Nigeria football teamMozambiqueMohamed SalahEgypt football teamAfrica Cup of NationsBenin football teammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

That was described by the family’s lawyers as “totally unacceptable, for a hearing due to start on 5 January”.A lawyer representing Sheffield United said the club “rejects wholeheartedly any suggestion of non-compliance”. The coroner agreed that the club had complied with what had been asked of them chronologically.The new date for the inquest may be pushed back further after Cusack’s former manager at Sheffield United, Jonathan Morgan, told the court he was unsure whether his wife had booked a holiday for early July, which would clash with some of the proposed dates. Morgan will be on a list of more than 20 people called to give evidence.The coroner said Morgan, who appeared at Chesterfield town hall via video link, must contact her office within 24 hours to clarify his holiday dates and that he would need to provide evidence if any holiday had been booked. In the meantime a 29 June start date was set, with up to two weeks allocated to complete the inquest.Morgan said he would be representing himself during the proceedings, despite repeatedly being reminded of offers of legal support and the options available to him, for example from a union such as the League Managers Association.Dean Armstrong KC, representing the family remotely on a video call, accused Sheffield United “for reasons that are frankly beyond us” of ignoring their requests to meet a specific timeline despite repeated emails sent in autumn 2025, adding with regards to the receipt of 699 pages on 15 December: “The family found themselves, already at the most difficult time in their lives, having to go through material at Christmas – we regard that as unacceptable. It’s upsetting. It’s clearly had an impact on the family’s health.”Joseph O’Brien KC, representing the club, rejected Armstrong’s words, saying via video: “His criticism of Sheffield United was wholly misplaced. We are very clear we have complied with everything that was required and within the spirit of trying to keep the hearing of 5 January as a live hearing.”It was agreed on Monday that no evidence is to be submitted after a deadline of the middle of May, six weeks before the new date, in an attempt to avoid a repeat and further delays.Armstrong described the delays as “extremely disappointing” because the “family are very keen to progress matters as soon as possible” and described it as a “hugely difficult time for them”.The coroner, Sophie Cartwright, said sorry multiple times to the family for the timeline and turned directly to speak to the Cusack family, saying: “You have been in my thoughts, particularly over Christmas.”Explore more on these topicsSheffield United WomenWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

There on the touchline, talk inevitably turned to his former roommate, housemate and teammate Joan García, now in goal for their greatest rivals. Carreras’s answer was just about audible over all the noise and then he was off again: he had something else to do before it all started, accepting a shirt marking his 100th game for Espanyol. Behind them as club legend Rafa Marañón presented it, the team captains lined up for a photo of their own with the first Catalan to referee this fixture in 80 years and, way off to the left out of shot, García clapped. Like everything else he did, except actually play, he did so discreetly.Joan and Jofre, both 24, have known each other “for as long as I can remember”, in Carreras’s words. Over four years, they shared a room at Espanyol’s residency on Carretera de Mataró in Sant Adrià del Besòs and then they shared an apartment. When García collected his award as Espanyol’s best player in 2023-24, and was handed a supply of sausages, Carreras also received an award – two different supporters’ clubs rewardingtwo different winners on the same day. When García started being noticed beyond Barcelona, Carreras declared his friend the world’s best. And when the summer heat got a bit much – and, boy, did it – García took refuge at Carreras’s. Now though they were opponents. And that, Carreras said, was “a bit strange”.European football: García back to haunt Espanyol as Barcelona go seven clearRead moreIt was also, it turned out, decisive: the difference in a derby that became even more about García than it was always going to be. What Carreras saw then, others saw on Saturday night when an astonishing performance from the goalkeeper he grew up with led Barcelona to a 2-0 victory, somehow unmoved amid all the mayhem. “In the end, that’s football,” Carreras had said, and in the end it was.Born in Sallent, 70km from Barcelona, García arrived at Espanyol’s residency shortly after his 15th birthday. Tall and daring, sometimes a little too daring, there was a touch of Casillas in his reflexes but with the physique and presence to dominate. Although he was as fast a learner as he was in the sprints where he left other keepers behind, it wasn’t always easy. There were two meniscus injuries. He had good goalkeepers ahead of him and early, isolated opportunities didn’t go well. His debuts, in 2021 in the cup and 2022 in the league, weren’t the kind you dream of. And yet, he would later say, it was probably better that way, a value in having errors to address and learning to live with them. Learning patience too.When Manolo González took over, the best thingthat happened to Espanyol in yearswas the best thing that could have happened to García too. That season insegundahe hadn’t played until March 2024; he played every game thereafter. Espanyol won promotion and in their first season back he was a revelation, salvation celebrated with the Espanyol badge brought to his lips.At which point, enter Barcelona. García had been at Espanyol a decade and his family were members: he knew leaving was one thing, natural enough, but that leaving forthemwas something else entirely, unforgivable. Speculation grew, the pressure too. “He feels Espanyol and I don’t think he will go there,” González said. “I’m not saying I’d cut off my hand if he did, but almost.” Yet in mid-June García became the first player to cross the Diagonal since Igor Korneev 31 years ago, although these days it’s not so much crossing the Diagonal as heading up it, beyond the city along the B20 and off at exit 16A towards Tarragona.Barcelona paid the buyout clause, nothing Espanyol could do. “I have to say goodbye to my home since I was 15,” García said, insisting that he would always “respect what I leave behind”, proud of leaving Espanyol inprimera. “I know it won’t be easy for everyone to understand,” he said, and he was right.View image in fullscreenJoan García plays in the derby, while Espanyol supporters hold flags picturing a red and blue rat.Photograph: Urbanandsport/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“Everyone chooses their path, what’s best for them,” Carreras said during Saturday’s warm-up and the money (€25m plus taxes) allowed Espanyol to renew Javi Puado’s contract, and keep Urko and Roberto, who were so vital in survival last season.Ty Dolan arrived too, and García’s replacement Marko Dmitrovic. Espanyol came into the derby in fifth having won five in succession. Which was one reason why Saturday’s meeting felt so big, a proper contest at last after two titles won and no games lost in 16 years at Espanyol, butthereason was García. Everything built around his return, the hostility supposedly awaiting him. “From love to hate, there’s often a single step,” El Mundo wrote. “More than a derby,” Sport called it, not exactly imaginatively. This, said Marca’s cover, was “a derby on fire”.Espanyol had put up nets to ensure that any missiles didn’t reach their former player, and called for calm. “Everyone is waiting for us to screw it up,” González lamented, so don’t let them. He also said that he remembered thepig’s head thrown at Luís Figo, so maybe hold off on the lessons in morality. “We’re not going to be coming with bunches of roses,” Espanyol’s coach said. “That’s normal; that’s rivalry.” Instead, Barcelona awoke with Espanyol posters up at bus stops and metro stations:Blue and white Barcelona, Anti-cule zone, the pride of Barcelona, Fucking Bar$a. They came with fake dollar bills, “Judas” García printed on them. They came with banners: one showed a beheading, most were emblazoned with rats. They carried cuddly rodents. They whistled García’s every move and literally called for his head.But García’s head is not for turning. However safe his hands and quick his feet, that might be the best part of him. Instead, he seemed to inhabit some place above the noise, the tension. “He’s a very calm guy; he prepared like always, very meticulous. He has so much confidence,” Jules Koundé said. García hadn’t said a word all week and didn’t now, yet he said it all. When Barcelona scored, Dani Olmo hitting a wonderful shot on 86 minutes and Robert Lewandowski adding a late second, he didn’t smile, didn’t react, but he had won.View image in fullscreenGarcía tips away another Espanyol effort.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersThe goals were fantastically set up by Fermin López but without García, Barcelona wouldn’t have got that far. A belting derby – the word “thanks” appeared 56 times in one 515-word report – was dominated by Espanyol, González proud of his team and his fans and unable to explain how they had lost. Except for, well,him. “Sorry, I’m not talking about Joan García,” he said, tired of having his words twisted. “What I think of Joan I’ve said here 50 times before.” What he had said was that just as Barcelona had Messi so Espanyol had García. And on Saturday night, for much of this season, that didn’t seem so far-fetched. His signing feels like a gamechanger, with 77% of shots stopped. Here, it was 100%. Seven from seven, five of them superb, on a night that was barely believable.“Mother of God almighty, what a goalkeeper!” Lamine Yamal posted. “Spectacular,” Fermin called him. “He’s amazing,” Olmo said. He had come “dressed as Superman” El Mundo Deportivo claimed, pants on the outside and everything. “Super Joan,” said Sport’s cover. He was “from science fiction”, El Periódico claimed. Poor Roberto could only look lost. Against a normal keeper, he might have had a hat-trick. They had been playing 20 minutes when he was clean through the first time, García stopping him. When the striker escaped after an hour, he did it again, twisting and launching at his feet. There was a flash at the near post, a swoop towards the far post. Another save led to an incredible stop that doesn’t even count as his but might just be the best. Seeing he couldn’t reach the rebound, García shoved Gerard Martín in the back, sending his own central defender flying in to block.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowRayo Vallecano 1-1 Getafe, Celta Vigo 4-1 Valencia, Osasuna 1-1 Athletic Club, Elche 1-3 Villarreal, Espanyol 0-2 Barcelona, Sevilla 0-3 Levante, Real Madrid 5-1 Real Betis, Mallorca 1-2 Girona, Alavés 1-1 Oviedo, Real Sociedad 1-1 Atlético MadridWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But it was one from a Pere Milla header, shifting in the air, throwing his arms out and somehow pushing over from a yard, that will linger longest, as good as any stop you’ll see. “That save’s one of the most important and lovely this season,” Koundé said; even more eloquent were the reactions of three opponents. Dolan was already celebrating; Carlos Romero stood in disbelief, waggling his fingers like he had trapped them in a drawer; Milla shook his head, approached García and gave him a gentle fist bump. Respect, you bastard. Seen that somewhere before.At the full-time whistle, sheet somehow kept clean, Dmitrovic – who made an astonishing save of his own – embraced him. “He’s a great kid,” the new Espanyol goalkeeper said. “He’s having a great season, even better than last year, which I didn’t know was possible. Another at this level and he’ll be the best in the world. I wish him all the luck in the world, except when we meet again.”As the two goalkeepers pulled apart and García headed towards the tunnel where his former flatmate waited, Hansi Flick grabbed him in a bear hug. “We didn’t deserve this win, I’ll be honest,” Barcelona’s coach said. “I have to say thank you to Joan García. His body language, his confidence, it’s fantastic, he gives us positive energy. I know he appreciates a lot and doesn’t forget everything that happened here: Manolo trusted him.

It is understood the striker has grown dissatisfied with life under Nuno Espírito Santo and wants a new challenge.Wilson was signed on a cheap incentivised one-year deal and his situation is an apparent sign of wider discontent within the squad over their manager. Nuno, whose side are at increasing risk of relegation from the Premier League, isin danger of losing the dressing room’s supportbecause of concerns over his tactics and man-management.Nuno Espírito Santo is losing support of West Ham squad as morale deterioratesRead moreIt is unclear how quickly an agreement will be reached for Wilson to leave West Ham, who are 18th before Tuesday’s pivotal home game against Nottingham Forest. . There are indications the former Newcastle striker’s departure may come towards the end of the transfer window, but is unclear whether as free agent or if West Ham will try to sell him.West Ham have confirmed the signings of two forwards picked by Nuno: Pablo Felipe from Gil Vicente and Taty Castellanos from Lazio for a combined package of up to £47m. Both could be involved against Forest, who are four points above West Ham. Winger Luis Guilherme, signed from Palmeiras in July 2024, has left permanently this month for Sporting.Nuno was sacked by Forestlast September and quicklyreturned to managementwhen West Ham fired Graham Potter that month. It is understood West Ham, who suffereda humiliating defeat at Wolveson Saturday, do not plan to sack thim if he loses to his former side. Nuno has won two of his 15 games and multiple sources say he has done little to endear himself to many of his players.Morale at the club is low and there has been frustration around Nuno’s tactical decisions. Figures within West Ham have been surprised by Nuno’s use of Wilson, who has scored four goals in 18 times. Although it is accepted striker’s physical load needs to be managed carefully, there is a feeling that West Ham are a better side with him and his bit-part role in recent weeks has caused surprise. There was frustration when Wilson was substituted in the 63rd minute of last week’s2-2 draw against Brighton, leaving West Ham to play without a recognised forward.Wilson has started the past two games, but was a substitute in the previous four. There was surprise when he did not come on duringWest Ham’s dismal 2-0 defeat by Brentfordin October. Nuno had started without a striker. West Ham produced improved performances when Wilson came into the XI for winsover NewcastleandBurnleyin October.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

And may him have mercy on you.”It is the second time in less than 12 months that the 26-year-old has been subjected to such abuse and Northumbria police have confirmed they have initiated an investigation that will involve their officers working in conjunction with the UK Football Policing Unit.“We are disgusted by racist abuse received by Joe Willock on Instagram on Sunday evening,” Newcastle said. “Following our win over Crystal Palace, Joe received several direct messages from an Instagram account that included racial slurs and deeply disturbing threats of violence towards Joe and his family. Sadly, Joe has faced this before. Each time we have acted quickly to support him and this has been our immediate priority again.“We have swiftly reported this material to the police and we will fully support any investigation to identify the person responsible and hold them accountable, wherever they are.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As Newcastle emphasise, the police are likely to hit brick walls unless Meta are prepared to reveal the private information needed to identify the Instagram user. “This can only happen with meaningful action from Meta, Instagram’s owners,” said Newcastle. “We urge Meta to give the police all the information they need to identify the perpetrator, and to do so quickly.“Removing content and applying message filters in not enough. Social media companies must do more to protect users and support the prosecution of those who seek to break the law on their platforms. We stand firmly with Joe and anyone else who faces this kind of abuse.”Richard Offiong, the campaign coordinator for Show Racism the Red Card, a leading anti-racism educational charity, said there was an urgent need for social media companies to do far more to stop racist abuse across their platforms.“Strong measures are needed to identify perpetrators quickly, remove harmful content and ensure those responsible face real consequences. Education, accountability and robust enforcement must go hand in hand if we are serious about tackling racism.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedMetaRacenewsShareReuse this content"

Martin O’Neill has been reinstalled as interim manager until the end of the season.The 48-year-old French coach was hired from the Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew on a two-and-a-half year contract on 4 December. He was in charge for only eight matches, six of which ended in defeat, before being sacked by the crisis-hit Scottish champions on Monday. A3-1 home defeat by Rangerson Saturday proved the final straw. Celtic led 1-0 at half-time before a second-half collapse promptedmore proteststowards the club’s deeply unpopular board and their most recent managerial appointment.Despite the turmoil at Celtic Nancy took over a team that had won seven of eight games under the interim manager O’Neill to move back into title contention. The popular 73-year-old, who replaced Brendan Rodgers in October, will come back for a second time this season as Celtic start their search for a permanent manager again. O’Neill’s assistant during his interim spell, Shaun Maloney, is back too.O’Neill said in a statement: “I know we would all have hoped for things to have worked out differently under Wilfried and I personally want to wish him good luck with everything he does in the game. He is a fine man and I am sure he will go on and achieve success again, I have no doubt of that.“For me, I’ve been asked to take this great job on again and my focus will be to try and get us back to winning ways if we can. We will need everyone right behind us.”View image in fullscreenMartin O’Neill won seven out of eight games in his first spell as Celtic’s interim manager.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty ImagesNancy became the first Celtic manager to lose his first two matches before suffering a humiliatingdefeat by St Mirrenin the Scottish League Cup final. When his next game ended in a 2-1 reverse at Dundee United it was the first time since 1978 that Celtic had lost four games in succession. Nancy won two matches – against 10-man Aberdeen and the bottom club Livingston – and presided over a calamitous defence that failed to keep a clean sheet and conceded 18 goals in eight games, one more than in the previous 24 matches.Celtic are six points behind the league leaders, Hearts, and have managed to out-do Rangers in terms of disastrous managerial appointments this season.Russell Martin lasted 123 days and 17 gamesin the shortest managerial reign in Rangers’ history.In a brief statement thanking Nancy for his efforts Celtic confirmed his assistants Kwame Ampadu, Jules Gueguen and Maxime Chalier had also left along with Paul Tisdale, their head of football operations. Tisdale, a former Exeter City manager, was also a target for disillusioned Celtic supporters for the dismal player recruitment during his 15 months in the role.Since winning the title last season, Celtic have parted company with two permanent managers in Rodgers and Nancy, and a head of football operations in Tisdale, and the chair Peter Lawwell stepped down in response to fierce criticism of how the club is run.Explore more on these topicsCelticScottish PremiershipMartin O'NeillnewsShareReuse this content"

In the mixed doubles dead rubber, Neal Skupski and Olivia Nicholls defeated Despina Papamichail and Stefanos Sakellaridis 6-2, 3-6, 10-4.Emma Raducanu ruled out of United Cup opener in false start to new seasonRead moreRaducanu said she was frustrated with the defeat but satisfied with her performance: “Considering the circumstances, doubt whether I was going to play or not today, I’m pretty happy with how I was able to play a match of three sets,” she said. “Considering I played five, six games in practice, it is a big effort for me. I’m really proud of how I put myself out there, despite the scenario and situation.”In what has become a common theme in Raducanu’s career, the 23-year-old entered the stadium surrounded by doubts about her form and preparation after Sunday’s revelation that her foot injury had forced her off the court for most of the off-season.There were positives for Raducanu to take from the match – she moved well in the first two sets and as her competitive juices began to flow deep in the second set, she found her range, taking the ball early and producing some excellent shotmaking to force a third set against an impressive Sakkari. However, after giving herself a chance in the match, Raducanu flatlined in the final games while the Greek effortlessly maintained her intensity to close out her first win over the Briton in her fifth attempt.Later, Raducanu shed light on her physical struggles over the past five weeks. “I started hitting two weeks ago, so it’s been a good two and a bit months where I didn’t play. I did fitness. It’s been difficult to increase the load and add the unpredictability of the tennis. I think today, being able to produce that, having not played, is just giving me confidence to what I can do when I do practice more. I know now I just need to get my head down, keep working.”Raducanu had been hoping to follow up a solid 2025 season with a strong off-season. She said she simply had to accept her situation. “I think you have to just take it as it comes,” she said. “I went to Barcelona for two weeks, but wasn’t really able to play. I just did a lot of gym where I could, then started static hitting. I played my first points two days ago in practice. It’s been a very fast run path. Today was good exposure. Happy I spent two and a half hours out there and I’m OK right now. I just need to keep going. The season is still very, very young. Week one. There’s a long way to go.”Earlier Harris, ranked No 127, courageously took his big serve and forehand to Tsitsipas, serving excellently and constantly looking to dominate with his forehand. He pushed Tsitsipas throughout, but it was the Greek who served best and took control of the baseline in the final set tie-break to close out a much-needed win. “I’m glad that the level’s there against someone like that,” said Harris. “It gives me confidence going into the rest of the year. So yeah, no one likes to lose. I’ll take the positives, learn from the match, and hopefully come back stronger against good players again.”Explore more on these topicsTennisEmma RaducanunewsShareReuse this content"

It means that public-sector employees whose work is managed by the Scottish government will get a day off, with the decision at the discretion of other employers.Scotland men’s national team will play their first fixture against Haiti on Sunday 14 June, with a kick-off at 2am UK time. This will be followed by other late-night starts at 11pm, including against Brazil, who beat Scotland 2-1 in Scotland’s last World Cup outing back in 1998.The significant time difference, as well as the expense of tickets precluding travel for many fans, has prompted industry calls for extended pub opening hours and fan zones on the days Scotland are playing.Swinney said: “Scotland qualifying for the men’s World Cup was a remarkable achievement and a landmark moment, and the reaction to the dramatic win against Denmark reminded us all what football means to the country.“This year, we want to make the most of this huge opportunity for Scotland and ensure as many people as possible have the opportunity to celebrate the team’s success.“Not only is this an historic sporting event, it’s also a chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, create tourism interest within the country and to make cultural and sporting connections.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandWorld Cup 2026World CupJohn SwinneynewsShareReuse this content"

But the Raiders went 3-14, going on a 10-game losing streak before finishing with a 14-12 victory over Kansas City on Sunday.Browns part ways with head coach Kevin Stefanski after 5-12 seasonRead moreNow the question is where the Raiders head next under the direction of owner Mark Davis, minority owner Tom Brady and general manager John Spytek. Davis said in a statement that Spytek would work with Brady to find the next coach.“Together, they will guide football decisions with a shared focus on leadership, culture, and alignment with the organization’s long-term vision and goals,” Davis said.The club could seek an offensive-minded coach to work with a young quarterback should the Raiders draft Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza or Dante Moore with the first overall pick.That formula worked well this season in Chicago with coach Ben Johnson and quarterback Caleb Williams and in Jacksonville with coach Liam Coen and QB Trevor Lawrence. Both teams are playoff bound after experiencing losing seasons the year before.Lamar Jackson is a once in a lifetime talent. And the Ravens are still going backwardsRead moreThere is no one path to success, however. New England hired a defensive coach in Mike Vrabel, and he worked well with quarterback Drake Maye to helped the Patriots go from a 4-13 record to 14-3 and the No 2 seed in the AFC playoffs.Carroll, 74, was the NFL’s oldest head coach, and he came to Las Vegas with the intent of winning right away. He got his wish of bringing in quarterback Geno Smith, whom he coached in Seattle. Neither got the success they expected, with Smith throwing a league-high 17 interceptions as the losses piled up.This wasn’t what Carroll used to as a coach. He coached the Seahawks to a Super Bowl title and the University of Southern California to two national championships.But now Carroll has been dismissed, just as Antonio Pierce was last year and Josh McDaniels midway through the 2023 season.The Raiders have run through coaches since appearing in the Super Bowl in the 2002 season.

Ruben Amorim’sdeparture from the clubon Monday was long anticipated and came, in the end, with a weary sigh. He had made a half-hearted protest about the recruitment structure after Sunday’s draw at Leeds, but it felt even at the time like barely more than a gesture. And so another manager, the seventh since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, falls victim to the United meat-grinder.Everybody at United, fundamentally, is unhappy. And not unhappy in the sense that Alex Ferguson used to be unhappy, when the club was essentially fuelled by his volcanic rages, but enervated, frustrated by the realisation that this is not how things used to be, that this was once the biggest football club in the country and now they keep failing to get the win they need to lift them to fifth.Manchester United fan’s view: ‘Amorim out was inevitable … but I wish club had kept faith’Read moreAfter Sunday’s draw at Leeds, Amorim made clear just how unhappy he is – although this being the modernPremier League, it was an outburst that required some decoding.“I’m going to be the manager of this team, not the coach,” he said. “And that is going to finish in 18 months. And then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job – not to be the coach.”His official job title is “head coach,”, but it’s been a long time since words meant what they say in the Premier League. So what was he actually talking about? Was this about control? With managers, it usually is. Amorim went on: “Every department, the scouting department, the sport director, needs to do their job, and I’ll do mine, for 18 months.”That suggested his real complaint was over transfers, which chimed with rumors Amorim has clashed with Jason Wilcox, United’s director of football.Perhaps it’s not unreasonable for a club to decide that if the man they employed as a head coach is no longer prepared to coach there’s little point in keeping him on, but this was not a decision based on one press conference. Signs of progress have been very hard to discern for outsiders. At the end of October, United won three games in a row for the first time under Amorim – against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton. It did perhaps then seem that some sort of corner had been turned. But they’ve only won three of 11 Premier League games since. One of those wasat Wolvesand one was a game against Newcastle in which the way theyheld on to a 1-0 leaddefied logic.Amorim, having insisted that he would never play anything other than a 3-4-2-1, has started to use a back four, in part in response to having three players away at the Africa Cup of Nations. In itself, that wouldn’t be an issue; there have been plenty of calls for Amorim to be more flexible, to adapt to circumstance, so it would be unfair to criticise him for that. But if he can change, why did he not do it sooner? What was his fundamentalism all about? Had he lost faith in his method? What might have seemed like welcome pragmatism only added to the sense of uncertainty.And where does this leave United? Over the course of two transfer windows they have backed Amorim and his reshaping of the squad to the tune of £430m/$580m, with only around £165m/$200m recouped in sales. What do they look for in a new manager? Somebody who will carry on the 3-4-2-1 experiment, such as Oliver Glasner, whose contract is up in the summer and who ispretty obviously frustratedat Crystal Palace? Or somebody with a totally different approach who will need to reshape the reshaping that Amorim has begun?Manchester United fan’s view: ‘Amorim out was inevitable … but I wish club had kept faith’Read moreThe implication of Amorim’s press conference behaviour is that there wouldn’t be much money available for investment – which is, of course, at least partly Amorim’s fault. He did, after all, take over a club that had finished eighth while winning the FA Cup and lead them to 15th, before losing the Europa League final, which meant no Champions League. Prize money has diminished and there is no longer any income from European football. Revenues have dropped this season because United’s form last season was so poor. And United did spend £200m/$270m in the summer on three forwards, when one probably would have been enough.But for now the drift goes on. When Erik Ten Hag’s United finished eighth in 2023-24, it seemed like a major crisis. Things have gotten so bad since that dabbling on the fringes of European qualification just feels like United’s level. And with each season that goes by, so getting back becomes harder.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedSoccer with Jonathan WilsonPremier LeagueUS sportsnewslettersShareReuse this content"

He led Cleveland to playoff appearances in 2020 and 2023. The Browns’ 48-37 victory over Pittsburgh in an AFC wild-card round game was the franchise’s first since 1993.Ironically, Stefanski was not on the Browns’ sideline for that game after he tested positive for Covid-19. He watched the game from the basement at his house.Stefanski is the sixth coach fired since owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam bought the franchise in 2012.

General manager Monti Ossenfort will be retained.The final indignity came Sunday, when the Los Angeles Rams beat the Cardinals 37-20 after scoring the final 21 points. It was the team’s ninth straight loss and 14th setback in 15 games.Raiders fire Pete Carroll after one season; Tom Brady to advise on new hireRead moreNow a new coaching staff will get the chance to rebuild a franchise that will have the No 3 overall pick in April, but has been to the playoffs just once since 2016.The 43-year-old Gannon finished his tenure with a 15-36 record, including 3-14 this season. His firing was not necessarily surprising, but the speed of his downfall was still jarring.The Cardinals had an 8-9 record last year in Gannon’s second season and the franchise appeared on the upswing. Two-time Pro Bowl quarterback Kyler Murray was in his prime and Ossenfort spent much of the offseason upgrading the defense, adding veteran pieces like Josh Sweat, Dalvin Tomlinson and Calais Campbell.But nothing has gone as planned.Arizona won its first two games of the season, though that would prove to be the high point. The Cardinals lost the next five games by a combined 13 points, including three straight on last-second field goals.During that stretch, injuries started piling up. Murray hurt his foot in a Week 5 loss to the Titans and hasn’t played since, calling into question whether he’ll be the team’s quarterback in 2026 despite a $230.5m, five-year contract that could run through 2028.Starting running back James Conner has missed most of the season with a foot injury while receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. – who was the No 4 overall pick in 2024 – struggled with injuries and inconsistency.There were also some embarrassing moments that added to the tension. Running back Emari Demercado dropped the football just short of a touchdown while celebrating too early against the Titans, which started a stunning collapse that saw a 21-9 lead turn into a 22-21 defeat.Gannon was caught on camera angrily confronting Demercado, appearing to bump the running back as he swiped his arm downward. The Cardinals fined the coach $100,000 for his actions.Arizona was also called for a franchise-record 17 penalties in a 41-22 loss to the 49ers in Week 11. The Cardinals were 0-6 against NFC West opponents this season, losing the last four by a combined 88 points.Gannon was hired in 2023 after two seasons as the defensive coordinator for the Philadelphia Eagles, who reached the Super Bowl during his final year before losing to the Chiefs.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsCleveland BrownsAtlanta FalconsnewsShareReuse this content"

The widespread sexual abuse consists of X users asking Grok to manipulate pictures of fully clothed women to put them in bikinis, on their knees, and cover them in what looks like semen.“I felt horrified, I felt violated, especially seeing my toddler’s backpack in the back of it,” St Clair said of an image in which she has been put into a bikini, turned around and bent over.“It’s another tool of harassment. Consent is the whole issue. People are saying, well, it’s just a bikini, it’s not explicit. But it is a sexual offence to non-consensually undress a child.”Acolytes of Musk had disliked her since she went public about his desire to build a “legion” of children, she said. Musk is the father of13 other children, with three other women.She said: “It’s funny, considering the most direct line I have and they don’t do anything. I have complained to X and they have not even removed a picture of me from when I was a child, which was undressed by Grok.”The abuse started over the weekend, and she said that since it began she had been reporting it to X and Grok, to no avail. “The response time is getting longer as well,” she added. “When this first started, Grok was removing some of them.”The manipulated image of her as a 14-year-old had been up for 12 hours by Monday afternoon. It and several other images highlighted by St Clair were finally removed after the Guardian sought comment from X.She said: “Grok said it would not produce these images any more but they continued to get worse. People took pictures of me as a child and undressed me. There’s one where they undressed me and bent me over and in the background is my child’s backpack that he’s wearing right now. That really upsets me.”St Clair said the abuse became worse when she publicly complained about her images being manipulated.Since speaking out, other abuse victims have been in contact. She has been sent other disturbing sexual images the AI tool has made, including some of children. “Since I posted this I have been sent a six-year-old covered in what’s supposed to be semen,” said St Clair. “She was in a full dress. They said to put her in a blue bikini and cover her in what looks like semen.”The mainstreaming of this abuse had been made possible by Grok, she said, adding: “I am also seeing images where they add bruises to women, beat them up, tie them up, mutilated. These sickos used to have to go to the dark depths of the internet and now it is on a mainstream social media app.”St Clair believes this is being done to silence women and that the problem will get worse. This was because the AI was being “trained” on the prompts it was given by sexually abusive men, while women were being frightened off the platform by the abuse, she said.“If you are a woman you can’t post a picture and you can’t speak or you risk this abuse,” she said. “It’s dangerous and I believe this is by design. You are supposed to feed AI humanity and thoughts and when you are doing things that particularly impact women and they don’t want to participate in it because they are being targeted, it means the AI is inherently going to be biased.”She referred to it as a “civil rights issue” because “women do not have the ability to participate in and train the models the same as men when they are being targeted. The other LLMs are being trained on the internet too and it’s poisoning the well.”Musk and his team could have stopped this widespread abuse of women in minutes, she said. “These people believe they are above the law, because they are. They don’t think they are going to get in trouble, they think they have no consequences.”She added: “They are trying to expel women from the conversation. If you speak out, if you post a picture of yourself online, you are fair game for these people. The best way to shut a woman up is to abuse her.”St Clair said she was considering legal action, and believed it could be classed as revenge porn under the new Take It Down Act in the US. The UK is in the process of banning the digital undressing of women, but the relevant law is yet to reach the statute book.An X spokesperson said: “We take action against illegal content on X, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary. Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

This is the deepfake menace we must confrontYanis VaroufakisThese inventions trigger rage, but also optimism. Maybe they will make people think more critically about debate and democracyMon 5 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 14.24 ESTShareIt was my blue shirt, a present from my sister-in-law, that gave it all away. It made me think of Yakov Petrovich Golyadkin, the lowly bureaucrat in Fyodor Dostoevsky’s novella The Double, a disconcerting study of the fragmented self within a vast, impersonal feudal system.It all started with a message from an esteemed colleague congratulating me on a video talk on some geopolitical theme. When I clicked on the attached YouTube link to recall what I had said, I began to worry that my memory is not what it used to be. When did I record said video? A couple of minutes in, I knew there was something wrong. Not because I found fault in what I was saying, but because I realised that the video showed me sitting at my Athens office desk wearing that blue shirt, which had never left my island home. It was, as it turned out, a video featuring some deepfake AI doppelganger of me.Since then, hundreds of such videos, bearing my face and synthesising my voice, have proliferated across YouTube and social media. Even this weekend, there has been another crop, depicting a deepfaked me saying fictitious things about the coup in Venezuela. They lecture, they say things I might have said, sometimes intermingled with things I would never say. They rage, they pontificate. Some are crude, others unsettlingly persuasive. Supporters send them to me, asking: “Yanis, did you really say that?” Opponents circulate them as proof of my idiocy. Far worse, some argue that my doppelgangers are more articulate and cogent than me. And so I find myself in the bizarre position of being a spectator to my own digital puppetry, a phantom in atechnofeudal machineI have long argued is not merely broken, but engineered to disempower.My initial reaction was to write to Google, Meta and the rest to demand that they take down these videos. Several forms were filled in anger before, a week or more later, some of these channels and videos were taken down, only to reappear instantly under different guises. Within days I had given up: whatever I did, however many hours I spent every day trying my luck at having big tech take down my AI doppelgangers, many more would grow back, Hydra-like.View image in fullscreen‘Hundreds of videos, bearing my face and synthesising my voice, have proliferated across YouTube and social media.’ Another AI-generated image from a deepfake video of ‘Yanis Varoufakis’.Illustration: YouTubeSoon, rage gave way to contemplation. Was I not, after all,the one who arguedthat big tech did not merely digitise capitalism but in fact spearheaded a great transformation, turning markets into cloud fiefs and profit into cloud rents? Are my AI doppelgangers not the perfect confirmation that, in this technofeudal reality, theliberal individual is dead and buried?Acquiescing to the partial loss of self-ownership, I sought solace in the rationalisation of these deepfakes as the ultimate act of feudal enclosure, proof that under technofeudalism we own nothing – not our labour’s data output, not our social graphs and now not even our audiovisual identity. Our new lords see us as tenants on their cloud lands, androids whose likeness they can appropriate at will to sow confusion, to muddy discourse, to drown genuine dissent in a cacophony of synthetic noise created for this purpose.But then a sunnier thought hit me, one that harks back to ancient Athens. What if my AI doppelgangers were harbingers ofisegoria(ἰσηγορία), a principle as bright, promising and absent as genuine democracy itself? When I asked several versions of AI chatbots to define it, they all dutifully misrepresented its meaning, definingisegoriaas equality of speech, or the right to be heard, or the freedom to address the assembly. But that’s not what the Athenians meant with the word. In fact, to themisegoriameant the exact opposite of today’s “free speech”, which they would dismiss as the abstract right to shout into the void. To the Athenians, it meant the right to have your views judged seriously, on their merits, independently of who you are or indeed how well you phrase them.Might AI deepfakes salvageisegoriafrom the clutches of our technofeudal dystopia? When we realise that it is impossible to verify who is speaking in a YouTube video, might we be forced to judge the merits of what is being said, rather than who is saying it? In the process of debasing authenticity, could big tech have inadvertently givenisegoriaa chance? These questions offered a glimmer of hope.It was the hope that the spectre of democracy may still be hovering over our heads if only we can find the motivation to look up, to engage in the slow, difficult, democratic labour that the algorithmic feed was designed to obliterate: critical evaluation of views and arguments thrown at us. Alas, this hope, though tangible, is insufficient as long as our technofeudal lords retain two colossal, asymmetrical advantages.How Amazon turned our capitalist era of free markets into the age of technofeudalism | Yanis VaroufakisRead moreFirst, they own theagoraitself – the servers, the feeds, the algorithmic means of communication. They can anoint their own speech as authentic with digital seals while drowning ours in a quagmire of doubt and noise. The result? Notisegoria,but a digital divine right where truth is the patented property of power.Second, and more cunningly, they need no deepfakes to rule.Their ideologyis embedded in themachine: the power toextract surplus valuefrom proletarians connected to the cloud through various digital devices, the logic of extracting cloud rents from vassal capitalists on their platforms, the tyranny of shareholder value, their imminent success atprivatising money.So our task is not to beg these lords for verification. Our task is political. We must socialise cloud capital, the all-powerful new force transforming society and destroying everything that makes humanism imaginable.Until then, let our digital doppelgangers speak. Perhaps they will so saturate the spectacle that we finally stop listening forour voiceand start judging theargumentson their own terms. This is perhaps the most paradoxical shard of hope in a hall of mirrors. But in this carnival, we grasp at every fragment we can.Yanis Varoufakis isan economist, politician and author.

So, for thenew year, we decided to flip the script with a different question for our writers and editors: what doyouwant in 2026?It’s a little early for Santa, of course. But like asking a sommelier what elusive wine she still hasn’t been able to snag a glass of yet, we thought it might be fun to see which products our experts have scribbled away on their secret wishlists – and which we might swipe for ourselves. Here is what they told us.Cuisinart Fast Freeze Ice Cream MakerCuisinartFast Freeze Ice Cream Makerfrom$99.94$99.94 at Amazon$99.96 at Sur La TablePhotograph: Courtesy of Amazon$99.94 at Amazon$99.96 at Sur La TableI am anice creamlover and thus have my eye on the Cuisinart Fast Freeze Ice Cream Maker. It seems very easy to use: you freeze your base overnight, let it sit for a few minutes, use the electric wand to process it into ice cream (with milkshake, sorbet and slushy options), and then add in your desired mix-ins.I love that you only have to commit to half a pint at a time, which is great if you like experimenting with flavors or have to cater to the tastes of multiple household members. I originally wanted the viralNinja Creami, but as someone who lives in a city apartment with limited space, its countertop footprint has been dissuading me from purchasing. Aside from being easier to store, the Fast Freeze is also a little less spendy – who doesn’t love a deal?– Bernadette Machard de Gramont, food contributorCuisinartFast Freeze Ice Cream Makerfrom$99.94$99.94 at Amazon$99.96 at Sur La TableParamount+ streamingParamount+Monthly streaming subscription$7.99$7.99 at Paramount+Photograph: Paramount+$7.99 a month at Paramount+You might not be able to tell just by looking at me, but you will know the second I open my mouth. I am a nerd. I’ll even go one step further: I’m a Trekkie. I grew up watching The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager. I’ll even champion Star Trek: Enterprise, including the opening credits song.However, I haven’t seen any of the newStar Trekmaterial since it was moved on to Paramount+. I already have too many subscriptions on my card, and I wasn’t looking for another. But after spending a night with a friend who went on about his love forLower Decks, I may be officially swayed. So, yes, I covet a subscription toParamount+this holiday season, preferably a yearly one to take my time perusing the content, which I know includes well-reviewed originals and access to the Champions League for soccer fans.– Jon Chan, home contributorParamount+Monthly streaming subscription$7.99$7.99 at Paramount+Cuyana Travel Case SetCuyanaTravel Case Set$178$178 at CuyanaPhotograph: Courtesy of Cuyana$178 at Cuyana2025 was the year I streamlined every step of mytravelroutine, from laying out an airplane uniform to nailing down my lineup of on-the-go essentials. I became particularly strict about organizing the contents of my personal item bag – my snacks, tech cords, wallet and passport, and any other item I need easy access to. Right now, I put everything in zippered pouches, which makes me feel more put together – I no longer dig through my bag in a panic trying to find my lip balm or portable power bank. Next year, though, I want to invest in more elegant travel pouches, namely theTravel Case Setfrom Cuyana.I’ve been a fan of Cuyana for years – theClassic Easy Zipper Toteis one of my go-to personal item bags, and its leather goods are the definition of timeless. This pebbled leather set comes with two different-sized pouches: one designed for toiletries, the other for beauty essentials. I would probably use the larger one for myskincareproducts (sunscreen, moisturizer, etc) and the smaller version would hold my keys, wallet and cash. The bright poppy color is, hands down, my favorite color, but I also gravitate toward the red and burnt orange pouches.– Lydia Mansel, travel contributorCuyanaTravel Case Set$178$178 at CuyanaDiptyque Baies scented candleDiptyqueBaies candlefrom$78$78 at FRWD$78 at DiptyquePhotograph: Courtesy of Diptyque Paris$78 at FRWD$78 at DiptyqueI’m mildly obsessed with scented candles. But most synthetic fragrances in grocery store candles give me a headache and even some of the lighter, natural scents don’t match my vibe.Since I tend to light candles most days in my home, I am eternally searching for one that will smell like a real-life scent, and I particularly appreciate herbaceous, floral notes. Recently, I came across the oversized Diptyque Baies candle. With a cult following and a price to match, the “Very Large” size starts at $350, depending on the store. The scent mixes two of my favorites: elderberry and rose. But for the price, this big, beautiful candle may remain a fantasy – though I might start with the smallest size, which is $48.– DrJulia Skinner, food and gift guide writerDiptyqueBaies candlefrom$78$78 at FRWD$78 at DiptyqueSunday Best Rib HoodAritziaSunday Best Rib Hood$48$48 at AritziaPhotograph: Courtesy of Aritzia$48 at AritziaWhen I selected my mostfashionablefriend for our secret Santa gift exchange, I couldn’t recall ever being so intimidated by an undertaking. Not only is her style effortless, but it borrows from a mix of contemporary trends and timeless flair. This detached and adjustable merino wool and cotton hood from Aritzia, which I’m seeing all over my TikTok algorithm and the icy streets of Montreal, seems to check off all those boxes.The concept is simple: if you’re wearing hoodless outerwear or looking for an extra layer of insulation under an existing hood, this makeshift option offers your head impromptu warmth. Beyond its utilitarian appeal, its oversized, slouchy look imparts an unbothered quality to your outfit while acting as a nod to a sweet and innocent babushka look my Polish grandmother rocks unironically. Now that this hood has my most stylish friend’s stamp of approval, I might just have to add it to my cart for the second time.– Marissa Miller, fitness and gift guide contributorAritziaSunday Best Rib Hood$48$48 at AritziaPositive Grid Spark Neo headphonesPositive GridSpark Neo headphonesfrom$249$249 at Positive Grid$249 at AmazonPhotograph: Courtesy of Positive Grid$249 at Positive Grid$249 at AmazonI’m actively trying to rekindle my love of playing guitar, and earlier this year, my wife surprised me with averyniceFender Telecasterfor my birthday. It’s far beyond my current ability level, but great instruments have a way of pulling you in.The problem is volume. With a two-year-old daughter who goes to bed early and still takes frequent naps, cranking a traditional amp to the right level of overdrive just isn’t realistic. The Spark Neo replaces a traditional amplifier – just plug the wireless transmitter into your instrument’s 0.25in output jack and start strumming. This feels like the right solution for my dad-rock aspirations. It’s also an easy win for anyone living in cramped quarters, or with a significant other who (understandably) doesn’t want to listen to Free Bird butchered dozens of times in a row.After recently borrowing a friend’s Spark Neo Headphones, I was immediately hooked. The sound quality is rich and dynamic with no perceptible delay from the wireless connection. And as a bonus, Positive Grid’s app opens up a deep library of amps, effects and presets, with backing tracks and lessons that make it easier to practice with purpose, not just noodle.– Josh Patterson, outdoor contributorPositive GridSpark Neo headphonesfrom$249$249 at Positive Grid$249 at AmazonNinja Crispi air fryerNinjaCrispi air fryerfrom$179.99$179.99 at Macy’s$179.99 at Kohl’sPhotograph: Courtesy of Macy’s$179.99 at Macy’s$179.99 at Kohl’sA portable air fryer that you can cook inandeat out of? Sounds like a winner to me.The Ninja Crispi 4-in-1 Portable Glass Air Fryer tops my list for two reasons: it’s multifunctional and it doesn’t take up a lot of space. Mykitchen is fairly small, so I’m usually on the hunt for cookware that won’t clutter my countertop (extra points if the product is cute and comes in different colors).Ninja’s tiny but mighty air fryer promises to cook your single-serve meals in just seven minutes. It has four cooking functions (air fry, bake, max crisp and recrisp) and it’s portable – which is ideal for making lunch and other meals on the go. Although I mostly work from home, portability is a major selling point. It also includes 6-cup and 4qt glass containers with lids. Yes, that means you can cook, eat and store your Crispi creations in one bowl.– Latifah Muhammad, gift guide contributorNinjaCrispi air fryerfrom$179.99$179.99 at Macy’s$179.99 at Kohl’sBambu A1 3D printerBambuA1 3D printerfrom$399$399 at Bambu$399.99 at Best BuyPhotograph: Courtesy of Bambu$399 at Bambu$399.99 at Best BuyIf you got aBambu A1 3D printerfor the holidays, congratulations. To say that I envy you is an understatement.This printer solves 3D printing’s fundamental problem: the fiddling. I’ve been 3D printing for years and I still have to spend a lot of time calibrating, bed leveling, tweaking temperatures only to watch first layers fail. The A1 aims to eliminate this through intelligent auto-calibration that adjusts all the finicky settings for every print. You can set it up in under an hour and get print quality that rivals machines costing twice as much.The basketball-sized build volume is big enough for most projects, and it can print quickly without sacrificing quality. If you want four-color printing, add the optionalAMS Liteattachment.At $299 ($399 with the AMS), it’s an entry-level machine that doesn’t feel like one. The software is polished, you can remotely monitor prints through the built-in camera, and thecommunity supportis A+. For anyone who’s been curious about 3D-printing but was scared off by horror stories of endless troubleshooting, this is your machine. And it’s firmly on my wish list.– Christopher Allbritton, tech and DIY contributorBambuA1 3D printerfrom$399$399 at Bambu$399.99 at Best BuyCelestron NexStar 8SE telescopeCelestronNexStar 8SE telescopefrom$1,699$1,699 at Amazon$1,699 at B&H PhotoPhotograph: Courtesy of Amazon$1,699 at Amazon$1,699 at B&H PhotoI love to stargaze. Honestly, I love space, so I like to look at it whenever I can. To that end, I would love to get a computerized telescope like theCelestron NexStar 8SE. A device like this can help democratize astrophotography to a level where I could actively participate and capture some amazing images myself – allowing me to not just browse images of galaxies and nebulae, but contribute my own photos as well.Why splurge for a computerized telescope? The big difference here is that it gets its position via GPS, then allows you to choose from a catalog of space phenomena. Once you make your pick, the telescope will then aim itself at that area and even track it as it moves across the sky. Not only can you take longer looks at what it zeros in on, but it also enables the longer exposures necessary to effectively capture images from space.– Adam Doud, tech contributorCelestronNexStar 8SE telescopefrom$1,699$1,699 at Amazon$1,699 at B&H PhotoOsetra caviarOsetraCaviar$150$150 at The Caviar CompanyPhotograph: Courtesy of The Caviar Company$150 at The Caviar CompanyWhen I was in my 20s, I had my first taste of caviar at a fashion week press event. Just a small dollop, presented atop a potato chip smothered in creme fraîche, sent my taste buds reeling – and I have been chasing that salty, crunchy, deliciously extravagant bite ever since. Of course, now that Rihanna isspooningthis luscious roe atop her fried chicken, even my shamelessly spoiled teens are dying to try it.So, this 1oz tin of Osetra caviar from The Caviar Company is at the top of my wish list. Less than $150, more affordable than the top-tierBeluga, I would even consider sharing, though I’m thinking of swapping out the chips for crispy potato pancakes. I also especially covet it because the company prioritizes sustainable fish farming and is transparent about its direct relationships and specific sourcing of the famously overfished sturgeon.– Tobey Grumet Segal, tech and lifestyle contributorOsetraCaviar$150$150 at The Caviar CompanyTourBox Elite Plus photo editing controllerTourBoxElite Plus photo editing controllerfrom$252$252 at TourBox$297 at AmazonPhotograph: Courtesy of Tourbox$252 at TourBox$297 at AmazonI edit a lot of photos every month – including hundreds of shots of cars and gadgets and, when I get lucky,my little dog, too. That means a lot of time adjusting tiny on-screen knobs and sliders in photo editing apps, clicking away with my mouse. Which is why I have been sorely tempted by the TourBox Elite Plus. It would replace a lot of mouse-clicking and dragging with actual knobs and buttons to twist and turn, which I feel would make the process much more pleasant. Plus, it’s designed to work with the primary photo editing apps I use, Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, but and can also work with DaVinci Resolve, another app I spend a fair bit of time in. It’s a bit of a splurge, but it should be worth the amount of time it will save me.– Tim Stevens, tech and travel contributorTourBoxElite Plus photo editing controllerfrom$252$252 at TourBox$297 at AmazonExplore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Filter USShops and shoppingShopping tripsFoodHeadphonesGadgetsParamount+featuresShareReuse this content"

He set about retraining it and, in a flash, he had it back on track – instinctively understanding the inner nature of artificial intelligence and machine learning in a way few adults do.His friends from the St Paul’s C of E primary school coding club tapped away to build their own AIs with similar dexterity. Just as people born in the early 20th century never knew a world without manned flight, and generation Z has always lived with social media, Joseph and his friends are AI natives.Here, on one December morning, some of them were being taught the principles and practicalities of the potentially world-changing technology that experts fear may pass large numbers of people by and leave them disempowered.View image in fullscreenChildren are growing up familiar with AI.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianPhilip Colligan, the chief executive of the digital education charity theRaspberry PiFoundation, has warned of a “big split” in society between people who grasp how AIs work and are able to control them – challenging their increasing role in automating decisions in areas including housing, welfare, health, criminal justice and finance. On the other hand, there could be a cadre of AI illiterates who risk social disempowerment.Colligan, a leading expert in technology and its social impacts, told the Guardian AI literacy must become a universal part of education on a par with reading and writing to avoid a social divide opening up.“There is a world where you’ve got a big split between kids who understand, have that core knowledge and therefore are able to assert themselves and those who don’t,” said Colligan, whose charity is affiliated to the £600m British low-cost tech hardware startup of the same name. “And that could be really very dangerous.”View image in fullscreenPhilip Colligan says schoolchildren must learn how to code.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianHis warning was backed by Simon Peyton Jones, a computer researcher who led the creation of the schools national curriculum for computing in 2014, prior to the AI boom. He called for a new digital literacy qualification for all schoolchildren that would ensure they know how to use AIs in a critical way.“If it’s simply a black box, then [its actions] seem like magic,” he said. “If you know nothing about how the magic is working that is terribly disabling. I am very worried about students leaving school without having agency in the world.”Their comments came amid a fall in the number of children studying computing, with 2025 entries for a GCSE in the subject down across the UK. Today, three times more people take history and nearly double the number take biology, chemistry and physics. At the same time, use of AI systems nationwide has been surging – up 78% in the year to September, according topollingby Ipsos.Part of the belief that learning computing skills is becoming redundant comes from some of the big AI companies, which argue their systems are going to automate coding. Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, said in October that 90% of its own coding was automated using its Claude AI model. Meanwhile, 2025 was the year when“vibe coding” became a common phrase– capturing the idea that AIs would allow humans to build software by using natural language instructions rather than specialised code.View image in fullscreenSome politicians have questioned whether coding lessons are redundant.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianPolitical leaders such as Keir Starmer have also suggested coding is becoming redundant. As leader of the opposition in 2023, he said: “The old way – learning out-of-date IT, on 20-year-old computers – doesn’t work. But neither does the new fashion, that every kid should be a coder, when artificial intelligence will blow that future away.” It has created the idea that understanding the inner workings of a computer may be less relevant in the future.“I think they’re just overhyping the benefits,” said Colligan, whose charity works in schools across dozens of countries.“This message is leaking out that the kids don’t need to learn this stuff any more and that is not only flawed it is dangerous. We’re already talking to teachers in lots and lots of schools around the world, not just the UK, saying: ‘We can drop computer science now, right?’ That’s a problem.”He added: “All of us are going into a world where more and more of the decisions we encounter every day will be taken by automated systems. At the moment it’s what movie should I watch next or what song should I listen to? Fairly soon it’s going to be finance decisions, healthcare decisions, criminal justice decisions. If you don’t understand how those decisions are being made by automated systems, you can’t advocate for your rights. You can’t challenge them, you can’t critically evaluate what’s being presented to you.”In December, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who is now an AI investor, predicted that “we will move from staring at the internet, to living in the internet”.Colligan said: “My concern is there will be a gap between kids based on their socioeconomic background. Some kids who go to great schools, who are able to teach this stuff, will be in a much stronger position as citizens, whether or not they’re using technology for their job. Those kids who are in communities where they don’t have access to [AI literacy teaching] will be passively on the end of a whole load of automated decisions.”View image in fullscreenColligan says ensuring all children understand how AI works will prevent a social divide developing.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianIn the coding club, the seven- to 10-year-olds are taught how AIs work. The lessons were clearly having an effect on Joseph. He said he thought AI “will probably be good, but if lots of people believe it when it’s wrong it will have a bad impact on them”.He was not interested in letting the AI do the coding of the video games he planned to make. “It might do it differently to what you want,” he said. “It might also do it wrong and you need to know how to solve it … I’d like to be in charge of the AI. If the AI is in charge of us, we wouldn’t really be able to control what we’re doing and that would be bad.”Explore more on these topicsEducationAI (artificial intelligence)SchoolsComputingRaspberry PiCambridgeChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business inJapan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.As a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business ServiceGameswas shortened to Sega for the new venture.For the next 15 years,Segainnovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.View image in fullscreenTwo Sega arcade games either side of Capcom’s Pac-Man at the Centre for Computing History, Cambridge.Photograph: Nathaniel Noir/AlamyOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.During this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.From the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”View image in fullscreenSega’s Master System.Photograph: Keith Stuart/The GuardianThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”View image in fullscreenStreets of Rage, one of Sega’s teen-targeted titles.Photograph: ArcadeImages/AlamyRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.Explore more on these topicsGamesSegaGame cultureJapannewsShareReuse this content"

Refusing on Sunday to condemn the attack as a breach of international law, European Union member statescalledhopefully for “a negotiated, democratic, inclusive and peaceful solution to the crisis, led by Venezuelans”. The delusional nature of that response was laid bare as Mr Trumptoldreporters the same day: “We’re in charge.”So much for the restoration of democracy. The US president also repeated threats of further military action, should the repressive regime left behind when Nicolás Maduro was seized fail to do Washington’s bidding. As Mr Trump’s marginalising of the Nobel prize-winning opposition figurehead María Corina Machado illustrated early on, the will of Venezuelans is not on his list of priorities.Operation Absolute Resolvewas about exercising raw power to dominate a sovereign nation, and controlling Venezuela’s future oil production.Faced with such nakedly imperialist ambitions, and a brazen contempt for rules-based multilateralism, Sir Keir Starmer and his European allies need to do much better than cover their eyes and disingenuously shift the focus of discussion. Having initially emphasised the need for a democratic transition in Venezuela, the French president, Emmanuel Macron,saidon Monday that he “neither supported nor approved” the manner of Mr Maduro’s removal. Sir Keir, whoseevasionsand obfuscations on the matter up to now have been painful to witness, should do the same. When Emily Thornberry, the Labour chair of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee,warnsthat US actions in Venezuela will only embolden other global bullies to trash international norms, he must know that she is right.For their part, European governments urgently need to plan for a world in which the west, as traditionally conceived, is no longer a useful concept. The reluctance to criticise Mr Trump is partly about keeping the US president on side, at a crucial moment for Ukraine. It is true that without meaningful White House security guarantees for Kyiv in the future, Vladimir Putin’s ability to pursue his own revanchist project of regional domination would be hugely strengthened. But unchecked and unchallenged, “America first” expansionism is becoming a geopolitical menace in its own right.Along with the United Nations, Europe has a duty to push back against the subjugation of international law to the whim of rogue superpowers policing their “spheres of influence”. Its leaders must also ensure the rapid development of sufficient hard power to exert some influence of their own. They may have no choice: note Mr Trump’s renewedclaimson Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. In a radio interview, Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said that the US threat needed to be taken seriously. That such a statement can be sincerely and justifiably made is jaw-dropping.Regime change in Caracas came weeks after thepublicationof a bellicose national security strategy that pledged to “restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere”.Colombiaand Cuba have now been put on notice, and in Denmark, so has a Nato ally. With Washington in the vanguard, a dangerous new world order is forming at pace. Within it, Europe urgently needs to speak up for its values, while building the capacity to defend its own interests.Explore more on these topicsUS attack on VenezuelaOpinionVenezuelaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropean UnionKeir StarmereditorialsShareReuse this content"

Venezuelahas vast oil reservesand used to produce more than three times as much volume as it does now. Therefore it should be a simple matter to upgrade the crumbling kit with an injection of dollars and watch the extra barrels and profits flow.That, roughly speaking, is the only clear part of Donald Trump’s plan for what happens next in Venezuela. “We’re going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure – the oil infrastructure – and start making money for the country,” he said at the weekend.The reality looks difficult. From the point of view of US oil companies, the invitation – or command – from the White House is not straightforward. The possible exception is Chevron since it is already inVenezuelavia a handful of joint ventures with the country’s state-owned oil company. If sanctions, quotas and government restrictions were now to clear, it could probably find ways to boost production efficiently. The 4% rise in Chevron’s share price said as much.But the initial kneejerk positivism in fellow US oil majors’ share prices is harder to understand. For those companies, the risk v reward calculations around re-entry are more complicated – and wholly unclear at this point. Look at analysts’ projections of what it would take to repair a decade of underinvestment in Venezuela’s oil industry and double production output to 2m barrels a day by the early 2030s: £115bn, reckons Rystad Energy.That is serious money, even for companies with the budgets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. That is doubly so if Trump is simultaneously trying to push down the price of a barrel of oil to $50 (from about $60 today), thereby capping long-term rewards.Boardrooms will want to know what, precisely, it means for the US to ‘run’ VenezuelaOne doubts Venezuela has suddenly jumped to the top of the average global oil company’s list of investment priorities just becauseNicolás Madurohas been removed. Boardrooms will also want to know what, precisely, it means for the US to “run” Venezuela, whether commitments can credibly be made for decades and what the fiscal regime for oil will be. None of those questions is likely to be answered soon. The Gulf of Mexico, Guyana, Brazil, and many other places, will continue to look easier venues for the big oily bets.“Even if the political environment backdrop was more predictable, in a world already awash with oil, the business case for significantly ramping up drilling in Venezuela is far from strong – particularly given the estimated high cost of extracting Venezuela’s “heavy” oil reserves,” said David Oxley, the chief climate and commodities economist at the thinktank Capital Economics.The title of his note – “Venezuela’s vast energy potential to remain untapped” – reflects an entirely plausible scenario. While one can see how output could get a short-term boost just by running operations better, a multi-decade project to unlock the “tremendous amount of wealth”, as Trump put it, is another matter. One is a short-term rebound; the other requires massive investment with long payback periods.None of which is to deny the geopolitical significance if the US effectively has control – or just heavy influence over – Venezuela’s oil industry and reserves. In the short term, merelyredirecting Venezuela’s exports to US refinerieswould change the shape of today’s market. China, now the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, would lose in that scenario.But big US oil producers’ instinct, probably, will be tosit on their hands. The prospect of $50 oil means most will be thinking about spending cuts, rather than investment spurges. Most have made promises to investors prefer share buy-backs over high-risk projects. And, as investment bank SocGen’s analysts put it, “the fact that Venezuela has nationalised the oil companies, not just once, but twice, will make the oil majors incredibly cautious about going back into the country.”An open question is how much pressure Trump could exert on the companies to spend “billions of dollars” regardless. But that is one uncertainty among many. Until the picture is clearer, do not expect a stampede.Explore more on these topicsOilEnergy industryDonald TrumpVenezuelacommentShareReuse this content"

A narrative is emerging that seeks to justify the US military intervention as a response to theNicolás Madurogovernment’s appalling human rights record.My office has long condemned serious human rights violations by the Venezuelan authorities. We have reported, monitored and warned about the situation inside Venezuela – most recently,just before Christmas. We have consistently called for an end to unfair trials, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, the persecution of political opponents and sweeping restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly. We have urged independent investigations and accountability. For many years, my team in Venezuela advocated for the release of human rights defenders, monitored trials and engaged with civil society and the opposition, as well as state institutions.Trump’s coup in Venezuela didn’t just break the rules – it showed there aren’t any. We’ll all regret that | Nesrine MalikRead moreOur detailed monitoring and reporting were intended to prompt action. When a state violates the human rights of its people, my office is among those who are charged with raising the alarm. It is up to the international community to use the lawful tools and mechanisms at its disposal, so that states respect their human rights obligations. These tools could include diplomatic leverage and investments in accountability. But these tools and mechanisms were not deployed effectively to influence the government ofVenezuela.Far from being a victory for human rights, this military intervention – in contravention of Venezuelan sovereignty and the UN charter – damages the architecture of international security, making every country less safe. It sends a signal that the powerful can do whatever they like, and weakens the only mechanism we have to prevent a third world war, namely theUnited Nations. No amount of deception and distraction can alter these facts.Beyond the legal arguments, history teaches us that while attempts at regime change may initially be greeted by relief, they often lead to massive human rights violations, dangerous chaos and protracted violent conflict.The human rights of Venezuelans are not a bargaining chip, or a point to be scored. I have visited Venezuela and spoken with its people, and I feel deeply for them at this moment. I feel for those waiting desperately for news about their loved ones; for families who have been separated; and for all those with empty places at their tables during this holiday season. Human rights need to be central to Venezuela’s future – not an afterthought, taking a back seat to negotiations around the exploitation of fossil fuels. The country’s future must be decided by its people.More broadly, human rights cannot be treated like an ideological ping-pong ball. We cannot afford for our rights to be instrumentalised: invoked when they’re convenient, and vilified when they’re not. I fear for people in the region and around the world who are deeply alarmed by what this breach in international law means for their own safety and security. This is not about choosing between unilateral intervention that runs contrary to international law, or ignoring years of human rights violations. We need more fidelity to human rights law around the world, not less.Venezuelan society needs healing. It needs justice to overcome polarisation and to repair its social and economic fabric. It does not need militarisation, violence or further uncertainty and instability.Above all, Venezuela needs the international community to stop paying lip service to human rights, and to stand up for the UN charter and for international law. The alternative will have terrible consequences around the world.Volker Türkhas been the UN high commissioner for human rights since 2022Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionUnited NationsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyNicolás MaduroTrump administrationAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

On 1 January, in a star-studded inauguration ceremony of uncommon pomp and optimism,Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist, wassworn inas the new mayor of New York and delivered aspeechthat declared the era of small government and centrist inhibition to be over, and anew dawnof ambitious social welfare programs to begin.The new mayor’s inauguration is the culmination of a decade of growth from the Democratic party’s insurgent left wing, and results from a feat of organizing within the country’s largest city that relied upon mass mobilization from downwardly mobile and economically disenfranchised millennial and gen Z voters. It was hailed as a generational shift inUS politics, inaugurating a new, 21st-century vision for the party.At Zohran Mamdani’s block party, I observed a simple truth: people want more politics, not less | Samuel EarleRead moreAnd less than two days later, from his Mar-a-Lago resort,Donald Trump, who was once thought to represent a decisive shift for his own Republican party, announced that his administration had carried out an action that seemedcharacteristic ofthe old, Bush-era past. An abrupt overseasbombing campaignand thekidnappingof a foreign head of state, Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, were facilitated without UN orcongressional approval, in plain violation of international law and the US constitution. The raid was meant to inaugurate a regime change in the South American country and to facilitate a neocolonial-style mass theft of thatcountry’s oiland mineral resources.One project was produced by a massive grassrootsorganizing effort; the other was conducted with virtually no attempt to persuade the public or manufacture consent. One promised greater dignity for Americans; the other offered them only the pleasures of vicarious domination and the infliction of suffering on faraway others. One gestured toward the possibility of a new politics to produce a morefair and optimistic future. The other was an eerie echo of that past, a violent pantomime of an era of American imperial expansion that had long been declared over. But both will reshape the domestic political contest that looms ahead: the 2026 midterms.They say that prediction is the lowest form of journalism, which of course does not stop many journalists from engaging in it. But the opening days of 2026 have rapidly reshaped the coming electoral contests in November that will define American politics this year.On the one hand, ayoung, insurgent left wingwill face the first major test of its ability to govern in executive office, watched by the keen eye of a sometimes hostile national media and a national electorate unsure of the left’s ability to govern. And on the other, a diminished president – under the sway of a neoconservative remnant in the form of secretary of stateMarco Rubio– has turned to military force in an effort to shore up his own popularity amid broken promises, astrugglingeconomy andplummetingpoll numbers.Despite his solid victory in New York and his broad popularity with younger voters, Mamdani will face an uphill battle in convincing Americans that his approach to politics offers a viable future. MeanwhileRepublicans, facing Trumpism’s disastrous present, have returned to the most violent and foolhardy ambitions of their past.Because let’s be clear: Trump is pursuing regime change inVenezuelabecause he is politically weak and he thinks, as struggling autocrats so often do, that he can shore up his domestic popularity with a foreign military adventure.The past year was not a good one for Trump: his restoration to power was initially met with widespread compliance, but he quickly destroyed much of American soft power, both domestically and abroad; spoiled his political capital in the US bydeploying troops to major citiesand pursuing an ostentatiously sadisticmass deportation agenda; and presiding over aneconomythat is struggling in every era exceptAI investment– an unpopular industry whose products seemingly do little beside to immiserate Americans’ lives and degrade their dignity.The Guardian view on Zohran Mamdani’s task: a high-stakes test case for progressive ambition | EditorialRead moreHis signaturetariffshave hurt both foreign relations and domestic consumer power; a struggle has emerged within his coalition as his underlings and followers jockey for position. There’sspeculationabouthishealth, and he has been damaged by ongoing scandals relating to hisclose associationwith the dead financier and convicted sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein. As 2025 drew to a close, the consensus was that his party washeaded toward a thrashingin next year’s midterms.From this position, Trump is probably hoping that he can rally Americans around the flag by going to war. Rubio has a past generation’s bloodlust for war and a shockingly naive belief – contradicted by all evidence and bitter recent experience – in the US military’s capacity to ensure a stable regime change abroad; he seems to see Venezuela as a stepping stone tooverthrowingthe government of Cuba, the birthplace of his parents.Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, has a vision of military action that appears about as sophisticated as that of a child who has recently watched an action movie and keeps making enthusiastic explosion noises that spray his parents with spit.They are stupid, cruel, petty men – men of great narcissism, little intellect and no character. They have no plan for an exit; their minds are empty except for their fantasies of glory and domination. They are exactly who Trump will listen to. The White House seems to think that this is the example that will persuade Americans to vote for Republicans in November. I doubt it.Meanwhile, the left’s new standard-bearer will be facing his own challenges. Mamdani’s campaign centered threepolicy proposals:rent freezeson rent-stabilized unit’s in the city’s famously unaffordable housing stock;free bus fares; anduniversal childcare. The campaign promises have the virtue of being precise, actionable and measurable markers of progress and improved quality of life for thousands of New Yorkers.Today, Trump’s target was Caracas. What tomorrow? | Stephen WertheimRead moreThis is, ironically, also their liability: Mamdani’s promises were so concrete that he has robbed himself of the opportunity to take a politician’s favorite route: to declare a victory after a partial or compromised accomplishment, or even after a total defeat. The buses will be free, or they won’t be; the pre-K program will be extended to two-year-olds, or it won’t be; the rents will be frozen, or they will go up again.No small number of city hall watchers, both outside of Mamdani’s party and within it, will be rooting for him to fail. As an example of the potential of leftwing and democratic socialists to govern and deliver on their promises, it will be crucial that he succeed. Meanwhile, as themidtermsapproach, the example of Mamdani – who will not be standing for election this coming November – will be cast as a reflection on every single Democrat who is.Candidates will petition for his endorsement or throw him under the bus, depending on their own needs in the moment – a few of them might do both over the coming year. He will be made a symbol of the Democratic party. Voters will be looking to see what kind of example he sets.It is part of the fraught history of this country that there have always been these competing impulses in American politics: between collectivism and extraction, solidarity and domination, egalitarianism and hierarchy, optimism and cruelty. Rarely has the choice been so stark between the standard bearers of the two parties. Often, they have looked more alike than this. At the outset of 2026, they look quite different.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionZohran MamdaniDonald TrumpTrump administrationVenezuelaUS foreign policyDemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

Or Xi Jinping seize Taiwan?Mon 5 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 13.08 ESTShareNo matter how you slice it,Donald Trump’s invasion ofVenezuelais an act of naked aggression. It is blatantly illegal and sets a disturbing precedent of indifference to national sovereignty that tyrants worldwide will be eager to exploit.The ostensible reason for the US president’s military incursion was to arrestNicolás Maduroon criminalchargesfor drug trafficking. But that does not justify invading Venezuela to seize him.Under the United Nationscharter, military force can be used against a sovereign nation in onlytwocircumstances – with the authorization of a UN security council resolution, or in self-defense from an actual or imminent armed attack. But there is no security council resolution, and Venezuela posedno suchmilitary threat to the United States.Trump has suggested that he was acting to defend the United States from the threat of drugs emanating from Venezuela, but that rationale for military action is dangerous. To begin with, Venezuelaisnota source for the real drug threat – the fentanyl that has been killing so many Americans. It is a route for some cocaine, generally produced in neighboring Colombia, but most of that goes to Europe, not the US.After Trump’s illegal Venezuela coup, there are two dangers: he is emboldened, but has no clue what comes next | Rajan MenonRead moreMoreover, drug trafficking is a crime that should be met with law enforcement, as the UN general assembly made clear indenouncingthe invasion of Panama in 1989 to arrest its leader, Manuel Noriega, on drug charges. Drug trafficking hasneverbeen recognized as an armed attack that would justify the use of military force.The concept of self-defense requires an actual military attack. The distinction is important because lots of cross-border activity causes harm (infectious diseases, pollution, cheap imports), but if that could legitimize a military response, it would decimate the UN charter’s presumptive ban on invading a sovereign nation.Trump’sinconsistencyalso suggests that drug trafficking is only a pretext for regime change. While Trump invaded Venezuela based on mere criminalchargesagainst Maduro, in November hepardonedformer Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who had beenconvictedof large-scale drug trafficking. Evidently the drug trade is not a problem when conducted by a friendly rightwing president.Might Trump’s invasion be justified by the doctrine of humanitarian intervention, which a UN summitendorsedin 2005 as the “responsibility to protect”? Maduro was a brutal despot who maintained power through relentlessrepression, while his mismanagementimpoverishedthewealthiestcountry in Latin America and sentnearly 8 millionrefugees fleeing. But because the use of military force is always risky, humanitarian intervention can bejustifiedonly as a last resort to stop an ongoing or imminent genocide or comparable mass slaughter. There was nothing like that under way in Venezuela.Recent US experience provides a cautionary tale on the use of military force for ostensibly humanitarian purposes. The US overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya left each country inchaosfor years. Bad as a dictatorship can be, chaos is generally worse.Trump can point to other military interventions with less disastrous results – the invasions of Grenada and Panama. But these were tiny countries, without anything approaching Venezuela’s substantial armed forces.Despite claiming that he will “run” the country, the autocratically inclined Trump does not appear interested in ending the dictatorship that has plagued Venezuela for more than a decade. The rest of Maduro’s regimeremainsin place.In deciding who might replace Maduro, Trump eschewed María Corina Machado, whowonthe 2025 Nobel peace prize for her commitment to democracy, in favor of Maduro’s hand-picked vice-president,Delcy Rodríguez, whom Trump officialsbelievewill protect US oil interests. Rodríguezneverdenounced the regime’s repression and corruption, and on Saturday sheassertedthat Maduro remains the country’s legitimate leader. But Trump seems confident that she will do his biddingwhen it comesto oil, threatening to repeat his invasion if necessary, possibly with boots on the ground – an occupation.Needless to say, Trump’s revival of the Monroe doctrine, now embellished with the “Trump corollary”, provides no justification for his invasion. Trump, seconded by Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, may want to revive the practice of major powers doing what they want within their spheres of influence, but the UN charter’s presumptive ban on military attacks on a sovereign nation was meant to end that recipe for endless war, even in a major power’s backyard.Leaving legality aside, Trump’s invasion sets a perilous precedent. If he can invade Venezuela, why can’t Putin invade Ukraine? Or Xi Jinping seize Taiwan (which is not even considered a separate sovereign state)?Trump is not the only one to be playing fast and loose with international law. The Russian and Chinese governments, somehow with straight faces, bothcondemnedTrump’s invasion of Venezuela, as if it had no parallel to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Russia is carrying out with substantial Chinese economicsupport.Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy went so far as tosuggestthat if Trump could topple Maduro, the dictator of Venezuela, then why not Putin, the dictator of Russia? Yet Zelenskyy knows full well that the more likely reading of Trump’s military adventurism is to undermine the international legal prohibition of invading a sovereign country – the core of Ukraine’s case for resisting Putin’s aggression.European leaders have been no better. French president Emmanuel Macron virtuallyapplaudedTrump’s action, ostensibly because of Maduro’s oppressive rule. British prime minister Keir Starmer and European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallasissuedbroad affirmations of international law without bothering to state that Trump’s invasion had flouted that law. German chancellor Friedrich MerzcalledTrump’s intervention “complex” and stressed the need for an orderly transition to an elected government.Today an illegal coup in Venezuela, but where next? Donald Trump talks peace but he is a man of war | Simon TisdallRead moreThe top European priority has been to keep Trump engaged in defending Ukraine. These leaders evidently figured that if keeping Trump on board requires biting their tongues or even stroking Trump’s ego at the expense of the legal principle that makes Putin’s invasion of Ukraine wrong, so be it.Maduro’s real offense seems to have been that he had befriended the wrong leaders (Russia, China, Iran) while sitting atop the world’slargestreserves of oil – aresourcethat Trumpcovets. But by that rationale, Rwanda is justified ininvadingeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo because of its mineral riches, the United Arab Emirates is justified insupportingthe Rapid Support Forces paramilitary in Sudan to maintain access to gold, and China could invade Taiwan to seize itssemiconductorfactories.That world of “might makes right” may seem acceptable to an American president who believes in power above all else, but as global economic capacity shifts, and with it the ability to sustain a military in a protracted armed conflict, the US government should be loathe to abandon the rules-based alliances that it has led for decades. It is an act of naive hubris to believe that Washington will always be the alpha male for whom rules are made to broken, not followed.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

For a time when there were at least concerted attempts to justify unilateral interventions and illegal warsin the name of global security, and even a moral duty toliberate the women of Afghanistanor “free the Iraqi people”.Now, as the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, isin essence abductedand Venezuelataken over by the US, there is barely any effort to situate the coup in any reasoning other than the US’s interests. Nor are there any attempts to solicit consent from domestic or international law-making bodies and allies, let alone the public. The days of the US trying to convince the world that Saddam Hussein did in fact have weapons of mass destruction despite secretly havingno reliable intelligencewere, in fact, the good old days.Maduro “effed around and found out”,said the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth. “Americacan project our will anywhere, any time.” The US will now “run Venezuela” said the president, Donald Trump. “We are going to have a presence in Venezuelaas it pertains to oil.” There is little to no effort to make reasonings for the takeover cohere. It is claimed that Maduro is guilty of “narco-terrorism” andother charges including“Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns [sic] and Destructive Devices against the United States” – charges that not only fail to clear the bar required for invasion and abduction, but also apparently are not even taken that seriously by Trump himself. Others charged with drug offences have been pardoned. Among them are Honduras’s former presidentJuan Orlando Hernándezand Ross Ulbricht and Larry Hoover, bothreleased from life sentencesfor convictions including drug trafficking.View image in fullscreenPresident Donald Trump monitors US military operations in Venezuela, with CIA director John Ratcliffe, at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, 3 January 2026.Photograph: Molly Riley/APThe point, as demonstrated bytriumphalist postson social media that includehip-hop-soundtracked montagesand Trump as a sort of gangster in chief, is in the very rebuke of the notion that US actions are subject to due process. The Venezuela coup is not an exhibition of the long arm of the law, but the fact that the USisthe law and is not subject to any higher one, able to wield its extraordinary power and lethality in the dead of night, kill dozens of innocents and face no consequences, let alone censure.And the response so far has proven this to be correct. These extraordinary scenes, actions and statements are already being passed into the realm of the normal by the sort of bland, hedged statements that we have grown accustomed to. Several politicians and heads of state have engaged in the sort of feeble and contradictory statements they make when their kind of diplomacy collides with the reality that their allies are out of their minds. Keir Starmer says that the situation is “fast moving” and that he will “establish all the facts”, just as the facts are marching Maduro ona perp walk in Brooklyn. The EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is “following very closely the situation in Venezuela… any solution must respect international law and the UN Charter”. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas reassures us that it is “closely monitoring the situation”, as is theAustralian governmentand others.What you will be reminded of with increasing frequency, once there are no more facts to be established or live situations to monitor,is that Maduro was a very bad man. Even if the importance of international law is proclaimed, it will be done in tandem with condemnation of Maduro. The British foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, always out in front, leads the chargewith this platonic ideal. Point number one, she tweeted on Saturday: “The UK has consistently rejected Nicolás Maduro’s legitimacy, and called for a peaceful transition of power in Venezuela.” Two, she added: “As the prime minister has made clear, we support international law. Our collective focus must now be on achieving a transition without bloodshed to a democratic government.” Note that there is no acknowledgment that international law was already violated, and by whom – only that it is supported, but apparently in no ways in which it can actually be upheld.The upshot is that we kick off a year in which the die is cast. The Venezuelan incident will shred whatever little remained of the pretence that there is any will to stand up for norms that underpin global security – that sense that there will be consequences, either material or social, that deter land grabs, annexations or regime changes. The world is already ripe for such a moment. The Middle East is a hotspot, maturing into a competition between rising Gulf states, and further unsettled by an unfettered US and Israel. We see this in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon. It is a mere blip on the news map now, but Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two powerful, previously close allies with increasingly ambitious regional agendas, arefacing off over Yemenand the sides in the conflict that each support there. The escalationin rhetoric and military action– Saudi Arabia struck a UAE shipment of combat vehicles headed for Yemen and accused the country of endangering its national security – opens an unprecedented front in the Gulf.Such chaos has already been enabled by the UAE’s new questionable, imperial role in the region and beyond in Sudan’s cruel war, and that country joins the club of nations that face no repercussions. On the other side of the Gulf, protests in Iran are in their second week and have already captured the interest of Trump, who hasthreatened more strikes, taking the prospect of US-led regime change there out of the realm of the unlikely. As is Trump’s threatenedannexation of Greenland.Today an illegal coup in Venezuela, but where next? Donald Trump talks peace but he is a man of war | Simon TisdallRead moreOther improbabilities become possibilities. China is performingmilitary drills around Taiwan. Vladimir Putin needs little encouragement, but the Trumpian doctrine of imperial dominion and discretionary right to launch military campaigns now mirrors Putin’s own, and further imbues Russia’s actions in Ukraine with validity. After Venezuela, you would be mad, if you were a regime with some measure of financial and military strength and regional ambition, not to test the waters at least.The tepid response from those who still feel the need to restate support for international law does nothing but contribute to this state of encouraged predation. The situation inVenezuelacannot be contained with peaceful transition (which is unlikely if the entirety of recent history is anything to go by). Just as Gaza could not be contained. One could argue that it is wise not to anger Trump – not even with a statement of the truth of his actions – and ask what a country such as the UK could do anyway. But resisting the violation of rules and insisting on adherence, even if certainly in vain, is how norms are established and then maintained. Lying low and hoping that this too shall pass is cowardice, denial and historical illiteracy.The consequences will be reaped increasingly, and not just by the unfortunate in faraway places. Fences, both practical and notional, that maintained a settlement – fragile and flawed, but a settlement nonetheless – are being dismantled. Silence is not safety. It is, to use the language of the day and channel the jubilant Hegseth, “effing around” and “soon finding out”.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS foreign policyPete HegsethVladimir PutinXi JinpingcommentShareReuse this content"

He would feel right at home in today’s EUMon 5 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 07.26 ESTShareIexpected the EU to push back strongly against Donald Trump’s new national security strategy. Not only does it show contempt for the EU and its “weak” leaders, but it also targets European citizens and migrants with racist dog whistles and barely disguised Islamophobia. Yet instead of a rousing defence of the bloc’scommitmentto human rights and equality, there have just been bland platitudes.António Costa, the president of the European Council,denouncedTrump’s plans to boost support for Europe’s far-right parties. But there was no public challenge to the racist logic underpinning his argument. Costa, who has spoken proudly of hismixed ancestry, could have made a convincing counterargument to the US president’s false premise that Europe was heading for “civilisational erasure” because of migrants and, by extension, millions of Europeans of colour.Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, insisted that the best response to the Trump administration’s insults was standing up for a united Europe, focusing on its strengths and taking pride in the EU. There was no reaffirmation of the compelling vision sheoutlinedonly two years ago of an inclusive EU “where it doesn’t matter what you look like, who you love, how you pray, and where you are born”.The truth is that Trump’s alternative reality about a “woke” Europe is laughable. He would feel quite at home in today’s EU. Far-right parties are on therise, and the rhetoric of “defending civilisation” – part of the “great replacement” conspiracy discourse – has seeped from the far-right fringes into the political mainstream. Von der Leyen’s own conservative bloc increasingly relies on far-right votes to move legislation through the European parliament. If Trump were to visit“Brussels so white”’s institutions, the US president would likely not run into many people of colour.The US and EU’s methods for dealing with unwanted migrants are beginning to converge. The EU might not deploy the masked ICE-style paramilitaries who stalk American streets, but its new migrationpacttightens asylum procedures, accelerates deportations and expands detention. Many EU countries want additional “innovative solutions”, which include increased powers for Frontex, the EU border control agencyaccusedof systemic human rights failures, including being complicit in illegal pushbacks.Twenty-seven European stateshave asked for a revision of the European convention on human rights because, they argue, migrant rights must be balanced against Europeans’ “security” and “freedom”.The EU may lack ICE-style paramilitaries but it has Frontex, accused of systemic human rights violationsAll of this is right up Trump’s street but is against Europe’s own interests. With ageing populations and labour shortages hollowing out entire sectors, the EU does in fact need migrants. The commission has identified shortages in42 occupations, including jobs in construction, transport, agriculture, hospitality, health and social care, which are essential for Europe’s economic resilience and “strategic autonomy”. That is why, even as politicians compete to sound tougher on borders, no one is saying that many of their governments are, in fact, quietly signing labour partnerships with the global south.The US president claims that nationalist parties are victims of censorship, but it is Europe’s progressives, especially those advocating for solidarity and justice for Palestinians, who facerestrictions. UN experts have had totellGermany to stop the persistent pattern of police violence against Palestinian solidarity activism. Meanwhile, in France a major international academic conference on Palestinewas forced outof the Collège de France in November, as a minister publicly labelled the event as “activist”.Those who cover European policies understand that in addition to politicians’ outbursts of moral panic, the EU has perfected a polished, technocratic form of exclusion that relies on directives and regulations, coded language about “European values” and a securitisation framework that normalises human rights exemptions. Sometimes, even the facts are denied: the lower house of the Dutch parliamentrefusedto discuss a government-commissioned study that found that anti-Muslim discrimination was structurally embedded in society – and young Muslims increasingly feel they do not belong.Europe’s political and media ecosystems have helped construct an “imaginary Muslim” who is a suspect and a security risk – and never a doctor, a nurse, a scientist or an elected representative, Dutch socialist MEP Mohammed Chahim told me. Nothing, not even evidence-based research, is allowed to go against the dominant narrative.I wish Europeans of colour truly wielded the power that the US president attributes to us. We do not. Many remain marginalised and stigmatised, and face structural discrimination. Yet countless others – far from plotting the demise of European “civilisation” – are working to ensure that Europe survives and thrives through their contributions across politics, business, technology, culture, sport, media, medicine, design, transport, academia and more.The question is whether Europe’s leaders – or at least those who are more responsible – will finally speak up. Trump’s fantasy of resurrecting a white, Christian Europe is certainly providing oxygen for his European acolytes who frame Europeans of colour through the tired lens of migration “crises”, identity threats and endless integration tests. Those who do not subscribe to this toxic fiction must have the courage to say so publicly and celebrate the diversity of Europe.Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs.

The US violation of Venezuelan airspace, ensuing airstrikes in Caracas, the seizure of Maduro and his illegal removal from Venezuela are all egregious violations of this. Any suggestion it was justified as an act of US self-defence is not supported by the facts. The US had not suffered a Venezuelan armed attack, nor is there any evidence to suggest such an attack was imminent.Geoffrey Robertson KChas gone so far as to suggest that what occurred was an act of US aggression against Venezuela, which is one of the most serious violations of international law. Russian aggression against Ukraine in February 2022 and the ongoing war that resulted has had an ongoing legacy.Labor wants US to ‘set out the facts’ before passing judgment on Trump’s capture of MaduroRead moreWhile Australia has been fierce in its condemnation of Russian aggression in Ukraine, theAlbanese government’s response to events in Venezuela has so far been muted. But there are significant implications for US allies and partners.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe Trump administration says it “will run” Venezuela (a claim top Republicans arealready backpedaling). How it will do so is unclear without US boots on the ground. However, as the Trump administration has a narrative of the Maduro regime being intertwined with drug cartels responsible for a flood of drugs into the US, there is every prospect of the US also seeking to replace Venezuela’s acting president, Delcy Rodríguez, with a more sympathetic regime.The White House has also indicated it willseek to control Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. Setting aside that US seizure of Venezuelan oil would be a further violation of international law, it is difficult to see how this could be achieved without US boots on the ground or a complicit Venezuelan government.While there needs to be caution in reading US conduct in Venezuela too widely, given the very particular political and regional content, there are some concerning trends for US allies such as Australia. Those include the increasing willingness of the Trump administration to use military force to advance US national interests. That can be seen by how the US conductedairstrikes in June against Iranin support of Israel and againstIslamic State in Nigeria in December, and airstrikes at sea against Venezuelan-linked drug trafficking small craft in the Pacific and the Caribbean. To date, this more assertive US defence conduct has not spread to the Indo-Pacific but there is no reason to suggest that it will not do so during the remaining three years of the Trump presidency.The US has rarely encountered a robust military response from its recent adversaries but the Indo-Pacific is a very different region from the Caribbean and Latin America. Assertive US defence activity in the Indo-Pacific against drug cartels, so-called “shadow fleets” at sea carrying sanctioned oil, or the Chinese coast guard or PLA navy contesting the US freedom of navigation assertions will result in a heightened regional military response.For Australia, given that it is deeply entwined in the US military and security framework through Anzus and Aukus, this has particular legal and defence implications. If US military action in the region was challenged, would that trigger Australia’s Anzus treaty obligations, and how would Australia precisely come to the aid of Trump-inspired US military adventurism?These are questions that Australia must ask itself. At their core they go to whether the Trump administration is truly committed to the rules-based international legal order that Australia as a middle power places so much store in. The postwar UN Charter framework has received ongoing bipartisan support in Australia. The Trump presidency may be proving even more of a test for the UN Charter and its values than even the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Donald Rothwell is professor of international law at the Australian National UniversityExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionVenezuelaTrump administrationUS foreign policyAsia PacificUS attack on VenezuelacommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s the good news: a great British toilet revolution could be on the wayEddie BlakeInspired by ministers and councils willing to spend a penny, architects are building beautiful, functional loos – a first step towards restoring civic prideMon 5 Jan 2026 09.03 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 10.27 ESTShareWhy do we have so few public toilets in UK cities? It’s hard to think of two more fundamental social needs than a) not being forced to relieve yourself on the street and b) not having other people relieve themselves on the street – yet the public toilet is an ignored and vanishing public amenity. The British Toilet Association reports that 40% of public toilets haveclosed since 2000– Victorian facilities in particular attract developers, not least because their dignified buildings endure: solidly built, centrally located and still embedded in the daily flow of the city. When maintenance costs are high and councils are struggling, it is easy to convert a sturdy urinal into a fancy bar or flower shop that brings in rent.Against this backdrop, a new wave of architects has begun to emerge who are reframing the problem and bringing new expression to the building type. They are supported by innovative councils and, sometimes, government grants. This may mark the start of a trend, driven by a convergence of conditions: growing public attention to access, the clear scarcity of toilet provision and a renewed sense of purpose within local authorities. These architects are emphasising not only public toilets’ necessity, but also the potential for public luxury.View image in fullscreen‘Old technologies to suit a modern world.’ Studio Weave’s public toilets in Woolwich, London.Photograph: Jim StephensonSome remarkable examples are inLondon. As director of Studio Weave, I’ve overseen two new public toilet buildings in the past year – one in Woolwich and one in Maida Hill – funded by the boroughs of Greenwich and Westminster respectively. Both projects were championed by forward-thinking council officers and local politicians who recognise the importance of such facilities and their role in civic life. Greenwich was successful in securing backing from the Department for Levelling Up’s Future High Streets Fund and, crucially, it was strongly supported during the public consultation. This meant that the council could ringfence spending on the public toilets, protecting them from overbearing cost-cutting measures.As an architect who designs public buildings, I can tell you that quality materials and vision are key. In cities, you are often dealing with a complicated underground spaghetti of gas pipes, sewers and cables. You may have to negotiate with local authorities that have no obligation to cooperate. And you’re working with Victorian infrastructure that almost never matches the drawings.We have to build toilets that are safe – perhaps with passive surveillance from nearby businesses – but that respect users’ dignity. We think about the way the doors open and who can see in and out, and we make sure there are no places to hide drugs or a knife. Our Woolwich toilets have high-quality traditional encaustic-tile flooring and oversized chimneys to enable passive ventilation – old technologies to suit a modern world. We like to incorporate shelter from the rain and sun, as well as drinking water and a place to sit down – those small public amenities that a council isn’t obliged to provide but will find hard to take away once they are incorporated into a solid building. Sometimes, we are lucky enough to work with a council that has money and a longer vision: for our project at Finsbury Circus, the City of London set a 100-year design life, demanding much higher-quality materials than most contemporary public buildings make do with.View image in fullscreenDK-CM’s Bruce Grove project, which has added a community room and cafe.Photograph: Emily Marshall/DK-CM ArchitectsColleagues in contemporary architecture have produced similarly strong work:DK-CM’s elegant refurbishment inBruce Grove(for Haringey borough) andHugh Broughton’s civic design in Westminster are distinguished by their architectural quality and thoughtful integration into the city. The Bruce Grove project has added a new community room and cafe to what was a dilapidated old public toilet building. The Westminster architects commissioned an artist to evoke the character of the local area.Delivering such projects means managing tight local authority budgets. It often requires cross-programming, such as adding cafes or storage facilities to offset maintenance costs through rent. These measures boost footfall, enhancing passive surveillance and therefore reducing antisocial behaviour. The result is a virtuous cycle: more users, less crime, less fear and ultimately even greater use.Local politicians know that visible public provision wins votes, yet in most UK councils, funding remains scarce. The projects above relied on the Mayor’s Fund, the Levelling Up Fund and small portions of local budgets – streams that have largely dried up. A bright civic future is therefore hard to imagine, even though investment in public toilets would probably pay for itself by revitalising public spaces and stimulating commercial activity.However, change may be coming – the government is offering positive news in itsPride in Place strategy, which will offer funding specifically for public toilets to local authorities. Earlier this year, theLondon Assembly calledon the government to make public toilets a statutory duty for local authorities. Perhaps the UK will follow the best practice ofthe Tokyo Toilet project, which brought talented architects to design safe, beautiful, accessible public restrooms – but also, importantly, has a well-funded maintenance programme. The project boasts that “toilets are a symbol of Japan’s world-renowned hospitality culture” – not a space that should be regarded as an afterthought or an embarrassment.Good architects should embrace the complex challenges of designing public architecture, whether that be libraries, museums or public toilets. It is possible to approach all these typologies with the same rigour and belief that good architecture will improve people’s lives. But this also requires political will. Ultimately, nothing is too good for the public. These buildings succeed not by hiding their function, but by dignifying it. They understand that good design doesn’t just manage waste, it redeems it. A public toilet can express democracy – evidence that a city still believes in itself enough to provide for its most basic, universal needs.It’s public toilets or barbarism.Eddie Blake is a director of the architecture practice Studio WeaveExplore more on these topicsArchitectureOpinionLocal governmentLondonPublic services policycommentShareReuse this content"

Some dogs are funny and eccentric. There are extroverts and introverts. Pack leaders and followers. Some are angry. Some are mean. Some dogs are super-smart, others are bone lazy.The best way to describe Ronda is that she was kind. She was kind to all other dogs. And she was kind to humans – not just to her own people but to all she encountered. Her love for her human and canine family was as unencumbered as it was uncomplicated.In her later years especially, strangers could sense her kindness – could see it in her eyes and her flailing tail. They would stop (when she could still do her daily long walks; a tumour in her chest kept her largely housebound for her final year), remark on her beauty and ask to pat her. She would make way for other dogs. Sit patiently while the yappiest, most alpha mutts barked at her and tried to boss her. Toddlers could yank her ears, poke her eyes and pull her tail. She’d lick them in return.View image in fullscreenRonda, left, and Olive. ‘Olive watched her surrogate mum die on her bed in the lounge.’Photograph: Paul DaleyAmid the rivers of tears, and the heartache at losing a being so central to our family, come the reminiscences of golden moments from the years we shared with her. I spend so much of my time with our dogs. They are with me when I work, when I walk, when I cook, when I go to the shops. They are part of life’s prosaic rhythms.They are integral to our memories. Their lives, their births and their deaths are in so many ways deeply emotional markers of our own time on Earth. Twelve years feels like a significant chunk of my life. Our youngest daughter was eight when Ronda arrived. Like Nari, the lab we got when our youngest was three, Ronda was a failed trainee detection dog. Nari died when our daughter was 12 and Ronda became the surviving co-pilot, the consort, a comfort and a joy in her journey from childhood to adolescence and now to adulthood.Ronda is there in so many of my seminal memories (not to mention hundreds of photographs) of all our kids and, now, our grandchildren.Nari was decidedly, robustly alpha. The day Ronda arrived and tried to steal her bone, Nari bit her on the snout. She never did that again. Ronda was madly jealous, demanding our attention – until Nari put her back in her box with a nip here and a snap there. She was always the subservient one.View image in fullscreenNari, right, and Ronda.Photograph: Paul DaleyNo surprise then that Ronda became lost, totally rudderless and afraid of the world when Nari died (I’d said when she went that she wasmy favourite dog everbut I’m no longer sure I have a best in show). After Nari’s death, I felt I needed to learn to love Ronda. But she made it easy for me after the arrival of a new interloper – the hyper-energeticOlive, a collie crossed with a blue cattle dog.We quickly observed a beautiful temperamental change in Ronda when the feisty six-week-old Olive blasted into her orbit. Olive nipped at Ronda constantly, chewing at her ears and scratching her face. She stole her food, used her as a child might the play equipment in the park. The pup gnawed so incessantly at Ronda’s tail that its tip was calloused until the day she died.But Ronda responded only with kindness, patiently playing with the pup, shielding her from bullies in the dog park and schooling her in her humans’ commands: stop, sit, outside, stay, go.Olive watched her surrogate mum die on her bed in the lounge, with her humans all about and ABC Classic (she loved it) as her final soundtrack. She understands what happened. Today, she sniffs around the house – in the laundry and under my desk as I write this – in search of darling Ronda.Olive is the smartest of dogs. Yet she can’t quite intellectualise it.But neither can I. I felt relief when Ronda’s discomfort – her laboured breathing and nocturnal restlessness – ended so gently. And yet this morning I still somehow expected to see her at the bottom of the stairs, her tail thumping at the floorboards at the faintest hint of my footfall. More tears.I thought about Ronda’s kindness and patience a lot when she was dying, about how her legacy had gradually become manifest in that yapping, nipping cross-breed pup Olive.For I’ve seen it in recent times in her care around dog-crazy toddlers on the street and the grandkids. And so touchingly at the aged care home we visit regularly, where she sits at the feet of the elderly so they might stroke her and shut their eyes to summon the poignant memories of their own long-lost doggies.I’ve long thought people (whatever our choice of pet) can learn so much from the animals in our lives. For me, it’s always – and always will be – dogs, such highly sentient, emotionally acute creatures.Ronda was a beauty in every sense and the grief at her death, right now, is as painful and red-raw as any I’ve felt. I often wondered if she was investing in me more love, patience and kindness than I could ever reciprocate.And now I see all of those characteristics in the dog she adopted and I’m certain of it.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsDogsOpinionPetscommentShareReuse this content"

Last year Keir – and that’s a huge problemJohn McTernanThis weekend’s lengthy BBC interview was a great opportunity to show more vim and a new vision, but once again process and stock phrases won outJohn McTernan was political secretary to Tony Blair at No 10Mon 5 Jan 2026 06.42 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 11.54 ESTShareKeir Starmer kicked off the political new year with a fascinating and revealing45-minute-long interviewwith the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. The format was another sign of the No 10 comms team changing up its game – it was the nearest thing that public service broadcasting gets to anask me anything (AMA). Throughout the lengthy exchange the real Starmer was on show as he calmly and doggedly fielded all questions.And that was the problem. This wasn’t an attempt to reframe the political narrative for the coming year, nor was it a clear exposition of Labour’s “soft left” political economy – nationalisation, workers’ rights and the green transition. There was a complete absence of storytelling, just reliance on a handful of carefully practised phrases, the abiding sin of thisLabourgovernment: the elevation of tactics above strategy.Responding to questions about his own, and his government’s, deep unpopularity, Starmer planted himself firmly – and repeatedly – on a “five-year mandate” that he argued was “in the national interest” for him to see through. Growth was mentioned as a touchstone, but without any analysis of “growth for what or for whom”, even though distributional consequences are the modern religion of socialism. A variety of questions about voters’ frustrations met the same response: the country is “turning a corner”. The possibility that the Labour government is actually about to turn into heavy oncoming traffic hovered over the discussion of the coming May elections in Scotland, Wales, London and councils across England, our very own version of the US midterms. For the prime minister these were just local votes, not a national referendum.What was revealing wasn’t the bloodlessness of the prime minister’s language: no one is ever going to rise from their seat shouting, “Preach, brother, preach!” after any of Starmer’s performances. Instead, what was fascinating were the few flashes of passion. Asked about the real changes that people should feel during the coming year, he kept returning to “bearing down on child poverty”. And you could tell he meant it. Which is, at the very least, ironic given that he and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, only came to the conclusion that thetwo-child cap should be liftedwhen the parliamentary Labour party took direct political control of welfare policy.As we know from his airmiles, it’s geopolitics that really brings Starmer to life. He was willing to talk to Kuenssberg compellingly and at length about his achievements in bringing the UK closer to the European Union and his determination to continue deepening those relations. He showed a desire not just to engage in this discussion but also to argue for increasinglyaligning with the single marketin contrast with rejoining the customs union.View image in fullscreenLaura Kuenssberg interviewing Keir Starmer on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, 4 January 2026.Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PAThis, though, was “Not Here Keir”: the technocrat who is more suited to being a foreign secretary or a trade minister. The devil was in the details, and he was willing to go there. What there was no evidence of was a political argument in favour of this approach. The government was “quietly, seriously getting on with the diplomacy” and any changes would be “sovereign decisions” in the UK’s economic interests. Brutal, street-fighting politics was absolutely absent. The best reason to talk about the EU is that it is “punching the bruise” – it is the one subject that Nigel Farage and his fellow travellers, such as Robert Jenrick, are absolutely desperate to never ever discuss.There was passion, too, over defence and security. The need for European leadership in security, the cause of a “just and lasting peace” in Ukraine. But when this unlawful invasion was compared to the kidnapping and rendition of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, Starmer reverted to his inner securocrat who wanted to “establish all the facts” before commenting on the record. Again, a desperate lack of political antennae. It is an iron law that Donald Trump destroys all in his orbit. Yet, rather than distance himself from the US administration, the prime ministerchose to emphasise: “I do get on with President Trump.” A line that highlights London Labour activists’ wry observation that the Green party won’t need to do much campaigning this May, since “Keir Starmer is on the ballot”.In the end, what the prime minister effectively said was meet the new year, same as the old year. A politics of relentless process rather than any elevated purpose.The best way to summarise where we are would be to adapt former Labour prime minister Harold Wilson’s dictum “the Labour party is a crusade, or it is nothing”. For Starmer, “the Labour party is a PowerPoint presentation, or it is nothing”. We hoped for better, and still do.John McTernan is a political strategistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Maybe they will make people think more critically about debate and democracyMon 5 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 14.24 ESTShareIt was my blue shirt, a present from my sister-in-law, that gave it all away. It made me think of Yakov Petrovich Golyadkin, the lowly bureaucrat in Fyodor Dostoevsky’s novella The Double, a disconcerting study of the fragmented self within a vast, impersonal feudal system.It all started with a message from an esteemed colleague congratulating me on a video talk on some geopolitical theme. When I clicked on the attached YouTube link to recall what I had said, I began to worry that my memory is not what it used to be. When did I record said video? A couple of minutes in, I knew there was something wrong. Not because I found fault in what I was saying, but because I realised that the video showed me sitting at my Athens office desk wearing that blue shirt, which had never left my island home. It was, as it turned out, a video featuring some deepfake AI doppelganger of me.Since then, hundreds of such videos, bearing my face and synthesising my voice, have proliferated across YouTube and social media. Even this weekend, there has been another crop, depicting a deepfaked me saying fictitious things about the coup in Venezuela. They lecture, they say things I might have said, sometimes intermingled with things I would never say. They rage, they pontificate. Some are crude, others unsettlingly persuasive. Supporters send them to me, asking: “Yanis, did you really say that?” Opponents circulate them as proof of my idiocy. Far worse, some argue that my doppelgangers are more articulate and cogent than me. And so I find myself in the bizarre position of being a spectator to my own digital puppetry, a phantom in atechnofeudal machineI have long argued is not merely broken, but engineered to disempower.My initial reaction was to write to Google, Meta and the rest to demand that they take down these videos. Several forms were filled in anger before, a week or more later, some of these channels and videos were taken down, only to reappear instantly under different guises. Within days I had given up: whatever I did, however many hours I spent every day trying my luck at having big tech take down my AI doppelgangers, many more would grow back, Hydra-like.View image in fullscreen‘Hundreds of videos, bearing my face and synthesising my voice, have proliferated across YouTube and social media.’ Another AI-generated image from a deepfake video of ‘Yanis Varoufakis’.Illustration: YouTubeSoon, rage gave way to contemplation. Was I not, after all,the one who arguedthat big tech did not merely digitise capitalism but in fact spearheaded a great transformation, turning markets into cloud fiefs and profit into cloud rents? Are my AI doppelgangers not the perfect confirmation that, in this technofeudal reality, theliberal individual is dead and buried?Acquiescing to the partial loss of self-ownership, I sought solace in the rationalisation of these deepfakes as the ultimate act of feudal enclosure, proof that under technofeudalism we own nothing – not our labour’s data output, not our social graphs and now not even our audiovisual identity. Our new lords see us as tenants on their cloud lands, androids whose likeness they can appropriate at will to sow confusion, to muddy discourse, to drown genuine dissent in a cacophony of synthetic noise created for this purpose.But then a sunnier thought hit me, one that harks back to ancient Athens. What if my AI doppelgangers were harbingers ofisegoria(ἰσηγορία), a principle as bright, promising and absent as genuine democracy itself? When I asked several versions of AI chatbots to define it, they all dutifully misrepresented its meaning, definingisegoriaas equality of speech, or the right to be heard, or the freedom to address the assembly. But that’s not what the Athenians meant with the word. In fact, to themisegoriameant the exact opposite of today’s “free speech”, which they would dismiss as the abstract right to shout into the void. To the Athenians, it meant the right to have your views judged seriously, on their merits, independently of who you are or indeed how well you phrase them.Might AI deepfakes salvageisegoriafrom the clutches of our technofeudal dystopia? When we realise that it is impossible to verify who is speaking in a YouTube video, might we be forced to judge the merits of what is being said, rather than who is saying it? In the process of debasing authenticity, could big tech have inadvertently givenisegoriaa chance? These questions offered a glimmer of hope.It was the hope that the spectre of democracy may still be hovering over our heads if only we can find the motivation to look up, to engage in the slow, difficult, democratic labour that the algorithmic feed was designed to obliterate: critical evaluation of views and arguments thrown at us. Alas, this hope, though tangible, is insufficient as long as our technofeudal lords retain two colossal, asymmetrical advantages.How Amazon turned our capitalist era of free markets into the age of technofeudalism | Yanis VaroufakisRead moreFirst, they own theagoraitself – the servers, the feeds, the algorithmic means of communication. They can anoint their own speech as authentic with digital seals while drowning ours in a quagmire of doubt and noise. The result? Notisegoria,but a digital divine right where truth is the patented property of power.Second, and more cunningly, they need no deepfakes to rule.Their ideologyis embedded in themachine: the power toextract surplus valuefrom proletarians connected to the cloud through various digital devices, the logic of extracting cloud rents from vassal capitalists on their platforms, the tyranny of shareholder value, their imminent success atprivatising money.So our task is not to beg these lords for verification. Our task is political. We must socialise cloud capital, the all-powerful new force transforming society and destroying everything that makes humanism imaginable.Until then, let our digital doppelgangers speak. Perhaps they will so saturate the spectacle that we finally stop listening forour voiceand start judging theargumentson their own terms. This is perhaps the most paradoxical shard of hope in a hall of mirrors. But in this carnival, we grasp at every fragment we can.Yanis Varoufakis isan economist, politician and author.

His debut play, an adaptation of the 1952 western High Noon, is about to receive its world premiere, and the fact that he turned 80 last year is neither here nor there. “Maybe I’m theoldnew kid on the block,” he concedes from his home in Los Angeles. His baseball cap bears a picture of a typewriter, as though there could be any doubt that he has writing on the brain.Admittedly, Roth is more experienced than the typical first-timer. Behind him lies not so much a hinterland of a career as an imposing mountain range, all of it in movies. He won an Oscar in 1995 for writing Forrest Gump: he’s the one you can credit (or blame) for lines such as: “Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re going to get.”I loved working with Robert Redford. One of the loneliest men I’ve ever metHis own CV has something of the chocolate box about it, mixing chewy toffees – Michael Mann’s whistleblower drama The Insider, Steven Spielberg’s Mossad thriller Munich – with bonbons like David Fincher’s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, in which Brad Pitt is born elderly and ages backwards, and recent versions of A Star Is Born and Dune. All earned him Oscar nominations. Film or play, the pleasure is the same. “I love to put one word in front of the other,” he says. “See if I can get the right one.”View image in fullscreen‘A little more human’ … Billy Crudup and Denise Gough in rehearsals.Photograph: Johan PerssonHis swerve into theatre was sparked by the realisation that non-musical westerns were a rarity on stage. “I thought, ‘What better vehicle than this parable?’” Directors agreed: Ivo van Hove was attached at one point; Thea Sharrock is now in the saddle. Most actors, Roth tells me, were wary of stepping into the cowboy boots of Gary Cooper, the film’s star. Cooper played Will Kane, the marshal trying frantically to rustle up a posse on his wedding day, having learned that a vengeful outlaw is due back in town on the noon train. Billy Crudup was undaunted, though. His interpretation of Will, says Roth, is “a little more human. Not that Gary Cooper wasn’t human but he maintained that mask. Now we learn more about Will and his fears.” Denise Gough plays his wife, a pacifist Quaker urging him to flee with her rather than stand firm.The film served as an allegory for life during the US anti-Communist witch-hunts of the early 1950s. Its screenwriter Carl Foreman was blacklisted for refusing to name names. “It’s about cowardice and courage,” says Roth. “There’s a lot of cowardice in America right now, with people voting against their own interests. Incipient racism is being fostered by the actions of our leaders. High Noon applies to that but also to other eras, like the people who had the courage to hide Jews during the second world war.”View image in fullscreen‘Farcical novel’ … Roth picks up his Oscar for adapting Forrest Gump.Photograph: Michael Caulfield/APRoth has often expressed a preference for adapting imperfect or mediocre source material. He called the original novel of Forrest Gump “farcical”, dismissed Benjamin Button as one of F Scott Fitzgerald’s poorer works, and was bored by Dune when he read it in his teens. He knows where I’m going with this. “That’s an unfair question,” he grumbles good-naturedly, acknowledging that High Noon is an exception. Adapting it was “1,000% a challenge. It’s the pinnacle of what a western could be.”He also found himself navigating the demands of theatre. “Movies are written in closeup. In my first version of High Noon, I wrote the stage direction, ‘He shuffles his feet.’ The director asked me, ‘And how are we seeing this from the balcony?’” A sprinkling of Bruce Springsteen songs will further distinguish play from film. “They’re anachronistic, which makes for an interesting combination.”Thankfully, the stage version retains the picture’s structural asset: it unfolds in real time as the townsfolk prepare anxiously for the noon showdown. In that sense, it continues the writer’s fascination with temporal compression and elasticity. Forrest Gump and Benjamin Button span decades; the CGI-heavyHere, which reunited Roth with the Gump gang (director Robert Zemeckis, stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright), whizzed through millions of years from prehistoric times to the pandemic. Few cared. “We thought we had something special, but the critics were nasty and nobody showed up.”One of Roth’s as-yet-unfilmed ideas revolves around a widow who is given the chance to relive her late husband’s final 24 hours. “As the day wears on, it gets more and more touching, until finally he leaves his boots downstairs and goes up to bed – and you know he’s gone. Kevin Costner bought it, and every year I keep hoping he’s going to make it.”If I said to Martin Scorsese, ‘Why don’t we do this movie backwards?’ he’d say, ‘Let’s try it! Keep writing!’Would he trust Costner after the actor-director made such a dog’s dinner of The Postman, one of Roth’s earlier screenplays? “You really are a rat, boy!” he says with a rueful laugh, then explains what happened: he wrote the script, about a postal worker roaming a dystopian America, as a vehicle for Tom Hanks – only for Costner to buy it and commission a rewrite. “I’d given it a sardonic quality. It was like Gulliver’s Travels. Kevin made it very earnest and serious.” It won five Golden Raspberry awards, AKA Razzies, including, as Roth cheerfully reminds me, Worst Screenplay.Being rewritten comes with the territory but that doesn’t make it any easier to take. “It can be bruising,” admits Roth. His departure from The Horse Whisperer was especially painful, and came after he had moved in with the film’s director and star, Robert Redford, to work on the script. “We got up at nine and he’d say, ‘I think I’ll go for a jog.’ Then he’d be back at 10.30 and say, ‘I’ll have a little something to eat.’ Then it’s noon and he’s got calls to make. It’d be 2.30 before we started work.“I don’t want to speak ill of him because he’s gone now but I wish he had been a little braver with the movie. I loved working with him, and I found him fascinating. One of the loneliest men I’ve ever met. But I knew one day he’d look in the mirror and not want to see me there.” Sure enough, Roth was replaced. “That day, I was giving a keynote address at the Austin film festival. I thought to myself, ‘You fucking fraud. You just got fired!’”View image in fullscreenRobert De Niro, left, and Leonardo DiCaprio in Killers of the Flower Moon.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/APSwings and roundabouts. Roth has done more than his share of rewriting other people, including uncredited work on everything from Ridley Scott’s Black Hawk Down to Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival. It would be remiss to spend time in his company and not canvas his opinions on the Who’s Who of auteurs who have called on his services. The word is that Mann is the toughest cookie in Hollywood.“Michael gets upset when he thinks people are stymieing him creatively,” he says. “He’s hard on crews. I keep telling him not to be. He wants to get it perfect. Nobody’s tougher than David Fincher, but I’ll work with him till I die. His obsessive nature probably makes him a better director. On Mank, he would shoot 40 takes of an actor walking across a room. I’d ask him, ‘Why are you doing so many takes?’ He’d say, ‘He hasn’t done it right yet.’”View image in fullscreenWriting on the brain … Roth watches rehearsals.Photograph: Justine MatthewThat couldn’t be more different from Martin Scorsese, with whom Roth wrote Killers of the Flower Moon, a sorrowful thriller about the Osage tribe members in 1920s Oklahoma who are swindled and murdered for the oil discovered on their land. “Marty lets you do anything. If I said, ‘Why don’t we do this movie backwards?’, he’d say, ‘Let’s try it! Keep writing!’”Roth currently has his plate full working on a Sydney Sweeney thriller (I Pretended to Be a Missing Girl) and a real-life mafia drama for Scorsese (Midnight Vendetta), as well as being an executive producer on Mann’s Heat 2. “I haven’t done any writing on it, but I probably will,” he says, in the casual manner of someone accustomed to helping friends with their DIY.It is High Noon, though, that brings the brightest gleam to his eye today. “It’s made me feel 22 again,” he says. “Theatre is like this little village. Everybody’s fighting for the most creative way to tell the story. I’m not used to being treated with such respect. They won’t cross a ‘t’ without asking me. Whereas in the movies, they’ll go, ‘Who gives a shit what Eric Roth thinks?’”High Noon is at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, until 6 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreWesternsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So I videotaped my brother David running, jumping and climbing in a car park’Interviews byPhil HoadMon 5 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 17.13 ESTShareJordan Mechner, designerProgramming was very open back in the 1980s. You had to teach yourself, either from magazines, or by swapping tips. When you wrote a video game, you submitted it on a floppy disk to a publisher, like a book manuscript. In my freshman year at Yale university, I sent Deathbounce, an Asteroids-esque game for the Apple II computer, to Broderbund, my favourite games company. They rejected it, but took my next effort, Karateka, a side-scrolling beat-’em-up.I wanted to do a platform game next, inspired by 1984’s The Castles of Dr Creep, where you could throw switches that opened doors and closed traps. I thought it would be cool to combine those puzzle elements with the same kind of fluid rotoscoped animation as Karateka, which was unusually realistic for the time. The opening scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark was also a big inspiration; I wanted the same excitement, like you could die at any moment. I devised a story about a princess locked in a tower by an evil vizier – and you have one hour to save her. It came from an unconscious place: the game describes the hero as an adventurer from a foreign land, but I realised later I was echoing my family’s history as Jewish refugees.I started in October 1985, videotaping my brother David in the parking lot of our old high school,running, jumping, climbing: all the movements needed. But there was no animation software in those days, so I had to digitise everything manually. First, I photographed still frames of the videotape, got the films developed, then retouched the images in two-tone black and white – the only colours the digitiser could pick up. It took months.Everyone in the company knew this was a hitI moved to San Francisco a year later, to work in Broderbund’s offices. It was exciting being surrounded by real programmers, like Will Wright, who later made Sim City. I thought being there would make me more efficient – but finishing Prince of Persia ended up taking four years.After the character animation, I built the levels. But just avoiding traps wasn’t that much fun. My girlfriend at the time, Tomi Pierce, who was programming in the same office space, kept saying: it needs combat. But my animation was so fluid I had maxed out the Apple II’s 48K memory, which is less than the average email today. Out of desperation, I used a technique called byte-shifting to produce, without using any more memory, a polarised “dark” version of the prince: the Shadowman. After the player creates him by jumping into a mirror, he runs around stealing your potions and closing gates in your face. It was the opponent the game needed. So I reprogrammed everything to free up enough memory for the sword-fighting animations and some extra guards. I rotoscoped the combat moves from a six-second sequence in the 1938 film The Adventures of Robin Hood when you can see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in profile.The Apple II was dying as a platform by the time the game came out in 1989. But after it did well on other platforms in Europe and Japan it was rereleased on PC in the US and sales picked up. You wouldn’t get that second chance today. I was relieved, vindicated, happy. It created an action-adventure template for platform games that influenced the later 3D wave: Tomb Raider and Uncharted are its direct descendants.I helped adapt our own 3D follow-upPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time, into the 2010 movie with Jake Gyllenhaal. Just prior, I had spent all my savings on developing another game, The Last Express, an artistic folly that flopped commercially. So Prince of Persia ended up rescuing me too.Doug Carlston, publisherJordan was one of five or six independent developers working in our attic space. The problem for a lot of programmers is that they get 90% done, and don’t have the stamina to finish the last 10% – which is boring. Jordan’s finish quality was always superb; he’s a very detail-oriented guy. He would disappear for months at a time, though – I didn’t know it then, but he wanted a career in Hollywood.The time away was probably good for the game. I liked it a lot more than Karateka: the gameplay and the story were much stronger. It had an intangible quality: you kept thinking about it when you weren’t playing it. It was one of those times when everyone in the company knew they had a hit on their hands.Because it defined its own genre, its reputation needed to grow before it took off. Eventually, it went platinum and sold over 2m copies, which was a pretty big deal then. It was an outlier in the video games industry at the time in its use of animation, which was traditionally a Hollywood talent. The tools that were relevant to one industry were becoming relevant to the other, similar to how Pixar started out creating graphics software for Lucasfilm. It was a harbinger of film and technology getting closer.Jordan Mechner’s graphic novel Replay is out nowExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeGamesAction gamesAdventure gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plus it has an unusually buff posho. Strap in!Lucy ManganMon 5 Jan 2026 17.00 ESTShareHe is a Balliol man, a suave toff in a suit as sharp as his cheekbones. Unusually buff for a posho, but that is because he is played by Leo Suter, who was Harald Hardrada inVikings: Valhallauntil about 10 minutes ago and evidently still has protein shakes to use up.She is a working-class Norfolk lass (“Swaffham High, Swaffham Tech”) in sturdy boots and a utility vest who is in the last chance saloon, job-wise, because of her habit of mouthing off to her bosses. She is played by Sofia Barclay, best known as Dr O’Sullivan in Ted Lasso but not getting to use her comedy chops here, because you mustn’t be funny in front of Balliol men. They find it damn confusing and have to be taken off for a lie down.Together, they are Detective Inspector Tommy Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers in what is described as a contemporary update of the original novels by Elizabeth George. Now look – I know what you’re saying, but no. There has not, in fact, recently been a contemporary update. That was The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, starring Nathaniel Parker as the eponymous hero and Sharon Small as his scrappy sidekick, and it began broadcasting a quarter of a century ago and finished in 2008. I’m sorry. We are all so much older than we think. And yet, curiously, younger than we feel. I blame the years from Brexit to Trump for that.Anyway. Now we have paused briefly to shake our heads in disbelief, let us return to the fray. This new endeavour – not to be confused withEndeavour, the Morse spinoff on ITV that was notLewis, though the original Parker/Small show was designed to compete with both, so I hope that’s clear – is entitled simply Lynley. Which is as contemporary as all-get-out already, before the credits have even rolled.Havers is assigned to the new DI up from London. She is not looking forward to “playing nursemaid to some fresh-faced city boy who doesn’t know his arse from his elbow”. But wait. What is that coming up behind her? Is it a wardrobe that took a wrong turn at reception? No, it is her new, very tall, very experienced, very “This is my arse, this is my elbow and I have no trouble distinguishing the one from the other” new boss. Fortunately, she is too feisty – a word I feel in my very marrow was capitalised in the script – for mortification to endure long.View image in fullscreenFeisty … Sofia Barclay (DS Havers) with Leo Suter (DI Lynley) and Rosalyn Wright (Maia Saunders) in Lynley.Photograph: Jonathan Hession/BBC/Playground TVThey are soon investigating a body found on an island beach – a man apparently murdered by being biffed on the head. He is Guy Brouard (Dave Anders), a very rich man who owns the entire island and, it is gradually revealed, likes to get up to the kind of things you would expect a very rich man who owns an entire island to get up to. He also has a wife, Ruth (Wendy Nottingham), who is dying of cancer and is largely tended to by his all-seeing housekeeper, Valerie (Amanda Drew) and his groundsman, Paul (Angus Cooper), plus a son who is expecting to inherit the place. No spoilers, but the son is married to an attractive woman, there’s a comely female student on a dig he’s funding on the estate and Valerie’s young niece is also hanging around the place for the summer.You can see from this that a lot of plot is about to happen, in between Lynley dropping bits of Latin into the conversation at every opportunity, and it is paid out with a sure hand and at a steady pace. Everything happens for a reason, every Chekhovian gun from sex tapes to pottery shards goes off, every loose end is tied up. And whenever we need to be kept in narrative suspense for a bit, we get a glimpse into the private lives of the central pair. Lynley is on barely-to-no-speaks with his parents; he may have left some professional or personal trouble behind in the capital; and his love interest, Helen Clyde, will be played by Niamh Walsh but not yet. Oh, and his new boss (Daniel Mays) hates him for reasons as yet unspecified. It might be the Latin. It might be that they have genuine beef. Or maybe the boss just wants to look more like a wardrobe himself. Time will tell.Havers visits her parents frequently but there is clearly a secret sorrow plaguing them all. She’s only second lead, so I suppose there will be more on her later.Everything, in short, is as it should be – for fans of the books, for fans of the old series and for fans of undemanding telly.Deo gratias.Lynley aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTV crime dramareviewsShareReuse this content"

Where the Upside Down is concerned, it’s never overStuart HeritageMon 5 Jan 2026 07.38 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Jan 2026 07.56 ESTShareWe’ve all had a few days to sit with theStranger Thingsfinale now, and reaction has been mixed. For every hardcore fan who found themselves in floods of tears by the end, there was a disgruntled TikToker aggressively listing all the plot holes the episode left unfilled in its race to the finish line. In other words, how you felt about Stranger Things as a whole probably determined how you felt about the way it ended.Which, despite any qualms you may have about the finale – and we’ll get to those soon – seems like the best way anyone could possibly wrap up a series. There was no tonal pivot; no bleak, Dinosaurs-style parable; no “it was all a dream” St Elsewhere-style cop-out; no Blake’s 7-style final bloodbath. Stranger Things died as it lived – full of spectacle and sentiment (and a chronically unwieldy mythology, and way too many characters).By achieving this, Stranger Things managed to bat it straight down the middle. Will this final episode become as beloved as Breaking Bad, or as widely discussed as The Sopranos? Almost certainly not. But at the same time, it avoided the pitfalls that drove Dexter and Game of Thrones into the dirt.View image in fullscreenShe finally got something to do! … Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers with Noah Schnapp as Will in Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixLooking back, it did a couple of things exceptionally well. The first was that it managed to pare back the ludicrous sprawl that upended the previous episodes, which spread a seemingly infinite number of characters across a seemingly infinite number of locations, dimensions and dreamscapes. It was so bloated that nobody could ever get anything done because they had to keep reminding each other where they were and why.This represented much cleaner storytelling. It was a bunch of characters versus a massive crab, and the crab lost. Everyone got a moment in the spotlight; especially Winona Ryder, who got to lop off Vecna’s head after spending half a decade getting paid to stand in the margins and look befuddled. The final battle looked amazing and felt suitably high-stakes. Fans who have spent the last decade watching as Stranger Things became riddled with bloat must have been thrilled.The second big plus was remembering that this was initially a show about children. The finale was peppered with flashbacks to the cast pre-puberty – a particularly canny move. Since Stranger Things debuted, we’ve all watched as the young actors have grown and grown, physically and in terms of notoriety. Seeing flashes of them small and innocent, unaware of the tsunami of global fame about to hit them, was unquestionably very touching. Plus the 18-month time jump at the end gave everyone the chance to play closer to their own age for once. You can only imagine the tears of relief Caleb McLaughlin must have shed knowing he wouldn’t have to wear that flat-top wig for a few scenes.View image in fullscreenUnquestionably touching … Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas, Natalia Dyer as Nancy, Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin, Joe Keery as Steve, Charlie Heaton as Jonathan, Finn Wolfhard as Mike, Noah Schnapp as Will, and Maya Hawke as Robin in Stranger Things.Photograph: Netflix © 2025Then again, what was my most memorable moment of the finale? Probably the moment I glanced at a clock and realised it still had still 30 minutes to go.At that point we were already deep into the denouement, with every single character being given their own elegiac sendoff. Steve became a teacher. Dustin got to be relatively obnoxious during his graduation. Erica honed her bomb-making skills. Joyce and Hopper got engaged. The army politely snuck off and never bothered anyone ever again. And Eleven either did or didn’t die, depending on your personal preference.On and on it went, the endings piling up on top of each other so extravagantly that the actual meat of the episode became a distant memory. It made the last Lord of the Rings film look like the model of restraint. There were so many endings to this episode, I briefly considered pitching a ranking of them, before I realised this would require me to watch them all again, and honestly, who has time?View image in fullscreenDid she really die? … Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven with David Harbour as Jim Hopper in Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixBut, as punishing as it was, for the diehards it felt earned. After all, this is who the finale was for: the millions who took this weird little jumble of 1980s references, initially designed as a one-season wonder, and grew it into such a monster that new episodes literally broke Netflix.So, did Stranger Things stick the landing? Well, no, because in the big scheme of things this doesn’t count as a landing at all. We’re in 2026 now, and the biggest crime an entertainment corporation can commit is letting an established IP die. The Duffers have confirmed they are already working on one Stranger Things spin-off and, if that’s too far away, an animated series (Stranger Things: Tales from ’85) will be out this year. Put simply, abandon the concept of Stranger Things ending. While there’s still money to be wrung from it, that won’t be allowed to happen.Explore more on these topicsStranger ThingsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It followsEmpire’s Crossroads: A History of the Caribbean from Columbus to the Present Day, from 2014, andEl Norte: The Epic and Forgotten Story of Hispanic North America, published five years later. The subtitle to the new book indicates its roots in the first two:The 400-Year Fight to End Slavery in the Americas.“I was led by both my own curiosity and also a frustration,” Gibson said, of how she came to retell that four-century fight over 500 absorbing pages.“So much that is known about the rise of slavery, the system of slavery, and the end of slavery, tends to be in the English-speaking world. So the English-speaking historiography looks at the US, it looks at Jamaica, but there’s this whole other story.The books to look out for in 2026Read more“I’ve spent a lot of time in Cuba, so I write about the Spanish-speaking world and the Spanish empire, and then there’s slavery in Brazil, which is a whole other thing. And when you’re in the scholarship, it’s linguistically divided. I wanted to bring it all together. I wanted to see what it looked like.”Gibson is herself well-traveled: from the American south, she moved to London, wrote and edited forthe Guardian, then went to Cambridge for a PhD centered on the Haitian revolution of the late 18th century, an epochal event in the fight for freedom. Now based in South Korea, she refuses to stick to well-trodden paths.“There’s been a big historical turn,” Gibson said. “In the last 20 or 30 years there’s become a lot more interest in the movement by enslaved people to get their own freedom, versus white abolitionism, which for a long time, certainly in Britain, received a lot of attention.”The Great Resistance recounts such attempts for freedom. Most involve desperate violence. The book begins in nightmare.View image in fullscreenA beach at Long Haul Bay, Nevis Island, St Kitts.Photograph: Michael Runkel/Robert Harding/Getty Images“The road to freedom is lined with bodies,” Gibson writes. “Some lie in the darkest recesses of the sea, like the ‘hundred Men Slaves [who] jump’d over board’ from the Prince of Orange during a balmy evening in March 1737 … ‘resolv’d to die’,” at least 33 succeeding, “sunk directly down”.It happened in the Caribbean not far off Saint Kitts, then contested by Britain and France. The 360 enslaved people aboard, bound for Virginia, were from Bonny in what is now Nigeria.“It’s definitely a dark book,” Gibson said. “But I didn’t want to dwell too much on the violence inflicted on enslaved people, because I feel like there’s a lot of that in other books, and there’s also a critique about white voyeurism, of violence to Black bodies.“If you read books about plantation history, or the rise of slavery, it is a horrible, violent story. But so is the story of freedom. What I tried to do is focus on the actions and reactions of enslaved people trying to get to freedom. So jumping off a ship – that’s their choice. Or a conspiracy, a revolt that is violently suppressed, I show that within the context of what they’re trying to do, rather than the arbitrary and horrific violence meted out by the system.”Gibson considers the history of transatlantic slave trade but does not focus on it. She points out that her endnotes “can point people to more detailed books about the horror of the Middle Passage”, terrible voyages that took enslaved people from Africa. When the Prince of Orange plied the route, she notes, the ship’s captain did not record the names of those he transported or who jumped to their deaths.That “really stuck with” Gibson, because in “contemporary accounts of resistance they might name the ringleader or a few others, and then it’s just numbers: it’s just, ‘16 slaves hung’, often.“Sometimes they do put names so that they can compensate the enslavers, but I was always really struck because in academic practice now, there is a lot of discussion about archival silences. And I felt in this story the silences were really, really loud. Here are these people rebelling against the system and nobody knows their names. Nobody can be bothered to record their names. They don’t even know what their names are. They don’t even know what names they’ve been given.”Some namesareknown well.Nanny, the woman who led escaped enslaved people (“Maroons”) in Jamaica and forced a treaty with the British, in 1740.Denmark Vesey, who rebelled in South Carolina in 1822.Nat Turner, who fought back in Virginia in 1831. Black campaigners are present too: US giants such as Frederick Douglass, lesser-known names like Robert Wedderburn and Olaudah Equiano, campaigners in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries.Prominent figures outside the Anglosphere include Lourenço da Silva Mendonça, “a member of the royal family in Pungo-Andongo, a part of what was then the kingdom of Kongo”, who in the 1680s, under his European name, became “one of the earliest abolitionists from Africa”. Forced to Brazil, Mendonça returned to Europe to fight for freedom, ultimately making his case at the Vatican in Rome, “anticipat[ing] the contemporary struggle for human rights”.View image in fullscreenToussaint Louverture.Photograph: North Wind Picture Archives/AlamyAmong violent struggles, there is of course Haiti and its successful revolution against French rule, led byToussaint Louverture, a great figure of Black history. Born enslaved, as a free man Louverture “purchased at least one slave and, while leasing his son-in-law’s coffee plantation, oversaw 13 others”. As Gibson notes, the fight against slavery was never clean, “noble sentiments” often “giving way to economic realities”.Lesser-known cases include that of Mahommah Gardo Baquaqua, taken from modern-day Benin to Brazil in the 1840s, treated brutally, then taken to Rio and “almost bought by a ‘colored man’”. In a narrative of his life published in New York in 1854, after his escape, Baquaqua said he recounted that near-sale to “illustrate that slaveholding is generated in power, and anyone having the means of buying his fellow creature with the paltry dross, can become a slave owner, no matter his color, his creed or country.”Gibson found Baquaqua “in the course of researching this book. He’s not well known, like Frederick Douglass, like Nat Turner … We don’t have any records of his life. We don’t know what this guy was doing.” Like many of her subjects, he proved “very hard to track”.Well aware that readers “want simple narratives”, Gibson said the challenge of explaining horrendously complicated realities was something “really frustrating about being a historian right now. Publishing is grappling with nonfiction losing ground to ‘romantasy’ and escapism and stuff. If you want this book to be a really happy story, it isn’t. I didn’t even get into the afterlife of slavery. Just because the practice and the institution ends [with abolition in Brazil, in 1888] we’re living with the afterlives and that’s completely unresolved.”In the US, Gibson argues, one such lasting effect of slavery is found in societal violence.View image in fullscreenThe Great Resistance cover.Photograph: Atlantic Monthly Press“You needed a culture of violence to suppress slave revolts, to make people work, to stop runaways. I think there’s a legacy that has not been grappled with. Why do you think there are guns in America?Whodo you think they were used for? Initially, it wasn’t to kill bears out west. It was to suppress, it was to keep order in the east. First, it was to kill Native Americans, obviously. Then the need for guns to keep away the Brits [founding myth of US gun-rights lobby] was the least of the concerns.“One thing I learned in doing this book is thatthe Citadelin South Carolina [a leading military college] was the result of the fear around the Denmark Vesey revolt. There’s a statue to Denmark Vesey in this park in Charleston that is not very far from the Citadel. The founding of the Citadel was about, ‘Oh, we can never let this kind of conspiracy happen again.’”Another lasting factor in the history of slavery, in the Caribbean and South America in particular, is sugar: cultivated by Europeans using forced African and Indigenous labor every bit as brutally treated as were enslaved people in the cotton fields of the US south.To Gibson, sugar was “the cocaine of its day. No one needs sugar. Cotton, well, it’s a staple. You make clothes from it. But nobody needed sugar. Arguably, nobody really needed the main commodities of the Caribbean: sugar, coffee, chocolate, cacao, in some of the islands, and Mexico and South America, indigo. Indigo had industrial or dying uses, but if you look at the commodities, most are absolutely luxuries.“And this intersects with scholarship and increased awareness about commodities through history, and luxury goods, the rise of the consumer society. Sugar’s just poisonous, really, and we’re all addicted to it, and the world is getting obese because of it, and that’s what I find so extraordinary: all these people suffered so much for something no one needed. To me, if there’s a starting point of the modern world, that’s it.”The Great Resistance isout now.To support the Guardian, order your copy of the UK edition atguardianbookshop.com.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Flipping through the jazz section on a visit to his local record store a few years ago, artist Kye Potter found a battered tape by American pianist and composer Jessica Williams. It looked every bit the quintessential DIY release. “The labels had come off the tape,” he says. “It was home-dubbed, with photocopied notes, a little bit of highlighter to accentuate the artwork, and released on her own label, Ear Art.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As a collector and occasional producer particularly interested in the American musical avant garde after John Cage, Potter was intrigued by a tape called Prepared Piano. Yet it seemed unusual from Williams, who was best known for making sparkling jazz in the straight-ahead tradition of Thelonious Monk and Errol Garner. If the west coast jazz circuit knew her as a musical experimenter – for her concerts,she requested pianos without the cover to make it easier to reach inside andstrum the strings– it was a facet that rarely made it to her records.“I’d never heard anything like it,” Potter says of the tape. So he emailed Williams to see if any more records existed. She sent back four recordings of prepared piano from the mid 1980s – two live, two made in the studio. And though she had long since retired from playing publicly, she also included some recent work. “She sent me probably 15 or 16 synth tapes – full releases,” says Potter.View image in fullscreenPrepared precursor … John Cage changing the tuning of his piano by placing coins and screws between the strings in 1949.Photograph: New York Times Co./Getty ImagesPotter worked with Williams during the Covid pandemic to put together Blue Abstraction, an album of prepared piano pieces that was released on artist Matt Connors’sPre-Echo Pressin late 2025. But Williams died in 2022, part way through the project. She was 73. “She was struggling physically and financially,” Potter says. Williams had been public about her difficulties after spinal surgery in 2012, meaning she could no longer tour, and a cancer diagnosis in 2017. “But I think her personality, strength, self-confidence and the calmness she found through having a spiritual practice all came out in conversation.”In later electronic, groove-focused releases such as Blood Music (2008) – defiantly tagged “NOT JAZZ”on the genre-sceptic’s website– and the two Virtual Miles releases (2006 and 2007), you hear a pianist trying to break free of expectation. Blue Abstraction, with its intriguingly altered piano reverberations, reveals that that impulse stretched back decades. Rather than a homogenous piano sound, the instrument creates many different sonic evocations: what could becimbaloms, gamelan, distant church bells, animals rattling around cages, and little machines spluttering into life. It has a tremendously urgent energy, monumental roars collapsing into snarling, highly punctuated riffs.Tortoise’s Jeff Parker tells me he is a fan of this “gorgeous, diverse, exploratory and nuanced” record. Jessika Kenney, a vocalist and composer who has worked with Sarah Davachi and Sunn O))), heard Williams play while studying in Seattle in the 1990s, and was drawn to the intensity of her music, but knew little of her surreal-sounding prepared piano until this release. Not long after seeing Williams live, she went to Indonesia, seeking “surrealism in the improvisational vocals of the Javanese gamelan”, she recalls. “Now that seems completely natural as a connection with her. I only wish it was known to me then.”Jessica Williams: Blue Abstraction – videoWilliams’ prepared sounds have technical precursors: think of John Cage’s prepared pianos, or the radical techniques of American eccentricHenry Cowell. What’s striking is how successfully she fuses these new sounds with her own bluesy vocabulary at the keyboard. The language rarely departs from that she developed in a discography stretching to more than 80 albums, meaning the new psychedelically coloured sounds are powered by the fizzy energy of an improviser in full control. It’s thrilling stuff.View image in fullscreenTireless experimenter … Jessica Williams in Oakland, 1986.Photograph: PRWilliams had always experimented with the piano. “I hit the notes, and I saw colours,” she told NPR’s Terry Gross in 1997. She received her first upright piano in 1954. On Currents, the long-running blog she kept (miraculously preserved by the Internet Archive), she told the story of her first “disassembling” – “as I’ve done forallpianos”, she noted: Williams took off a panel from below the piano’s keyboard, and placed it on the floor beside her stool. “I needed a drummer, and that left foot became the hi-hat foot,” she wrote.Williams originally studied classical piano at the Peabody Conservatory. Early encounters with the classical repertoire led her to Rachmaninov; she took his famous Prelude in C minor to her piano teacher, who scolded her for improvising a section. But he saw her potential: the next week, he brought her Dave Brubeck to play. She learned his Take Five within a week.Brubeck would latercall Williams“one of the greatest pianists I have ever heard”, and McCoy Tyner was similarly impressed. Williams’ 2004 Grammy-nominated album Live at Yoshi’s, Vol 1, shows her deep absorption in jazz history, plus her trademark playful pianistic wit. Nevertheless, despite her long journeys to educate herself in the genre – first, to the hipper sounds of Coltrane, Miles and Dolphy, before working her way back to Monk and Garner to Fats Waller and James P Johnson – she quickly became disillusioned with the jazz world.After moving from Philadelphia to San Francisco, Williams met the great Mary Lou Williams when the latter played a week at the Keystone Corner. Buoyed up by the elder pianist’s advice (“Don’t ever let anyone stop you”), she became a strident, public critic of her scene: of the meagre pay, the jazz “boys’ club”, the “jazz hang” – namely smoking and drinking as the primary means of getting gigs – and of a corporate industry riding on the coattails of struggling artists.“I am continually disappointed at the reality of the ‘jazz world’ and its inability to organise, communicate and stand up for a set,any set, of core values,” she wrote in the liner notes to her 2008 release Deep Monk. Similarly, the writing on her blog is wide-ranging, unflinching, expressly political and feminist, though she rarely discussed her experiences as a transgender woman. As John Corbett noted recently in German magazine JazzPodium: “To add to the sexism … that chased her from her preferred musical arena for a period, imagine what kind of inhumane bullshit she must have endured as a trans woman in the jazz scene of the early 80s.”View image in fullscreenUnlinching … Jessica Williams.Photograph: Peter Symes/RedfernsThe 10 best jazz albums of 2025Read moreWilliams’ career arced towards self-sufficiency. After time in the bustling Bay Area scene, she moved through smaller cities such as Sacramento and Santa Cruz, settling in Portland in 1991, moving smaller still, to Yakima, Washington State, in the 2010s. Williams saw early on the huge potential of the internet “to change human consciousness beyond anything experienced during the Industrial Revolution”,as she wrote, and also to help establish herself as an independent artist. By the late 90s, she used her own website to blog, run another record label, (Red and Blue Recordings), ship records, and maintain a mailing list of dedicated fans, who attended concerts –often given in people’s homes.Even after she sold her piano to pay for her spinal surgery and retreated from performing publicly, she continued to make music: not jazz (“when it stopped being fun playing jazz, I stopped doing it,” she wrote in 2018) but on synthesisers. “That makes me happy – as a hobby.” After her death, some in the online jazz community remarked that her passing had gone virtually unnoticed. Now, there’s a sense that a Williams revival may be beginning. For starters, Potter and Conners are contemplating a more blues-focused prepared piano project. “Music just flowed out of Jessica her whole life,” says Potter. Even in death, the sense is she’s not quite finished.Blue Abstraction Prepared Piano Project 1985–1987 is available viaWorld of Echo MusicviaPre-Echo PressExplore more on these topicsMusicJazzfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A woman is killed, a man grievously injured, and a letter is sent to the news media. The killer gives himself a name –this is the Zodiac speaking–and provides a message written in code. So we start with three mysteries: the man, his motives and his message. The third is quickly cracked; the first hypothesized, but never definitively proven. But it’s the why of it all – why a man would kill at least five seemingly random people, and why we as a culture still care – that will require more significant investigation.‘Pure euphoric escapism’: why Adventureland is my feelgood movieRead moreWhen it was first released more than 18 years ago, David Fincher’s Zodiac was considered a bit of an also-ran. Over two and a half hours long, it depicts the search for the Zodiac killer, who spent the late 60s terrorizing California’s Bay Area, as a series of bad leads and dead-ends, and concludes without definitively proving anything. It flopped at the box office and was not nominated for even a single Oscar.Yet, to the great concern of my friends and loved ones, Zodiachas become my go-to rewatch. When I have nothing much to do, I might put on 20 or 30 minutes, and watch Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr) and San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) attempt over years to untangle clues, allusions and near-misses knotted around the identity of the Zodiac killer.To tell the truth, I find it all a bit comforting. Now, there is obviously quite a lot to disturb here: a mother with child trapped in a moving car, a daylight attack by a man in a leather mask. But contra Fincher’s clinical reputation, Zodiac is a film of surprisingly light pleasures. The dialogue is zippy, the performances closer to His Girl Friday than Seven. I could spend five hours visiting various police precinct evidence rooms, or listening to the long chain of variously balding character actors as they list off Bay Area place names: Napa, Vallejo, Lake Berryessa.James Vanderbilt’s screenplay provides the viewer with a near-constant uptake of new information, a series of puzzle pieces that nearly fit together, but not quite. This enlists the viewer in the act of investigation, placing them on a level with the characters in their collective attempt to parse relevant information from chaff. Only deep in the runtime, and years into the story, do you realize that this exploration will likely never reach its destination.For Fincher, as for his characters, the search for the Zodiac transmutes into a kind of quest, a vocation that calls out to particular niche obsessives – puzzlers, codebreakers, meaning-makers – and turns the film into something far more expansive than your typical serial killer tale. Whether dramatized or documented, the modern true crime story tends to be intensely over-determined, bending all evidence towards an established conclusion. But Zodiac is a process movie where the clues keep coming but never quite add up, and the search can never come to a definitive ending. There are always more messages, more references, more threads to be pulled, leading its collection of journalists, detectives and obsessives down tangents that might consume literal years of their lives, and yield little but a persistent fascination.Zodiac is, at its heart, a story of the persistent attraction of mystery, where the slow unspooling of surprising facts, incidental details and seeming revelations can become an infinite churn and can even swallow up a life. It touches on the detective story, the newspaper movie and the contemporary paranoiac obsession with lining up the endless stray impressions of daily life into something neat, comprehensible and, most of all, meaningful. In particular, Graysmith’s quest begins with an attempt to safeguard his children, and ends up endangering them. Yet he never considers dropping it, not even when mysterious strangers are calling the house late into the night to breathe over the line. The confidence of the search, the surety of Graysmith’s belief that he will somehow, someday know – the stakes here are existential, though the danger is long in the past and all violence is entirely self-inflicted. To give up the search would be to give up the work of his life, a choice he (and we) never seriously consider.Every time I watch Fincher’s film, I too become convinced that I will find, somewhere in its weave of suggestion and incident, the solution to the Zodiac killings, much as some people believe they will find mysteries of the universe in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The constant unspooling of new information, the new leads, new possibilities, draws me onward, deeper into the puzzle, until the story dissipates and no conclusion arrives. A few weeks, a couple months, a year or two passes, and I take the disc off my shelf, and keep on with the search.Zodiac is available on Netflix and Paramount+ in the US, Amazon Prime in the UK and HBO Max in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsDavid FincherMy feelgood movieJake GyllenhaalChloë SevignyRobert Downey JrMark RuffaloThrillersDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Schwartz was 24 when it became a Broadway hit in 1972 but many of the evergreen lyrics reveal an old soul. “Cats fit on the window sill, children fit in the snow,” observes its eponymous hero. “So why do I feel I don’t fit in anywhere I go?”Pippin’s framing as a musical erected by a band of travelling players fits this fringe venue well. The stage is sparsely decorated and the arriving performers offer a ramshackle narrative conjured from – and constantly on the verge of vanishing into – thin air, thanks to tricks from magic consultant Martin T Hart in a production directed and choreographed by Amanda Noar.In Roger O Hirson’s book, Pippin is portrayed by a player essaying the role for the first time. Noar heightens the character’s naivety by having the lead actor, Lewis Edgar, plucked as if from the audience, dragooned into the show by the authoritarian Leading Player (Emily Friberg). She casts a spell on him with her brightly painted talons and similarly wields control of a marionette-like ensemble who exude slinky mischief in the opener, Magic to Do.View image in fullscreenBeguiling … Emily Friberg in Pippin.Photograph: Inigo Woodham-SmithThe seductive charm of that song is the keynote of a production that never quite captures the musical’s prevailing malevolence, despite a beguiling performance by Friberg who stalks the stage. The pair of songs about battle, War Is a Science and Glory, should chill in their vaudeville grotesquerie, as should Bob Fosse’s choreography for a routine dubbed “the Manson trio”, referring to the cult leader’s manipulative powers of control.The Fosse flash – isolated hips, flickering fingers – is often present here but the dark undercurrent of the time in which Pippin was written is mostly missing, despite costume designer Hannah Danson’s blend of the 1970s with AD780. However, counterculture optimism shines through, especially with Simple Joys – performed with hula hoops flying across the stage – and the gentle protest song Morning Glow, richly delivered to its crescendo by Edgar under Simon Jackson’s golden lighting and backed by musical director Harry Style’s industrious five-piece band.View image in fullscreenA hero on a quest for meaning … Lewis Edgar, aloft, as Pippin.Photograph: Inigo Woodham-SmithTraditionally, largely due to Hirson’s often leaden book, Pippin can be an annoying and over-earnest hero on his quest for meaning – the character is the major flaw in his own story. But Edgar succeeds in making him more of a rebel against his father (Oliver Wood), even if the overall characterisation remains rather disjointed.‘Magic to do – just for you’: the miracle of Stephen Schwartz’s musical PippinRead moreIf Pippin is the tale of a boy becoming a man, one of its highlights is grandmother Berthe (Clare Brice) in her rousing solo No Time at All, seemingly growing younger with each line. Elsewhere, Helena Caldas gives us a simpering but sly Fastrada (Pippin’s stepmother) and Mia Quimpo makes a strong professional debut as the antithetically pure Catherine, offering a life stripped of pageantry. There is plenty of weird magic and simple wonder, even if you miss the wickedness.AtUpstairs at the Gatehouse, London, until 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsStephen SchwartzFringe theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

However in terms of numbers, One Battle After Another was outdone by Frankenstein and Sinners, both of which won four, including best supporting actor for Frankenstein’s Jacob Elordi and best original screenplay for Sinners’ Ryan Coogler.The TV portion of the awards proved another triumph for teen-violence drama Adolescence, co-created by and starring Stephen Graham; it won best limited series as well as three acting awards, for Graham and his co-stars Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty in their respective categories.Seth Rogen’s Hollywood comedy The Studio dominated the TV comedy prizes, winning best comedy series and acting awards for Rogen and supporting turn Ike Barinholtz. Likewise The Pitt edged its rivals in the drama awards, winning best drama series and acting prizes for Noah Wyle and Katherine LaNasa.The lineup also contained a couple of jabs at Donald Trump: South Park, which hasled the way in satirising the president, was given the best animated series awards, while Jimmy Kimmel, whocame under sustained pressure from Trumpafter the shooting of Charlie Kirk, won best talkshow. And in a quirk reflecting the North American nature of the awards, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy won best movie made for television due to its US premiere on streaming service Peacock, despite it showing in cinemas in most other international territories.The awards, which are voted on by the largest association of “broadcast” film and TV critics in the US and Canada are organised by the Critics Choice Association and its offshoot the Broadcast Television Journalists Association.Full list of winnersFilmBest pictureOne Battle After AnotherBest actorTimothée Chalamet – Marty SupremeBest actressJessie Buckley – HamnetBest directorPaul Thomas Anderson– One Battle After AnotherBest original screenplayRyan Coogler – SinnersBest adapted screenplayPaul Thomas Anderson – One Battle After AnotherBest supporting actorJacob Elordi – FrankensteinBest supporting actressAmy Madigan – WeaponsBest casting and ensembleSinnersBest foreign language filmThe Secret AgentBest animated featureKpop Demon HuntersBest comedyThe Naked GunBest production designF1Best costume designFrankensteinBest hair and makeupFrankensteinBest visual effectsAvatar: Fire and AshBest soundF1Best cinematographyTrain DreamsBest songGolden – KPop Demon HuntersBest scoreSinnersBest stunt designMission: Impossible – The Final ReckoningBest young actor/actressMiles Caton – SinnersTelevisionBest drama seriesThe PittBest comedy seriesThe StudioBest actress in a drama seriesRhea Seehorn – PluribusBest actor in a drama seriesNoah Wyle – The PittBest actress in a comedy seriesJean Smart – HacksBest actor in a comedy seriesSeth Rogen – The StudioBest supporting actor in a drama seriesTramell Tillman – SeveranceBest supporting actress in a drama seriesKatherine Lanasa – The PittBest supporting actor in a comedy seriesIke Barinholtz – The StudioBest supporting actress in a comedy seriesJanelle James – Abbott ElementaryBest limited seriesAdolescenceBest actress in a limited series or movie made for televisionSarah Snook – All Her FaultBest actor in a limited series or movie made for televisionStephen Graham – AdolescenceBest supporting actor in a limited series or movie made for televisionOwen Cooper – AdolescenceBest supporting actress in a limited series or movie made for televisionErin Doherty – AdolescenceBest animated seriesSouth ParkBest talkshowJimmy KimmelLive!Best variety seriesLast Week Tonight With John OliverBest comedy specialSNL50: The Anniversary SpecialBest foreign language seriesSquid GameBest movie made for televisionBridget Jones: Mad About the BoyExplore more on these topicsFilmTimothée ChalametJessie BuckleyOne Battle After AnotherPaul Thomas AndersonAdolescenceStephen GrahamnewsShareReuse this content"

No one has been charged criminally with regard to the allegations in the lawsuit.Global e-casino Stake has dismissed the claims as “nonsense” and said it was “not concerned” about the lawsuit.Two women in the US state Virginia have filed a class action seeking US$5m from e-casino Stake.com, the celebrities and another Australian internet personality for alleged breaches of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) and consumer protection laws.Stake.com, a Curacao-licensed global e-casino, is officially banned in dozens of countries including the US, Australia andthe UK.Its American arm, Stake.us, does not allow users to gamble directly with real money. Wagerers play with e-tokens – some are provided for free while others can be purchased and withdrawn as cryptocurrency.The class action, filed on Wednesday, alleges Stake.us’s anonymised design enabled Drake to fund purchases of automated streams, artificially inflating his royalties and popularity on music streaming platforms, including Spotify.Court documents allege Drake and Ross hid the financing from public view by transferring gambling winnings via Stake’s anonymised tip system to an Australian man, named in court documents as George Nguyen, who allegedly operates the online accounts grandwizardchatn**** and Grandavious.A Stake spokesperson said on Monday US time: “For the record, Stake.us does not have a tipping function that could be used in this way. This is a nonsense claim and we are not concerned about this lawsuit.”Nguyen, who has posted promoting Drake and the gambling platform, allegedly traded between the Stake proceeds, cash and cryptocurrency to pay bot vendors for artificial music streams on behalf of Drake and Ross.The lawsuit alleges Drake transferred millions of dollars as part of the scheme, including in the form of $100,000 and $10,000 tips to Ross. The lawsuit also alleges public posts, chat logs and leaked communications prove Nguyen’s role.The class action claims the scheme dates back to 2022 and “remains an ongoing and imminent threat of racketeering activity”. Drake, Ross and Nguyen were contacted for comment.The suit also alleges Stake, with Drake and Ross, deliberately misled consumers to believe the platform was legal and harmless.The lead plaintiffs, Tiffany Hines and LaShawnna Ridley, alleged they suffered serious harm after Drake’s promotions encouraged them to gamble on Stake. The platform had financially harmed users by encouraging them to gamble illegally and leaving them vulnerable to addiction, the class action claimed.A Missouri man in October brought a similar case against Stake, Drake and Ross, which Ross at the time dismissed as “bullshit”.Stake.us faces lawsuits in other US states claiming it has operated illegally. Responding to an August case brought by the Los Angeles city attorney, Stake’s Australian parent company, Easygo, told The Australian: “We reject allegations that have been made in the media in relation to this potential claim and will vigorously defend this and all such claims.”Since 2022, Drake has promoted Stake on Instagram and on Kick, the Easygo-owned livestreaming platform, including a post in June revealing he had gambled $124.5m and lost $8.2m in a month.“Gotta share the other side of gambling… Losses are so fried right now,” he captioned the story post.“I hope I can post a big win for you all soon.”The rapper in December promoted hours-long livestreams on Kick with a post captioned: “Can we end my roughest gambling year on a good note?? I want to MAXWIN and share 10% of it with you. Go to Stake to find out how you can enter to win that pot.”The lawsuit alleges Stake has paid Drake $100m a year and provided free gambling credit to the rapper and Ross.Ross, a 25-year-old internet personality andprofessional livestreamer, moved to a rival e-casino, Rainbet, and quit Stake in 2025, telling viewers he would continue streaming on Kick due to his friendship with its 30-year-old founderEd Craven.Craven, hailed by Forbes as Australia’s youngest billionaire with an estimated $2.8bn fortune (A$4.2bn), co-founded Kick in Melbourne in 2022 with Bijan Tehrani after their success with Stake. The platformdrew regulatory attentionin August after hosting a livestream during which a man died in France.In Australia,Gambling Help Onlineis available on 1800 858 858.

It is the land of razzle-dazzle and high ideals, of jazz music, Bogart and Bacall, Harriet Tubman and Hamilton, a nation that was anti-colonialist and pro-liberty from its conception, whose Declaration of Independence states that “all men are created equal”. Why, then, does this same country so often produce clown-show politics, racism at home and abroad, and imperial ambitions, latterly in Greenland and Canada? Why does it regularly show contempt for the world order it helped create? Why did it once again electDonald Trump?These contradictions have kept an army of journalists, White House-watchers and soothsayers in business for generations. Alistair Cooke, perhaps the greatest British exponent of the genre, interpreted the country via the minutiae of everyday life, observing people at the beach, say, or riding the subway. Stourton, another BBC veteran, who first reported from Washington in the Reagan years, takes almost the opposite approach. He looks at Trump and Trumpism through the run of history, arguing in a series of insightful essays that the 47th Potus is not an American aberration but a continuation, an echo of dark and often neglected aspects of the country’s past. Trump, he concludes, is “as American as apple pie”.Stourton, who currently presents Radio 4’s religious and current affairs programme Sunday, takes six key aspects of Trump and Trumpism and sieves the history of the republic, looking for precursors or parallels. Broadly speaking, the categories are religion, imperialism, immigration, tariffs, political persecution and the way in which the president wields power. Appropriately, given Stourton’s expertise, he kicks off with an exploration of American faith.It is baffling for those of us who live outside Trumpland that Christian nationalists form a major component of the Maga faithful. How can anyone purport to follow Christian values and still align themselves with someone so obviously venal, corrupt and immoral? In search of an answer, Stourton spools back to colonial America, and to John Winthrop, who landed at Salem, Massachusetts, in 1630, at the head of a group of 700 English Puritan settlers. It was Winthrop who famously described the new religious colony he intended to found as “a city upon a hill”, an image since borrowed by US presidents from JFK to Reagan to Barack Obama. Winthrop served for many years as governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where he and his co-religionists happily sentenced dissenters to whipping, banishment and even execution. This was justified, in Winthrop’s view, because the state existed to uphold divine laws, and if its earthly methods needed to be brutal, so be it.The modern parallel is clear. Christian nationalists will support Trump as long as he helps them return divinely founded America to the Christian state it once was: he’s delivering on his side of the bargain through actions such as appointing the supreme court justices who overturned Roe v Wade. Seen through the lens of early puritanism, the alliance makes far more sense than it does in the context of the constitution, whose guarantees of religious freedom only arrived a century and a half later.There are precedents in US history for almost all of Trump’s actionsThis tension – between an enlightened US and its illiberal alter ego – runs through Stourton’s book. In the 20th century, for instance, US presidents liked to define the nation as anti-imperialist, which gives the impression that Trump’s present-day coveting of Canada and Greenland is the anomaly. But territorial expansion was a key aim of the US for much of the 19th century. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 set the template. Thomas Jefferson acquired 530m acres from Napoleon, including land that makes up part or all of 15 modern-day US states. The country doubled in size overnight. Of course these lands were not France’s to sell: their true owners included an estimated half-million Native Americans. But Jefferson’s deal set the tone for a “century of confiscation” and ethnic cleansing that was to come.Four decades later, the US government made another massive grab for land, forcing Mexico to cede more than half of its territory, including modern-day California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona and New Mexico, and parts of Colorado, Wyoming and Oklahoma. In all, there were around 20 episodes of American expansion in the 19th century, including two attempts to annex Canada. The US “resorted to absolutely every trick in the book to achieve its ambitions”, according to Stourton, including real-estate deals, bribery, treaties, diplomatic sharp practice, bullying, ethnic cleansing and conquest. “The outcome always came first,” he writes, “the means mattered less.”There are precedents here for almost all of Trump’s actions. Summary arrests and deportations? Attacks on the “fake news” media? In 1798, John Adams signed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which allowed him to imprison or banish foreigners without trial, and banned “false and malicious” writings against the president and the government. Contempt for judges and the law? See Andrew Jackson, Potus number seven, a “monster”, according to Stourton, and a hero to Trump. Jackson refused to implement a supreme court verdict he disagreed with, allegedly saying of the chief justice: “John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!” Tariffs? President William McKinley raised import duties to around 50%, a “Trumpian level”, with disastrous consequences for the Republican party. Muslim migrant bans? Stourton refers us again to Winthrop, whose regime inflicted punishment based on the identity or sect to which a person belonged, and required strangers wanting to reside in Massachusetts to get permission.Occasionally, the attempts to find historical precedent feel a little stretched. The weakest may be the link Stourton draws between Trump’s use of the state to punish his enemies and the McCarthyite witch-hunts of the 1950s. There are similarities in the way government processes are abused, but these feel very different. Trump, the most powerful man in the country, is motivated by a desire for personal retribution: he orders the prosecution of people he thinks have slighted or wronged him. Joe McCarthy, who never rose higher than the status of junior senator, had no history with many of his targets, but attacked them opportunistically, because he loved the spotlight.On the whole, though, Made in America is a pithy, entertaining and informative intellectual exercise. Stourton makes a persuasive case that Trump is a logical outcome of American history, a modern representative of the illiberal, imperialist streak inUS politicsthat stands in sharp contrast to the more familiar values of the constitution. He set out to prove that you cannot understand Donald Trump without understanding America’s past, he tells us. What he found in the end was that “you cannot understand America without understanding Trump”.Non-Americans should hardly take solace from Stourton’s conclusion that Trump is an American phenomenon. As Cooke is once supposed to have remarked, “The British especially shudder at the latest American vulgarity, and then they embrace it with enthusiasm two years later.”Made in America: the Dark History that Led to Donald Trump by Edward Stourton is published by Torva (£20).

His poems are shaped by his classicism, his consciousness of his Welsh ancestry and a sense of strong personal affiliation with Ireland. Johnson was a member of Yeats’s Rhymers’ Club, and is associated with the Decadent movement of the 1890s.Renegade is one of his faultless pieces of lyric verse. Its three six-lined, beautifully cadenced stanzas are linked by a nuanced refrain, each time beginning with a different conjunction. The avoidance of closure at the end of the first verse is especially notable, thanks to the connective first word of the new stanza’s first line, “For all that now is over”. Thepararhymein each stanza’s opening lines (“over / discover”; “ over / lover”; “ over / recover”) asserts the certainty of the loss of “all that”, and that an ineradicable echo or shadow remains. Renegade is a song of disillusionment and defeat, shot through with the brilliance of a memory that refuses to fade entirely into the past.The lost ideal itself is never defined clearly. In the first stanza it takes the form of “Holy Land”, a “banished secret” and a “charmed communion with high things unseen”. Some of the symbolism is a reminder of Johnson’s conversion to Catholicism in 1891, and raises the possibility of a lament, not for lost faith, for which there seems to be no evidence, but for an ideal associated with it. Phrases such as “charmed communion” and “banished secret” suggest nevertheless that Johnson’s Holy Land is broader interior terrain, possibly erotic.On the basis of better-known poems, such asThe Dark Angel, Johnson’s life and work are usually interpreted through the prism of suppressed homosexuality. Renegade might be read as a farewell to the erotic enchantment that had only ever been attainable in a dream, or through its poetic expression.Many of Johnson’s poems bear dedications. The identity of the dedicatee here, Arthur Chamberlain, is uncertain, but he may have been his Rhymers’ Club associate, AB Chamberlain, who is described in the Second Book of the Rhymers’ Club anthology as “affiliated permanent guest”. Perhaps he was the special friend in whom Johnson confides in another beautiful lyric, The Precept of Silence. If the date, 1887, given to Renegade in the1895 collection Poemsis correct, it suggests the poem pre-existed the club: of course, the friendship may have come first, or the dedication added later. Renegade’s opening conjunction “But …” suggests that the imagined reader would recognise that, in spite of the intensity recalled, whatever prompted the emotion is “over”, and would share the regret.In the opening and closing stanzas, there’s an emphasis on the speaker’s physical appearance, his eyes and looks. These particulars match the intimate tone, the sense that the poet is confiding in someone who can imagine his face. At the same time, the poem has a wide embrace: its intensity admits all young and no-longer-young “dreamers of dreams”.Unexpectedly, the second stanza conjures an ancient, nomadic scene: the poet is a “merchant of earth’s market-place, no lover” and “broken echoes fill the mart” as if memories stirred and died again on the traded and degraded ground. Aiming to depict the ordinary, “dusty, trodden road of all”, Johnson creates a particularly haunted scene, before the “silent memories” are drawn away “down chill air”, replaced by oppressive “care” and seemingly abandoned.In this newly bleak setting, images of abandoned worldly grandeur, the throne and crown, represent the price and magnitude of the speaker’s loss. It was a kingdom, and is beyond restoration. He has chosen to disappear, crouched “at the heart” of an urban scene. He desires anonymity. But there’s still the implication that his emotion must be concealed from someone who might, too tenderly, observe it: he requires himself not to “wear” his “old love looks” but to “wear [them] down” – as if he could commit an act of slow but violent erosion of himself, so that only the “dull look” remains. This look appears nevertheless to be a mask: “Befitting love unthought on, or forsook.” None of the denials the poem lists are convincing, and yet the denials are passionate, and central: a survival mechanism, not a pose. And one of the secrets of Johnson’s extraordinary lyric is that the speaker has forgotten nothing of the blaze and richness of his lost Holy Land.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I love the combination of roast sweet potatoes with crumbled feta and a bright, fresh pesto; adding butter beans to the mix brings another hit of protein, as well as getting more legumes into your diet – win-win! A jar or tin of chickpeas would work just as well, if that’s what you have in, and feel free to substitute the parsley for other soft herbs, should you wish.Roast sweet potato, feta and butter bean traybake with spring onion pestoPrep15 minCook30 minServes22 largesweet potatoes, scrubbed or peeled (up to you) and cut into 1½cm chunks570g jarbutter beans(or 400g tin butter beans), drained and rinsed2tbsp olive oil2tsp smoked paprika2tsp flaky sea salt200g block feta, crumbledFor the spring onion pesto25g flat-leaf parsley, leaves and tender stems3 spring onions, trimmed and roughly chopped50g almonds, or pine nuts50ml extra-virgin olive oilJuice of½ lemonHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Tip the sweet potato chunks, butter beans, olive oil, smoked paprika and a teaspoon of sea salt into a roasting tin or tray large enough to hold everything in almost one layer, mix well, then roast for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, blitz the parsley, spring onions, nuts, olive oil, lemon juice and half a teaspoon of salt in a high-speed blender or chopper. Taste and add more lemon juice and/or salt as needed; if you prefer a thinner texture, loosen with a little more oil, too. Set aside and put your feet up.Once the sweet potatoes and butter beans have had 30 minutes, take the tray out of the oven, spoon the spring onion pesto all over the top, scatter on the feta and eat warm.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyCheeseVegetablesBeans, pulses and legumesVegetarian food and drinkMain courseSauces and graviesrecipesShareReuse this content"

As we start a new year, the focus is back on balance, and these dishes offer both nourishment and flavour, while also being ideal for making ahead. The overnight oats are a source of fibre, the muffins are high in protein and the pie is a source of both.Pear and ginger overnight oats (pictured top)Prep5 minCook10 minSoakOvernightServes4120g rolled oats1 tsp ground cinnamon4 small pears,2 grated, 2 to garnishSalt120ml freshly squeezed orange juice(from 3-4 small oranges)2 balls stem ginger, finely chopped, plus 1½ tbsp syrup from the jar200g greek yoghurt, plus extra to serveSliced pistachios, to serve (optional)In a small bowl, mix the oats, cinnamon, grated pears and a pinch of salt. In a second bowl, stir the orange juice, chopped stem ginger and ginger syrup, then stir this and the yoghurt through the oat mix. Cover and chill overnight, either all in one bowl or in individual portions (once made, the oat mix will keep in the fridge for up to five days).In the morning, top a portion of the oats with a small spoonful of yoghurt and half a sliced pear; sliced pistachios and/or a drizzle of stem ginger syrup also make nice additions.Tortilla, spinach and sesame pieView image in fullscreenThis makes a pretty large pie, which you can absolutely halve, if you like; it freezes and reheats well, too.Prep45 minCook1 hrCool1 hrServes9-12For the spinach filling400g spinach, thoroughly washed and dried3 spring onions,trimmed and thinly sliced1 small leek,trimmed, washed and thinly sliced½ tbsp flaky sea salt½ bunch fresh dill,leaves pickedBlack pepperFor the potato filling700g white onions, peeled and thinly slicedFlaky sea salt120ml olive oil700g baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 3mm-thick slices3 medium eggs,thoroughly whisked1 lemon,juiced, plus the grated zest of ½ lemonFor assembly270g pack filo pastryOlive oil,for brushing25g white sesame seeds, to garnishHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line a roughly 37cm x 27cm metal or enamel baking tin with greaseproof paper, making sure it overhangs on each side.Put the spinach spring onions and leek in a colander in the sink, sprinkle with the salt, then toss and leave for 15 minutes. Using your hands, scrunch the spinach, onions and leeks together, squeezing out as much moisture as possible as you do so, then mix in the dill and season with black pepper.Meanwhile, sweat the onions and two teaspoons of flaky salt in the olive oil on a medium heat for about 15 minutes, until fully softened and starting to turn a little golden. Add the sliced potatoes and another teaspoon of flaky salt, gently stir to combine, then cover the frying pan and leave to cook for 15 minutes. Take off the heat and leave to cool a little, then mix in the eggs, lemon zest and juice.Layer two or three sheets of filo in the base of the lined baking tin, brushing each one with olive oil before adding the next. Tip in the potato mix, spread it out evenly, then top with the spinach mix. Make a lid for the pie with another two or three sheets of filo, again brushing each one with olive oil as you lay them in, then trim the edges with scissors. Brush the top of the pie with olive oil, sprinkle liberally with sesame seeds, then bake for an hour, turning up the heat if it’s not browning enough. Remove, leave to cool for an hour or so, then slide the pie out of the pan and on to a large board (use the paper overhang to help you).The pie will keep for up to three days in the fridge, but it’s also excellent frozen and reheated gently. To serve, use a serrated knife to cut it into portions.Corn, cottage cheese and dill muffinsView image in fullscreenPrep20 minCook35 minMakes6 large muffins100gpancettaor bacon lardons(optional)40g unsalted butter120g plain flour½ tbsp baking powder¼ tsp fine sea salt¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda150gcorn kernels, fresh or frozen2 spring onions, trimmed andthinly sliced2 tsp finely chopped fresh dill100ml buttermilk, or 85ml milk mixed with 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice1 large egg1½ tbsp maple syrup150g cottage cheeseHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line six or seven holes of a 12-hole muffin tin with muffin cases (or squares of greaseproof paper).Put the pancetta, if using, in a cold pan, set it over a medium heat, then leave the lardons to render their fat and turn golden. Add the butter and, as it melts, use a spatula to scrape down the pan, picking up all the browned bits. Set aside to cool slightly.Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and bicarb, then add in the corn, spring onions and dill, and toss to combine.In a jug, whisk the buttermilk, egg and maple syrup, then stir through the cottage cheese.Add the wet ingredients to the dry and whisk just until combined. Fold in the melted butter (with or without the crisp pancetta), then divide the mix between the lined muffin tin holes. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until golden and cooked through.The muffins will now last for three to four days, stored wrapped and at room temperature.Alexina Anatole is the author of theSmall Wins Substackand Sweet: The Secret to the Best Desserts, published by Square Peg at £27.
