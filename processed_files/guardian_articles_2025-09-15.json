At the last election, Reform won five seats. Two MPs, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock, have since left the party over artistic differences – ie, falling out with Nige – and have gained only one in the cold-hearted Sarah Pochin. Now they are back to their full complement. Five, it turns out, is the magic number. The race is on to find, not just the next recruit, but the next to leave. It could be anyone. Get too close to the Sun God Nige and you tend to crash and burn.For once, the email from Reform insisting that Monday’s press conference would contain an important announcement was more or less accurate. Normally all you get is a parade of new councillors or a policy that is never going to happen. But this time Reform had gone all in. A room in a luxury Mayfair hotel. And Nige talking deadly earnestly about preparing for government. A job so important, it couldn’t be entrusted to any of his current half-witted derelicts, such as Richard Tice or Lee Anderson. They were really only there as cosmetics. To make up the numbers.Step forward the latest defection. Not a half-witted idiot like Nadine Dorries or the sequinned Andrea Jenkyns but someone on the outer edges of being taken seriously. It goes without saying that Danny Kruger is deeply weird, but he is – or was until this morning – a Conservative frontbencher. One of Kemi Badenoch’s shadow ministers.No wonder Nige looked pleased to introduce him. If also a little wary. Slightly deferential. Danny won’t be nearly so easy to push around as the rest of the Reform MPs. Perhaps too, Nige might be a little twitchy of taking another Tory. He doesn’t want to make a habit of taking any old Conservative MP who has been spooked by the polls and decided to jump ship. If Reform ends up looking like a care home for the Tories then it may begin to lose support quite rapidly.Danny is quite good at sounding sincere. He likes to consider himself a deep thinker. A man with a big brain. Other opinions are available. So Danny adopted his sad face. This wasn’t a moment of triumph, he said. He was here more in sorrow than in anger. He had been a Conservative for more than 20 years – a Tory MP for the last six – and he was here to say that theTories were finished as a party of opposition.It was game over. He didn’t seem to appreciate the irony that he was one of the people responsible for his party’s end of days. Austerity, Brexit, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss. Danny was a cheerleader for all four. But today was a new day. A tabula rasa. The sins of the past could be both forgiven and forgotten. Time to move on. Kruger may have not so long ago lauded the talents of Robert Jenrick but Honest Bob was now dead to him. For Danny, loyalty comes cheap.“Britain is not broken,” he said. That might have come as a surprise to Nige. Farage has spent the whole of the summer touring the country telling anyone who would listen that it was. Moving on. It was the Tory party that was broken. Only Reform could bring the radical change that was needed.David Cameron had let his country down. Theresa May had let his country down. Boris Johnson had let his country down. As had Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and Kemi Badenoch. Worse than that, they had also let him down. There was no bigger crime. You get the feeling that almost everyone lets Danny down in the end. No one escapes his disappointment. Just about the only person to remain on Danny’s pedestal is Danny himself. No greater self love hath any man … It would come as no surprise were Nige to be the next to feel Danny’s disenchantment. So soon. Too soon.Then came the questions. Unfortunately for Nige, the first was nothing to do with his new signing. Instead, it was about his curious financial arrangements regarding his house in Clacton. Here our great champion of free speech and transparency in public life came over all tetchy and opaque. He had seen a KC and everything was legal and anyone who said any different could expect to be sued. Only no one had suggested illegality. Just that he might have lent his partner the money to reduce the stamp duty liability. Strangely he wouldn’t even repeat what he had previously said about his partner being independently wealthy.Next it was time for Danny to backtrack a little. When he had said Kemi was useless he had really meant to say she had been brilliant. He didn’t want to sound churlish. No one could have done better than Kemi. Except for Honest Bob. But Kemi had also been superb. It was just a thankless job. Mmm. That may be. Yet you won’t find many other Tory MPs singing her praises. Kemi being a bit crap was probably the one thing that everyone in all parties could have agreed on.What you have to realise, said Nige, was that Reform was really an inclusive party. The most inclusive party. Anti-racist people are welcome in Reform, he continued. They could stand side by side with the others. So sweet. No one would be turned away. “You’d have been amazed by the diversity at our conference in Birmingham,” he added. Or maybe you wouldn’t. Almost everyone there was white. And Nige carefully stopped Danny from answering a question on same-sex relationships.There was no need for a byelection, Nige and Danny agreed. His East Wiltshire constituents would have realised Danny was basically a Reform candidate last time out. It’s just he forgot to make it explicit. Besides no one wanted a byelection. That just left enough time for Danny to appeal to his new team mates. He might have previously suggested they were a bunch of dim chancers making spending promises they could never keep, but what he really had meant was they were on the threshold of forming the next government. And he was looking forward to working with them. Somehow you just know it’s all going to end in tears.Explore more on these topicsReform UKThe politics sketchNigel FarageConservativesKemi BadenochcommentShareReuse this content"

I bow before Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton’s many career achievements: Perrier award-winners, makers of successive hit TV series, not to mention megastars (as I shall soon discover) in China. But can they convince us that there are old ghosts haunting the 90s-built New Victoria theatre, located in a shopping mall? Such is the challenge faced by theInside No 9duo as they take their hitshow-of-the-serieson tour. “We made it very much about the ghosts of Wyndham’s theatre,” says Shearsmith of the show’s West End run. “Now we have to change it so that every place we’re in, that’s where there’s a legend of bloody Belle, and that’s where she haunts.”Over the tour, that may mean the 100-year-old Liverpool Empire or Edinburgh Playhouse: no problem. Or it might be the rather fresher Marlowe in Canterbury or Milton Keynes theatre, which opened in another shopping precinct in 1999. “That doesn’t lend itself to a legend,” admitsShearsmith, chatting over lunch at a London rehearsal room. “So we are amending the phraseology to make it sound older than it is. We’ll say ‘a quarter of a century’ rather than ‘25 years ago’. One sounds recent and the other sounds old.”View image in fullscreenGrotesques … as Edward and Tubbs in The League of Gentlemen.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyNone of this was anticipated when the pair created Inside No 9: Stage/Fright earlier this year. “We never intended it to tour,” says Pemberton. Nor did they take it for granted that a stage show based on their 10-year anthology series would necessarily fly. That seems bizarre to me: the avalanche of praise for Inside No 9 since its final series makes the success of a live outing feel nailed on. But its creators made no assumptions. The TV show’s popularity “crept up”, says Pemberton. “There were times when people used to go ‘Any more League of Gentlemen?’” – theircult sketch show that ran from 1999 to 2002– “and we’d say, ‘Well, we’re doing Inside No 9’, and they’d say, ‘Oh, I’ve never seen it.’”He continues: “Sometimes you’d feel, because it was on BBC Two at 10 o’clock, you were falling into a crack, and it wasn’t the show everyone was talking about. It’s only when you announce something’s ending that you start to feel this enormous love for it.” Making the stage show reinforced the point. “I remember feeling with League of Gentlemen as well,” adds Shearsmith, “that you never get a sense of who’s watching it, apart from your mum and dad telling you that there’s someone in the post office who said, ‘I saw your son last night.’” With Stage/Fright, “you get to meet your audience at the stage door”, says Pemberton, “and hear what it means to them. That’s been amazing. We now feel,” he says, with satisfaction, “that it’s been a good decade’s work.”Inside No 9 was far from a surefire hit when it launched in 2014. There may have been, as Shearsmith contends,a noble tradition of anthology showson TV (Alfred Hitchcock Presents; Tales of the Unexpected) – but the tradition was dormant. TV orthodoxy demands recurring characters with whom audiences can build a relationship. The only constant in Inside No 9 was Shearsmith and Pemberton as stars (or cameos), and their horror-meets-comedy sensibility. And the quality and variety of their ideas – which became ever harder, says Shearsmith, to sustain.“Doing six new stories every series for the last 10 years, it was always, ‘Wow, we got away with it again,’” he says. “All we were ever thinking was, ‘What next? Have you got any more new ideas?’” To the viewer, I say, it felt effortless. “It may look effortless,” responds Shearsmith, “but under the surface, the swan’s feet are …”, and then Pemberton finishes his sentence: “arthritic”.The challenge with Stage/Fright was to capture the spirit of the TV show – not just its laughter-meets-chills vibe, but its tonal variety. And so Stage/Fright re-used existingInside No 9content (they reprise most of the series four episode Bernie Clifton’s Dressing Room, about a clapped-out comedy double act), featured a celebrity guest star at each performance (Lee Mack at press night, along with Ian McKellen, David Tennant and Bob Mortimer), and also addressed the question: “What can we do – with the bows at the end, even with the pre-show message about mobile phones – that can really play with the idea of being in a theatre?”That led to the decision not to spin a purely fictional tale, but to appear – unprecedented this, for both of them – as themselves. “We were reticent about that,” says Shearsmith. “We were terrified of looking indulgent in any way. But [director Simon Evans] said, ‘No, the fact that you’re there, and it’s live, is a massive new thing for anybody coming to see it. People don’t see you, ever: you’re always hidden behind the characters in the stories.’ So we put ourselves in it. It’s not a fourth-wall show. We acknowledge we’re all in this building together, and then things happen” – spooky things, as the ghosts of each individual theatre are summoned to the stage.View image in fullscreen‘We were terrified of looking indulgent’ … playing themselves in Stage/Fright at Wyndhams Theatre.Photograph: Wyndhams TheatreWithout ever stinting on the entertainment, this all makes for a wonderfully tricksy and destabilising show, its strands united by Shearsmith and Pemberton’s palpable love for theatres and their hauntings – and for old-school entertainment, its double acts in particular. Is that a personal concern? “We never really thought of ourselves as a double act in the traditional sense,” says Pemberton. “We’ve sort of accidentally become one, haven’t we?” says Shearsmith. Their relationship isn’t toxic, like Tommy and Len (AKA Cheese and Crackers) in Bernie Clifton’s Dressing Room, with “one always feeling stuck in a certain role”, says Pemberton. “We’ve always been able to change it up. We often don’t know until days before we shoot who’s going to play which character.”“All that proves,” says Shearsmith, “is that we’re interchangeable.”And as for all those theatre ghosts, that’s been an obsession since at least their League of Gentlemen days, when they considered setting that show’s movie spin-off in a haunted playhouse. “I wouldn’t want to be the last person to leave the theatre at night, making sure it’s all closed up,” says Pemberton. But is it harder frightening people on stage than on screen? Shearsmith had prior experience with that, having starred in League co-writer Jeremy Dyson’slong-running stage hit Ghost Stories. “How do you frighten people who’re aware they’re surrounded by lots of other people, in a theatre, who’ve all been laughing together?” he muses. “It’s hard to switch gears like that. But they’re linked, aren’t they, laughter and fear? Playing with that is fun.”It’s also a technical feat on stage. “There’s a lot of special effects,” says Shearsmith, “a lot of magic, gore and blood. Timing is everything: there’s a ballet of stage hands and crew working in tandem with what we’re doing.” But it works: I teetered on the edge of my seat for the entirety of Stage/Fright – and you might too if you catch it on its tour. Its creators are delighted to be bringing it to their home patches of Hull and Manchester in particular. “If you’re a fan of a thing and it turns up in your town,” says Shearsmith, “you can’t believe it. I used to go to Hull NewTheatreand once saw Peter Davison from the telly in some play, and couldn’t believe he was right there. It’s great!”In the Shanghai Grand there’s an Inside No 9 experience. It’s like walking into our mindsIt’s unlikely, mind you, that the good burghers of Hull and Manchester will be as excited as the Chinese, who – as surprising as anything in Inside No 9, this – turn out to be obsessive fans of the series. “They’ve got their own live show of it that’s been running for two years now,” reports Shearsmith. “We went to Shanghai last year to see it. We got to the fifth floor of the Shanghai Grand, which is massive, and there’s a whole interactive Inside No 9 experience. It’s like walking into our minds. The show is far bigger there, andwewere massive,” he says, a 56-year-old man bewildered to be treated like a pop star. “We had security, people trying to grab us – it was mad.”There are no plans, as yet, to tour Stage/Fright to the Middle Kingdom – but then, the Inside No 9 boys have no plans at all right now. “We don’t have next year set up,” says Pemberton. “It’s the first time in a decade we don’t have anything at all that’s definite. We’ve just been rolling along with Inside No 9 for the last 10 years.” This tour lets them roll along with it for a few months more, soaking up the love. And then? “Who knows? And that’s scary, but it’s freeing as well,” says Pemberton. “We’re used to the feeling of, ‘Oh God, what are we going to do now?’ – because that’s what writing Inside No 9 has felt like all along.”Inside No 9: Stage/Fright is touring to 6 DecemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreComedy (Stage)Inside No 9Reece ShearsmithSteve PembertonComedy (Culture)featuresShareReuse this content"

We have been locked up in this place for more than a month. Some people expect to be forced on to a plane toFrancetoday. Nobody wants to go. For us, this is a disaster.”The man speaking, Fessahaye, is an asylum seeker from Eritrea who fled indefinite military conscription in his home country, and walked through the Sahara before being tortured and enslaved in Libya. He eventually crossed the Mediterranean and reachedEurope. From France he travelled to the UK in a small boat.“This place” is Brook House immigration removal centre near Gatwick airport. It is one of two centres, along with Harmondsworth, near Heathrow, where an estimated 92 people who recently arrived on small boats have been detained in preparation for removal to France in anew deal hailed by the prime ministeras a development that will finally “turn the tables” on the high number of asylum seekers arriving here in dinghies.The scheme, known as “one in, one out”, swaps uninvited small boat arrivals in the UK, who will be forcibly removed to France, for asylum seekers in northern France who have been given permission by the UK government to travel here legally to have their asylum claims considered.Fessahaye and the other detainees spend their days being locked into and unlocked from their cells and frantically searching for a lawyer who can stop them being put on a plane to France.View image in fullscreenProtesters at the ‘unite the kingdom’ rally in London on 13 September.Photograph: Krisztián Elek/SOPA Images/ShutterstockAnger about small boat arrivals – 31,027 so far this year, up from 22,440 over the same period last year – was one of the drivers of Saturday’s“unite the kingdom” rallyorganised by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson (whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon).So far there is no evidence that “one in, one out” has deterred crossings from northern France, despite the UK government proclaiming that dozens of small boat arrivals have been locked up. Since the first detentions on 6 August, a few thousand more people have crossed the Channel, including a particularly high number – 1,097 – on 6 September.Critics say the scheme is flawed because the good fortune of one asylum seeker to come here legally is dependent on another being locked up and forcibly returned to France. Last month, Fessahaye and many others paid more than €1,000 to a smuggler to make the treacherous journey across the sea.“What is so upsetting for us,” says Abdul, a detainee from Afghanistan, “is the unfairness of it all. A few people from my country were on the same boat as me. They were not locked up as I am, but were allowed to go free and are living in a hotel at the moment. It seems it is just a matter of luck whether the Home Office locks you up or sets you free. I keep asking the Home Office how they choose who to detain but they do not answer. All they will say is: ‘You came to the UK illegally in a small boat.’ Some of us started a hunger strike to protest about being locked up here. It is so unfair.”It seems it is just a matter of luck whether the Home Office locks you up or sets you freeThe Home Office has provided limited written communication to some of those detained in the form of cold, one-page removal directions stating: “I am writing to confirm your departure details from the United Kingdom.” Some lawyers have successfully challenged these notices, but not everyone has been able to find a legal representative.An equally unfriendly Home Office Q&A leaflet explains to detainees that once they arrive back in France they will be given temporary accommodation by the French authorities and may be able to apply for asylum in France. It adds that there is “financial assistance” available for those who agree to return to their home countries – something many asylum seekers say would be a death sentence.NGOs working to support immigration detainees say they come from a variety of the world’s conflict zones, including Sudan, Eritrea, Yemen, Afghanistan and Libya. Some were forced to work for the smugglers on their journey, while others were kicked and beaten by them. Some were trafficked, sexually abused and tortured in Libya, have PTSD and say they feel suicidal. An estimated 10 lone children who arrived on small boats were wrongly detained and later set free.View image in fullscreenA group of people are brought into the Border Force compound in Dover, Kent after a small boat incident in the Channel on 9 September.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAWhile France is deemed a safe country, many due to be flown back there say they are fearful because they have experienced beatings and teargas at the hands of the French police. Recently figures from the UK’s far right have been visiting northern France and threatening migrants there.Philippe Sabatier, the deputy public prosecutor in Boulogne-sur-Mer, said: “Local law enforcement agencies have been notified to prevent any disturbances that may be caused by the passage of these people.”Olivia Clark, the executive director of Refugee Legal Support, says that during a recent trip to Calais they spoke with more than 500 asylum seekers about “one in, one out”, with 90% indicating they would not apply for it.“People will continue to take dangerous boat crossings unless they believe there is a viable alternative to reach safety,” she says. “At its core, this ‘one in, one out’ arrangement reduces protection to a numbers game, trading in human lives rather than providing a genuine, safe alternative to dangerous crossings.”Emma Ginn, the director of the charity Medical Justice, says: “The vast majority of our clients detained under this scheme are survivors of torture and trafficking. Some have experienced sexual abuse and slavery. Our independent clinicians have visited clients in immigration removal centres, medically assessing them and finding concerning levels of post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts.”View image in fullscreenThe Home Office is using scheduled Air France flights to remove asylum seekers.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Getty ImagesUnusually for such a high-profile scheme, the Home Office is using a well-known airline – Air France – to remove people on a scheduled flight alongside other passengers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants in the UK and L’Auberge des Migrants in France are urging people to send messages to Air France exhorting it not to fly the asylum seekers back to France.“These deportations are a new step in the externalisation and criminalisation of exile, which transforms the right to asylum into a lottery and puts human lives at risk,” says a spokesperson for L’Auberge des Migrants. “We call on Air France to immediately cease all participation in these deportations. And we call on the French and British authorities to put an end to this cynical trade in human lives.”Failing a sudden volte face, the first deportees could be flown out of Britain on Monday, with more to follow during the week.“I am so stressed about the threat of being sent back to France,” says Hagos, an Eritrean detainee waiting behind bars at Brook House. “I came here to find safety. I never expected to be locked up instead.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationFranceRefugeesEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meaning “much in little”, it has become the motto of this minuscule establishment in theWorcestershiretown of Malvern.This is the world’s smallest commercial theatre with room for 12 people – or 16 with some standing – that has been brought back to life by local residents after falling into disrepair and at risk of demolition.Called theTheatreof Small Convenience, it was once a Victorian toilet and measures just 10 sq metres – the stage itself is a snug 1.5 metres.“Places like this are so rare now,” said Loz Samuels, the theatre’s creative director and co-founder of the community interest company which runs it.“People’s experience of culture and entertainment is so digital and different to what it was. Places where you can come in and it’s so intimate and it’s really special – it’s really important to keep it alive.”View image in fullscreenThe exterior of the theatre in Malvern.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianThe theatre was created in 1997 by Dennis Neale, described as a local legend and eccentric performer who spent 19 years putting on puppetry shows in the space that captivated local children.In its heyday it was a much-loved and unique claim to fame for Malvern, with the theatre entering theGuinness World Recordsin 2002.But after Neale’s retirement in 2017, the building fell into disrepair and was badly damaged by a fire caused by a dehumidifier. With a destroyed roof, damp floor and damaged walls, local residents began to fear it would be lost for ever, especially with talk of a development next door.“The fire really damaged the roof, so water got in and the integrity of the building was really vulnerable. It was quite a major renovation,” said Samuels.Along with local volunteers Jan Birtle and Dibah Farooqui, they acquired the building from the council and raised £17,000 from the local community to help get the renovation off the ground.“It needs replastering, it needed rewiring, it needed a new floor, it needed underfloor heating. There’s obviously no room for heaters,” Samuels said. “We’ve still got the world record, but because we’ve had the plastering and the damp proofing, if there’s another contender we’ve got another couple of inches up our sleeve. Only a tad, but it all counts.”The theatre’s deep blue walls are adorned with a vivid gold constellation – with stars “sponsored” by local residents – while intricate wooden carvings frame the stage.The challenge hasn’t been plain sailing, and Samuels has fears for the long-term future of the theatre. The team were recently rejected for Arts Council funding, and admit that with just 12 seats, making the space financially viable will take some creative thinking.View image in fullscreenA plaque on the building honours Dennis Neale, who still lives locally and has given the rejuvenation project his blessing.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianSet to open its doors in October, the theatre’s first show is Sceptre, a seance-themed immersive show designed specifically for the space. There are plans for a Narnia-style Christmas grotto and even weddings in the future.“It is a challenge to find work that fits in here,” she said. “But I feel like the building creates opportunities, you’ve just got to be imaginative. You can make real sensory experiences because you can control the light. As soon as you step foot in here, you forget the world outside, you could be anywhere.”Neale, who still lives locally, has also given the project his blessing and recorded a message that will be played at the start of future performances.“I think what he did is so quintessentially English and so special,” Samuels said. “He’s really happy, although I think at first he was a bit like, who is this crazy woman who’s suddenly really determined to save the theatre, why would you do that?“I don’t think he could understand why anybody would think it was so important to save.”Samuels is urging performers and artists with original ideas for the space to come forward, and despite some nervousness, is optimistic for the future of the venue.“I feel like it’s a strangely magical place and I just believe that the universe will look after it somehow,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWorcestershireGuinness World RecordsEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The leader makes his or her speech, the commentariat falls upon it, and to anyone half normal reality simply continues, undisturbedMon 15 Sep 2025 11.20 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareConference season has arrived for the big political parties, and every year for the past 20 years, I have attended some, though not all, of it. I always have a lot of complaints, which I used to think were all different but in fact boiled down to the same thing: this pantomime doesn’t mean anything. The leader makes his or her speech, the commentariat falls upon it, more often than not declaring it to have saved them from whatever surge of unpopularity they were engulfed in the week before, and to anyone half normal, reality simply continues, undisturbed. No, Boris Johnson promising to “level up” in 2021 did not address the cost of living crisis.Keir Starmer having a tool-maker dadwith his “eye on the object” (same year) did not make him more relatable or charismatic.There were some years that I thought maybe I was being naive, and the wiser heads were correct – might Tony Blair’s admission of fault, in the vaguest imaginable terms (“I now look my age. You feel yours,”at the Labour conference in 2003), be the decisive turning point when we all learned to stop worrying and love the Iraq war? Nope, it was not.Once in a while, conference goesso catastrophically badlythat it feels mean to comment. So whenTheresa May, in 2017, was beset by a prankster, a persistent cough and letters falling off her meaningless word-salad backdrop, the universe was already plainly so ranged against her that the inevitable lampooning felt like overkill. And yet, fundamentally, the problem was the same: if we think we’re in a world where a speech will make a difference, even to public perception, let alone to livelihoods, we’re dreaming.Around the edges of that, though, there were always things to discover. If you went to the Conservative party conference in 2014, you would probably have been less surprised by their general election victory the following year, when all the pollsters were predicting another hung parliament – the members had a spring in their step, the smart, politically neutral-ish young lobbyists were out in force. Would you have been able to predict anything useful, such as the Brexit referendum that would spin out of that unexpected victory, or the mire it would drag us into for the next decade and counting? Of course not, but what could you have done with that information anyway? Stockpiled roquefort?So this year, much of that remains true. Insiders are intoning solemnly that Starmer really needs to pull a great speech out of his hat if he wants to reverse the sense of doom that clings to him, while outsiders are asking, “A speech sayingwhat, exactly?” Because when you leave aside promises that sound like everyone else’s, take out bland pleas for the nation to unite around its shared values and ignore half-baked attempts at poetry – all those things being tried and tested ways of changing nobody’s mind about anything – what else is left?Other insiders, meanwhile, are speculating minutely about where Kemi Badenoch could possibly go next, rhetorically speaking, in order to put clear blue water between theConservativesand Reform, while at the same time outflanking them to the right and somehow capturing the middle. Outsiders can guess exactly what she is going to say: something horrible about migrants; something baseless about net zero; some other unkind thing, most likely about transgender people. Reform’s conference has already happened, of course, and unfolded exactly as predicted, with outright xenophobia largely camouflaged under calls for the amorphous: freer speech; things to be like they were; change. The Liberal Democrats know who they are and what they stand for, at least, and the Greens’ conference will be livelier and conceivably the most harmonious, given that the new leader Zack Polanski was elected with 85% of the votes.What is really different about this year is how remarkably uninviting either main party – Labour or Conservative – is to watch. Historically, for all the patterns of meaninglessness and bluster, one or other of them was redeemed by either power or challenger energy. This year, power looks like a burden and the challengers look hopelessly lost.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabour conferenceLabourConservative conferenceConservativesGreen partyReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

So what’s different this time and how will it all work?What has been announced?Five new deals, adding to an existing SMR partnership between Rolls-Royce and Virginia-based BWXT. According to the US embassy, the deals are worth a combined $100bn (£73.5bn).View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer hosts representatives of the nuclear industry at a reception at Lancaster House in London to mark the announcement of the new UK-US partnership.Photograph: Alberto Pezzali/ReutersThe most eye-catching project involves the US company X-Energy working with Centrica, the owner of British Gas, to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors (AMRs) in Hartlepool. AMRs, part of a group of reactor designs known as Generation IV, use cutting-edge cooling systems and fuel. The government claims the Hartlepool project could power 1.5m homes, create up to 2,500 jobs and deliver a £40bn economic boost, including £12bn for the north-east.What are the other projects?Alongside Hartlepool, there is an £11bn deal between tech company Holtec (US), energy supplier EDF (France) and the property investor Tritax (UK) for SMRs to power datacentres at theformer Cottam coal-fired power stationin Nottinghamshire. This, the government says, will create “thousands” of high-skilled construction jobs, as well as local long-term roles.Last Energy, from the US, will build a “microreactor” to power the expansion of Dubai-owned DP World’s London Gateway port. The nuclear fuels firm Urenco, which is 33% owned by the UK state, has agreed a £4m deal to supply nuclear fuels to the US market and will also build a new UK facility.Finally, the US companies TerraPower and KBR want to deploy their 345MW Natrium advanced reactors at sites around the UK. Each could create 1,600 jobs during construction and 250 permanent positions.Haven’t we heard all this before?Prime ministers love embracing nuclear power but more plants have been planned than have ever seen in a spade in the ground (see Wylfa on Anglesey).Rishi Sunak backed SMRs in 2023, launching a new public body called Great British Nuclear (GBN),backed by £20bn. GBN came from the imagination of Boris Johnson, who had announced plans, which could be politely called ambitions, foreight new full-scale nuclear power stations.View image in fullscreenHinkley Point C nuclear power station is under construction but has faced delays.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersIn 2014, in an announcement that seems almost unthinkable now, David Cameron’s governmentwelcomed Chinese government investment in Hinkley Point Cin Somerset. Hinkley was originally scheduled to start powering homes in the 2020s but remains delayed, with the latest estimates suggesting it may not come online until 2031.So what’s different?First, there are now examples of new nuclear projects actually starting to move forward. The UKstruck a £38bn dealwith private investors, including Centrica, to build Sizewell C on the coast of Suffolk, earlier this year, afterblocking Chinese involvement this time. Sizewell, like Hinkley, is a full-size power plant.View image in fullscreenThe government struck a £38bn deal with private investors to build Sizewell C.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersMeanwhile, Rolls-Royce’s nuclear plans are also progressing. It wasselected by the UK governmentto build three SMRs earlier this year. It is also selling six to the Czech Republic and has entered the US regulatory process to sell them there too. The factory-built SMRs are far smaller and, in theory, quicker to build than full-scale power stations.The US-UK agreement involves changes to the licensing regime to allow new reactors to move from blueprint to first power more quickly, by fast-tracking design approval. If a reactor has already passed “rigorous” safety checks in one country, that work can be used by the other to support its assessment. The two governments say this will whittle the approval process down from up to four years to as little as two.What are the obstacles?As with Hinkley, nuclear power projects in the UK have been subject to huge cost and time overruns. What’s more, large-scale nuclear build-out will require people with the requisite skills in construction and engineering, industries where UK manpower is thinly spread. Most of the Hinkley workforce is expected to move swiftly over to sister project Sizewell C, raising questions about where new blood will come from.It is not clear what will be done with the waste from an expanded nuclear industry. The price tag for cleaning up the ageing Sellafield nuclear waste dump has alreadysoared above £136bn, while plans for a geological disposal facility an underground waste dump in Cumbria – are also costly, up to £54bn according to a Treasury assessment thatdescribed the plan as “unachievable”.There are also question marks over how quickly new projects could connect to the National Grid, amid an existing backlog of new energy projects waiting to be hooked up.While large nuclear plants are built on the coast, partly to minimise the impact on populated areas in the event of an accident, some of the SMRs – particularly those near datacentres – will be inland. Many people do not want to live next door to a nuclear reactor.Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerEnergyEnergy industryexplainersShareReuse this content"

Allies of alternative leaders are talking up their candidates’ prospects of rescuing the government’s standing.One MP who has so far been loyal to Starmer said: “Downing Street needs to start improving things very quickly, otherwise they are going to lose control of this whole situation.”A Labour official said that the departure of Ovenden – one of the prime minister’s longest-serving and closest allies – would weaken Starmer further.“The more Keir loses people around him, the more people start to realise the problem is not them, but him,” the person said.Starmer accepted Ovenden’s resignation after he was revealed to have exchanged messages with a friend eight years ago in which he jokingly recounted a conversation that had happened at a party the previous evening.In those messages, which are revealed in a forthcoming book about Starmer called The Fraud, Ovenden talked about how those at the party had played a game of “shag, marry, kill” involving Abbott, before describing how they might have sex with her.Abbott called the messages “very unpleasant”, likening them to messages revealed by theMartin Forde inquiryinto bullying, racism and sexism in the Labour party.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “These messages are appalling and unacceptable. As the first black woman to be elected to parliament,Diane Abbottis a trailblazer who has faced horrendous abuse throughout her political career.“These kinds of comments have no place in our politics.”Starmer has long had a difficult relationship with Abbott, with his allies havingtried unsuccessfullyto persuade her to step down before the last election.Ovenden said in a statement: “I am accused of, eight years ago as a junior press officer, sharing with a female colleague the details of a silly conversation that I was party to with other female staff members.”He added: “As an adviser, my duty is to protect the reputation of the prime minister and his government.“Most people could find a private conversation they’ve had in the last decade, whether in the pub or on WhatsApp, that would be distasteful or embarrassing if it were published.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But his immediate departure has caused alarm among some of Starmer’s allies, who say the PM looks increasingly exposed, with his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, one of his few remaining long-term advisers.One Labour official said: “Keir threw away his closest confidant over a trivial comment made eight years ago.”Another said: “Paul was the best brain in government, and without his instincts and intellect battling for the priorities of the voter, this government risks turning inwards.”But even as Starmer tries to turn the agenda to his meetings with Trump, he is also facing further questions over what he knew about Mandelson’s relationship with the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him in Washington.Ministers will be pressed on that question on Tuesday after the Conservatives secured an emergency Commons debate on the Mandelson controversy.The Tories are demanding to know when the prime minister knew about the messages in which Mandelsongave Epstein his effusive backing, even while the financier was facing charges of child sex trafficking.0:51Keir Starmer: 'Had I known then what I know now, I’d have never appointed Mandelson' – videoStarmer told Channel 4 News on Monday: “I wouldn’t have appointed him had I known the nature and extent of the relationship – the fact that he was questioning and challenging [Epstein’s] conviction.”But many MPs are irritated not just by the missteps, which have led to the departure of several key members of staff, but also by the prime minister’s perceived failure to denounce the resurgent hard right.Starmer attempted to rectify that later on Monday, telling Channel 4: “I’m absolutely determined to lead in this fight of our times between renewal, the patriotic cause of the Labour party, and the division and toxic chaos and decline that would come under Reform.”But with events moving quickly, some believe the prime minister may face a challenge before next May’s elections – even before one of his chief rivals, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, has time to find a Commons seat.One Labour source said: “At this rate Wes [Streeting, the health secretary] is going to have to get organised earlier. Things are moving too fast for Andy.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourDiane AbbottnewsShareReuse this content"

On arrival in the UK, the patients and their families have been granted access to NHS treatment, appropriate housing and comprehensive support services for an initial two-year period.They are the first children to be brought to the UK for treatment as part of agovernment operationbeing coordinated by the Foreign Office, the Home Office and the Department of Health and Social Care.Between 30 and 50 young Palestinians are expected to be treated, while two critically ill children and their families arrived inScotlandfor treatment, according to Holyrood.Cooper told the Mirror newspaper at the weekend that “it was a lot of diplomatic work in order to help them actually leave Gaza”.She added: “But that work is under way and I’m determined to make sure that we can do our bit to help those injured families and also to help students get into their courses this autumn.”Neil Gray, the Scottish health secretary, said the Scottish government had committed to supporting the treatment of up to 20 Palestinian youngsters who are expected to arrive in Scotland in the coming weeks.Gray, the SNP MSP for Airdrie & Shotts, said: “This initial support is a small step towards restoring some humanity to the catastrophic situation in Gaza as a result of the Israeli government’s actions.”Gray added the Scottish government had been working closely with the health boards that will be treating patients and the local authorities that will accommodate their families to ensure they have somewhere to live and receive the “essential support they need”.Downing Street is also working to evacuate students with places to study at British universities.Some Palestinian children have been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, a humanitarian initiative founded by a group of senior doctors and healthcare leaders.Since UN-backed global food security experts declared a famine in Gaza City on 22 August, the territory’s health ministry reported that at least 142 people have died from starvation and malnutrition.More than 50,000 children are estimated to have been killed or injured in Gaza by Israeli forces since the attacks by Hamas on 7 October 2023, according to the charity Unicef.Explore more on these topicsGazaChildrenNHSIsrael-Gaza warScotlandYvette CooperMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

When something has gone badly wrong, public servants – from the bobby on the beat to the highest office in the land – will be under a duty to act with honesty and integrity at all times. Anyone who fails to do so faces criminal prosecution.“And it will be supported with a new offence for flagrantly misleading the public, with those found in breach of the law facing up to two years behind bars, along with replacing the current offence of misconduct in public office with two new offences. These are serious punishments for serious wrongdoing.”Under the bill, legal aid will automatically be available to bereaved families at inquests whenever the state is represented by an “army of taxpayer-funded lawyers”, Lammy said.“Those grieving will never again have to pass the hat around to have their voices heard,” he said.Pointing to his own experience of losing a friend in the Grenfell Tower disaster, Lammy said the bill was a tribute to the work of campaigners involved not just in Hillsborough, but also Windrush, the Manchester arena bombing and the Post Office scandal.“I lost a dear friend,Khadija Saye, in Grenfell,” he said. “I know what it is to sit with families whose lives have been torn apart, and to feel the weight of a system that too often meets grief with defensiveness and delay.”TheHillsborough disasterin 1989 during the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the football ground in Sheffield led to the deaths of 97 football fans.Sue Roberts, whose brother Graham was unlawfully killed at Hillsborough, described the bill’s introduction as a “huge step in the right direction” but said the families would be “watching closely to ensure this bill is passed in its entirety and enacted in full.“The government must resist any pressure from those who don’t believe the public deserves to know the truth about when the state fails,” she said.Some families and campaigners are expected to attend Downing Street on Tuesday to mark the bill’s introduction.Lawyers for the Hillsborough families remain concerned that the “duty of candour” offence has been drafted too narrowly, and could let off some public officials who should face the law.The bill only applies to some inquiries. Lawyers for the families have been reassured that the government plans to amend it to cover combined authorities and local authorities.The “duty to assist” definition could also be widened, lawyers said. Officials have promised that other bodies will be covered by the law including the Care Quality Commission, the Health and Safety Executive and official “ombudsman” investigations.Pete Weatherby KC, an architect of the original bill who represents many of the Hillsborough families, told the Guardian that survivors and bereaved families will be closely involved as the bill proceeds through parliament.“This bill is a major step forward,” he said. “It is sufficiently strong to affect culture change so public bodies tell the truth as matter of course rather than be dragged kicking and screaming.“The government has agreed that we will be involved in the process to pass the bill and will be involved in what happens next.”The expansion of legal aid for bereaved families, with non-means tested help and support for inquests, has been welcomed. Julia Waters, the sister of headteacher Ruth Perry who took her own life after an Ofsted report downgraded her school, said her family had been “forced to crowdfund to cover our legal costs at an already emotional and stressful time”.“Hillsborough law will help ensure families like mine are no longer left to fight for truth and accountability on our own – in the hope that those in power can finally be held responsible when things go catastrophically wrong,” she said.Natasha Elcock, from Grenfell United, said: “It has been so easy for public and private agencies to escape accountability and scrutiny. By establishing a duty of candour, Hillsborough Law will prevent this, help us learn from failures and ensure bereaved and survivors are properly supported.”Lobby Akinnola, who lost his father, Femi, early on in the Covid pandemic, said he and others had seen “first-hand how easily the truth is delayed, diluted or denied”, adding that this new bill is “a huge step towards” justice.Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justiceHillsborough disasterDavid LammyLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

In their first trial last year, the defendants had also been convicted of perverting the course of justice, concealing the birth of a child and child cruelty.Sentencing them on Monday, Judge Lucraft KC told them: “It is clear … neither of you gave much or any thought for the care or love for your baby.”The judge said they had displayed “arrogance”, adding: “What you did towards baby Victoria can only be described as neglect; neglect of the gravest and most serious type.‘A relentless, destructive energy’: inside the trial of Constance Marten and Mark GordonRead more“There has been no genuine expression of remorse from either of you.”While he said they had expressed sadness, they had “adopted the stance of trying to blame everyone else”.On Monday, Lucraft, the recorder of London, jailed the pair for 14 years and handed Gordon a further four years on extended licence.Speaking after the trial, DCI Joanna Yorke of the Met police, who led the homicide investigation, said: “The selfish actions of Mark Gordon and Constance Marten resulted in the death of an innocent newborn baby who would have recently had her second birthday and should have had the rest of her life ahead of her.”Jaswant Narwal, the chief crown prosecutor, said the couple had “used different antics to frustrate and delay court proceedings”, adding: “No child should have had its life cut short in this preventable way. I hope today’s sentences provide a sense of justice and comfort to all those affected by this tragic case.”During the sentencing hearing, the judge repeatedly reprimanded Marten and Gordon for their “disruptive” behaviour in the dock as their lawyers were mitigating for them. He threatened to have them removed from the court, and to continue the hearing without them if necessary, labelling their behaviour “disrespectful”.1:31'Where is your child?': police release footage of Constance Marten's arrest – videoJurors in the first trial were not told about Gordon’s violent past, which was partly revealed only in their second trial. Lucraft listed this among aggravating factors when passing sentence.Gordon and Marten spent seven weeks on the run before they were found by police in Brighton, East Sussex.Officers had launched a nationwide hunt after finding the couple’s burnt-out car on a motorway near Bolton, Greater Manchester, on 5 January 2023. In it was evidence that the baby, Victoria, had been born shortly beforehand.The couple travelled across England in taxis with the newborn; eventually ending up in the countryside near Brighton.After a search by police, Victoria’s body was found amid rubbish inside a Lidl bag in a disused shed. Her remains were too badly decomposed to establish the cause of death.The prosecution said she had died from hypothermia in the cold and damp conditions inside the flimsy tent, or was smothered. The defendants claimed their daughter’s death was a tragic accident after Marten fell asleep on her.In 1989, Gordon, then 14, held a woman against her will in Florida for more than four hours, and raped her while armed with a knife and hedge clippers. Within a month, he entered another property and carried out another offence involving aggravated battery.Gordon, who moved with his mother from Birmingham to the US at the age of 12, was sentenced to 40 years in jail and released after 22 years.Jurors in the retrial appeared shaken by the revelations – even though Marten had revealed Gordon’s rape conviction while giving evidence.In 2017, Gordon was convicted of assaulting two female police officers at a maternity unit in Wales, where Marten gave birth to their first child under a fake identity.Jurors were told Marten had been warned by social workers about the risk of falling asleep with a baby lying on her and that a tent was unsuitable.Both defendants gave evidence in their retrial but each cut short their testimony before they could be cross-examined by the prosecution.Marten and Gordon were told they would serve two-thirds of their 14-year custodial terms behind bars. And they were told they would then be released to serve the remaining time on licence. In Gordon’s case, the latter period included the extra four years handed down because of the danger he was deemed to pose.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Moments later, troops stormed in, hoisting the allies’ flags above a “liberated” piece of land consumed by flames.The military drills, part of the major Zapad-2025 military exercises and staged at the Borisov training ground in Belarus, were billed as a defensive response to a notional western invasion – in effect Nato.Zapa, which is the Russian word for “west”, refers to military drills focused on the western theatre.Yet the display of firepower, witnessed during a rare western media visit to the authoritarian state, has stirred unease in European capitals amid mounting regional tensions and fears that Moscow isprobingNato’s defences after Russian drones entered Poland and Romania last week.1:03Russia and Belarus hold joint military drill as regional tensions rise – video report“The exercises, in our view, are unprecedentedly open. We pose no threat to anyone and stand for building a constructive and pragmatic dialogue,” Valery Revenko, a senior Belarusian military official, told reporters after the drills.He added that the drills, due to end on Tuesday, had been scaled down to highlight their defensive nature and were held further from Nato’s borders than originally planned, in what he described as an effort to reduce tensions in easternEurope.Even so, western capitals will be watching closely, mindful that Zapad-2021 gave Vladimir Putin cover to move large formations of troops and equipment westward – many of which, months later, took part in the invasion ofUkraine, including from Belarusian territory.The exercises also underscored a growing rift between Europe and Washington in their approaches to the Kremlin.View image in fullscreenAn operator prepares a drone at a training ground during the joint Russia-Belarus Zapad-2025 military drills near Borisov, Belarus on 15 September.Photograph: Ramil Sitdikov/ReutersView image in fullscreenRussian and Belarusian flags fly at the training ground.Photograph: Ramil Sitdikov/ReutersIn a surprise visit, two US military officials attended Monday’s war games – the first known visit by American representatives to a Russian military drill in years.“The best viewing seats will be provided for you,” the Belarusian defence minister, Viktor Khrenin, told one of the two attache, named as Bryan Shoupe, before the drills.“Thank you for the invitation,” said Shoupe, shaking hands with Khrenin.The US officials, who declined to speak to the Guardian, stood out among military representatives from Russia’s traditional allies – authoritarian states in Africa, as well as China, Myanmar and others.But their presence, swiftly seized on by Russian and Belarusian state media to suggest the drills carried global weight, is likely to heighten Europeanfearsthat Donald Trump is unwilling to take a hard line on Moscow or further isolate the Russian leader.Amid that uncertainty over Washington’s resolve, Poland has responded to the drills by deploying up to 40,000 soldiers to its border with Belarus, while European allies have sentadditionaljets to patrol against possible Russian drone incursions.View image in fullscreenRussian troops load an Iskander missile on to a mobile launcher during Zapad-2025 at an undisclosed location in the Kaliningrad region of Russia.Photograph: APView image in fullscreenA Belarusian Mi-35 attack helicopter flies during the military drills near Borisov.Photograph: Ramil Sitdikov/ReutersWarsaw has also closed its border with Belarus for an indefinite period, dealing a painful economic blow toAlexander Lukashenko, who depends on the route for the transit of Chinese and Russian goods. The move provoked anger in Moscow, which vowed to retaliate.“The Russian government has asked us publicly to reconsider. Well, we would like the Russian government to reconsider sending arsonists and drones into Poland,” Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, told the Guardian in an interview in Kyiv on Saturday.The Zapad-2025 drills are a fraction of the scale of Zapad-2021, which involved up to 200,000 Russian personnel and is now regarded as one of the stress-tests for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.According to the Belarusian defence ministry, about 1,000 Russian troops were taking part alongside 7,000 Belarusian forces – a stark illustration of Moscow’s manpower shortage after the heavy toll of its war in Ukraine. On Monday, only a handful of Russian soldiers were visible on the training grounds.Konrad Muzyka, a military analyst with Rochan Consulting in Poland, said it was difficult to draw firm conclusions from this year’s Zapad drills, as Belarus and Russia had released less information than usual.“One scenario is that Russia doesn’t really have the time to do a proper Zapad exercise this year, with most of its forces engaged in Ukraine,” Muzyka said.But he added that another explanation could be that the sides wanted to “obfuscate what’s happening in Belarus and the scenarios they are practising”.View image in fullscreenBelarus’s defence minister, Viktor Khrenin, at Zapad-2025.Photograph: Ramil Sitdikov/ReutersView image in fullscreenRussia’s deputy defence minister, Yunus-Bek Yevkurov.Photograph: Ramil Sitdikov/ReutersBelarus has been a crucial ally for Russia during the invasion of Ukraine, offering its territory as a launchpad for Moscow’s initial thrust from the north in February 2022 and supplying the Russian army with clothing, gear and equipment.Lukashenko, however, has resisted Kremlin pressure to send his own troops into the conflict – a step that would be deeply unpopular with both the army and the wider population.Still, Belarus’s military has become ever more entwined with Moscow’s.A sweeping security treaty signed in December 2024 further deepened that integration and placed Minsk under Russia’s nuclear umbrella. Lukashenko has since announced that Russia’s Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile will be deployed in Belarus this year.“You could say the Belarusian armed forces are an extension of Russia’s western military district, and you wouldn’t be far from the truth. They cooperate at every level – tactical, operational, strategic. Belarus is essentially a forward-deployed logistics base for Russian forces,” said Muzyka.Military analysts cautioned that it was highly unlikely that Belarus would ever join the fighting in Ukraine, or that Moscow would use its territory to launch a renewed push into Ukraine.“Ukraine has heavily fortified and mined all possible invasion avenues from Belarus,” said Aleksander Alesin, a military analyst in Minsk.“The element of surprise is gone. Meanwhile, Russia’s reserves are stretched out,” Alesin added.For Lukashenko, the exercises come at a delicate moment. Well-practised at hedging between Moscow and the west, the Belarusian leader’s brutalcrackdownon dissent after the rigged 2020 elections has left him a pariah in Europe and pushed him into an increasingly vassal-like relationship with Russia.Sensing a political opportunity, he has in recent months made fresh overtures to Trump’s administration, casting himself as a key channel between Washington and Moscow to end the war in Ukraine.Last week, those efforts appeared to bear fruit when Belarus secured limited US sanctions relief for its national airline after Lukashenkoorderedthe release of more than 50 prisoners, among them a British-Belarusian woman.While Lukashenko claimed small victories on the international stage, few in Belarus seemed interested in the spectacle of the drills at home.In Borisov, the city nearest to the training grounds, residents said they paid little attention to the exercises, voicing instead their hope that the country would be spared direct involvement in the war in Ukraine.View image in fullscreenThe crew of the Arkhangelsk nuclear-powered attack submarine join the Zapad-2025 drills at an undisclosed location in Russia.Photograph: Russian defence ministry press service/EPAView image in fullscreenSoldiers taking part in the exercises at an undisclosed location in Belarus.Photograph: Russian defence ministry press service/EPASince the mass crackdown on dissent, few Belarusians have dared to speak openly to foreign reporters. Yet behind the fear, flashes of anger and frustration at the country’s deepening isolation seep through.Tatyana, a librarian in Borisov, lamented that after the post-election crackdown and the imposition of western sanctions, cooperation with European partners had ended and the shelves of foreign books had thinned. In their place have come shipments of Russian and Chinese titles – from the two countries that help keep Lukashenko’s regime afloat.“I just hope things go back to normal,” she said. “We want to have dialogue with the west again.”Additional reporting by Shaun Walker in KyivExplore more on these topicsBelarusRussiaUkraineAlexander LukashenkoUS foreign policyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The consultant anaesthetist had asked another nursing colleague to monitor the male patient, who was under general anaesthetic, so he could go to the bathroom.Instead, Anjum, a married father of three, went to another operating theatre at the hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne,Greater Manchester, where sexual activity took place with Nurse C on 16 September 2023.A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) hearing was told another nurse at the hospital described seeing Nurse C “with her trousers around her knee area with her underwear on display” and that Dr Anjum was “tying up the cord of his trousers”.Anjum was absent from the operating room for eight minutes and the patient came to no harm.The matter was reported to management and Anjum was dismissed in February 2024 following an internal investigation. Last week he told an MPTS disciplinary tribunal he wanted to resume his career in the UK and relocate with his family after they had since moved to his native Pakistan where he worked as a doctor.Anjum promised there would never be a repeat of a “one-off error of judgment”. Giving evidence, he said: “It was quite shameful, to say the least. I only have myself to blame. I let down everybody, not just my patient and myself but the trust and how it would look.“I let down my colleagues who gave me a lot of respect.”On Monday, the tribunal determined that Anjum “had put his own interests before those of the patient and his colleagues” and the incident involving Nurse C “had the potential to distract Dr Anjum … and he may not have been able to give his full attention to the patient’s care”.The tribunal chair, Rebecca Miller, said his actions, while they did not harm the patient’s safety, were “significant enough to amount to misconduct that was serious”.However, she was satisfied that Anjum was determined not to repeat his past misconduct and considered the risk of repetition to be “very low”.No sanction will be imposed on the doctor and the hearing will reconvene in Manchester on Tuesday to decide whether to issue a warning on Dr Anjum’s registration.Anjum had admitted engaging in sexual activity with Nurse C and that he knew she was “likely to be nearby” when he left his patient. He also admitted his actions had the potential to put his patient at risk.Explore more on these topicsGreater ManchesterDoctorsNHSHealthHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Standing at the centre of Sir Hubert Murray Stadium in the capital of Port Moresby, Amet was overcome by emotion.“That was an exciting, memorable time,” recalled Amet, who would go on to become the chief justice of Papua New Guineaand today serves as the country’s US ambassador.“I don’t think that there were many dry eyes as we lowered the Australian flag and raised ours.”View image in fullscreenPrince Charles at Papua New Guinea Independence Day celebrations, 1975.Photograph: Trudie Hargrave/National Archives of AustraliaBut while Port Moresby celebrated with ceremony and song, another community regarded the new state with suspicion. Hundreds of kilometres away, in the highlands of Tari, local men with axes descended on a government station where the new flag had just been hoisted.“As soon as the PNG flag went up, they didn’t pull the flag down – they chopped the whole bloody pole down,” recalled Chris Warrillow, who worked in Tari under the Australian administration.What began that day in 1975 was not just just the transfer of power from Australia, but the attempted unification of more than 800 language groups under one sovereign Papua New Guinean state. The official line was “unity in diversity,” yet accounts on the ground point to a more fractured transition, some echoes of which are still being felt today. Though the country continues to face deep challenges, including social and economic hardships, many hold on to the promise and power of the moment of independence, fifty years on.The path to independenceAustralia had governed Papua New Guinea for decades when, in 1972, Gough Whitlam pledged on the campaign trail he would begin the transition to self-governance if elected.“We believe it wrong and unnatural that a nation like Australia should continue to run a colony,”Whitlam said weeks before he was voted into power.Once in power, Whitlam moved swiftly, granting PNG self-governance the following year and cementing a timeline for full independence by 1975.View image in fullscreenGough Whitlam inspecting guard of honour at Papua New Guinea Independence Day celebrations, 1975.Photograph: National Archives of AustraliaIn the 1970s, Australian officials held most senior positions in government, law, healthcare and education across the country – positions that were being handed over to local Papua New Guineans under the self-governance process.While many of the educated class in the Port Moresby supported self-government, others in the provinces across PNG feared independence as another form of subjugation – by unfamiliar neighbours, in languages they didn’t speak, under a system that was foreign to theirs.Amet was student council president at the University of Papua New Guinea, representing what he called PNG’s “urban educated elite” who saw themselves as the future leaders of the independent state.“We were all excited about self-government and then independence, which was obviously distinct from our elders and many of our citizens in our provinces,” he said.Outside the capital, some tribal leaders supported independence too and saw it as a way to reclaim authority over their customary land.In parts of PNG, some groups had long resisted Australian rule. They refused to pay taxes, demanding greater autonomy, and calling for early independence. That anger occasionally turned violent, like in 1971when a senior Australian administrator was murderedby tribal leaders wanting to reclaim authority over their customary land.Yet for most Australians working in PNG, the experience was different. Many felt broadly welcomed in the communities where they worked. Young patrol officers – known askiaps –fulfilling the roles of police officers, and tax collectors, among other things, in remote areas.Deryck Thompson, who in 1972 was part of the last intake of Australians to work as patrol officers in PNG, also took part in political education. He said the work was easier in coastal villages in the south-west of PNG where people had more exposure to foreigners. There, Thompson would use the analogy of PNG and Australia being like two canoes tied together, whose ropes would soon be cut sothat PNGcould be free to travel independently.View image in fullscreenImage taking during a 1971 ALP delegation to Papua New Guinea.Photograph: Mick Young/Whitlam Institute“Most local people hadn’t been out of their villages or that immediate area, and so they had really no understanding of what it would mean for the country to be independent,” Thompson said.“They were really focusing on a day-to-day subsistenceexistence, and didn’t have time to sit down and discuss what may or may not happen in the outside world.”There were concerns among some Australian administrators that they didn’t have time to prepare PNG’s remote communities for a future as part of a sovereign nation“It was all a mad, last minute political education,” Warrillow said. “We were brainwashing, ‘You are getting [independence], you will have it, like it or not.’”When independence came, most of the Australians working in PNG returned home, vacating the thousands of public posts, though some would remain as expatriates in the new country.View image in fullscreenImage taken during the 1971 ALP Delegation to Papua New Guinea.Photograph: Mick Young/Whitlam InstituteThere was great hope for PNG new leaders in the years after those celebrations. But for many who lived through that moment, the country they imagined is yet to materialise, even 50 years on.Terry Siik, who lives in Gerehu, was a teenager in 1975 and recalls standing with thousands of others to watch the flag-raising ceremony.“I remember the cold air and the wind in the trees, when the flag rose, it felt like we were all lifted into a new future,” Siik says. He says life was simpler then, with “no fear on the streets.”“We were poor but we had hope. We believed independence would bring a better life,” the 66-year-old says.Since 1975, PNG’s population has more than quadrupled, though employment opportunities haven’t kept pace. Rates of illiteracy, malnutrition and preventable disease also remain widespread, while thevast majority of citizenssee government corruption as a problem.“They are struggling, whereas we were privileged to have jobs that we could just go into as we chose,” Amet said.In Geheru, Siik says more than 30 people live in his small house and his children can’t move out as housing is too expensive.“We dreamed of a better future for them, but now I wonder, was it worth it?”Still, every Independence day he raises the flag outside his home.“I raise it not because everything is perfect, but because of the dream we had back in 1975 and the hope that one day our leaders will remember what it means.”Rebecca Bush contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsPacific islandsPNG independence: 50 years onPapua New GuineaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This truism is part of the message and the power of theGazaBiennale, which is currently working to exhibit the art of dozens ofPalestiniansaround the world – including inNew York City, where the abolitionist arts non-profit Recess hosts an exhibition of work from more than 25 of these artists.“They are artists, they need to create art,” said the Biennale organizers, who requested to be identified as the Forbidden Museum. “We need to help artists stand up for themselves with their skills. Just because you are an artist in the middle of a genocide doesn’t mean you don’t have anything to do.”Part of the conception of theGazaBiennale is the notion of displacement – due to the ongoing war, it is not possible to host the Biennale in Gaza, nor is it possible to transport the artwork to places around the world in order to exhibit it. So the organizers have had to find ways to showing the work in displaced formats.‘Restoring humanity’: Paris exhibition showcases 5,000 years of history in GazaRead moreAs co-director of Recess Lindsay Harris put it, the Gaza Biennale reinvents the concept of a biennale to make it applicable to Gaza, which is currently under blockade and being devastated by relentless warfare. “In a biennale, everybody comes to one location to experience the world, but here it’s the world experiencing one location, Gaza.”Work from the Gaza Biennale has been shown in places such as Edinburgh, Valencia, London and Padua, with current plans for upcoming showings in Istanbul, Athens, Sarajevo, Berlin and Toronto, among others.“We discussed with each artist that we didn’t know how their work is going to be exhibited,” said the Forbidden Museum. “We don’t know exactly how we’re going to reinvent it, recreate it – not make a copy – so that the work can exist in this ‘displaced state.’”View image in fullscreenAshraf Sahweil – Remains of Waiting (A Branch). (2025).Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and the Gaza BiennaleMany of the artists participating in the Biennale have endured devastating losses – according to the show organizers, roughly three-quarters of the artists in the show have seen the destruction of all of their prior artwork and have had to effectively start over during the war. “We’re dealing with artists who have lost their entire life’s work,” said the Forbidden Museum. “Everything is gone. What does it mean to create a work in that situation? These artists found the strength to start from scratch again from nowhere.”‘My work is a scream for help’: Gaza’s artists document life under fireRead moreThe artists describe their practice as a way of sustaining themselves through the unthinkable. Their work largely deals with the day to day realities of living in a brutal warzone in which civilian casualties have been estimated as high as 83% of the total deaths.“During the war, art became a means of survival for me,” said Murad Al-Assar via a translator. “Through painting, I was able to release my pain and distress, transforming fear into images that tell our stories. The experience taught me that painting is not just an aesthetic space, but a testimony to our lives and a means of conveying our voice to the world.”Al-Assar creates in conjunction with children, integrating their own art creation into his process in order to see the world through their eyes. This has allowed him to work with a “new energy”. “Their innocence and simplicity allow me to see the world from a clearer and more honest perspective,” he said. “Their spontaneous drawings open new doors of expression for me and inspire me to reconnect with art as a space for play and dreaming, not just as a tool for documentation.”View image in fullscreenMurad Al-Assar – Noise of Death (2025).Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and the Gaza Biennale.Another participating artist, Tasneem Shatat, shared her view that the creation of art has been vital to her survival. “I see art as a form of psychological therapy that teaches you how to deal with or at least escape the terrible reality we are living in,” she stated, via a translator. “Art does not reduce pain, but it allows you to know how to use it in your own way to either get out of your situation, be patient, meditate or heal a little, even if the situation is one shock after another.”Shatat sees her artistic practice as creating a “living archive in Gaza” where she collects the stories of other Palestinians that she has encountered along the way. “It is an artwork in the form of a book that contains an archive of the memories of displaced people and their reality, which I archived for history.”Harris explained that in order to exhibit the artwork in the Biennale, she and her team came up with the means of reinventing the art in its displaced form. For A Tent on the Road, a mixed media collage made by Maysa Yousef, she chose to create a print in order to best represent the many different textures present in the original. “She’s looking at her own displacement across multiple sites and what it means to recreate home within a tent,” said Harris, “How do you recreate home again and again and again? I think we all do that, especially here inNew York.”View image in fullscreenMaysa Yousef – A Tent on the Road (2024).Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and the Gaza BiennaleThe idea for the Biennale was sparked by a simple gesture – a Palestinian woman approached the organizers of the Forbidden Museum with the desire to create art. At first, the Forbidden Museum was taken aback by such a gesture. “We were shocked that there was a young lady who’d like to be an artist now,” they said.The Forbidden Museum eventually helped this woman set up a residency and begin to create art, and through that process they began to evolve the idea of seeing what art was being made in Gaza and how it could be shared with the outside world. “We were looking for a big event to join, but we never thought we would be the big event,” they said. “This is important within the history of art, that there are people in Gaza creating art now, that they are encouraging each other and sharing their work, that they are interested in being seen and that their exhibitions could somehow break the blockade and siege.”For the Forbidden Museum, the act of letting the world see that art is being made in Gaza is extremely powerful. It gives a voice to those who have been radically disempowered, letting them speak on their own terms and in their own voice. “It’s about how we can affect others, how we can let people see there are artists in Gaza making art now,” they said. “It’s about those artists who feel amazing when someone hears them. They might be done tomorrow, so they need to be heard.”The Gaza Biennale is now on display at Recess in Brooklyn until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsExhibitionsArtGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesNew YorkPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) visits his “mind palace” to figure out how he and his friend/minion John Watson (Martin Freeman) got drugged. Words, phrases and images float around his head, and he moves them around with his hands.“It’s a memory technique,” Watson explains to a confused onlooker. “You plot a map of a location – it doesn’t have to be a real place – and then you deposit memories there.” Theoretically, he says, you can never forget anything, he says: “All you have to do is find your way back to it.”The scene is ridiculous. It’sbecomeameme. It’s also mostly nonsense. “This seems more like run-of-the-mill free association,” says Dr Nicole Long, associate professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, when I send her a clip.But the mind palace is a real mnemonic device, and Watson’s description is fairly accurate, says Long. More commonly known as a “memory palace”, or, in academic circles, the method of loci, the techniquedates backto ancient Greece. And it’s still widely used: onestudyfound that nine out of 10 “superior memorists” use the method of loci.I am decidedly not a superior memorist – one with a “remarkably retentive memory”, according to theCollins dictionary. I often feel as if I am starting every day afresh, like a newborn babe. Information enters my brain and then sizzles into nothingness, like water evaporating from a hot pan. Friends bring up people or events from the past, and I smile blankly, with no idea what they’re talking about. If a task or plan is not immediately slotted into the “to-do list” on my phone, it is lost forever.So, I asked experts how memory palaces really work, and tried to build my own.What is a memory palace?As John Watson said in Sherlock, invoking a memory palace involves picturing some structure or place in your mind, and linking items you want to remember with specific locations around that place, Long explains.“The most classic version is rooms in your home,” she says. Say you want to memorize a list of words, for example. Place each of those words in a different room and think about each item in each place, says Long. For instance, to remember the last 10 winners of the Academy Award for best actress, you could picture Mikey Madison at your front door, Emma Stone in your living room, Michelle Yeoh in your kitchen, and so on.What is ‘executive dysfunction’ and how do you overcome it?Read moreTo remember the words, picture yourself walking through your home and seeing each thing in its specific location.What kind of information can you store in a memory palace?The method of loci doesn’t work for all information. It’s best for memorizing simple, discrete bits of data, Long says, like numbers or words.“For more complicated memories, it is harder to use that as a strategy,” she says. “If you are in the market to buy a house and you go see a bunch of houses, it would start to get weird if you associated each house with a different room in your house. There would be a lot of interference.”I decide I’m going to memorize the first 20 digits of pi. Friends ask me if this is the most practical information to memorize. When will I use it? They’re going to feel pretty silly someday when a stranger stops us on the street and asks if we can recite the first 20 digits of pi.How do I build a memory palace?Although the Sherlock depiction makes it sound like you build one vast, glittering mind palace in which to store all of your memories, that’s not quite how it works.If you’re trying to memorize different sets of information, it’s helpful to imagine different locations rather than trying to cram all the data into the nooks and crannies of your studio apartment.“If you walk into one room and you’re queuing five items, that’s hard because you have to disambiguate them and it gets confusing,” says Long.To learn more, I went to the pros. Vishvaa Rajakumar, an Indian college student who won the 2025MemoryLeague world championship, told me over email that he doesn’t always picture the same place when storing information. “It could be any location that comes to my mind at that moment,” he says.Sometimes, he doesn’t even picture places. “For numbers, I give them life by creating images,” he says. “9,356 means Michael Jackson watching TV, while 0812 means Alex Mullen [a memory athlete] eating ice cream.”Currently, Rajakumar’s record for memorizing 80 random digits is 13.41 seconds. “I can also memorize 180 digits in one minute, and over 360 digits in about three minutes,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the front door, I picture 3.14159; on the kitchen island, 265; on the stove, 358; in my sink, 979; on my bedroom door, 323; on the couch, 846.It takes me about two minutes to cement the images of the digits in my mind. “Do you want to hear me recite the first 20 digits of pi?” I ask everyone I talk to that day. And several days after that.None are as impressed as I’d hoped, but I find it satisfying. Also, none of them check whether I’m right, so if I’m wrong, no one would know. Once, reeling through the numbers, I realize I have been saying “256” instead of “265”, but otherwise it seems to have stuck.Why does it work?“The short answer is, we don’t know,” says Long.One theory is that in placing information in a memory palace, we are paying special attention to it and therefore are more likely to remember.“Just thinking about strategies for trying to remember something is going to help you remember better than just passively letting things wash over you,” Long explains.But there might be more to it than that. The method of loci is uniquely suited to capitalize on how the brain works. One of the primary areas of the brain responsible for memory is the hippocampus, says Long. “The two things the hippocampus loves to do above everything else is spatial navigation and associations,” she says. So by using spatial navigation to associate a place and an item, we are letting the hippocampus do what it does best.Can memory palaces improve your overall memory?“The jury’s still out on that,” Long says. “I think the answer is that it can’t hurt.”Is memorizing the first 20 digits ofpi really that impressive?Maybe not, but remember what I said about my terrible memory? It felt like a gargantuan achievement to me, someone who regularly forgets the most important item on a shopping list.Still, to test myself further, I used a random word generator to come up with 12 words for me to memorize: weakness, administration, council, protest, college, anniversary, sausage, genetic, growth, gap, bring, isolation.I mentally placed these words around my parents’ apartment, which took about a minute. In two minutes, I had them memorized. I tested myself several times throughout the day, and wondered how long I would associate the sconces in my parents’ dining room with the words “college” and “anniversary”.I’ve been strolling through this list a couple of times a day, and can remember each and every one. How is that useful, you might ask? Well, you’re going to feel pretty silly when a stranger stops me on the street and asks me to say exactly those 12 words.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyMemoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In this 1930 painting, lent by the Musée Picasso in Paris, a body with no defined gender contorts into an insoluble puzzle, a leg sprouting above its anus, the head, eyes closed, bulging where genitals might be, the other leg standing on the ground balanced by an arm whose hand functions as a foot while the other arm, fist clenched, bends like a tail. In just this way, Picasso turned art inside out and upside down, twisted it unrecognisably, yet made it all the more compelling, human and passionate.Born into a Europe of realistic sculptures and perspective pictures, he blew up those conventions, put them back together, then smashed them again, and a few times more. It’s hard not to be awed by his achievements, his turmoil of creative energy, the scale of his artistic breakthroughs, althoughTate Moderntries its best. Theatre Picasso starts with coughing noises and references to gender and artistic borrowing. But those concerns go nowhere, vanishing in what becomes – almost despite itself – a riotous celebration of his genius.View image in fullscreenTwisted reality … The Acrobat, 1930.Photograph: © RMN-Grand Palais (Musée national Picasso-Paris) / Adrien Didierjean/© Succession Picasso/DACS, London 2025.It breaks Picasso up, as he broke up what he saw. There is no chronology or historical context. A piece of film shot by Man Ray of Picasso in a wig as Carmen – a holiday movie shot just after he’d painted Guernica – is followed by a selection of much later “obscene” images. In one of them, The Kiss, a man and woman give it a lot of tongue, practically eating each other, trying to get inside each another. In the same way, Picasso’s art wants to swallow the entire physical world. You can feel the fleshy wetness in your own mouth. He rejects realism to make you taste the real.An artist who makes kissing look as filthy as this is hardly going to hold back when it comes to the nude. His 1968 painting Nude Woman with Necklace gets a spotlit wall to itself and a wall text drawing attention to his possessive depictions of women. As if we needed telling. In this blue-green tinted painting, we can see the model’s vulva and anus simultaneously as she fingers the necklace against her breasts. The critique misfires. Picasso was in his late 80s when he painted this, its rawness and anger as much to do with death as with sex. There is a pathos in his determination to go one better than Dylan Thomas and rage, rage against the dying of desire.Death raises its hollow-eyed head insistently from this point in the exhibition. Picasso’s 1952 painting Goat’s Skull, Bottle and Candle is a memento mori that makes you glad to be alive. It’s a painting with the sharp lines of a drawing. The canvas is broken up into white, grey and black disharmonious lozenges, the skull delineated in harsh sections with crystalline force to make you see and feel what he saw on the table in front of him, fresh from the butcher, starting to attract flies.View image in fullscreenCrystalline force … Tapestry Le Minotaure 1935.Photograph: François Fernandez/© Succession Picasso/DACS, London 2025.Death comes in the afternoon in a nearby 1960 drawing, in wet flowing black ink, of acorrida, a bullfight. A man on a horse has stuck his lance into the mighty bull that lowers its head as if in a willing self-sacrifice. Theatre Picasso claims to view the artist as “performative”, setting his works in a dark stage-like space, on theatre flats, with spotlights and mood music. The gimmick’s real effect is to illumine his Spanishness. (Cue castanets.) From his unlikely drag act as Carmen to this heartbreaking bullfight scene, the country he left as a young artist haunts the show just as its suffering haunted him.In his 1937 comic strip The Dream and Lie of Franco, the fascist leader in the Spanish civil war is a genuinely obscene Don Quixote, his eyes on phallic stalks protruding from a hairy pig’s arse of a face as he squares up to a mighty bull representing the Spanish workers. As his violence becomes crueller, a woman flees a burning house with her dead baby in her arms, a timeless, devastating image of war.Close by is Tate’s Weeping Woman, the great painting he did in 1937 alongside Guernica. You can see the Luftwaffe bombers reflected in her eyes. What you notice in front of the original here is how he added a stroke of blue over one plane, just in case it was too strident. So Picasso, tough guy artist, comes courageously close to bathos in this painting. As this woman weeps, her hair is a flowing river of hope while a bee feasts on her tears. Some good must come of the horror.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is he even figurative? He is the inventor (with Braque) of abstraction and collage. In his early cubist art, there is no sex or death – just an eye engrossed by the small stuff of reality in which it sees infinities. You are brought back to basics by the dots of grapes in Bowl of Fruit, Violin and Bottle from 1913. So much beauty, so much mystery. It is because Picasso loves the little good things so much that he can face modernity’s horrors without despair.

Unlike other manufacturers, all eligibleAppledevices will be able to download and install the update the moment it is released rather than in a staggered fashion.Which devices can get it?All Apple smartphones from2019’s iPhone 11or newer can install iOS 26. All tablets from the2018 iPad Proor 2019 iPad Air (3rd gen), iPad mini (5th gen) oriPad (8th gen)and newer can install iPadOS 26. All Apple Watches from the2020’s Series 6or newer can install watchOS 26. AllMacBook Airs from 2020, 16in MacBook Pros from 2019, 13in MacBook Pros from 2020, Mac minis from 2020, iMacs from 2020, Mac Studios from 2022 and the 2019 Mac Pro or later can install macOS 26 Tahoe.How do I get it?Open the Settings app on an iPhone or iPad then navigate to General >SoftwareUpdate. Tap install if available to download, verify and then reboot to finish. You can also install the update using a Mac or iTunes on a Windows computer.WatchOS 26 requires an iPhone 11 or later to be runningiOS26 first. Then open the Watch app on the phone and navigate to General > Software Update to begin the installation. You will need to put the smartwatch on its charger to complete the update.Macs are updated in System Settings, navigate to General > Software Update.How much will it cost?The updates are free from Apple. If you are being asked to pay for an update it is a scam.What happened to iOS 19 to 25?Apple has switched to a new year-based naming format for its software. That means iOS 18 and others that were released in September 2024 for the 2024-2025 period are being replaced with iOS 26 et al for 2025-2026. It’s a bit like sports seasons now.Liquid Glass everywhereAll of Apple’s operating systems now sport the same semi-translucent design that looks a little like frosted glass bubbles floating above a flat background, bringing the depth-based interface from theVision Pro headsetto the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac. Icons, notification banners, buttons and menus are more rounded with a sheen to them that reacts to movement, allowing you to partly see through them to your wallpaper, app or content beneath.iOS 26View image in fullscreenThe Liquid Glass look for the home screen and icons is one of the biggest changes for iOS in many years.Composite: AppleThe Liquid Glass redesign has changed the shape and look of the icons and widgets on the home screen. In addition to the reworked standard app icons, you can now turn them all colourless and translucent, tint them with your choice of colour or use a dark version of the original icon.Notifications and other elements now bounce into view from the top of the screen. Widgets display at the bottom of the lockscreen and the clock can dynamically scale in size depending on how many notifications take up the display.Dynamic and hiding buttonsVarious buttons now shrink away when you don’t interact with them. For example, the camera app has been streamlined to hide additional modes behind a slider or big pop-up menus. The address bar and navigation buttons in Safari now condense down to a small button at the bottom of the screen as you scroll. To get to your tabs and controls you need to swipe the address bar button upwards or press the three-dot button.Filter spam more easilyView image in fullscreenImproved spam filtering is now part of the phone and messaging apps.Composite: AppleThe phone app can automatically screen calls from unknown numbers with the iPhone answering and asking for their name and reason for calling before alerting you so you can decide not to pick up. Messages can now screen texts from new senders and detect spam, filtering them out to separate inboxes. The phone app can also wait on hold for you until a customer services agent picks up and is ready to speak to you.The phone app, FaceTime and messages now all have live translation built in too.Games appA new Games app acts as the home for gaming on the iPhone. It contains your games library, highlights what your friends are playing and replaces Game Centre for tracking achievements, competitions and other gaming events.iPadOS 26View image in fullscreeniPadOS 26 marks a huge upgrade for multitasking on the iPad, bringing it more into line with macOS.Composite: AppleThe iPad gets the same visual redesign as the iPhone with clear icons and hiding buttons, but with more dramatic changes to the wayiPadOS 26works thanks to new multitasking capabilities designed for those that use an iPad as a computer replacement.Mac-like menu bar and full windowingView image in fullscreenThe familiar macOS menu bar is now on the iPad.Composite: AppleOne big new addition to theiPadis the menu bar and window management abilities from the Mac. Swipe down from the centre of the top of the screen in an app to reveal its menu bar with all of the various functions, including the familiar settings, file, edit, view, window and help menus from the Mac.It also has Apple’s traditional red, yellow and green three-dot menu for closing, minimising, shrinking or expanding the window. Press and hold the buttons to reveal tiling and moving controls, just like a Mac, or manually resize and move the window to any position you’d like. Swipe up and hold for Exposé, flick an app to the left or right to snap it to the side of the screen, or flick it up to go full screen.You can open multiple windows and have them overlap, tile them side-by-side or just have a mess with the home screen acting like the desktop on a Mac.Preview and Files appThe Files app has been revamped to make it easier to manage documents and files on your iPad, including being able to set the default app for opening particular file types as you would on a computer. Folders such as Downloads or Documents can be added directly to the Dock for easier access.The Mac’s Preview app has been brought to the iPad, which can handle PDFs, images and various other documents, allowing you to view, edit or mark them up with an Apple Pencil.watchOS 26View image in fullscreenWatchOS 26 improves the workout experience and adds most of the new features from iOS 26.Composite: AppleThe glass-like design of the iPhone is even more apparent on theApple Watchwith notification bubbles overlaid on top of the watch face, floating buttons in apps and a softer look to the smart stack of widgets.Workout BuddyApple’s new chatbot for fitness is Workout Buddy, which can talk to you, offering advice and encouragement while exercising similar to an Apple Fitness+ coach. It flags when you’ve hit certain milestones, goals, pace or thresholds during activities, such as a faster last kilometre, and then recaps your workout at the end. It works over Bluetooth headphones connected to the watch and needs an iPhone 15 Pro or later phone nearby.The best iPhones in 2025: which Apple smartphone is right for you, according to our expertRead moreSleep scores and high blood pressure alertsThe sleep app now generates sleep scores each morning as a one-glance look at how well you slept. For Series 9 or Ultra 2 or later watches, a new blood pressure feature will notify you if it detects signs of hypertension over the last 30-day period.Wrist flickApple has also added a great new gesture to the touch-free gestures available on newer Watches. Turn your wrist quickly away from you and back to dismiss notifications, alarms and other alerts. It joins the double-tap gesture as handy ways to clear things or use the watch without touching it.New watch facesView image in fullscreenThere are various new and revamped watch faces to choose from as part of watchOS 26.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThree new watch faces have been added. Flow is a large digital face that uses the Liquid Glass design to change colour and react to movement. Exactograph separates hours, minutes and seconds into their own analogue dials in various open or closed forms. The Ultra-exclusive Waypoint encircles the time with a live compass pointing to various landmarks and points of interest. A revamped Photos face is also available with floating numerals.macOS 26 TahoeView image in fullscreenMacOS 26 Tahoe incorporates the same Liquid Glass design elements.Composite: AppleMacOS gets most of the new features and design changes made to the iPhone and iPad, including more rounded window corners and glass-like effects.Phone appView image in fullscreenThe phone app allows you to make, take and review calls without your phone.Composite: AppleApple has brought the full Phone app to the Mac for making calls through wifi calling and the connected iPhone. It shows recent calls, voicemails, contacts and supports the new call screening and hold assist features from the iPhone.Live activities such as sports scores or delivery apps from the iPhone now appear in the menu bar on the Mac.SpotlightActions have now been integrated into the Spotlight search system, which allows you to send messages and emails, create notes, add reminders and other actions straight from the search bar. You can now filter files by type, list them together, find documents on third-party cloud services and browse through apps, files, clipboard history and other bits instead of searching.Explore more on these topicsAppleSoftwareiPhoneiOSiPadTablet computersSmartphonesnewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands of Liverpool fans set out for Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, full of excitement for the FA Cup semi-final. Ninety-five of themnever came home. Two more died of their injuries years later. The terrible images from the ground still haunt us today.What happened on the day of the disaster was appalling enough. But what came afterwards was a national disgrace. The authorities closed ranks to cover up their own failings – concerned more with protecting their own reputations than the public they were supposed to serve. And families, who had already lost everything, wereforced to watch onas their loved ones were smeared and blamed for their own deaths.At the first inquest, senior police officers were flanked by an army of taxpayer-funded lawyers, while the families scraped together what they couldfor a single barrister– all the might of the state against ordinary people, raw with grief. And it was only after decades of struggle that further inquests finally confirmed what the families had always known: that the 97 wereunlawfully killedand bore no responsibility for the disaster. We can never allow this to happen again.View image in fullscreenFrom second left: David Lammy, justice minister Alex Davies-Jones and attorney general Lord Richard Hermer lay wreaths at the Hillsborough memorial at Anfield, Liverpool, 15 September 2025.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAOn Monday, inLiverpool, it was an honour and a privilege to meet the Hillsborough families. I was deeply moved by their dignity, resolve and, above all, selflessness in ensuring that no others suffer as they have.For 36 years they havefought for justice, and so often in the face of hostility and indifference. And it is because of their strength that this government will now deliver something that should have been done long ago: a Hillsborough law.This law will bring about the cultural change that so many have campaigned for. It includes a new professional and legal duty of candour. When something has gone badly wrong, public servants – from the bobby on the beat to the highest office in the land – will be under a duty to act with honesty and integrity at all times. Anyone who fails to do so will face criminal prosecution.And it will be supported with a new offence for flagrantly misleading the public, with those found in breach of the law facing up to two years behind bars, along with replacing the current offence of misconduct in public office with two new offences. These are serious punishments for serious wrongdoing, and are no less than victims and their families should expect.And, learning the lessons of Hillsborough, and other tragedies since, we will transform the experience of families at inquests. For the first time, legal aid will automatically be available to bereaved families at inquests whenever the state is represented – so those grieving will never again have to pass the hat around to have their voices heard.View image in fullscreenA silent march, in 2022, to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianWhile this government is bringing forward the Hillsborough law, the credit is not ours. It belongs to the families of the 97, whose courage and determination, in the face of so much adversity, has never faltered. And it belongs to the families and communities scarred by other disasters and scandals, who have fought with the same persistence for accountability: Grenfell, the Manchester Arena bombing, Windrush, the Horizon scandal, and for everyone betrayed by the institutions meant to protect them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If we are to offer any hope to the children of austerity, the next few weeks will be decisiveMon 15 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareRun-down housing estates in Britain’s former industrial heartlands remind us of the poverty described by George Orwell in The Road to Wigan Pier in 1937 – but these days there is no Orwell to chronicle what the arithmetic of deprivation means for families condemned to lives of poverty.Millions of children, as the children’s commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza,told us this summer, are faring very badly, living in “almost Dickensian levels of poverty”. And what she calls the striking awareness children have of being poor requires us to find a modern-day Dickens to hear their voices.For the past two years – and from my experience of working with a new charity, Multibanks UK, which complements food banks by offering clothing, bedding, hygiene goods and baby goods for families in need – I, like the children’s commissioner, have been seeing the hidden injuries of poverty. It’s not only the shortage of basic essentials asfood prices risefar faster than wages and child benefits. It’s the totality of the conditions in which so many of the generation I call austerity’s children – young people born into poverty in the Tory years – are living: homes without heating, bedrooms without beds, kitchens without kitchen utensils, floors without coverings and even toilets without toilet rolls.For many it is much worse: damp mouldy rooms, outside toilets and no kitchen table to eat at or write up their school work on, only a cold floor. “In our kitchen there’s loads of holes that rats come through at night and sometimes they bite through our walls,” a girl of seven said in thechildren’s commissioner’s report. And for the nearly 170,000homeless childrenin England, there is no stability: entire families are being housed in cramped temporary accommodation on top of each other. “I’ve moved houses seven times,” a 10-year-old girl reported.It is the huge increase in the number of children in deep abject poverty that should worry us most. These children are living in families whose income is less than 50% of the median, the government’s own baseline for absolute poverty. It is difficult to see how we can meet themost recent government target– getting 75% of five-year-old children ready for school by 2028 – if we cannot lift these children up. As the Trussell Trusthas just shown, the inequities of the two-child benefit cap mean a family with three or more children is twice as likely to call on food banks for emergency help. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, one million children aredestitute or near-destitute, usually going without three or more essentials – food, clothes, toiletries and a roof above their heads.But poverty now runs even deeper, and hits children even harder, than this. I grew up in a town where I could see poverty in slum houses, the prefabs and the estates that were flooded most years as waves crashed over the harbour walls. But that did not prepare me for what I see now – the anguish of parents, unable to cope, some surrendering their children into care because they know they cannot provide for them; and, above all, the humiliations children suffer when they go without, the ostracisation they experience at school, shunned for being poor. Their poverty is not their fault, but still they feel shame.This summer,up to 3 million childrenwill have been skipping meals, while more than 2 million households willrarely have known the benefitof fresh food or hot food at home. “Mum would cry every time she was going to pay the bills,” reported a boy of 16. Another child told her younger brother to stop asking for toys, and explained how for three years she had been holding off asking for trainers. “I used to play the violin until it broke,” a girl told the commissioner. Another teenager I spoke with told me about having to share football boots with his brother, each missing training once a fortnight until they both grew out of the boots and neither could join in football practice at all.The pain of these children may be invisible to most of us, but children have a “hyper-awareness” of what their poverty means and how different they are from the other kids at school. “A lot of us who were on free school meals used to get bullied for it,” reported a teenage girl. But even worse are their stories of being humiliated because they don’t have the shoes or kit that their fellow pupils are wearing, and how they are shunned because they don’t use soap, shampoo and toothpaste.Children themselves do not talk about “poverty” as such, the commissioner reported. Instead, they talk about living without food and furnishings in insecure, crowded, even unsafe houses, like the eight-year-old boy who reported “there’s stuff like robbing and sometimes there’s drunk people and stabbing”.For most of my life, the tide of poverty had been turned back in one way or another.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is time to do more than chronicle this pain as Dickens and Orwell did. The next few weeks are decisive. Today, actor David Tennant will launch an appeal to end the suffering of millions of Britain’s children. Hope for our poorest children lies in the child poverty review’s recommendations and November’s budget: to fairly taxthe excess profits of gambling, and if more money is needed to remove some of the interest rate subsidy enjoyed by commercial banks when they deposit money at the Bank of England. That would be the first step, stopping child poverty’s inexorable rise by taking an initial 500,000 out of poverty and by relieving the sufferings of another 900,000.The party conference season and the Labour deputy leadership hustings must now become platforms for an urgent discussion on how we end the biggest cause of social division in Britain today. By our commitment to social justice, our country can reaffirm that we will never lose sight of our moral compass.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthOpinionPovertyUK cost of living crisisChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

Plenty of conspiracy theories, some of which have never been put to rest, were floated and debated. But the difference between what happened then and what we are seeing now is that, in the aftermath of those violent deaths, there was a sense of shared grief, of national mourning. Those tragedies seemed to bring us, as a country, closer together in our shock and sorrow.Obviously, tha is quite unlike what is occurring today, when the president has publicly declared that he “couldn’t care less” about healing the divisions plaguing and weakening our society. The instinctive and widespread response to Kirk’s death has been to demonize and blame a perceived enemy.Donald Trump, Stephen Miller and their minions were quick to accuse the “lunatic radical left”.Charlie Kirk’s killing was a tragedy. But we must not rewrite his life | Moira DoneganRead moreDespite the emerging evidence, they seem unwilling to amend their version of what happened. I will admit that, on hearing the news, my first thought was that the Maga movement had orchestrated the killing to distract us from the Epstein files, or that this was the modern-day equivalent of the 1933 Reichstag fire, which occurred when the German parliament building was torched, and the National Socialists blamed the communists, and used the event as a pretext for suspending civil liberties and installing an authoritarian regime.The motives of the suspected killer,Tyler Robinson, are still unclear. But it appears that both the right and the left both had it wrong to some degree. Robinson was a studious young man from a solidly Republican, Mormon family, used anti-fascist slogans and apparently disliked Kirk for his hateful views.Regardless of what we thought of Kirk, it is profoundly and dangerously immoral to sanction political violence, regardless of its object. It is unseemly to celebrate the shooting of a human being with a wife and children – even a man whose rhetoric we may have despised.In another country, in another era, the death of Kirk might have served to remind us of the essential importance of free speech, of the concept that even the most polarizing figures should be able to speak publicly without fear of violent retribution. In drafting the first amendment, the founding fathers affirmed the idea that even racists, misogynists and anti-immigrant bigots have the right to express their beliefs and to engage in a free and fair debate with those who hold very different views. In fact, it’s the essence of democracy, the cornerstone on which our nation was founded and that every patriot (however that word is construed now) should affirm.Instead, Kirk’s death has been weaponized as a pretext to further undermine first amendment protections, to circle the wagons around the worst aspects of censorship and blind obedience to authority. It is being employed to foster the fear of saying anything that runs contrary to what those in power believe and allow us to express. Already, teachers, soldiers,government officials, firefighters and reporters – most prominently, MSNBC news analystMatthew Dowd– have beencensured or lost their jobsafter saying in public or on social media thatKirk’s rhetoricwas a form of not-so-thinly-disguised hate speech.Charlie Kirk’s death is a tragic marker of the indiscriminate nature of political violence | Margaret SullivanRead moreThere has been somepushback, among the public and on the floor of Congress, against the directive that prayers should be said and flags lowered to half mast in Kirk’s memory. Personally, I’m fine with the idea of prayers and lowered flags, except that I think that these gestures of mourning, honor and respect are being deployed too selectively.The flags should have been lowered for, among others, another recent victim of political violence:Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, who was murdered, along with her husband, Mark, in June. Prayers should be said for theColorado high school students woundedin one of the latest school shootings, on the very same day as Charlie Kirk’s murder. Flags should be lowered and prayers said for every victim lost to senselessgun violence, until we are tired of all the praying and flag-lowering, until we decide, as a nation, to take action to prevent these tragic deaths.My great fear is that we are nearing the day when, if we are being honest, the flag should be lowered in memory of our fragile, flawed, precious democracy. In that case, we may have to wait a while to see it flying proudly and at full mast, once again.Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and SciencesExplore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingOpinionUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS crimeGun crimecommentShareReuse this content"

Do your eyes glaze over at the mention of foreign fiction? Is your reading diet missing the vibrant flavours of stories from Africa, Asia and Latin America? Restricting your reading to novels from Europe and North America is like going to an all-you-can-eat Mexican buffet and just eating tortillas. Why do that?I have been getting to know about countries in the global south through literature. Being an intrepid traveller, current events addict and avid reader led me inexorably to read books from around the world. The book that most reeled me in to the ability of literature to open the door to another country was Gabriel García Márquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude, a dazzling, magic-realist ride through Colombia’s fortunes and misfortunes. Eventually, a cocktail of wonder, wishfulness and wanderlust inspired me to write a book about the joy of seeing the world through books.It’s easy to stick close to a literary home, but it’s also limiting, maybe illogical. Non-western nations are home tomore than 6 billion people–about 85%of the world’s population. Little wonder they are also referred to as the “majority world”.There’s a whole gamut of storytelling out there that is as colourful as an Indian textile bazaar, as rich as the spices of an Ethiopian stew and as passionate as a tango in Buenos Aires. Tales that encompasses love, loss, joy, revolution and even stretch to exploding mangoes, a ferociously funny Frankenstein and ghosts with strong political views.There are other ways to get facts. Newspapers are full of them, as are podcasts and documentaries. Travel shows proliferate, take your pick. But even then, there is nothing like the view of the world via a novel. Novels can go beyond merely being set on location. They can describe and landscape, but they can also capture a nation’s spirit and reveal something of its soul, offering a gateway to understanding the world in all its complexity, richness and absurdity. Seeking out authors from different cultural backgrounds, races and genders means reading books that challenge assumptions and broaden horizons as we venture into new worlds and learn about people who live different lives. It’s a cure for cultural myopia.Nigeria’s civil war in the 1970s?Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Half of a Yellow Sunis unputdownable. Seoul searching?Nobel prize-winner Han Kang, with works such as Human Acts and We Do Not Part, delves deep into South Korea’s psyche. A slice of life from Cuba?Leonardo Padura’s crime-busting Havana cop Mario Conde is on the case. And there’s a lot more where these came from – tales told with vim, vigour and narrative verve by writers such as Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Isabel Allende, Arundhati Roy, Naguib Mahfouz and Abdulrazak Gurnah.With independence a seminal event for many global south nations in the 20th century, the anti-colonial struggle pulses at the heart of some novels (so loud sometimes that you can almost hear it beating). The Nigerian writerChinua Achebe, considered the grandfather of modern African literature, said that “until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter”. As the literary lions of the global south roar, they not only tell us about their own countries but also about their former colonial masters. Salman Rushdie called it “the empire writes back”.My world tour spanned about 200 books, but it was never meant to be an exercise in worthiness. These books aren’t heavy-going and humourless, they are page-turning, plot-twisting, keep-you-up-till-late-in-the-night good. And they offer worldview-altering experiences.Confronting the western canon and freeing yourself from the anglophone autocracy is more about gate-opening than gatekeeping. I found that diversifying reading makes your literary world bigger, richer and more exciting. And reading around the world helps explode the oft-perpetuated myths that Africa is riddled with conflict and famine, that the Middle East is an unremitting war zone, and that Latin America is a heady mix of drug cartels, military coups and carnivals.The writer and activist Elif Shafak has talked about “the vastness of Storyland, where there are no borders, no hierarchies, no ‘us versus them’”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The big idea was that, by putting Argos general merchandise shops within Sainsbury’s supermarkets, both chains would benefit via a customer crossover effect. But the problem was also screamingly obvious: why volunteer to step in front of Amazon’s non-food steamroller?Simon Roberts became chief executive of Sainsbury’s in 2020, replacing Mike Coupe, the architect of the Argos deal, and immediately indicated where he stood. His “food first” strategy wasn’t quite a declaration that he viewed Argos as inessential to the day job of competing with Tesco et al, but it wasn’t far off.Thus nobody was surprised by Sainsbury’s confirmation on Saturday that it was considering an approach for Argos from JD.com, the enormous Chinese retailer. The identity of the would-be buyer was logical – JD.compublicly flirted with the idea of bidding for electrical chain Curry’s last yearand is still thought to be keen on a splashy entry into the UK.Sainsbury’s talks to sell Argos to Chinese retailer JD.com collapseRead moreSunday, however, brought news thatthe talks were offalready because, said Sainsbury’s, JD.com would only engage on “materially revised terms and commitments”. In negotiation-speak, that’s like calling the other side a bunch of time-wasters. The talks look properly dead. Everybody knows Argos isn’t worth what it was in 2016, but it’s still a substantial business.There is still a possible upside to the messy weekend saga for those Sainsbury’s investors who view Argos as unwanted baggage. The mere fact of talks suggests Argos has not become so enmeshed in Sainsbury’s infrastructure that the business could never be separated and sold.Of the 664 Argos shops, 461 are within a Sainsbury’s store, so a divorce would still be tricky. But more and more of Argos’s trade is going online, so perhaps there is still somebody out there who would want the 200-odd rump stand-alone shops, allowing Sainsbury’s to take back its store space to put to better use.Sainsbury’s doesn’t reveal Argos’s profits, butthe detail-free chartsit occasionally publishes suggest margins are slim (certainly slimmer than in the supermarkets) and have been getting slimmer in recent years. On the other hand, turnover at Argos is almost £5bn and digitalisation has happened, so perhaps there is still an appeal for somebody.For Roberts, Argos is best viewed as a low-level headache. Its presence is annoying for shareholders who would prefer a pure grocery-only story, especially nowSainsbury’s has sold most of its bank. But the core supermarket business isn’t obviously being distracted – and the weekend update confirmed this year’s expectations on operating profit and cashflow, which helped the share price. The worry is more the medium-term one that, one day, the demand on Argos to stand on its own feet internally will become impossible to maintain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it is still fair to turn down offers at silly prices. Roberts has a couple of years to find an alternative – either a self-help fix of Argos or a sale on respectable terms.

But as masculinity researchers, we see her work differently. It’s a cultural marker of a wider phenomenon: young women’s increasing withdrawal from dating andcommitted relationships.Carpenter bottles the palpable exasperation of young women’s experiences with emotionally unprepared partners. And her feelings show up in the data. Women are more likely than men to saydating is harder than it was 10 years agoand they are twice as likely to cite physical and emotional risk as the reason why. Thedisproportionate emotional laborplaced on women in relationships, paired withrising economic insecurity, does not compute.If Taylor Swift’s pop ballads embodied millennial aspirations of love, then Sabrina Carpenter, for gen Z, instead captures the sense that healthy relationships are out of reach. In her song Nobody’s Son, Carpenter sings: “There’s nobody’s son / Not anyone left for me to believe in,”a growing sentiment we have found in our research.Gen Z is undoubtedly divergingby gender, as 62% of single women report they arenot looking to date at all, compared with 37% of men. And the gen Z women whoaredating areincreasingly choosing older men. This has wide-ranging implications, from political futures to fertility rates.The manosphere’s narrative has spread, blamingmale lonelinesson women while ignoring thedecline in male friendships, or the communal spaces lost to austerity measures. In reality, it is often young women on the receiving end of the loneliness crisis. Carpenter captures this in the title Man’s Best Friend:the feeling of dating men who release long-bottled emotions in romantic relationships rather than friendships. This undue pressure has led to fewer young women willing to enter relationships, a trend amplified as both genders are told to turn away from each other online.Why fear the tote bag-wielding, matcha-drinking ‘performative male’? At least he makes an effort | Rachel ConnollyRead moreIn Tears, Carpenter highlights this shift in young men’s respect for women: “A little respect for women will get you very, very far / Offering to do anything, I’m like (Oh my god!).” This low bar reflects a broader trend among gen Z men, who increasingly adhere to restrictive masculine norms and push back against gender equality. As of 2023,55% of menfeel entitled to knowing their partner’s whereabouts, 42% believe they should always have the final say in relationships and men aged 18-23 are theleast likelyto agree with the statement that “feminism has made America a better place”.As the market for digital intimacy balloons, the concerns raised in Man’s Best Friend show no clear path toward resolution. Instead, emerging technologies purporting to solve this “loneliness crisis” exploit a gendered gap – tapping into male insecurities, emotional suppression and the stigma around seeking help. AI girlfriend platforms such as Candy.ai and Kindroid are exploding in popularity. Nor is it just men, as72% of teens report using AI “companions”. Instead of offering real support, they paywall intimacy and hyper-sexualized “connection.”. Socialized to avoid vulnerability, boys are being funneled into digital relationships where emotional connection costs money and care is reduced to a buyable commodity. These platforms profit from keeping men emotionally isolated.In an online ecosystem where men’s outrage fuels engagement, Carpenter’s album art – showing her on all fours as a man pulls her by the hair – ignited a sensationalist stir, condemned by critics as“soft porn for the male gaze”. But was Carpenter pandering to or provoking the manosphere? When the album dropped, her lyrics confirmed what fans familiar with her discography could have guessed all along: a sharp, hyperaware take on gender power dynamics. Through irony and provocation, she makes clear that she controls the narrative, rather than being consumed by it.Carpenter is not the only pop star expressing the exasperation of gen Z women. The meteoric rise of stars like Olivia Rodrigo and Carpenter ask us to question: so whose problemisthis? Carpenter gives us an answer in the song Manchild: “I choose to blame your mom.” Knowing that he is not her responsibility, she sums up the problem with ourcurrent momentof “masculinity crisis”: its blame and solutions continually land on women.It leaves us asking: how can young people move through this exasperation to form healthy relationships, when we aren’t directly talking to each other? Despondency about dating isn’t new – but the prevailing belief had been that persistence would eventually lead to partnership. But as the gender divide continues to widen, whatwillthe future of relationships, and thus the fabric of our society, look like? How can women voice frustration over the emotional labor that jeopardizes future relationships without getting stuck in resentment? And if young men do become more emotionally available, will we even recognize it when it happens?Caroline Hayes is a researcher and narrative strategist, specializing in the intersection of tech, culture and gender; Carolina Hidalgo-McCabe is an organizer, researcher and the host of The Masking Tapes, a podcast that explores 21st century masculinity and the gender divide; Alice Lassman is a policy expert, with her forthcoming book exploring how AI’s influence on gender and emotions are reshaping economic life.Explore more on these topicsSabrina CarpenterOpinionGenderRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

Thedecision to proscribe the group, taken in June, was an alarmingly illiberal overreaction to the damage some of the group’s supporters arealleged to have caused to military equipment. Now ministers and the public are seeing the consequences, as non-violent protesters against the ban are brought before judges.A long and proud tradition of civil disobedience includes campaigners for women’s suffrage, and against nuclear weapons and the burning of fossil fuels. Yet with its rash decision to lump the kind of direct action practised by Palestine Action in with terrorism, ministers have turned their back on this. More than 1,600 people have been arrested since the ban, many of them middle-aged and older. More protests are planned.It is bad enough that the UK has,like the European Union, failed to restrict trade with Israel or end arms exports, despite mounting evidence of war crimes. But for champions of direct-action tactics to face the risk of jail, in the same week that the prime minister plays host to President Trump, is a disgrace. As was pointed out when the Palestine Action ban was introduced, existing laws can be used to prosecute individuals who commit crimes for political motives. Currently,24 people are awaiting trialon charges including violent disorder after an Elbit Systems UK site in Bristol was targeted.Ministers claimed to have based their decision on an intelligence assessment. But a declassified version of this advice, seen by theNew York Times, said that most of Palestine Action’s activity “would not be classified as terrorism”. At a time when police, prisons and the courts are all overstretched, the ban has diverted resources in the wrong direction.This is the case whatever happens in court this week. The events of the weekend, when26 police officers were injuredat a massive far-right rally in London, makes the government’s skewed priorities even more glaring. Ministers, and the police,appear to have been caught off-guardby the demonstration’s scale and violence.Unless the home secretarymanages to prevent it, Palestine Action’s proscription will be challenged in court in November, on the grounds that it could interfere with people’srights to free expression and assembly. While the ban stands, the courts should opt for leniency. Harshly punishing people for championing the right to protest would send a terrible signal, at a time when liberal democracy is under growing threat.But even acquittals would not right the wrong of Palestine Action being proscribed in the first place. Protesters against Israeli brutality in Gaza and the West Bank should never have been dealt with in thesame legislative orderas Maniacs Murder Cult and Russian Imperial Movement, as happened in July, or placed in the same category as Hamas and Hizb ut-Tahrir.Following the prime minister’s panicked recent reshuffle, the new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, should take a different approach. Three independent reviewers of terrorism laws have recommended that proscription ordersshould be time-limited. Now would be a good moment to revisit a decision that should never have been made.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But one important factor may have been missed. That Merck, which is also cutting jobs elsewhere – 6,000 globally – is recalibrating not just in response to the UK or the US, but to China.Merck’s cash cow is pembrolizumab (brand nameKeytruda), an immunotherapy drug launched in 2014 that has successfully treated advanced melanoma, head and neck, lung, cervical and other cancers. It blocks an antibody called PD-1, teaching the immune system to fight the cancer. Because some patients are out of other options, the results sometimes seem miraculous.But Keytruda’s patent runs out in 2028. And now there is another drug on the global market, called ivonescimab, made by Akeso Biopharma. In head-to-head trials, reported in theLancetjournal in March, the innovative Chinese drug, which hits an additional tumour target, outperformed Merck’s – and it’s cheaper. The World Health Organization nowlistsPD-1 drugs as essential medicines worldwide, with no special status for Keytruda. No wonder Merck is cutting costs.Experts warn that this is no flash in the pan. Both treatments are products of a shift in the technology from pharma to biopharma. The former delivered mass-market drugs; the latter produces bespoke, high‑cost therapies. Richard Sullivan, professor of cancer and global health at King’s College London, and Lewis Husain, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies,wroteearlier this year that China, once seen as a follower, is now emerging as a global leader in cutting-edge biopharmaceutical treatments, reshaping the competitive landscape.The closure of Merck’s UK research centre, with the loss of 125 scientist positions, is another setback for the government’s biopharma ambitions. AstraZeneca has already scrapped vaccine research expansion in Liverpool. In an interview with the BBC,Sir John Bell, Oxford’s former regius professor of medicine, said industry bosses had told him that they see Britain as a poor bet. They demand more subsidies, higher drug-price caps and fast NHS approval for expensive new biopharma treatments. Yet these niche therapies benefit only a small number of patients, and higher spending on them inevitably leaves less for everyone else’s healthcare.Donald Trump is setting the mood music, demanding drug firms make their medicines in the US. Merck, known as MSD in Europe but headquartered in New Jersey, will be looking to oblige. The nominally Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca, which followed Merck byannouncingit was “pausing” a £200m research expansion in Cambridge, in Julypledgedto spend £37bn on research and development and manufacturing in the US by 2030.But this is a global industry. AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Roche and GSK are among the big players now doing deals to develop new Chinese drugs. Countries will buy the best medicines they can afford, which may be Chinese. Britain can’t just rely on price caps and vagueindustrial strategypromises. It needs to examine how rivals structure their incentives, regulation and support – and then decide where it can compete. That doesn’t mean simply inflating the NHS drugs bill, but targeting strengths. With the US retreating frommRNA– the platform behind the most widespread Covid vaccines – Britain has a rare opening.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I was brought up to offer my seat to any woman (of whatever disposition) or elderly person as a matter of principle. In 60 years of doing so, I have never had other than a polite demurral – more usually acceptance.Now that the boot is on the other foot (for which I need a walking stick to maintain my balance), I find that about 30% of young people will instinctively offer me succour, which I gratefully and gracefully accept. The rest don’t seem to care.There is nothing nuanced about it: they are either thoughtless or plain selfish. But I take great comfort in those with compassion – in time, they will prevail.Ian MacKellarHuntingdon, CambridgeshireI think Polly Hudson may have missed the point about Celia Imrie’s dismay about not being offered a seat for the duration of her train journey.Last month, I boarded a very crowded train in London Euston bound for Milton Keynes with my 73-year-old Spanish friend who had fallen the previous day – we were transporting her around in a wheelchair. Her daughter looked around the packed carriage in consternation. Don’t worry, I said, I will sort it.I looked around the carriage and chose the nearest, seemingly fittest, young man and asked him to give up his seat for my friend. “Well, it’s not a seat for the less able,” was the reply.After a lot of huffing and puffing, he did eventually get up and went off in a huge sulk to find another seat. I proceeded to sit on the carriage floor on a plastic bag (I’m 73 years old too).Judith HeinemannMilton Keynes, BuckinghamshireI have read and heard many rationalisations for lots of different things, but this one takes the biscuit. Embarrassed? For trying to be courteous? It feels far fetched. I am old, but to get to see the operas and concerts that I love, I have to take a tram to the centre of my nearest traffic-conscious city. Trams are frequently crowded and the journey is quite long, but I need never worry, for someone will inevitably offer their seat to me within seconds.

We are not horrible bigots who do not accept trans people and think they should face discrimination. But that is usually the narrative.We are mainly women who have real and well-researched concerns about, for example, the effects of medical treatment that was being given to young people – who do not have the maturity to appreciate the life-changing outcomes ofpuberty blockersand irreversible surgery.The many wider issues of concern are also complex. For example, women’s sports are physically dangerous when male-bodied opponents are allowed to compete. It is possible to live as the opposite sex from the physical body, but genetic makeup and sex characteristics cannot be changed. This is not prejudice. It is scientific fact.People such as the philosopherKathleen Stock, For Women Scotland group, the comedy writer Graham Linehan, and many others who have extensively researched and spoken out about these issues, have been doing so for years and have had to fight for their right to be heard. Jobs and incomes have been lost and reputations sabotaged. But they have, thankfully, kept going.That libraries and literary festivals are being influenced by trans rights activists to censor gender-critical writers and artists is no surprise to any of us who have an interest in this issue. It is shocking. But we must all speak up or our precious rights to free speech will be further eroded.That the Guardian has published this article by a gender-critical writer is a welcome step forward. Let us hope that recent legal wins may be the start of a more measured and honest debate outside what has become a nasty and misogynistic shouting match (and actual censorship) against those who care about young people, and the rights of women and gay people.Name and address suppliedExplore more on these topicsFreedom of speechLGBTQ+ rightsScotlandGraham LinehanGenderTransgenderWomenlettersShareReuse this content"

Regrettably, a recently attempted rewatch found me craving a little more instant drama and maybe a little more instant kissing.I sacrilegiously switched to Bridgerton halfway through, a sin that has haunted me since. Aly’s piece highlights why.The elegance, acting, casting, costumes, soundtrack and subtlety of the 1995 adaptation are perfect. And yet, I wonder, has the world of scrolling, 30-second videos, Netflix and 1,000 pieces of stimulus at all times taken away our ability to appreciate the classics?We still crave period pieces, the language, the angst and especially the costumes, but I’m worried that the adaptation wouldn’t make the history it did if it were created today. And this is horrifying. I hope Dolly Alderton’s upcoming adaptation somehow achieves the impossible task of attracting both Austen fans (me) and those pesky, unengaged youth (also me).Best believe, after reading Aly’s article, I downed the phone, bought a Penguin classic and had a good hard think about my behaviour.Grace GoodaVictoria, AustraliaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The defender could not help himself, he needed to make his views known, but when all of the pieces were put together from last season and into the summer, it was difficult to see that he was planning on staying at the club.There was the repost of a social media message last September that claimed he was tired because Spurs had not flown him back on a private jet from Argentina duty. Note: reposts can be endorsements. There was the complaint in December that the club’s lack of spending meant they were falling behind Premier League rivals. “You have to realise that something is going wrong – hopefully they [the board] realise it,” he said.New legal challenge to plan for Spurs football academy in London parkRead moreThere was the moment in March of this year when Romero thanked the Argentina medics for his return to fitness after injury while making no mention of the physios at Spurs. There was the interview in April when he said he would love to play in Spain’s La Liga. And he appeared to sign off on more than one level in mid-June as he paid tribute to the club’s outgoing manager, Ange Postecoglou – just after Thomas Frank had been confirmed as his successor.“You paved the way despite the many obstacles that always existed and always will exist,” he wrote. Romero was being linked at the time with Atlético Madrid.Romero’s story is the dictionary definition of a volte-face. That he has remained at Spurs might be attributed in part to how Atlético were never likely to find the money to make a compelling offer. But there are additional layers, deeper ones – primarily the fact that he ended up signing a four-year contract extension. Also, that hedid so as the captain, having agreed to be the on-pitch leader of the Frank era after Son Heung-min’s departure for Los Angeles FC.View image in fullscreenCristian Romero celebrates Micky van de Ven’s goal at West Ham with Lucas Bergvall and Xavi Simons.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe excitement is bubbling at Spurs as they prepare to make their grand Champions League return; they kick off with a home tie against Villarreal on Tuesday night – the reward for that night in Bilbao, as the Europa Leaguevictory against Manchester Unitedwill always be known.Frank’s European experience stretches no further than a handful of Europa League qualifying ties with Brøndby more than a decade ago. It has been quite the journey for him, taking in managing Brentford at Griffin Park in the Championship and it was touching to hear him talk of how he could not wait to hear theChampions Leaguearia; to feel the vibes inside the stadium during the opening minutes of the game.Frank is not the only important change at Spurs. There are new people in charge in the shape of Vivienne and Charles Lewis after theeasing aside of the chairman Daniel Levy. There is a new chief executive in Vinai Venkatesham; a new non-executive chairman in Peter Charrington. But it is hard to see a clearer symbol of the fresh direction and hope than Romero. And the more he spoke at the pre-Villarreal media conference, the more it was possible to read into the reasons for his optimism.“I did a lot of interviews which seemed like I was talking badly about people inside the club but in the end I’m a person who sometimes makes mistakes and that’s it,” Romero said.“I always want the best for the club. Sometimes, things have been said that aren’t true as well but always everything I said is because I want there to be a structure of a club that can be at the top level, part of the big clubs.“That’s why I was sometimes so angry before. But today I see a very organised club with a clear idea and a coach who is organising things. Everyone is seeing that in a short space of time we are with him. Absolutely everyone inside is looking in the same direction and that is the important thing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there was plenty to grill him about, including his comments from December about the “people responsible” for the relative lack of investment in the squad.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Bentancur puts an arm around Cristian Romero in training before Tuesday’s visit of Villarreal.Photograph: John Walton/PA“As I said before, it’s a bit of everything,” Romero said. “It’s about the group of players, the coaching staff, the people that work for us, the executives obviously. In the end, it depends on everyone that we pull in the same direction. I think that since Thomas arrived, they have started to take all those decisions to go in the same direction. And then when it’s like that, everything runs a lot more easily.“We’ve had a great start to the season. There’s a lot we can still improve upon but we’ve created a lovely group to work with. The previous manager, Ange, brought this group together and now Thomas has arrived. He has brought in new players and they are fitting in nicely. When you are a family like this off the field, it’s much easier to achieve things on the field.”Romero was asked for his thoughts on Levy’s departure. “I don’t know what’s happened but it’s not something I’ve had the chance to speak with him about personally,” the 27-year-old said. “He’s a person who’s been at the club for a good many years. We need to thank him because he’s the person who brought me here. Fortunately, we could crown his reign with a trophy, which would have made everyone happy, including him. I just desire the very best for him and it’s his decision …”The last half-line was open to question but Romero was in no mood to brook many arguments. The past is the past.

The bar had just been raised to six metres. So Mondo reached into his kitbag and dug out the Claw.It is his weird looking special shoe, with a spike protruding from the front of it like a medieval torture implement – and the 25‑year‑old Swede takes it out only on those occasions when he sniffs a world record in the air.I get out of breath walking up the stairs these days, admits Usain BoltRead moreAt this point five men were still jousting for the world title. But after Duplantis had breezed clear at 6m, 6.10m and 6.15m his eighth consecutive global title – and a $70,000 (£51,000) first prize – was secured. Now history was calling.There was a nod to the official, the bar was pushed to 6.30m, and there was a 14th world record to chase.Duplantis uses the Claw shoes because it means that in his 20 strides he can get up to speed quicker, plant the pole faster and soar even higher – providing the technique is right.“Whenever I think that I have a chance to break world records I do bring out the Claw,” Duplantis said. “I don’t do it every time, but when it comes out, then you know it’s business time. I can really feel the benefit from the very beginning of the running, and the way that I’m able to push the first few steps and build up speed.”Duplantis does not wear it all the time, however, partly because the first version, introduced last year, had a metal spike that would lacerate his hand or arm on the way up.Nowadays the spike is not so sharp, according to Puma’s vice-president of innovation, Romain Girard. “In the latest iteration we have, the claw is actually a kind of a little condom, or kind of a shell made of rubber,” he said. “So it makes sure it protects him.”However, Duplantis has an established routine and he wanted to stick to it. The Swede’s first attempt failed by the tiniest of margins. The second, in which he brushed the bar on the way up only to see it fall in a delayed reaction, was even closer.By now all of his competitors were watching by the runway and willing him on. The Greek athlete Emmanouil Karalis, who had taken silver after clearing 6m, even used an electric fan in his face to cool Duplantis down.The Swede wasn’t finished yet. He reached for another weapon, a stiffer pole to help him to get higher. As he began those 20 steps to glory the crowd roared at first, then gasped, before the roar jumped in volume and intensity.Duplantis was over. He had done it again. Hehas always been oneof the ultimate showmen in track and field. Now he had summoned one of the greatest moments in the 42-year history of the world championships – and another $100,000 for breaking the record.View image in fullscreenDuplantis soars on his way to more history.Photograph: Paweł Kopczyński/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter landing he immediately ran to group-hug his fellow competitors, who were all jumping for joy too. The crowd’s cheers had barely subsided when Duplantis was off again: charging around the track, punching the sky. Several TV camera operators tried to chase him down but good luck with that given the amount of adrenaline rampaging through his body.He ran to his fiancee, Desiré Inglander and gave her a lengthy kiss – then he made it clear to the 60,000 crowd that he loved them, too.“I am just so happy,” Duplantis said. “I wanted to come back to Tokyo because I knew it was a wonderful city. But it’s better than I ever imagined. This is the biggest dream ever to come true for me.”As at the Paris Olympicslast year, the world was privileged to share it with him too.Meanwhile, there was a major surprise in the men’s 3,000m steeplechase as the double Olympic champion Soufiane El Bakkali was beaten by the New Zealander Geordie Beamish, who had been spiked in the face during the heats.View image in fullscreenGeordie Beamish, who picked himself up after a spike in the face during the heats, won gold in the 3,000m steeplechase final.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters“This was a turn-up, wasn’t it?” Beamish said. “That was pretty unreal. I only knew I’d win one metre before the finish and that was enough. It’s the first track gold for New Zealand at a world championships, which is pretty cool.”In the women’s 100m hurdles, Switzerland’s Ditaji Kambundji won gold in 12.24sec, ahead of 2022 champion Tobi Amusan’s 12.29.All three British runners in the men’s 1500m qualified for the final on Wednesday and for Josh Kerr, Neil Gourley and Jake Wightman, their chances of a medal increased when the Olympic championCole Hocker was disqualifiedfor barging a competitor out of the way.“Wednesday’s shaping up to be a fantastic event,” Kerr,the defending champion, said. “I’ve done a fair few of them, so I’m excited.” He has in fact now made six consecutive major finals in the event across the world championships and Olympics. “That consistency is not easy to come by.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

To us he was simply ‘Richard’, our son. A loving father, grandfather, and brother, and a true friend to many. He had a heart as big as his smile, and his kindness, humour and loyalty touched everyone who was lucky enough to know him. To the wider world, Richard will always be remembered as one of boxing’s greatest champions – a man who gave everything inside the ring and wore his heart on his sleeve outside of it.”View image in fullscreenA person lays a floral tribute in memory of Ricky Hatton at his home.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAUnforgettable Ricky Hatton turned boxing into a spectacle for his vast army of fansRead moreThe family added: “He inspired generations with his fighting spirit, his humility, and his love for the sport. But beyond the titles, the nights to remember, and the roar of the crowd, he remained the same down-to-earth Richard who never forgot where he came from.“As a family, our loss is immeasurable, and words cannot truly capture the pain we feel. We have been deeply moved by the overwhelming outpouring of love and support. It has been a source of great comfort to see just how many lives Richard touched, and how widely he was admired and respected. At this time, we kindly ask for privacy as we come to terms with life without him. Richard’s memory will forever remain in our hearts, in the hearts of his fans, and in the sport he loved so dearly.”The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said the city would consider how best to honour Hatton’s memory properly. Burnham said Hatton’s death was “hard to take in” and added: “Ricky was much loved by so many in Greater Manchester.

The former world road race champion posted on social media: “If the UCI and the responsible bodies couldn’t make the right decisions early enough, then long‑term it’s very bad for cycling that the protesters managed to get what they wanted.“From now on, it’s clear that a cycling race can be used as an effective stage for protests and next time it will only get worse, because someone allowed it to happen and looked the other way.”The three-week Vuelta a España, the final Grand Tour of 2025, was characterised by multiple pro-Palestine protests which caused crashes that forced two riders to quit the race, several changes to stage finishes and distances, and the cancellations of podium ceremonies.A huge protest forced theabandonment of the final stageand the cancellation of all the planned celebrations. But it was also a glimpse of one possible future for World Tour road racing if the Israel-Premier Tech (IPT) team continue to compete.For the Vuelta itself, the race has been catastrophic with increased policing cost, lost television audiences, disenchanted sponsors and stage-winning riders, including Kwiatkowski’s teammate Egan Bernal, being denied their moment of podium glory.On Sunday evening in the car park of their team hotel in suburban Madrid, Jonas Vingegaard, Joāo Almeida and Tom Pidcock, the top three finishers, stepped on to a makeshift podium of drinks coolers, and sprayed each other with champagne. It wasn’t quite the sunset podium on live TV that they and their sponsors had expected after three weeks of tumultuous, fractured and occasionally dangerous racing.“It’s a shame that a moment for eternity was taken away from us this way,” Vingegaard, the victor, said of the Madrid finish cancellation. “I’m really upset about it. Everyone has the right to protest, but only without influencing or endangering our race.”In little more than a fortnight, an initiative which began targeting the IPT team’s participation in the race morphed into a far bigger anti‑Israel protest movement.With further protests promised for other races, including the Tour de France start in Barcelona next year, the European racing scene is now in a bind. There were also demonstrations on Sunday in Canada, at the one-day GP Montreal, where a large yellow sign accused the IPT team of being an “ambassador of genocide”.Although there was a growing sense in the peloton that the team owner, Sylvan Adams, and his riders should have pulled out of the Vuelta, Adams steadfastly refused, saying acceding to a request from the race organiser, ASO, to withdraw would have seen no end to the protests against them and potentially other teams.“They asked us to quit the Vuelta, but we did not surrender to the terrorists,” Adams said during the race. “I told them that they were wrong and that we had the right to stay.”Adams’s stance was welcomed by Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, while the billionaire team owner said he had also received support from the UCI. Israel-Premier Tech declined to comment on the latest suggestion that teams may not race at events where their riders participate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, in a sport now heavily reliant on nation-state sponsorship and branding, politicised mass protest, no matter how peaceful, will not be.Unlike stadium-based sport, road racing – in need of public goodwill – remains uniquely vulnerable to protest and disruption on almost every kilometre of the route. Fully securing 175km of French, Italian or Spanish countryside is logistically impossible and prohibitively expensive. It also goes against the positioning of cycling as a free “people’s festival”.Richard Plugge, Vingegaard’s team manager at Visma-Lease a Bike and one of the most influential World Tour bosses, said on Sunday evening: “These days, sport is used as a platform for addressing social issues. But the participants must be protected. They must not become victims of this social debate.“That debate must be kept out of the athletes’ arena at all times. Athletes must be able to fight their battles unhindered in the stadium, or in our case, on the road. Otherwise, the unifying essence of sport will be jeopardised.”The UCI declined to comment on its handling of the situation, instead praising race organisers’ professionalism in the face of the protests and criticising the Spanish government. In a statement, it noted its “total disapproval of and deep concern about the events that marked the 2025 edition of La Vuelta Ciclista a España”.“We also regret the fact that the Spanish prime minister and his government have supported actions that could hinder the smooth running of a sporting competition and, in some cases, expressed their admiration for the demonstrators.”Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

The FISI confirmed on Monday that he did not recover after “cranial trauma” and a subsequent swelling of his brain.“It is a tragedy for the family and for our sport,” the FISI president Flavio Roda said in a statement on Monday. “It is absolutely necessary to do everything possible to ensure that such episodes do not happen again.”“At this sad and painful time, I want to tell all athletes and coaches, in all sports, that the federation is by their side and that they will find all the support they need,” Roda added. “I ask for the utmost respect for Matteo’s family, whom we will stand by for as long as necessary.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

He is the second elite Italian skier to die in a training incident within the past year, afterthe death of junior champion Matilde Lorenziat Val Senales in October 2024.A part of Italy’s World Cup team since 2021, Franzoso was training alongside other Italian skiers including Dominik Paris, Christof Innerhofer and Mattia Casse in Chile. The team are preparing to race on home snow at the Milan-Cortina Olympics in February, but those preparations have now been marked by tragedy.The US skier and Olympic gold medallist Lindsey Vonn posted a black and white picture of Franzoso on Instagram. “This is incredibly sad,” Vonn wrote. “I was skiing this exact slope three weeks ago … RIP Matteo. My sincere condolences to his family and loved ones.”Franzoso made 17 World Cup appearances and finished 28th in the Super-G event at the Olympic host venue, Cortina d’Ampezzo, in 2023 – his best performance at alpine skiing’s highest level.He also won a super-G race on the second-tier Europa Cup circuit in 2021, having finished fourth in the downhill at the world junior championships in 2020.Explore more on these topicsSkiingItalyWinter Olympics 2026EuropeWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The latest cab off the rank, Lee Blackett, is the 11th individual to take on the role in nine years but it may just be that the national team have found the ideal catalyst to enhance their chances at the next Men’s Rugby World Cup in Australia in 2027.Blackett, 42, auditioned successfully for the job in the summer tour of Argentina and the US, where England scored 13 tries in three Tests, and he has emerged as the big winner in Steve Borthwick’s latest cabinet reshuffle with Richard Wigglesworth switching to defence and Joe El-Abd helping out with the forwards.Steve Borthwick urged by club coaches to rest England’s Lions during autumn internationalsRead moreFresh from helping to steer Bath to Premiership and Challenge Cup titles last season, Blackett has been recruited to add further zest to England’s attacking game, starting with their opening autumn series international against Australia on 1 November. With about 20 Tests between now and the next World Cup, England will be keen for him to hit the ground running.Blackett, for one, believes there is more than enough time for England to put together a compelling backline blend, with five campaigns – autumn international series, Six Nations and summer Tests – to come over the next two years. “Do I think we’ve got enough time? Yes. Five campaigns is enough to see people, it’s enough to develop our game, definitely.”The personable Blackett, who played for Rotherham and Leeds before turning to coaching, fully deserves his call-up having been left to resurrect his career three years ago after the financial collapse of Wasps where he was director of rugby. He has always been a sharp-eyed student of the game and his creative partnership with the masterful Finn Russell at Bath proved beneficial for all concerned.Blackett, a mood-enhancing dressing-room presence, certainly helped to broaden Bath’s outlook and will encourage players to venture outside their comfort zone. “A psychologist once told me that those environments which say ‘This is the way we do it’ don’t have a growth mindset. My biggest fear as a coach is becoming a dinosaur. If someone says, ‘He’s past it,’ that’s my big fear. So I’m constantly looking at the game, seeing where it’s going and seeing if I’m missing something.”A podcast chat with the former England international James Haskell also inadvertently helped to remind him of his overriding coaching objective. “Hask said: ‘You always gave us confidence.’ That is what I want to do. I want players running out confident, I want players running out there going, ‘If I see something, this coach backs me.’ I don’t want us to miss opportunities when they are there for us.”Any number of England fans will be shouting “hallelujah” by now. For assorted reasons, until this year, England have tended to lurched from one attacking philosophy to another and have employed a battalion of specialist coaches. Eddie Jones, Glen Ella, Ed Robinson, Sam Vesty, Scott Wisemantel, Rory Teague, Simon Amor, Martin Gleeson, Nick Evans and Wigglesworth have all led the attack at some stage and if Blackett stays until the 2027 World Cup he will be the longest serving of the lot.View image in fullscreenFin Smith (left) and Marcus Smith offer England a wealth of attacking talent from the fly-half position.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThat will depend, ultimately, on England’s results with Blackett stressing that England will not be prioritising “funky rugby” over winning matches. “I’ll be doing whatever I feel is best to win us the game. I’ll be looking at the opposition and where I feel we can get an advantage. If you think that’s funky … I just want something that works to win us the game.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A couple of the guys are going to be disappointed but, for me, having three of them competing is going to make them better. They’re all going to have to be at their best.”Leicester’s recently appointed defence coach, Mike Forshaw, meanwhile, has left his role at the Tigers for personal family reasons.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was his trademark To Da World pose before the 100m finals. The cheers and adulation of 60,000 fans in Tokyo’s National Stadium. A reminder of glories past.The 39-year-old Jamaican had not watched athletics at allsince retiring in 2017until seeingMelissa Jefferson-WoodenandOblique Seville win gold. And, as he also admitted, he now spends his time streaming movies and building Lego – and even gets out of breath when he walks up stairs.Simbu snatches world marathon gold from Petros in historic photo finishRead moreHowever, when asked why the new crop of sprinters is not as quick as his generation, despite the advances in spike and track technology, Bolt’s competitive instincts fired back to life. “You want the real answer? We’re just more talented,” he said. “That’s all I’m saying. Of course, it shows when it comes to the men. You can see the women are different. They’re running faster times and faster times. So it shows – it has to be the talent.”Bolt, who won eight Olympic gold medals and 11 world titles, still holds three world records – 9.58sec in the 100m, 19.19 in the 200m and 36.84 in the 4×100m relay – that stand tall. The athletes he used to beat – including Tyson Gay, Yohan Blake, Asafa Powell and Justin Gatlin – were also quicker than the cream of the 2025 generation. Indeed, no one has broken 9.70 since the Lausanne Diamond League meeting that followed London 2012.While Gay, Blake, Powell and Gatlin were all banned at various stages for doping offences, Bolt said the fact that Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce improved her times once the super spikes arrived showed that talent was key. “You have Shelly, who has got the new spikes, and she ran faster. So it’s just the talent. We’re just way more talented men over that time. It shows if you look at it.”Bolt also urged track and field athletes to show more of themselves to engage with casual fans. “It’s the personality,” he said. “I think a lot of people try to be fun but it comes off different. It’s just having a good time. If you try too hard, it’s not going to be the same.”He also pointed to a moment at the 2012 Olympic Games, when he was the flag bearer for Jamaica, and saw Queen Elizabeth II at the opening ceremony. “When I was in London, I knew the queen, so I waved,” he said. “I tried to engage with fans and that’s why they gravitated to it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But these days he confessed to a more sedentary lifestyle at home.Asked what he did on a typical day, he replied: “Well normally, I wake up just in time to see the kids off to school, and then it depends on what I have to do. If I have nothing to do, I just chill out. I might work out sometimes if I’m in a good mood. I just watch some series and chill until the kids come home.“I spend some time with them, hang out, until they start annoying me then I leave. And then afterwards, I just stay at home and watch movies or I’m into Lego now, so I do Lego.”Bolt, who ruptured an achilles last year, said he no longer runs. “No, I mostly do gym workouts. I’m not a fan, but I think now that I’ve been out for a while I have to actually start running. Because when I walk up stairs I get out of breath. I think when I start working on it fully again, I will probably have to do some laps just to get my breathing right.”However, he insisted that watching track and field again had made him want to bring his children, Olympia Lightning Bolt, five, and his twin sons, Saint Leo and Thunder Bolt, four, to the world championships in Beijing in two years’ time.That, of course, is where his legend began at the 2008 Olympics. “I’m excited because I get to bring my kids and I can tell them: ‘Listen, this is where it all happened.’ I’ve shown my kids videos and stuff like that. They’ll be six and seven, and they’ll kind of understand the moment, and I can explain to them what their dad has done over the years.”Explore more on these topicsUsain BoltWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Burke, meanwhile, sent out a treble from just seven runners over the two afternoons, highlighted by Fallen Angel’s victory in the Group One Matron Stakes on Saturday.And there was a confidence-boosting Group One winner too for Kia Joorabchian’s Amo Racing operation, to kick off a vital period for the owner after a substantial eight-figure investment in both bloodstock and property ahead of the 2025 campaign.Thus far, it seems fair to say that Amo’s season has not gone entirely to plan.Joorabchian spent just shy of £25m on yearlings at last October’s Book 1 Sale at Tattersalls alone, completed his purchase of the historic Freemason Lodge, Sir Michael Stoute’s former stable in Newmarket, in early January and moved Raphael Freire from his former base in Lambourn to take charge of Amo’s new British HQ in the spring.Freire was then ejected from the hot seat just four months later, having saddled eight winners from 52 starters, to be replaced by Kevin Phillipart de Foy from early July. Royal Ascot was winnerless, and so too the July meeting at Newmarket and the Ebor festival at York. To date, Freemason Lodge’s best win of the year was Hollywood Treasure’s 16-1 success in the Listed St Hugh’s Stakes at Newbury.Beyond the main base in Newmarket, however, there have been distinct signs of life in recent weeks, with Adrian Murray’s yard in Ireland posting two Group One wins, with Power Blue in the Phoenix Stakes and, on Sunday, Arizona Blaze in the Flying Five at the Curragh. The latter contest was a win-and-you’re-in for the Breeders’ Cup Turf Sprint at Del Mar, and since the same horse finished second in the two-year-old equivalent last year, it is an obvious end-of-season target.View image in fullscreenDelacroix, ridden by Christophe Soumillon, left, on his way to winning the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown on Saturday.Photograph: Damien Eagers/PAKarl Burke’s Aylin, owned in partnership with the Al Shaqab operation, also has a guaranteed spot in the starting stalls at Del Mar, in the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf, after her win in the Group Two May Hill Stakes at Doncaster last week.Amo has drawn a blank with 14 previous runners at the Breeders’ Cup, so any win at the meeting would be a cause for huge celebration. If one of the big-ticket yearling colt purchases at last year’s sales could emerge as a Classic contender for the spring of 2026, meanwhile, the overall grade in Amo’s end-of-term report might suddenly improve from a so-so C to a very solid B-plus.The long-term goal for Joorabchian and his partners, including Evangelos Marinakis, the Nottingham Forest chair, seems to be to complete the same virtuous circle as John Magnier’s Coolmore Stud operation. First, find a top-class stallion, then encourage breeders to use him by supporting his offspring relentlessly at the sales, race the best of them and then retire them to stud in turn.Step one in particular requires both an eye-wateringly large investment of both time, effort and money, and no small amount of good fortune along the way. But if, and it is a big if, you can find a stallion like Sadler’s Wells or Galileo – or Godolphin’s Dubawi or Frankel at Juddmonte – they can conceivably cover 150-plus mares each year at a six-figure fee per cover, for a couple of decades. Galileo earned £580,000 for his owners when he won the Derby in 2001.

Ancient Egypt has won both of his starts to date and, along with Power Blue, who has a speedier pedigree, holds an entry in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket on 11 October.A colt near the top of the ante-post betting for the 2,000 Guineas would make all of Joorabchian’s cash-flashing, both last year and this, feel like money well spent. Coolmore and O’Brien have dominated the beginning and middle of the 2025 Flat season, but the upstart Amo operation could yet play a major role in the finale.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsAidan O'BrienfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had praised the team for “not giving in to hate and intimidation”, adding that it had made Israel proud.The protests culminated with 100,000 demonstrators gathering for Sunday’s rally. According to the Spanish government, 22 police officers were injured in clashes with protesters and two people were arrested.Speaking earlier on Sunday, Sánchez praised those taking part in the Vuelta and also paid tribute to the Spanish people “who mobilise for just causes such as Palestine”.He added: “TodaySpainshines as an example and as a source of pride. It’s [giving] an example to the international community by taking a step forward in defence of human rights.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government has allowed and induced the non-completion of La Vuelta, and thus, an international embarrassment that was televised around the world.”Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the populist PP president of the Madrid region, also put the blame squarely on Sánchez.“When the prime minister of the nation encourages a boycott of theVuelta a Españain his own capital, he becomes directly responsible for every incident that occurs, whether the race is stopped or whether there is a single assault,” she said. “What damage to our sport and our country!”The Israeli government, which has described Sánchez’s stance on Gaza as a “continuous anti-Israel and antisemitic attack”, said the prime minister bore responsibility for Sunday’s scenes. It denies carrying out a genocide, and says the war in Gaza is one of self-defence.“The pro-Palestinian mob heard the incitement messages – and wrecked the La Vuelta cycling race,” said Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar. “Thus, the sporting event that had always been a source of pride for Spain was cancelled. Sánchez and his government – a disgrace to Spain!”Last week, the Israeli government announced that two senior leftwing members of the Sánchez administration – the labour minister and deputy prime minister, Yolanda Díaz, and the youth minister, Sira Rego – would be banned from entering Israel because of theircriticisms of its conduct in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsSpainVuelta a EspañaCyclingEuropeIsraelPalestinian territoriesGazanewsShareReuse this content"

Big hits from its back catalogue include Hereditary, Moonlight, Lady Bird, Uncut Gems, and Spring Breakers, as well as TV shows including Euphoria.This year, A24’s releases include Covid western Eddington and Celine Song’s Materialists, about the dating travails of a professional matchmaker in New York, played by Dakota Johnson, who finds herself torn between high-status financier Pedro Pascal and broke actor Chris Evans. The movie won acclaim for its scepticism about modern courtship, and for its clear-eyed take on what many perceive as a transactional dating market.To promote the film this spring, A24 launched a website,menofny.com, which invited Manhattan residents to input their vital stats – including salary – into a live, real-time ticker which ranked men according to their key attributes. The data appeared on screens at the New York Stock Exchange and on billboards across the city. Materialists has so far made over $100m at the box office.View image in fullscreenAlicia Vikander in Ex-Machina.Photograph: Film4/AllstarThe company took a more viral approach in 2015 when launching Ex-Machina at the South by Southwest film festival. A Tinder profile was set up for Ava, the AI robot played by Alicia Vikander in the film, and users who matched with her were asked assorted questions including “Have you ever been in love?” and “What makes you human?” before directing them to an Instagram page revealing the stunt.Representatives for Feeld said that mentions of A24 were tracked in profiles across the globe, suggesting that the studio’s cut-through as a signifier of edgy yet still populist entertainment is now worldwide. It also appears to be intimately and energetically linked with the digital interaction of its key demographic.A24 records eight times more social engagement than more veteran competitors, such as HBO, Disney and Marvel, based on the ratio of Instagram likes to followers.Bloomberg recently reported around the particularly keen identification with the brand among US cinemagoers, quoting an A24 board member as saying that more than60% of the peoplewho go to see an A24 film in cinemas are motivated to do so because it is an A24 film.The studio’s mushrooming popularity also means it finds itself at something of a tipping point, with overexposure and mainstream acclaim meaning it could forfeit its bespoke, clubby credentials.Now employing more than 200 people in offices worldwide, the company is still owned by its original founders and investors, Daniel Katz, David Fenkel and John Hodges, with a limited number of stakeholders having boarded since 2012.A recent New Yorker profile of the companyreported that it had had its most profitable half year in its history, quoting a top executive saying the business model was constructed to absorb the potential financial hit of passion projects such as Eddington.“To use a baseball metaphor, we hit singles and doubles,” they said. “And when you set up movies to hit singles and doubles you can let your partner – in the best version of this – really take creative risks. We don’t need to gross a hundred million dollars.

Hell, call their employer. We don’t believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility, and there is no civility in the celebration of political assassination.”Miller said he had been feeling “incredible sadness, but there’s incredible anger” and would be focusing his “righteous anger” on the “organized campaign that led to this assassination, to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks”.Detailing what he believes is a “vast domestic terror movement”, Miller pointed to what he said were “organized doxing campaigns, the organized riots, the organized street violence, the organized campaigns of dehumanization, vilification, posting people’s addresses, combining that with messaging designed to trigger, incite violence, and the actual organized cells that carry out and facilitate the violence”.The political leanings of the shooter who killed Kirk are not yet clear. Bullet casings found with the shooter’s gun were inscribed with references to video games and online culture. Still, prominent figures on the right – before a shooter was apprehended – declared war on the left, claiming it was responsible for Kirk’s death.There is no evidence of a network supporting the shooter, and Miller did not provide substantiation of his claims that there is a “vast domestic terror movement” at play.Since Kirk’s death, rightwing influencers have found examples of people they say are glorifying or celebrating the violence and have sought to get them fired. One post that Miller retweeted said people should go beyond contacting employers and should go after professional licenses for lawyers, teachers and medical professionals because they “cannot be trusted to be around clients, children, or patients”.Trump has also said the problem today is on the left, not the right. “When you look at the agitators – you look at the scum that speaks so badly of our country, the American flag burnings all over the place – that’s the left, not the right,” Trump said on Sunday.On the podcast, Vance said that after he left Kirk’s family in Arizona, he read a story in the Nation, a leftwing publication, where the author detailed Kirk’s views and, he said, took a quote about several prominent Black women out of context to imply it applied to all Black women.The magazine is not a “fringe blog” but a “well-funded, well-respected magazine whose publishing history goes back to the American civil war. George Soros’s Open Society Foundation funds this magazine, as does the Ford Foundation and many other wealthy titans of the American progressive movement”, Vance said, hinting at the organizations the administration might target.The Ford Foundation responded: “The murder of Charlie Kirk was an appalling act of violence. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. Political violence is un-American and a threat to our way of life, and the perpetrator of this heinous crime must be held accountable. The rise in politically motivated violence is a significant crisis in our society that all Americans need to join together to address.”Vance later mentioned that the foundations that helped fund the magazine are tax-exempt, a sign that the government could go after that status.“Charlie was gunned down in broad daylight, and well-funded institutions of the left lied about what he said so as to justify his murder,” Vance said. “This is soulless and evil, but I was struck not just by the dishonesty of the smear, but by the glee over a young husband’s and young father’s death.”The writer of the Nation articlesaid on Blueskythat she was not paid by the Ford Foundation or Open Society to write the article.The Ford Foundation said it has not provided any funding to the Nation since 2019.Vance said he “desperately” wants national unity and appreciated the many condolences he has received from Democratic friends and colleagues, but he said there was no unity without confronting the truth. “The data is clear, people on the left are much likelier to defend and celebrate political violence,” he said, citing theresults from a recent YouGov poll. “This is not a both-sides problem. If both sides have a problem, one side has a much bigger and malignant problem, and that is the truth.”On the show, Vance also interviewed Kirk’s friends and political allies, showing how Kirk worked to keep the warring factions of the right aligned behind Trump and tried to bring in other political movements by elevating them into roles in the administration. They shared how Kirk was omnipresent in the transition after Trump won the White House.Robert F Kennedy Jr said Kirk was a “spiritual soulmate” to him and that his endorsement of Trump, at a Turning Point rally in Arizona amid fireworks and sparklers on stage, was “Charlie’s orchestration”. Kirk helped shepherd Kennedy into his role as health secretary, Kennedy said, and also helped his daughter-in-law get a role in the administration.On breaks between guests, the live stream rolled footage of Kirk during his typical college campus visits debating about the Trump administration’s first 100 days or the left’s views on immigration.Since Kirk’s killing, Turning Point USA has seen a massive rise in inquiries to start new chapters on high school and college campuses. Andrew Kolvet, a spokesman for the organization, said on X that the group received over 32,000 inquiries over the course of two days. Turning Point currently has about 900 official college chapters and 1,200 high school chapters.“Charlie’s vision to have a Club America chapter (our high school brand) in every high school in America (around 23,000) will come true much much faster than he could have ever possibly imagined,” Kolvet wrote.Explore more on these topicsJD VanceCharlie Kirk shootingTrump administrationRepublicansDemocratsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.” Bessent added that the Chinese team had made “aggressive asks” during negotiations, but did not explain what they were.Li Chenggang, the top Chinese trade negotiator, confirmed later on Monday that two sides had reached a basic framework consensus on resolving issues related to TikTok through cooperation, reducing investment barriers and promoting trade. Li said friction between the two economic giants was normal, but warned Washington against continued “suppression” of Chinese companies.“We would like to stress that the outcomes of the trade and economic consultations are hard won, and the US side should not, on the one hand, askChinato accommodate its concerns, whilst at the same time continue to suppress Chinese companies,” Li said in Madrid.The framework agreement is a breakthrough in the long-running dispute over TikTok’s ownership, which has raised national security concerns in Washington over the app’s Chinese parent company ByteDance. In April 2024,Joe Biden signed legislationthat gave ByteDance nine months to sell the platform to a US-approved buyer or face a total ban – a deadline thatDonald Trumphasrepeatedlyextended.The US is estimated to have over135 million active userson the platform, including the White House, which launched its own official account in August, despite the fact that government devices themselves arestill prohibitedfrom using the app under federal law.TikTok briefly went dark in January when the ban took effect, displaying messages that the app was unavailable under US law. Trump reversed the shutdown within hours of taking office, signing an executive order to delay enforcement for 75 days before extending the deadline again and again. Apple and Google had removed TikTok from their app stores during the brief blackout but restored access after government assurances they would face no penalties.Washington’s security concerns center on fears that Beijing could manipulate the massively popular platform to spy on Americans or influence public opinion. Christopher Wray, the former FBI director,warned senatorsthat China’s national security laws could compel ByteDance to hand over user data or suppress content, and the Department of Justice last year said TikTok had gathered the sensitive data of American users based off gun control, abortion and religion through its use of Lark, a workplace communication platform similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams,according to court documents.Security experts have long pointed to three main areas of concern: Chinese influence campaigns, mass data collection on US citizens, and potential vulnerabilities that could compromise users’ devices.The TikTok ownership saga stretches back to 2020, when Trump first ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a shutdown. Microsoft initially pursued a potential acquisition worth billions of dollars, with CEO Satya Nadella engaging directly with Trump, but it fell apart in what Nadella dubbed at the time “the strangest deal” he has ever worked on.Soon after, Walmart and Oraclecame closeto buying TikTok’s US arm, proposing a joint acquisition of a new entity called TikTok Global, but it was shelved indefinitely after the Biden administration conducted its own review of Chinese tech companies.Oracle has remainedTikTok’s US cloud providersince 2022 in a deal aimed at addressing security concerns.Bessent said final details would be settled when Trump speaks with Xi Jinping, China’s president, on Friday. Trump hinted that the deal was in the making while all sides were still at the table, posting onTruth Socialthat “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much want to save. They will be very happy!”Greer confirmed that the agreement was now awaiting approval from both leaders.“We’re not going to be in the business of having repetitive extensions,” Greer said. “We have a deal.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokChinaTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We see it right now in the US with a huge brain drain and capital drain, as whole sectors are being de-invested or even attacked.”Consistency in the direction of UK policy over the last 20 years – when successiveLabourand Conservative governments vowed to press ahead with tackling the climate crisis, until Rishi Sunak’s premiership – had benefited the economy, he said.In his first interview since being appointed in July, Topping said: “It’s been a real strength of the UK. That’s one of the main reasons to be concerned about the fragmenting political consensus, is if we start to signal to the world that we’re going to flip-flop, like the US.”The government could do more to cut theprice of electricity for consumers, which would benefit both households and businesses, he added. At present, the way theUK’s privatised electricity market works means that the price of electricity is usually set by the price of gas, which has been high and volatile.“The thing driving high costs now is gas,” Topping said. “Very high gas prices right now have added to borrowing because the government’s had to support business and citizens.“So we’re very confident there are big economic savings, particularly on electrification, which gives a big efficiency benefit. And there’s a massive energy security benefit. Our energy imports will reduce more than 75%.”Market reforms and shifting green levies that currently fall on electricity into general taxation, would lower prices across the economy, he argued.View image in fullscreenNigel Topping, the UK’s new climate adviser, warned that ‘flip-flopping is not good for investment’.Photograph: Dominika Zarzycka/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockRelying on fossil fuels also stores up problems, he pointed out. A future spike in gas prices could add 13% of GDP to our borrowing, according to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility.Topping, 59, rejected arguments thatextracting more gas from the North Seawould help.“It’s a basin in terminal decline, it’s going to reduce by 85% by 2050 anyway. So why would you do it? There’s no way of saving the 200,000 jobs in the North Sea, which is sometimes declared,” he said.As gas prices are set internationally, more UK production would not make energy cheaper. Expanding production would alsodamage the UK’s credibility on climate action, he said.Topping, who spent 18 years in manufacturing before moving into climate advocacy in 2007, was the UN high-level champion for climate action at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021.“The evidence is very strong that we can do [net zero] and it will be to the significant benefit of the economy, both macroeconomically and microeconomically,” he said.“Like any investment, there’s an upfront cost. Our advice shows that it’s about 0.2% of GDP [most of which will come from the private sector]. But by the back end of the next decade [from 2035] you reap the benefit.”While he cannot prescribe policies, Topping can give broad directional advice. The CCC’s most recent assessment of progress towards the 2050 net zero targetfound the UK was getting back on track in several areas, after years of inadequate policy under the Conservatives.But there are still figures in the Labour government who want to weaken net zero policy, toecho stances taken by the Tories under Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK.There were rumours in Westminster thatadvisers to Keir Starmer wanted Ed Miliband, energy security secretary, moved in the recent reshuffle, but he resisted.Faced with opposition from the right, Topping insists that policy should be based on facts and evidence. “If narratives are developed which aren’t backed up by evidence, we need to be really careful,” he said.The UK could evenreach net zero as early as 2045, Topping believes – though this is not official CCC advice. Other greenhouse gases would take slightly longer but could still be reduced to net zero by 2050, he said.Despite the directions taken by Reform and the Tories, Topping sees a strong mandate for climate action among the UK public.“The evidence that we see is that people recognise that bold, strong action needs to be taken,” he said, noting that the CCC has been closely involved with citizens’ panels.“The majority are supportive of action and want it explained and want it to be fair.“What we’re concerned about is arguments being developed which are not supported by robust evidence for political purposes, and so we will make sure that we see that we’re providing evidence which allows people to make informed decisions based on solid evidence.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyClimate crisisEnergyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

They have also been dehydrated, with no puddles to drink from.Spawning pools for Atlantic salmon and natterjack toads have also dried up, Natural England said, which means they had a bad breeding season.Wetland birds such as the shoveler duck and the curlew have also seen their marshy habitat disappear during the dry weather.Natural England also said that important peatlands have been drying out and at least 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of land on sites of special scientific interest have been destroyed by wildfire.How can England possibly be running out of water?Read moreThere have been seven consecutive months of below average rainfall, which hasplunged the country into drought conditions. Despite recent heavy rain, reservoirs and groundwater remain at low levels. Reservoirs fell by 1.4% last week, and are now 56.1% full on average across England. The average for this time of year is 82.8%. Last month capped a hot and dry summer that was the warmest on record for the UK since 1884, and the majority of England recorded less than half the average rainfall for August.The water shortfall situation in England has been defined as a “nationally significant incident” based on the number of areas affected and the impact being seen in the environment.Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, said: “Drought conditions are having a catastrophic effect on our flora and fauna, which lasts long after rain returns. Some Atlantic salmon streams have dried up and there are declining populations of wetland birds and amphibians. Garden animals such as hedgehogs are dying because their insect-based food sources disappear during drought.“We need to take action now to make our landscapes more resilient, including through the creation of more wetlands to help cope with the effects of both drought and flood.”The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) has noticed berries ripening weeks early in its gardens across the country. This has led to fears for birds and other animals, as if the fruit is out too early this may mean a dearth during the later autumn and early winter, when food is scarce.Guy Barter, the chief horticulturist at the RHS, said: “A dearth of berries in later winter, because they ripened now, could lead to birds going short of food.Birdsneed frequent meals and are reported to not have large food/fat reserves to fall back on unlike, say dormice. It may be wise for people to double down on feeding birds this winter.”Barter added that blackberries, cotoneaster, hawthorn and holly are out already, but that some plants such as pyracantha and ivy have not got ripe berries yet. “Therefore, when planting for wildlife it would be prudent to plant a wide variety of berrying plants for a spread of berry maturity,” he advised.Mark Roberts, a water management specialist at the National Trust, said: “This year’s drought has left a clear mark on nature. Dried-up springs in the Lake District have impacted water supplies and depleted water bodies have caused the death of fish. Both our newly planted and ancient trees have struggled since early spring, with usually lush flower borders in our gardens showing real signs of stress, hampering their ability to provide food and shelter for a variety of insects including bees and amphibians such as frogs.Experts have warned it will take a wet autumn and winter to reverse the impacts of seven continuous months of below average rainfall.Explore more on these topicsDroughtNatural EnglandConservationBirdsWildlifeFishnewsShareReuse this content"

Enfield council’s planning committeeapproved the proposals in February, despite local protests, on greenbelt parkland rich in bats, newts and mature trees.The approval came despite local protests about shutting the public out of a swath of the park and the council handing a 25-year lease to Tottenham Hotspur for £2m.Benny Hawksbee, the chair of the Guardians of Whitewebbs, said the group was “blown away” by donations from more than 800 backers, including Spurs fans outraged by the club’s plans.ThePublic Interest Law Centre, representing the Guardians, has filed an application to take judicial review proceedings, claiming the council breached the Local Government Act 1972.The grounds for the case include a claim that the council misled its planning committee on the issue of biodiversity net gain, that it failed to properly assess the impact of the development on the green belt and that the decision was tainted by apparent bias.Hawksbee said Spurs should “allow women to use the club’s 17 elite pitches available at their ‘world-class training ground’ in Enfield. The overwhelming majority of Premiership clubs do not segregate men and women footballers in this way. If they allowed the players equal footing, there would be no need to take away our precious public park.”Campaigners wereunsuccessful last year in a high court challengeover the granting of the 25-year lease to Spurs but the new judicial review is based on fresh grounds over the granting of planning permission.Less than two months after planning permission was granted, a 500-year-old oak tree was felled within a separate part of the park.Mitchells & Butlers Retail (MBR), which runs a Toby Carvery pub where the tree was felled,apologised for the upset caused by the fellingand claimed it was necessary for safety reasons because the tree was dead or diseased.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In 2022, it became thefirst state in the country to make school meals freefor all students, regardless of income. Many districts have implementedfarm-to-school programsto bring local foods into the cafeteria. And last year, months before the “Make America healthy again” movement would make its way to the White House, it became the first state in the nation toban six synthetic food dyesfrom school meals.This week, it passed legislation that will put it in the lead on school meals in yet another way – banning ultra-processed foods. On Friday,Californialawmakers passed a bill that will define, and then ban, ultra-processed foods from school meals. The legislation, which must now be signed by the governor, Gavin Newsom, is believed to include the first statutory definition of ultra-processed foods in the world.“We have so far found a formula that we think works and can help guide the national conversation on these issues,” saidCaliforniastate assembly member Jesse Gabriel, who sponsored the bill. That formula, he said, is “bipartisan, common sense, science-based”.Ultra-processed foods, or UPFs, are industrially formulated products that are often high in fats, starches, sugars and additives, and make up73% of the US food supplytoday. Think fast food, microwave dinners, sodas, chips, and even packaged bread and sweetened yoghurts.Junk food leads to more children being obese than underweight for first timeRead moreAlthough nutritionists have been talking about UPFs for more than a decade, the US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr – a longtime pseudoscience proponent – made them a household term through his “Make America healthy again” coalition. While the federal governmenthas yet to take any significant stepsto rein in UPFs – Kennedy’s rhetoric, and growing concerns over the safety of the food supply, have spurred more states to begin assessing ways they can limit UPFs.But much of that work began in California. In 2023, the legislature passeda first-in-the-nation law, also sponsored by Gabriel, to ban four chemicals already prohibited in the European Union and other nations.“It really blew my mind how out of step the United States is with the rest of the world when it comes to food safety,” said Gabriel. “We don’t love our kids here in the United States any less than they love their kids in Sweden or Saudi Arabia or South Korea. So why is it that they are taking stronger measures to protect their kids than we are?”More than 20 other states have copied California’s ban on those four chemicals, or its similar ban onsix synthetic food dyesin school meals.Although it’s the first state to define UPFs, California is far from the only one to consider ways to remove them from school meals and the broader food supply. According to researchers at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, lawmakers in at least 18 states have introduced more than 40 pieces of legislation that would restrict the sale of foods with certain additives. This year, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Utah and West Virginia have all passed laws that will ban foods containing certain dyes and additives from school meals.“There’s something so interesting about California and West Virginia bookending the country both physically, but also with this issue around food safety,” said Bernadette del Chiaro, senior vice-president for California at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy group focused on environmental and agricultural policy, which has backed the California law.Although Kennedy has spoken out against UPFs from his post in Donald Trump’s Republican administration, Democratic states and lawmakers have raised concerns about food safety as well. But red and blue states have taken different approaches to defining the UPFs they seek to ban.Ingredient red flags: how to spot the chemicals to avoid in food, kitchenware and cosmeticsRead more“It is really hard to define an ultra processed food,” said del Chiaro. “We all kind of know what junk food is when we see it, but putting that definition in writing that has the force of law behind it is” more difficult.Food policy experts have generally followed a system calledthe Nova classificationto define UPFs, but even nutritionists sometimes disagree over what counts as a UPF. The Nova classification categorizes a product as “ultra-processed” if it’s industrially formulated to be “edible, palatable and habit-forming”. But because that definition is based on processing, not specific ingredients, it can be difficult to agree on exactly which foods fall into the category.Lindsey Smith Taillie, a professor of nutrition and co-director of the GlobalFoodResearch Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said she and her colleagues have noted three different approaches states are taking to define the UPFs they seek to ban.The most common definition of UPFs is foods that include any of about a dozen additives, “primarily artificial food dyes and then a couple emulsifiers or dough conditioners”, said Smith Taillie. A handful of other states, such as Texas and Louisiana, have used a definition that includes about 40 additives, she said, though there’s no clear through-line for why those additives were chosen, as they include some that have already been banned in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. California, she said, stands out for taking “the most rigorous approach to evaluating the science”.“California is the state that is coming the closest so far to trying to actually take action on this concept of UPFs as it has been defined in the literature, which I think is important because that’s where the evidence of health harm is,” Smith Taillie said. “When we look at what a lot of these states are doing with a super-narrow definition of additive, there’s really no body of evidence that suggests that that’s going to make an impact on health.”The text of California’s new law defines a UPF as any food or beverage that contains stabilizers, thickeners, propellants, colors, emulsifiers, flavoring agents, flavor enhancers, nonnutritive sweeteners or surface-active agents – and has high amounts of saturated fat, sodium or added sugar, or nonnutritive sweeteners.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionDel Chiaro, of the Environmental Working Group, hopes California’s definition might lead the way for other states and school districts.“Shifting the purchasing decisions of the fourth-largest economy in the world, and the most populous state in the country, I think will have an absolute, positive effect on the buying options that other school districts have,” she said. “I think there will be a snowball effect here that’ll help kids all across America.”Dating back to the 1970s, scholars havedescribeda “California effect” in which other jurisdictions or industries adopt the regulatory standards set by one region – often California – because it is more efficient to apply the same standards everywhere. The first of those regulations forced automakers to abide by the state’s clean air policies, and more recent ones have aimed to eliminate single-use plastics.But implementing a ban on UPFs in California school meals will take more work than simply defining UPFs, food policy experts say.Alternatives to UPFs “would require, by definition, more cooking”, said Smith Taillie. “The only way to really do that would be, you would have to increase labor cost.”Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food policy at New York University, agrees.“Taking UPFs out of school meals means providing kids with whole, not UPF, foods. These either have to come pre-prepared or cooked on site,” she said in an email. “USDA reimbursements have to cover not only the food; they also have to cover staff salaries, equipment and supplies.”“Schools turn to UPFs because they are cheaper and save staff time,” she added. “Taking UPFs out of schools has to be coupled to higher reimbursement rates or it won’t work.”In the process of passing this bill, Gabriel said many legislators had the same concern about cost. But what they found was that it’s often cheaper to eliminate UPFs. “What was very helpful to us there is that there are a number of districts in California that have already moved in this direction. And so we actually had food service directors come in and testify,” he said. “Not only had it not cost them more, but in many districts they had actually saved money by switching to healthier alternatives.”He shares an example of switching from serving a syrup with pancakes that contains high fructose corn syrup, cellulose gum, caramel color and other hard-to-pronounce ingredients to one that solely contains maple syrup. In many cases, it’s not a change that is “necessarily gonna cost districts more”, he said.Del Chiaro of the Environmental Working Group agrees that omitting UPFs doesn’t have to be expensive, and “isn’t likely to have a massive impact of any kind on school budgets”.“This bill is not mandating that everybody buy organic $6-a-carton blueberries,” she said. “All we’re doing is getting rid of the particularly harmful ultra-processed foods on the lunch tray.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaOur unequal earthUltra-processed foodsSchoolsChildrenFoodNutritionWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over as a national party, over as the principal opposition to the left.”His defection comes weeks after the Conservative leader,Kemi Badenoch, said Tories who “want to jump ship” to Reform UK are “welcome to do so”.In a statement announcing his switch, Kruger accused the Tories of clinging to “defunct institutions”, and said they have been operating under “sham unity” since their general election defeat last year which has left them in “stasis”.He said it was even “too late” to save the Tories under a new leader such as Robert Jenrick, whose leadership bid Kruger supported last year.He said: “We on the right of politics face a choice. To embrace the change that is happening or to go down to a deserved demise. To follow the flame of conservatism as it passes to a new torch or to stand still and get darker and colder and more pointless.“To be conservative is not to worship the ashes of defunct institutions. It is to preserve the fire that gives our country its life.“The new custodian of that fire, the best hope we have, maybe our last hope, and I fervently hope the next prime minister, isNigel Farage.”The defection is the first from a sitting MP and member of the shadow frontbenchsinceReform’s surge in the polls this summer. Standing alongside the Reform leader, Kruger said the party was now “getting serious as a government in waiting”.Kruger, 50, is the son of Prue Leith, a restaurateur, TV presenter, cookery writer and novelist. The Eton-educated MP rejected claims his background meant he did not understand the concerns of working-class voters unhappy with the system.He has been appointed Reform UK’s head of “preparing for government” and said all of their plans going forward would be fully costed.Kruger distanced himself from remarks he made in the Commons two months ago that Reform UK would “spend money like drunken sailors”.Kruger told the Guardian he had rejected Reform UK’s welfare policies, but Farage had since committed to welfare reform. The Reform leader said his party would be hosting a press conference next week to address the numbers.Kruger said: “What we are doing today is announcing a process of getting serious as a government in waiting. We are not being arrogant, certainly not hubristic about the expectation of winning. We are ahead in the polls, it doesn’t mean it is going to stay that way.“We are not predicting victory. But we are anticipating victory, and we are doing the responsible thing, as Nigel said earlier, of ensuring that if we are fortunate enough to win the support of the public, we will be ready with a plan.”Kruger said he had “no idea” whether other Conservative MPs were in talks with Reform about defecting, but added that he hoped his former colleagues would “follow me”.Farage, responding, said: “We keep everything under wraps. When we have negotiations, nothing leaks. None of you had a clue that Danny would be joining us today and that is how we operate.”Asked how damaging the defection was to her leadership, Badenoch went on the defensive.She told broadcasters: “Danny has made his case very clear that this is not about me. I can’t be distracted by that and I’m not going to get blown off course by these sorts of incidents.Nigel Farage admits breaching parliamentary rules over Trump eventRead more“I know that this is the sort of thing that is going to happen while a party is changing. I am making sure that people understand what Conservative values are.”A Tory MP told the Guardian the news was “very upsetting” and was a “terribly bad look” for the party as they accused Kruger – first elected at the 2019 general election – of not really helping the Conservatives with their fight.“It seems like Reform will just be filled with a lot of washed-up 2019-ers. Our whip should’ve been on top of this,” the MP said.Danny Kruger takes Reform back to full strength – so who’ll be next to quit? | John CraceRead moreLee Anderson told the Politics Inside Out podcast Boris Johnson wouldn’t be welcomed in Reform. “No we don’t want him. I like Boris a lot … he’s got this stuff that you can bottle up like a charisma is infectious. People want to be around you, talk to you and you know, be in the same room. It’s nice to have that.

He wanted to please everybody and in politics you’ve got to pick a side.”Responding to Kruger’s defection, a Labour spokesperson said: “Every Conservative who defects to Reform ties Nigel Farage more closely to their record of failure.“Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes, it won’t change the fact that he has no plan for Britain.“The Tories crashed our economy and left public services crumbling. Britain deserves better than Reform’s Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price.“Only this Labour government is driving forwards delivery to make working people better off and give our country the renewal it needs.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKConservativesNigel FarageKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

Numbers have ballooned by 80% since 2018.Among the protesters were Rebecca Emmanuel, 42, from southLondon, and her 16-year-old son, Joshua, who was born at 24 weeks and has needed intensive support throughout his life. “My worry is if these cuts happen, they will cut back on the support that my son gets at the moment, and that’s really helped him,” Emmanuel said.Her friend Lesley Gordon, 43, whose seven-year-old son, Kai, has an EHCP and is in a special needs school for children with autism, is also worried. “Every child matters. If they make any more cuts it will really affect our children,” she said.The government is expected to outline its plans in the schools white paper to be published later in the autumn. There are fears it could lead to a rebellion, similar to that which forced the government to gut its welfare bill after a major backlash from backbenchers.Davey, whose own son has special educational needs, warned protesters gathered in the shadow of Big Ben that a “big fight” lay ahead. He said change was needed but added: “I am really worried that the reform that we might get offered won’t meet the needs of our children and young people.View image in fullscreenEd Davey said changes to special needs education were needed, but a ‘big fight’ lay ahead.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“So we’ve got to monitor this government like never before. We’ve seen them promise a lot and then not deliver. And what I say to Keir Starmer, [the education secretary]Bridget Phillipsonand the government is, ‘this is the last chance saloon for you. Get this wrong and you are out’.”The warning came as the prime minister’s troubles continued to mount. Responding to the protest, Phillipson said engagement with parents had shown “there are elements of EHCPs they value”, but “we need to call time on the battles to access support and bureaucracy that too many of them continue to face”.View image in fullscreenAshley Millhouse, centre, said she was ‘really worried’ about her son, who is struggling in mainstream school, losing his additional support.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianAshley Millhouse, 38, an enhanced teaching assistant (TA) in a Send school, travelled down from Durham to fight for her “hero”: her eight-year-old son, Alfie, who has an EHCP after being diagnosed with autism. He is struggling and in mainstream school, where he receives additional support in the mornings, but his mother says he needs more. She fears he may get less under the government’s changes.“I’m really worried. He does not get enough support now. The thought of him getting less … it would be so detrimental for his future,” Millhouse said. “I’m not big on politics, but I believe our children all have a right to an education. Our children matter. I want nothing but the best for my child.”View image in fullscreen‘We need help,’ said Kate Faxen, whose daughter has not attended school since Christmas 2024.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianKate Faxen, 47, a council worker from Enfield, north London, said her 15-year-old daughter had not been to school since Christmas 2024. She has an autism diagnosis, as well as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and pathological demand avoidance. She has an EHCP which covers funding for specialist provision, but everywhere is full.“Bridget Phillipson is talking about getting more children [with special needs] into mainstream. But my child could not cope,” said Faxen. “They should be taking the burden off the parents. There’s far too much on us. The hours I put in. People say, ‘don’t worry, I’m sure it’s going to be OK’. But nothing about this is OK. We need help.”A debate was due to take place in parliament later on Monday, triggered by an e-petition calling on the government to retain the legal right to assessment and support in education for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). The petition attracted more than 120,000 signatories.Phillipson said: “We inherited a system on its knees, forcing families to fight for every scrap of support. That’s why we are listening to parents and taking action – investing £1bn into Send and £750m in specialist school places, rolling out a new inclusion-centred training curriculum, and improving early intervention for ADHD, autism and speech and language needs. But in a system so broken, there is much more to do.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsChildrenAutismAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderDisabilityEd DaveyBridget PhillipsonnewsShareReuse this content"

Kearney is now the northern editor at Irish broadcaster RTE.In documents submitted to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT),MI5conceded it obtained phone data from Kearney on two occasions in 2006 and 2009.Jude Bunting KC, representing Kearney and the BBC, told a hearing on Monday: “The MI5 now confirms publicly that in 2006 and 2009 MI5 obtained communications data in relation to Vincent Kearney.”He said the security service accepted it had breached Kearney’s rights under article 8 and article 10 of the European convention on human rights. They relate to the right to private correspondence and the right to impart information without interference from public authorities.View image in fullscreenVincent Kearney, who now works for Irish broadcaster RTE.“This appears to be the first time in any tribunal proceedings in which MI5 publicly accept interference with a journalist’s communications data, and also publicly accept that they acted unlawfully in doing so,” Bunting said.He claimed the concessions that it accessed the journalist’s data represented “serious and sustained illegality on the part of MI5”.A BBC spokesperson said: “MI5’s admission that it illegally obtained communications data of a BBC journalist is a matter of grave concern. It raises serious and important questions that we will continue to pursue.”Bunting told the tribunal that police forces had also made admissions about obtaining Kearney’s communications data from 2012. He said they admitted storing it and then handing some of it on to Durham constabulary in 2018.The tribunal heard the force’s authorisations related to its investigations into themurder of police officer Stephen Carroll in 2009and to an investigation into the leak of information from the PONI.Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland director, said the disclosure from MI5 was “profoundly alarming”.“A journalist’s right to protect their sources is not a luxury, it is the bedrock of a free and fearless press,” he said. “This is not just about one journalist, it is about the public’s right to know the truth.“What is now urgently required is full transparency, genuine accountability and an end to this pattern of unlawful intrusion.”Kearney took legal action following information that emerged in the case of journalists Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney.In a landmark judgment last year, the IPT found the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and theMetropolitan policehad unlawfully carried out covert surveillance on the two Belfast-based journalists.Details disclosed in that case suggested that public bodies, including police forces, had spied on Kearney. At the time, McCaffrey and Birney said they believed there was “no doubt” reporters continue to be targeted in the UK.The pair were wrongfully arrested in 2018 after they produced No Stone Unturned, anaward-winning documentaryalleging collusion between police and loyalist paramilitaries in a notorious Troubles massacre.Explore more on these topicsMI5UK security and counter-terrorismBBCHuman rightsNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

It was Grade-II listed in 2016.With buildings that were innovative in both design and engineering, Grimshaw was regarded as a forerunner of architecture’shi-tech movementalong with Norman Foster, Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano. However, he disliked the term, telling the Guardian in 2018: “Hi-tech sounds like a stylistic movement. We see ourselves as very solidly grounded in Paxton and Brunel” – the great architects of the Victorian era.His work, however, looked anything but Victorian. The Eden Project, whichwas built in a disused clay pit, is made up of a series of interlocking geodesic domes supported by tubular steel and housing 5,000 varieties of plant life.View image in fullscreenThe geodesic domes of the Eden Project opened to the public in 2001.Photograph: John Barratt/AlamyThe Eurostar terminal, dominated by a sinuously curving, 400 metre-long roof, won both the Mies van der Rohe award and the Riba building of the year award (now the Stirling prize) when it opened in 1994. “It seems run-of-the-mill now,” Grimshaw told the Guardian’s architecture critic Oliver Wainwright in 2018, “but it was a huge emotional thrill at the time, to be connected to Europe like this. I suppose it’s particularly ironic now, given the absolutely crazy decision to leave the EU.”The Brits who built the modern worldRead moreGrimshaw’s firm won a second Stirling prize last year for its work on the Elizabeth line inLondon. It designed the underground parts of the stations in collaboration with AtkinsRéalis, which was responsible for the engineering, as well as the firms Maynard and Equation. The architect said he believed there was “something heroic” about railway stations, “with the excitement of departure and the exhilaration of arrival”.He was knighted for his services to architecture in 2002, served as the president of the Royal Academy from 2004 to 2011 and wasawarded the Riba gold medal in 2018. His firm, which announced his death, described him as “a man of invention and ideas” who had an “extraordinary ability to convince others that daring ideas were possible”.Though other architects explored stylistic avenues such as postmodernism, Grimshaw strove to make his work as lightweight, sustainable and pure as possible. “I see the practice of architecture as similar to boat-building,” he said. “It’s about materials and structures doing real things, as opposed to decorative things.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureEden ProjectCornwallLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

It also found that rates of intimate partner violence were 2.5 times lower in countries that had introduced comprehensive measures on violence.But 676 million women and girls lived within 30 miles (50km) of a deadly conflict event in 2024 – the highest number recorded since the 1990s.Womenare also more likely than men to be affected by a global increase in food insecurity.By 2050, under a worst-case climate scenario, up to 158.3 million more women and girls globally may live in extreme poverty (subsisting on less than $2.15 a day) as a result of climate change. Nearly half could be in sub-Saharan Africa.“When systems are in place that really put women and girls at their heart, we see very concrete progress,” said Sarah Hendriks, director of UN Women’s policy division.View image in fullscreenAn Afghan woman begs for alms in Kabul during a snowstorm in January. More than 350 million women and girls are likely to be in extreme poverty by 2030.Photograph: AFP/Getty“But what the gender snapshot shows is that progress hasn’t been fast enough – there is both stagnation [and] regression,” she added.The proportion of women and girls living in extreme poverty has hovered at 10% since 2020, the report found, and on current trends more than 351 million will remain in that status by 2030.Hendriks contrasted$2.7tn (£2tn) of military spendingannually with calculations in the report that it would cost $420bn a year to advance gender equality. “That’s a drop in the bucket,” she said.Adigital gender dividemeans 70% of men globally use the internet compared with 65% of women, but initiatives to address that could lift 30 million women and girls out of poverty by 2050, and generate a $1.5tn windfall in global GDP by 2030, the authors calculated.Not just resisting, but leading the fight: five women who refuse to be ignoredRead moreThe snapshot monitors progress on gender equality across the 17sustainable development goals (SDGs)adopted in 2015.The world is off track to meet SDG targets in 2030, but “a different path is still possible”, the report said.Thirty years after theBeijing Declaration and Platform for Actionset out a blueprint for gender equality, UN Women hasasked governments to commit to renewed actionat the UN general assembly in New York this month.“We now have over 86 countries around the world who have submitted very ambitious commitments,” said Hendriks.“It can seem very hopeless, but in actual fact, we can choose a world where millions more women do not remain trapped in poverty or sidelined from power or exposed to violence. We actually can choose a world where women’s rights are delivered at scale and that the returns of that are shared by all.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentWomen's rights and gender equalityWomenWomen's healthUnited NationsGenderPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

US district judge Carl Nichols in Washington said FAA had satisfied its obligation “to take a hard look at the effects of light on nearby wildlife”.Donald Trump signed anexecutive orderon 13 August – titled Enabling Competition in the Commercial Space Industry – that wouldrelax environmental rulesfor commercial spaceship companies, apparently benefitting Elon Musk. The companies may be able to forgo the environmental reviews that are required under the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa).Private space companies are required to obtain launch permits from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). And, as part of that process, companies are subject to review under Nepa.These environmental reviews are required because rocket launches and landings can be enormously disruptive to local towns and residents, along with the natural surroundings. Exhaust, smoke plumes and sonic booms created at launch can injure and kill endangered species, and detritus from exploded rocket parts returning to Earth can harm fish and marine animals with hazardous material spills, fuel slicks and falling objects.Trump said it was imperative to national security that the private rocket-ship industry increase launches “substantially” by 2030.SpaceX has beenseeking to increase its rocket launchesand landings around the country even as it has been embroiled in the lawsuit brought by environmental groups for violating the National Environmental Policy Act. The groups say the FAA did not do a thorough enough environmental assessment of SpaceX’s impact to endangered species regarding its rocket launches in Boca Chica, Texas.The lawsuit looked at the first launch of SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket inTexasin April 2023. The rocket, which is designed to one day make it to Mars, pulverized its launchpad on takeoff, sending chunks of concrete flying six miles (10km) away. The blast ignited a grassfire that burned nearly 1.5 hectares (4 acres) of state park and, from what is known, destroyed a nest of bobwhite quail eggs and a collection of blue land crabs.The FAA announced in May that it had given SpaceX permission to increase its number of Starship launches in Texas from five per year to 25. SpaceX has also been seeking toincrease launchesof its smaller Falcon rockets from Vandenberg space force base in California from 50 per year to 95.Dara Kerr contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsSpaceXTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

Of the 1,065 people onboard, 30 died when the ship’s propellers snagged two lifeboats, the culture ministry said.The project to document the wreck and its contents was carried out in May by an 11-member team of professional deep-sea divers, using closed-circuit diving equipment.The research was organised by the British amateur historian Simon Mills, the founder of the Britannic Foundation, and supervised by a department within the Greek culture ministry responsible for underwater archaeology.The ministry said: “Conditions at the wreck site were particularly challenging due to currents, depth and low visibility,” adding that certain objects initially selected could not be retrieved because of their location and preservation status.The retrieved objects include the ship’s observation post bell, the portside signal lamp, various items of portable equipment from first and second class, ceramic tiles that had decorated a Turkish bath, and a pair of binoculars.They were transported to the specialised department’s laboratories in Athens for further conservation and were to feature in a permanent exhibition at a new museum of underwater antiquities under construction in Piraeus, the ministry said.The third vessel of the group, the RMS Olympic, sailed from 1911 to 1935, undergoing safety improvements after the Titanic sank in 1912.Explore more on these topicsGreeceThe TitanicNorthern IrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

When the song went through the roof, he came to me, bent over and said, “Kick my ass!”’Interviews byHenry YatesMon 15 Sep 2025 09.45 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 13.34 EDTShareKlaus Meine, vocals/songwriterBeing a West German band made playing the Soviet Union in the late 1980s particularly special. We’d grown up in a divided country and had tried many times to play in EastGermany, but they would never let us in. When we did our first gig in what was then Leningrad, the atmosphere was a bit grey, not very colourful or rock’n’roll – but hearts started opening up over the course of the 10 gigs we did in the city. It ended up a bit like Beatlemania, with fans circling our cars after every show.In Leningrad, we realised we were being watched by the KGB. But when we played the Moscow Music Peace festival the following year, the soldiers in the stadium turned to face the bands, joined in the cheering and became part of the audience. It was like the world was changing in front of our eyes. Suddenly, with Mikhail Gorbachev in the Kremlin – and perestroika and glasnost – it was possible for this Russian Woodstock to happen. It was hard to believe that people had been sent to prison for listening to western rock music – because now there was a Russian audience going nuts to Rock You Like a Hurricane.In September, after I came home, I started fiddling around with my little keyboard. Wind of Change was not some kind of fantasy: it was one of those songs that comes from deep in your soul and you just try to express what you’ve lived through. The lyric refers to Moscow’s landmarks because when we played the festival there, all the bands went for a boat ride on the Moskva, all the way to Gorky Park.MTV wanted Bon Jovi to headline. The fans went crazy while we played – then Bon Jovi came on and they all leftThe whistling was a result of me having no guitar when I was writing it. The record company in the US later called me and said: “You have to take the whistle out.” I said: “No way.” When the song went through the roof, the same guy came to me, bending over and saying: “Klaus, I was wrong. Please forgive me – you can kick my ass!”Matthias Jabs did a wonderful kind of Hendrix guitar intro, while Rudolf Schenker played a fantastic guitar solo – and it all just came together. But not one of us thought about the political side of Wind of Change. Nobody had a master plan. For me, it was just a reflection of what we saw, this change in the air. It’s a song of hope for a peaceful future, perfect for that historical moment.When Patrick Radden Keefe – a very serious journalist from the New Yorker – confronted me with the theory that the CIA wrote Wind of Change to bring the cold war to an end, I had to laugh. Not in your wildest dreams would you think of something like that. But in the end,his podcastwas a huge promotion for the song.A line in Wind of Change says: “We could be so close, like brothers.” That was exactly the way we felt at the Moscow Music Peace festival. Now, 35 years later, it’s like the clock is ticking backwards. It’s very sad.Rudolf Schenker, guitarIn Leningrad, we were playing to over 10,000 people each night. By the time of the Moscow Music Peace festival, we were big in Russia. But MTV wantedBon Jovito headline. The fans went crazy while we played – then Bon Jovi came on and they all left the stadium. We saw Jon Bon Jovi do an interview later that night and he said: “I’ll never play after the Scorpions again!”We could already feel the world drastically changing. And after we came back from Moscow, Klaus called me and said: “I have a song.” Normally, Klaus didn’t write music, just lyrics. But he played me Wind of Change and I told him: “It’s great, but there’s one thing missing – a chorus.” He came back with the full song when we went to Vancouver to record the Crazy World album.I worked hard on the guitar solo, because I’d realised the song’s potential. I’m not the best guitarist – normally I’m the rhythm player. So I remember sitting with my headphones on, tracking take after take, trying to put down a solo that would lift up the lyrics for a powerful finale.Wind of Change was released in January 1991, and I said to Klaus: “You know what? We also have to record a version in Russian.” Pirate radio was born at that time in Russia, and at six every morning, they’d start by playing that song. It became the soundtrack to the most peaceful revolution on Earth. Now, we have a whole different world. In 2022, Klaus said, “I can’t sing Wind of Change the way it was” – and he changed the lyrics he sings live to ones that support Ukraine.The new Scorpions compilation, From the First Sting, is out on 26 September via BMGExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeBon JoviGermanyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s installation day for the sculpture he’s created for this year’sLondondesign festival and, like the many other visitors to one of the capital’s best known public spaces, he’s enjoying the sunshine.His new work – What Nelson Sees – looks good in the bright light. The fused bundle of weathered steel industrial pipes is eye-catchingly at odds with the grand fountains, statues and Victorian pomp of the massive bronze lions. But this sculpture is completely site-specific: press a play button and look into one of the eyepieces embedded into three of the five pipes and you see images of the surrounding city from the viewpoint of naval commander Horatio Nelson’s statue 45m up in the sky. Keep watching and the eyepiece plays a film which runs through AI-generated imagery of the view since before Nelson’s Column was first erected and then goes on into a possible future of pedestrianised streets and rooftops covered in hydroponics.“I grew up in London,” Cocksedge says, “and I always looked at Nelson’s solitary figure and wondered what it would be like up there. I’ve got sketchbooks going back to when I was a teenager full of ideas about how seeing that view could be possible.”View image in fullscreenAI-generated imagery … What Nelson Sees.Photograph: Mark CocksedgeMany of Cocksedge’s artworks plough this slightly eccentric furrow: concepts that come from a childlike imagination but realised with exceptional craftsmanship and engineering skills. His pieceCoalescenceconsists of 2,500 pieces of anthracite – suspended like a starburst – which represent the amount of coal needed to power a continuously burning lightbulb for a year. TheBourrasqueseries is inspired by light playing on airborne sheets of paper. The spectacle of magically floating paper is delightful (fashion brand Dior now has the artwork permanently installed in their Avenue Montaigne boutique in Paris), but the simple idea can only be achieved using hi-tech materials powered by an electric current.For What Nelson Sees, Cocksedge collaborated with Google to create a mainly AI film of Nelson’s field of view from when the column was first erected in the 1840s. Each scene – from the Blitz through the swinging 1960s to a future landscape adapted for London’s ageing population – is created using meticulous written prompts to ensure historical accuracy and to reflect statistically probable outcomes from research.“Technology had to be part of the work so it felt the right moment for me to experiment,” he says. “It’s very different to my art college days when you had paint and canvas, but I’ve got a four-year-old daughter and an almost 80-year-old dad – I want him to see the city change and I want her to see what the past was like. How else could I do that?”View image in fullscreenPaul Cocksedge in Trafalgar Square, London.Photograph: Stephen Chung/Alamy Live NewsThis whimsical creativity has a clear purpose. Cocksedge’s optimistic vision of London’s future is based on research from experts in climate change and urban planning. “Do you know, in Paris food production is 60% local, whereas in London it’s only 3%? That’s why in the future, we created hydroponics and a much greener city.”The artist believes that public art can be a great way to engage a diverse audience with issues, especially those who don’t often visit galleries.This piece isn’t finished until I see people gazing through the sculpture – their bodies are the last ingredient“My background is working class and my entry point into creativity came very late on. Looking around Trafalgar Square I can see people from different backgrounds interacting with things and that’s great to me. I’m so excited that you can use design to create open situations where you can reach more people and deal with quite important issues in an engaging way. This piece isn’t finished until I see three people gazing through the sculpture – their bodies are the last ingredient.”As the site of many protests, celebrations and rallies over the years, Trafalgar Square has seen all sorts of engagement between different factions, but Cocksedge is still optimistic. “I’m very aware of the challenges this city has. This square is a place that’s always charged. But we keep on going even if it feels dicey. I think London will cope.”The next day, I head down to the installation’s technical test with Elizabeth Dellert, head of development for the festival. Even in the brief time I’m there, about 20 passersby stop to peer into the eyepieces or touch the pipe structure curiously. A businessman whose meeting has been cancelled due to the transport strikes stops to ask about the sculpture. It turns out that he runs a mentoring service inspired by Nelson’s leadership strategy. A conversation instantly starts with Dellert, who studied history, about the influence of military infrastructure on business hierarchy, team loyalty and how Lady Emma Hamilton, Nelson’s mistress, deserves recognition.Watching tourists and locals pause at the sculpture and listening to this spontaneous conversation, I thought back to my conversation with Cocksedge and how his piece wouldn’t be finished until people – the missing ingredient – were there. I wished he’d been there to see this moment when it finally became complete.What Nelson Sees is in Trafalgar Square, London, until 18 September.

In their third film together, the rising Canadian actor is at once magnetic and utterly heartbreaking as Simon, a young gay artist honing a budding career as a drag queen. At night, he transforms into Glory Gore, a glittery vision dressed in exquisite costumes that have been lovingly designed by his sister Maude (Alice Moreault). Off stage, Simon is much less self-assured, despite his swagger. An unexpected visit from his absent mother Claire (Anne-Marie Cadieux), along with a toxic romance with fellow drag performer Olivier (Félix Maritaud), soon throw this sensitive soul into an emotional whirlpool.Dupuis’s astute writing keenly conveys the paradox of falling for a narcissistic manipulator. At first glance Olivier is a perfect creative and life partner, but soon whittles down Simon’s self-esteem with jabs about the latter’s talent and looks. As the relationship grows more dysfunctional, Dupuis pushes Pellerin to the edge of the frame, a visual correlation of his isolation among his real-life and drag family. Pellerin, moreover, embodies the character’s turmoil with stunning physicality; his quivering gaze betrays a vulnerability that starkly contrasts with his larger-than-life stage persona – and yet, like a boiling frog, he also luxuriates in the attention of his cruel lover.Performing, here, is a double-edged sword. Even when Simon leaves the nightclub, he is compelled to continue playing the part of the cool, obedient boyfriend. But Solo is far from yet another queer tragedy, making space for the joy of self-expression, rendered through dazzling sequences of thrilling drag performances that range from sexy and political to plain silly. At a time when this art form is increasingly under threat, such representations feel particularly essential and powerful.Solo is in UK and Irish cinemas from 19 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDragLGBTQ+ rightsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Roberto Benigni’s Italian comedy Johnny Stecchino is the exception. Yes, it’s farce, but it’s also sly social commentary, ridiculing the mafia without sanctifying its opposition, and playing with the gap between how things are and how they appear.Six years before his Oscar-winning role in Life is Beautiful introduced him to a global audience, Benigni wrote, directed and starred in this 1991 box office hit that instantly became a national classic. Stecchino is Italian for toothpick, and mafia boss Johnny Stecchino always has one between his lips, a prop that defines his swaggering persona.‘The energy is infectious’: why Bride and Prejudice is my feelgood movieRead moreI first saw the comedy on TV a few months after moving to Sardinia in 2003. Struggling to follow the plot, I kept mixing up Dante, the naive, banana-munching bus driver, with his doppelganger Johnny – both played by Benigni – who others often mistake him for. His name is no accident: Dante, like Italy’s great poet guiding readers through the DivineComedy. But this Dante stumbles through his own comic inferno with no map and no clue, surviving on oblivious charm. Even then, I recognised my own bewilderment in his incomprehension, and seeing it played for laughs made my confusion over cultural codes feel lighter.The story hurtles forward: Dante meets Maria, the gangster’s glamorous wife, played by Benigni’s own wife, Nicoletta Braschi, who sees in him a perfect solution. Lure him to Palermo, pass him off as her husband, and have him assassinated in Johnny’s place so she can escape the mafia for good. Dante is wined and dined, treated with baffling deference, and listens earnestly as a mobster, introduced as Johnny Stecchino’s uncle, gravely dispenses “truths”. He assures Dante that the cocaine he is offered is actually diabetes medicine, and later reveals the “true evil of Sicily” is not the mafia, but Palermo’s traffic. Dante nods with heartfelt conviction, as ifziohas finally voiced what he’s believed all along. Every scene teeters between menace and absurdity, yet Dante grins his way through.One of my favourite moments comes when Dante attends the opera with Maria. Mistaken for Johnny, he is told he’s an assassin. The camera cuts between the jeering crowd and his confused expression. Thinking they’re angry about the banana he stole earlier, he waves a banknote, insisting he meant to pay after the first act. The solemnity of the opera makes his misplaced apology even more absurd. It takes me back to an afternoon in Abruzzo, au pairing, when local friends told me the family’s money wasmacchiato di sangue– stained with blood. I pulled out a 5,000-lire note, saw it was clean, and shrugged. Both Dante and I carried on in ignorance, our literal interpretations shielding us from truths we couldn’t grasp.‘Visceral, sensual wonders’: why The Talented Mr Ripley is my feelgood movieRead moreThe comedy lies as much in the visuals as it does in the dialogue. Benigni’s performance is physical musicality: a loping gait and a body that is constantly angling and swerving, as if always half a step out of sync with the world around him. He jumps when he bumps into people and objects. The camera lingers on his face, catching every flicker of misplaced confidence. Palermo’s streets have the theatricality of a stage set, framing him as if he has wandered into the wrong play which, in a sense, he has. Timing is everything: the half-beat before a misunderstanding lands, the long pause that turns menace into farce.Italian cinema has always been good at holding opposites in the same frame. From the grit of neorealism to the bittersweet social comedies of the 1960s, it has never been afraid to let humour sit alongside tragedy, and political commentary alongside romance. Even in comedy, there’s usually a truth tucked inside the joke. In the UK or the US, this might stay on the surface. InItaly, it becomes a satire about complicity, identity and survival.Twenty-two years later, I’m fully at home in Sardinia and whenever I watch Johnny Stecchino, I laugh out loud, the way Italians do when slapstick hits just right. The scenes with the banana, the marked banknote and the road-safety lectures to mafiosi are as gloriously daft now as the first time I watched them. Back then I didn’t know who was who or what was going on and laughed anyway. Proof that sometimes, like Dante, you have to keep going, even when the story makes no sense. And if you’re lucky, you get to look back decades on and see the comedy in it all.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsMy feelgood movieComedyItalyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A spoiler is proffered by this genial, roundly entertaining indie, which arrives with little fanfare yet goes on to demonstrate all any film requires is a good yarn and the right jobbing performers in place. It’s one of those stories you can’t believe hasn’t been filmed before: that ofMildred “Millie” Burke(played here by Emily Bett Rickards), a single mother and diner waitress who in the postwar era became America’s first millionaire sportswoman under the sobriquet of “the Kansas Cyclone”, first lady of the nascent all-girl wrestling scene.At a more confident moment, such material might have yielded a major studio vehicle perhaps for Demi Moore or Angelina Jolie. In this economy, a modest stipend has been afforded director Ash Avildsen (son of the late Rocky director John G Avildsen) to fashion something resembling a superior telemovie. Part of the fun is that Mildred and trainer/manager/on-off beau Billy “the Big Bad” Wolfe (Josh Lucas) are having to invent a sport on the hoof, girl-on-girl combat having been proscribed in certain states, with stuffed shirts convinced this just isn’t a woman’s place. The script – by Avildsen and Alston Ramsay, parsing Jeff Leen’s biography – has one pointed, self-sustaining running joke: wherever Mildred fights, the audience is full of contemporaries looking to unleash frustrated energies.Avildsen makes the 1950s look quietly and unfussily handsome, casting people who look the part. Small-screen face Rickards (Arrow, The Flash) and double Kelly Phelan more than hold their own amid the grappling action, while Lucas – a movie star like they used to make – offers a terrific heel turn as a glorified carnival barker rattled by Mildred’s success. Avildsen is prone to luxuriating in his own Americana – the midsection is somewhat baggy – and you sometimes sense the writing tiptoeing around the wrestling scene’s less salubrious aspects. The stronger stretches, though, display ample pluck and moxie; if you’ve missed that genus of spinning-headline movies where men address women as “toots”, this one’s for you.Queen of the Ring is in UK cinemas from 19 September and on digital platforms from 13 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmWrestlingBiopicsPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bernstein’s Symphony No 3 has a huge role for a narrator who speaks words written by Bernstein himself, against a choral backdrop of the Jewish Kaddish prayer, sung in Hebrew and Aramaic. Composed either side of the Cuban missile crisis and dedicated to the memory of John F Kennedy, it is unmistakably a product of the anxieties of the early 1960s. But have those anxieties ever really gone away?Thanks to the blazing conviction of Antonio Pappano’s conducting it didn’t feel at all dated here. The playing was bright and precise, the London Symphony Chorus equally responsive in a piece full of challenges: at one point half a dozen of them had to become conductors, each directing a sub-group of their colleagues as they sang in different tempos and rhythmic patterns. The Tiffin Boys’ Choir proclaimed their first entry through cupped hands so as to cut through the heft of the orchestra, before joining in the dancing rhythms of the finale. At the work’s centre, the soprano soloist Katharina Konradi sang a serene lullaby.What really set the tone was Felicity Palmer’s narration. Bernstein’s text is a monologue addressed to God in which the conductor addresses God almost as an equal – plenty of jokes to be made there. It moves from devotion through anger to a kind of reconciliation. Dignified yet animated and absolutely sincere, Palmer judged it perfectly.The mood turned springlike after the interval: the world had seemed a different place in 1946, when Copland’s Third Symphony was borne on a tide of postwar optimism, its finale growing out of the composer’s reworking of his own Fanfare for the Common Man. Pappano drew out the symphony’s electric primary colours and constantly evolving textures with irrepressible energy. Thanks to the glinting percussion section – including, at floor level, an anvil, gleefully thwacked with a claw hammer – this was an often noisy performance, but an irresistibly joyous one.London Symphony Orchestra’s season continuesExplore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanLondon Symphony OrchestraAntonio PappanoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Comedian Stewart Lee celebrates the eccentric life of his great inspirationStewart LeeMon 15 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 05.51 EDTShareToday’s episode of BBCRadio 4’s Great Livesis my third attempt to use my limited comedy fame to foist the non-idiomatic music-making of the Sheffield-born guitarist Derek Bailey on an unsuspecting public. In 2009, I chose Derek as my specialist subject on Celebrity Mastermind, beating the comedian John Thomson, who chose James Bond villains. To be fair, I would also have won if I had done his round. I was getting questions like, “Which Japanese duo collaborated with Derek Bailey on the 1995 album Saisoro?” and John was getting, “What colour was Blofeld’s cat?”Musical minds immeasurably superior to mine have grappled more succinctly with the enigma of Derek, who died in 2005 at the age of 75.Writing in the Quietus four years ago, Jennifer Lucy Allan explained: “Derek Bailey is one antidote for anyone who thinks they’ll never understand improvised music. His guitar playing is that which requires a surrendering to your own ears. It is what it is, and that’s exactly what he intended it to be.” I, in turn, listen to Derek and think: “This, whatever it is, is resolutely and implacably this.” And that is what I, as a comedian, have tried to steal from it.I think I first saw Derek play at the ICA in the early 90s, as I started scouring pub attic evenings and Labour club Sunday afternoons for free improvised music, after I came to London to try standup in the winter of 1989. Voraciously curious about the capital’s concealed subcultures, I nonetheless rarely understood who or what it was I was watching. Seeing the band Morphogenesis burst a balloon and amplify pot plants as a lone cat crept audibly around them, upstairs in a squatted Hackney pub named after a Captain Beefheart song, I’m not sure I was aware that these musicians even made records. And there was no Google to tell me.But I do remember the first time I met Derek. In 1996, I visited his humble Hackney home to interview him for a Sunday newspaper about his new album Guitar, Drums ’n’ Bass, which Derek, then in his late 60s, had created by jamming along to pirate radio broadcasts of the brutal new dance music phenomenon, which had forced their way into his frequencies from concealed aerials on nearby tower blocks.I remember the room he practised in being sparse and white, empty and monastic, and that he affected a comical bemusement at the idea that anyone would buy his records: “Do you just sit still and listen to them, or do you potter about and make cups of tea while they’re on?” For Derek, music lived in the moment, perhaps as a reaction to the decades he spent as a successful session musician for hire – did he really play on Petula Clark’s Downtown? – before his Damascene conversion to the absolute abandonment of tyrannical composition.Derek sent me away with his seminal book, Improvisation: Its Nature and Practice in Music, and a cassette of the Scottish music hall comedian Chic Murray, both of which influenced me enormously. Fresh from the encounter, I wrote: “Bailey comes over like a cross between Clegg from Last of the Summer Wine and a harsh-but-fair science teacher, who illuminates the Genesis myths of improvised music without being remotely patronising.”A fractious exchange followed of which I am not entirely proud. I’m surprised the producer left it inFor the next decade, Derek supplied me with CDs of outtakes and postcards he inscribed with inspiring mantras, my favourite reading simply: “The struggle continues.” Derek died on Christmas Day 2005, Jesus Christ in reverse. At his funeral, I performed a Chic Murray routine, while the wake afterwards, upstairs in a Hackney pub, saw the veteran American jazz hoofer Will Gaines, then 78, sit in a chair and tap out a fond and furious farewell. I wish this had been preserved for posterity, but its undocumented passing is quintessentially Derek.I visited Derek’s Hackney Downs house for the fifth and final time earlier this year, ostensibly to hold a ladder for the archivist Tim Fletcher, as he scoured the dark attic for illuminating items before the property was sold. Shafts of sunlight shone through the lean-to extension Derek had improvised freely long ago, in simpler times, when marginal artists could still afford to live and create magic in the city’s neglected nether regions.The presenter of Great Lives, the former Tory MP Matthew Parris, had clearly arrived for the programme having prepared little, relying on notes supplied to him, and was taken by surprise by Derek’s music, which he described as sounding “like a chimpanzee”. A fractious exchange followed of which I am not entirely proud, mediated by the improv expert Ian Greaves. I’m surprised the producer left it in. But I suspect Derek would have enjoyed it.

Now he is back with an album of synthy pop pumpersLuke TurnerMon 15 Sep 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 06.04 EDTShareAt a recent Monday night gig in London, Joel Gibb – AKA the Hidden Cameras – took to the stage with his acoustic guitar dressed in a sensible white shirt, looking for all the world as if he’d come straight from an office job. As he played a suite of Hidden Cameras songs old and new, the guitar was dropped, the shirt came undone then was removed, revealing a white vest. The room starting shaking to an electronic backing track, and things got sweaty. “It was a rebirth,” he says from a booth in the studio where he recorded new album of electronic pop pumpers Bronto, “like the indie boy gone bad.”View image in fullscreenThe Hidden Cameras Bronto album coverPhotograph: PRThe synth-driven purr and slink of Bronto makes for a startling shift from country-tinged last album Home on Native Land and the exuberant multi-instrumental pop with which the Hidden Cameras first emerged from Toronto, Canada in the early 2000s. This genre twist was thanks to the melodies largely being written in Gibb’s head on the house and techno dancefloors of Berlin, his home for the last two decades. “I kept singing the same refrains to myself over other tracks – the ‘ooh’ and the ‘ah’, the ‘ah’, the ‘ooh’,” he says, “what else are you going to do?Dance musicis very empty, but dancing is meditative.”While this genesis means the album is in part his homage to Berlin, Gibb adds that it’s also a dialogue with Munich, where the songs were fleshed out and recorded with longtime collaborator Nicolas Sierig as they both got to grips with learning how to use a collection of old synthesisers. “It was better to work with someone that’s not in the dance world to make some dance tracks and to create a whole new way of making a record,” he says. Although Berlin is the place to “party in and gain experiences”, Munich became a lens through which to examine them. He praises the city for having “a different vibe. It’s fun to go there and record. It’s calm. It’s clean. It’s conservative.”View image in fullscreen‘Everyone has a song called I Want You, and I am making mine’ … Joel Gibb.Photograph: Max ZerrahnThe tension between the conservative and the hedonist is one of the constants between early Hidden Cameras, when he described the band as “gay church folk music”, and today. Their celebrated 2003 album The Smell Of Our Own celebrated gay sex and an escape from religious shame (Gibb was brought up in the Baptist church), making them outliers from what was still a fairly hetero-dominated indie rock scene. This included gloriously explicit songs referencing soldier orgies, kneeling “for the taste of a man” and about the joys of a golden shower. “I’m surprised I wrote those lyrics, actually,” says Gibb; “I’m very conservative now.” I am not entirely sure if his bashful tone is serious. There’s a pause. It is only in London, he adds, where he has been on gay dating apps and seen men stating they’re H&H, meaning high and horny and looking for chemsex. “How are people in London H&H?” he muses. “They’ve got rent to pay and it’s so expensive.”The world has become kinkier in the last 20 years, catching up with the Hidden Cameras. In a city where little is taboo, Bronto’s inspirations are not just from Gibb’s visits to the darker corners of clubs like Berghain. Some of the sensuality comes from more vanilla sources, such as the German openness around the body. “The whole nudity thing here is so much more normal,” says Gibb, “In Germany, you’re not allowed to wear your bathing suit in the sauna – they’ll yell at you. It forced me to be comfortable with nudity, and it did infiltrate the music.”Even more innocently, Bronto was inspired by Olivia Newton-John’s Physical, the first song Gibb loved on the radio. The booming drums of infernally catchy You Can Call, meanwhile, was his attempt to write a song that might win the Eurovision song contest. Gibb says that he wanted to use the minimalism of electronic music to write in a more directly romantic way. It’s an album about how the transience of life any city, not just Berlin, can impact sexual and romantic entanglements. “It’s more traditional on the lyrical side,” he says. “Everyone has a song called I Want You, and I am making mine.” There are nods to his heroes, two of whom (Erasure’s Vince Clarke and Pet Shop Boys) delivered remixes of Undertow and How Do You Love? that married their own classic electro pop sensibilities to the new, direct Hidden Cameras sound.Although Gibb describes Bronto as “a brand-new direction, feeling or representation of who I am”, he’s planning to carry on playing old songs on guitar before the sweat-in-a-vest electronic section in this autumn’s tour. After that, it’ll be a return to more familiar terrain with an album of “jangly” guitar music. He reflects that the commonality through these different periods of the Hidden Cameras is not just his voice and presence, but his exploration of the contradictory emotions that surround love. “There’s romanticism and there’s cynicism,” he says, “I still feel like there’s a part of me that’s not jaded.”Bronto by the Hidden Cameras is out now.They play Rough Trade East, London, on Monday 15 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndieDance musicShareReuse this content"

This sharp 90s satire – the Conservatives have been in power for 17 years – has the misfortune of being McEwan’s only novel to win the Booker prize in his 50-year career, despite being widely considered one of his slightest. But it fizzes along like the champagne that is part of the euthanasia pact hatched by the two men in a plot that even theauthor conceded was “rather improbable”. New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani was right when she concluded that it wastestament to the author’s skillthat he had managed “to toss off a minor entertainment with such authority and aplomb” to win the gong he had so long deserved.View image in fullscreen9First Love, Last Rites(1975)A pickled penis, cat-roasting, incest, cross-dressing and child abuse are just some of the unsettling fare served up in McEwan’s first short story collection, published when he was just 27. The literary world was shocked and enthralled. “Even the positive reviews were scandalised,”McEwan wrote later. “What monster had come among us?” The monster was here to stay.View image in fullscreen8The Cement Garden(1978)Everyone remembers the first time they readThe Cement Garden. “I did not kill my father, but I sometimes felt I had helped him on his way,” begins the chillingly impassive voice of the teenage narrator Jack. Four children bury their dead mother in the cellar and the oldest siblings end up having sex. McEwan’s first novel is as hard and smooth as the concrete in which both parents fetch up, and it left a dark imprint on the psyche of a generation of teenagers. He didn’t earn his nickname Ian Macabre for nothing.View image in fullscreen7Black Dogs(1992)Bernard and June Tremaine, married but unable to live together, represent “the twin poles” of rationalism and spiritualism at the heart of this novel of ideas. Set against the fall of the Berlin Wall, McEwan’s fifth novel isconsidered a “neglected gem”by critics. It is also, apparently, one of the author’s favourites. The eponymous slavering black dogs may be metaphors for man’s capacity for evil, but in the novel’s climax they are terrifyingly real. “They will return to haunt us, somewhere in Europe, in another time”: the final line seems depressingly prophetic today.View image in fullscreen6Saturday(2005)For those early McEwan devotees bemoaning that he had gone over to the light side, Saturday was the point of no return. Set on 15 February 2003, when 2 million people took to the streets of London to protest against the invasion of Iraq, the novel follows a day in the – very comfortable – life of neurosurgeon Henry Perowne: early-morning lovemaking with his wife; a game of squash; a visit to his elderly mother; and a lovingly prepared bouillabaisse for supper.John Banville declared it a “dismayingly bad book”, and the ending might be preposterous (Matthew Arnold saves the day!), but the novel hums with the same technical mastery and polish as the silver Mercedes in which Perowne drives around Fitzrovia.The prince of darkness ascended to “England’s national author”.View image in fullscreen5Nutshell(2016)McEwan’s 14th novel is a rewriting of Hamlet told by a foetus in utero – but don’t let that put you off. Reflections on mortality, the climate emergency and neuroscience are all squeezed into 200 pages. “Not everyone knows what it is to have your father’s rival’s penis inches from your nose,” gives a whole new perspective on the Oedipal undertones of Shakespeare’s original.McEwan once compared comic novelsto being pinned down and tickled. Here he is on ticklish form: funny, weird and deadly serious.View image in fullscreen4Enduring Love(1997)The balloon accident at the beginning of Enduring Love cemented McEwan’s reputation as the master of the gripping opening set piece. A picnic on a sunny afternoon. A nice bottle of wine. A cry for help. Five men hold on to the ropes of a hot-air balloon to try to save a 10-year-old boy in the basket. One by one they let go. “Hanging a few feet above the Chilterns escarpment, our crew enacted morality’s ancient, irresolvable dilemma: us, or me.” The reader remains suspended in a state of high anxiety until the last page of this story of a stalker’s obsession.“I wanted to write a book in praise of rationality, which gets a poor showing in literature,” McEwan told Radio 4’s Bookclub.View image in fullscreen3On Chesil Beach(2007)“They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible,” begins this slim, elegant novel. It is 1962, the year before “sexual intercourse began”, as Philip Larkin has it, but begin it must for the newlywed art graduate Edward Mayhew and violinist Florence Ponting. It doesn’t go well. Each misinterprets the other’s moves in a way that would be comic were it not so sad. McEwan dismantles this nascent marriage with the same forensic attention he oncedismembered a corpse in The Innocent.View image in fullscreen2Lessons(2022)Spanning a 70-year stretch from the postwar period to the present day, Lessons is McEwan’s longest and also most autobiographical work, “anovel of the backwards look”, as the author put it. The novel interweaves the story of Roland Baines from his army childhood in Libya to boarding school in Suffolk (both also apply to the author), unsatisfactory jobs, love affairs and marriages, with global events from the Suez and Cuban crises up to Brexit and the pandemic. The unsettling opening section about an intense affair between 14-year-old Roland and a young piano teacher is vintage McEwan. Lessons charts a generation’s decline from youthful optimism to political disillusionment and despair. A friend of McEwan’s wrote to say it had the feel of a last novel. Fortunately, they were wrong: a new book,What We Can Know, set in a future UK partly submerged by rising tides, will be published this month.View image in fullscreen1Atonement(2001)A 1930s country-house romance, a bravura account of the British retreat from Dunkirk in 1940 and a metafictional coda that made some readers want to start the novel from the beginning and others hurl it at the wall – this is McEwan at the height of his powers and determined to show what he could do with them. All his favourite themes are here: loss of innocence, morality, the possibility of absolution and the workings of fiction itself. His old friend Martin Amis described the first 200 pages of Atonement as McEwan’sgreatest achievement. John Updike called it “a beautiful and majestic fictional panorama”. It might not have won the Booker, but its success (andthe starry film adaptation) made McEwan a household name. Nearly 25 years after it was published, Atonement remains one of the finest novels of this century.Explore more on these topicsBooksRankedIan McEwanFictionShort storiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wild Swans, first published in 1991 and written by Jung Chang with the help of her husband, Irish-born historian and writer Jon Halliday, had a global impact few authors dare to dream of. It told the story of three generations of women in 20th-century China – Chang’s grandmother, her mother and herself – and became one of the most popular nonfiction books in history, selling more than13m copies in 37 languagesand collecting a fistful of awards and commendations. For any author, following that would be a challenge. Now, Fly, Wild Swans returns to the story, picking it up after Chang’s own departure from China in 1978, and revisiting episodes from the earlier work with added detail.Wild Swans was Chang’s second book: her first was a biography of Soong Ching-ling, the wife of the early 20th-century revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, which, she volunteers, had deservedly little impact. Wild Swans was different: animated by a powerful family story, set against the dramatic political background of war and revolution and enlivened by Halliday’s formidable narrative talent, it was an instant hit.Chang and Halliday’s next book, a biography of Mao Zedong, suffered fierce criticism in the academy for a perceived lack of historical rigour. She subsequently produced a biography of the Empress Dowager Cixi and a book about the three Soong sisters,Big Sister, Little Sister, Red Sister.While these displayed her signature approach of presenting China’s recent history through the lives of prominent women, her own story was placed on the back burner – until now.To orient new readers, Fly, Wild Swans first returns to Chang’s grandmother’s birth in 1900, the binding of her feet and her marriage at 17 to a warlord from whose household she escaped with her infant daughter in her arms. That infant grew up to join the communist struggle against the ruling Kuomintang party and married a fellow revolutionary who became a senior official after the communist victory in the civil war. All might have been well, but both Chang’s parents lost their faith in communism during the mass starvation of the early 1960s that was a direct result of Mao’s earlier policies.They began a retreat from political life, but this did not save the family from persecution in the Cultural Revolution, when, in order to reassert his dominance, Mao launched his Red Guards against party rivals and society at large. Chang was 14. Her father, Shou-yu, died in his early 50s as an indirect result of persecution, having wrestled, unsuccessfully, to reconcile his youthful idealism with the often dreadful brutality of Mao’s China.Shou-yu was a puritan communist who had refused to get his wife, De-hong, into a good hospital during a potentially dangerous pregnancy and had gone out of his way to deny any appearance of helping a young relative who needed his endorsement for a job. De-hong complained to him that he might be a good communist, but he was “a rotten husband”. In Fly, Wild Swans, we learn not only of the extraordinary efforts De-hong, who had also come under attack in the Cultural Revolution, made to secure her husband’s release from detention, but also that, in his final years, Shou-yu came to regret his dogmatic behaviour.Since 1991 China has gone from poverty to relative prosperity, becoming the world’s second largest economy; Chang herself went from being the daughter of a disgraced official to enjoying personal wealth and fame in the west. Although Wild Swans was banned in China, she was still able to conduct research there for several years, and in Fly, Wild Swansshe recounts at some length the Chinese sources, interviews and archives on which the Mao biography was built. These included contacts of her own family in Sichuan, the province where Mao’s ultimate successor, Deng Xiaoping, was born. (The criticism of her work on Mao clearly rankled, and here Chang dismisses it as having been driven by western “apologists”.) She returned to China to visit her mother every year until the country’s change of political direction under Xi Jinping made it impossible.By her own account, Chang comes from a family whose members repeatedly, and at great personal risk, took moral stands, first enlisting in the Communist party to fight oppression and injustice, and later standing up to the injustices and abuses perpetrated by the party itself. De-hong, in a final act of love, asks Chang’s brother not to take the risk of returning to China, fearing it would be unsafe for him. Chang herself notes that Xi Jinping had decreed that any “insult or slander” of the honour and reputation of “heroes and martyrs” is a crime punishable by imprisonment. “As Mao was regarded as the primary hero of the nation,” she writes, “it began to sink in that … I faced incarceration when I was in China.” She realises that she will never see her ailing mother again.Few can match Chang’s ability to bring Chinese history and politics to life through deeply felt personal narrative, and few have shaped western understanding of China as broadly. Nearly 35 years on from the book that made her name, this story of suffering and success has the air of a closing chapter, a reckoning with both her achievements and the cost of the path she chose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The prize will honour women across all genres who “have been trailblazers in their field, especially in the past when it was more difficult for women to have successful careers as writers”, said the RSL.The inaugural winner is 91-year-old Maureen Duffy, a poet, playwright, novelist, nonfiction writer and activist whose works include the 1966 novel The Microcosm, set in the lesbian club Gateways in London.Duffy found out she had won the prize when Evaristo visited her at home earlier this month. “I hope this encourages writers to keep on writing, because it is a hard thing to support yourself as a writer in this country,” she said.Asked by Evaristo how it felt to be acknowledged as a pioneer, Duffy said “it’s a funny old thing. I suppose I’ll get used to it. But at the moment it seems extraordinary, really.”Evaristo was announced as the Women’s prize outstanding contribution winner in June. The one-off prize, funded by Bukhman Philanthropies, was awarded to Evaristo based on her body of work, which includes the 2019 Booker winner Girl, Woman, Other, as well as her “unwavering dedication to uplifting under-represented voices across the cultural landscape”.“It felt right that I should share this substantial and unexpected windfall with other older women writers as a way to acknowledge their pioneer spirits and achievements,” said Evaristo. “It’s very easy to forget the feminist struggles of the past and the intrepid women who paved the way for successive generations, and it’s important to celebrate our trailblazers while they are still around to enjoy it.”“It’s no secret that older women writers tend to be overlooked, while older male writers often enjoy substantial careers until they topple over into their graves,” shewrote in the Observeron Sunday. “While Duffy has sadly slipped from view of late […] she deserves to be better known to younger generations﻿.”While Evaristo herself chose Duffy – in a decision she described as a “no-brainer” – for the inaugural prize, future years of the award will focus on a particular literary genre, and be judged by specialists in the field, including agents, publishers, critics, and writers. Each winner will be asked to spotlight a “deceased and forgotten” female writer who inspired them when they were starting out, as well as three emerging writers.Duffy has written more than 60 works across a range of genres. She won her first poetry competition aged 17, and completed her first play while studying English at King’s College London. In the late 1950s, she worked as a schoolteacher, before turning to writing full-time after being commissioned to produce a screenplay by Granada Television. In the early 60s, she began campaigning for gay rights, and was one of the first public figures to come out as lesbian.Duffy went on to write for stage, screen and radio. In 1968, she was one of the first group of women to have extracts of their plays staged by the National Theatre, and the first to have a full run of a play, Rites, produced by the Jeanetta Cochrane theatre, where the National was then based.She has written almost 30 plays and a dozen poetry collections, as well as works of nonfiction including a biography of English playwright Aphra Behn, considered the first English woman to earn a living by writing.“When I conceived of the prize, Maureen Duffy was always foremost in my mind as the recipient because she is a true trailblazer in every sense of the word,” said Evaristo. “Raised in a working-class, single-parent family, she has had a prodigious, prolific and varied career as a brilliant, imaginative and groundbreaking writer since the early 1960s, as well as being an advocate for writers. She was instrumental in campaigning for writers’ licensing rights, which led to the formation of the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society.”Duffy’s win will be marked at an event at the British Library, London, on 30 November.Explore more on these topicsBooksAwards and prizesBernardine EvaristoPoetrynewsShareReuse this content"

Both books are set at an Ivy League university in a crime-ridden New England town; from various well-seeded clues, we can identify this as Brown University. Here it is called Warren, because the Bunnyverse is unabashedly silly and self-referential. Rabbit jokes abound.The first book followed Samantha, an alienated, cash-strapped creative writing student cold-shouldered by her workshop cohort, a cabal of four ultra-feminine rich girls who all call each other Bunny. The Bunnies wear fluffy dresses, eat mini food and – as Samantha learns when she’s finally inducted into their cult – express their creativity through demonic rites that involve exploding rabbits. Samantha has to transcend them to find her voice as an artist. The story of Bunny is the result.We Love You, Bunny begins with Samantha bound and gagged in an attic. The Bunnies surround her, congratulating her venomously on the success of her book. Now they want to tell their story. Passing an axe like a talking stick, they introduce us to four versions of their Bunny-centric world. Then they pass the mic to a special guest.While Awad happily annihilates her characters, she seems to get a real kick out of bitchinessThis follow-up has the key strengths of the original, particularly its scabrous satire on upper-middle-class American femininity. The Bunnies binge-watch reality TV show The Bachelorette,are performatively gaga for the Brontës and Virginia Woolf, and hug each other incontinently, squealing insincere endearments. Their narcissism, when thwarted, fuels a rage that becomes only more explosive for being repressed. Their friendship is a psychic mind-meld that threatens to dissolve them, even as they resent, denigrate and seek to crush each other. Each Bunny writes in a precious-girl genre: the proem; the Angela Carter sex-with-monsters story; Kathy Ackerish shock porn; a post-feminist work apostrophising kitchen appliances. One Bunny imagines her mentor saying: “I will help you birth [this book] from your mind’s vagina … into a living entity of double-spaced pages beautifully screaming.”There is a brinkmanship to this kind of satire; it can all too easily cross into misogyny. But while Awad happily annihilates these characters, she seems to get a real kick out of femmeness, and even bitchiness. She fully understands the appeal of drinking a London Fog with a hot friend whose allegiance to you is uncertain, but whose apartment is much nicer than yours, and whose dedication to braiding your hair is total.We Love You, Bunny suffers from a certain sequelitis. It’s baggier than the original. Its metaphors for creativity feel less earned. The game of visiting each Bunny’s point of view also disappoints. They remain two-dimensional mean girls, each a slightly different flavour of shallow, insecure, pretentious and cruel. Where their viciousness is explained, it’s the legacy of wealthy families who can’t love. This use of popular-girl tropes was brilliant in Bunny, where theStepford wifesameness was key to the horror, and Samantha’s longing/loathing implicitly made it partly her projection. Here, inhabiting their loathsomeness becomes a bit of a chore.This is redeemed, however, when we come to the last voice of the novel. As those who have read it will remember, the exploded rabbits turn into hot-boyfriend golems with rabbit paws. Here we meet the first of these bunnymen, who comes into existence wearing the pearls of one Bunny and the dress of another, while carrying the axe of a third (a tool which sees plenty of use by the novel’s end). Unlike his successors, he is fully anatomically human and has a mind of his own, while remaining a Bunny product. Named Aerius after an allergy medication, he tells his story in a Brontë/chicklit Frankenspeech, peppered with both smiley and frowny faces, cutesy neologisms such as “Manny Scripts” and “Lappy Top” and words like “twas” and “afeared”. He’s prone to rhapsodising in breathless fragments: “The hum of Grasses! The Moon casting her slivery Light on my Face! Aerius felt alive!” In short, he is both adorable and hilarious.Toward the end, a writing professor passes judgment on the story we’re in: “A touch too camp.Zany.A sort of zanyromantasy,isn’t it?” Yes, it is, but Awad is here to show us that romantasy can be serious literature, andnothingcan really be too camp. And if We Love You, Bunny has weaknesses endemic to sequels, it also has their strengths. There’s the fun of meeting the old characters and seeing areas we wondered about before, but it also builds on the original, opening up new territory and making new jokes. And though it’s better to start with the first novel, We Love You, Bunny can be read alone. It’s a goofy, overblown flower of a book with lots of thorns that pleasurably scratch.We Love You, Bunny by Mona Awad is published by Scribner (£16.99).

So this Tosca is neither new to the company nor helped by the attention focused on last week’sRoyal Opera House staging in which Anna Netrebkocommanded the headlines. Here, the focus was on the Welsh-UkrainianNatalya Romaniw, who three years ago madean acclaimed ROH debutin the career-defining title role. This was emphatically Romaniw’s night, every inch the absolute diva, in ravishing voice and investing her characterisation with such fine nuances of gesture and colouring of the words as to hold one riveted. It was certainly worthy of Sarah Bernhardt, for whom Victorien Sardou wrote his original play and whose performance inspired Puccini to compose his opera.Puccini’s faithfulness to the specific Roman locations and the historical facts of June 1800 in this period of the Napoleonic wars, would seem to preclude a contemporary setting elsewhere. Yet directorEdward Dick’s allusions to the rise of the far right and the thuggery of the regime which chief of police, Baron Scarpia, represents are all too chillingly resonant of the political machinations and skullduggery that have only escalated globally in the seven years since Dick conceived his approach.View image in fullscreenAn aura of Catholicism … Dario Solari (middle) as Baron Scarpia in Tosca, with WNO cast.Photograph: Dafydd OwenIn darkly lit sets, a gilded Madonna-adorned cupola – differently angled – does duty for all three acts in a nod to the Rome of the past, with banks of electric candles hinting at the aura of Catholicism, Scarpia’s manipulative lechery could not be more current, while conveying the torturing of Tosca’s lover – the painter Cavaliere Cavaradossi – to her via Scarpia’s laptop livestream only heightened the tension. Dario Solari’s Scarpia may not have been quite as sinister or oleaginous, nor as imposing in the act 1 Te Deum as the most demonic of interpreters, but his animal instincts when standing as though caged within the confines of his four-poster bed had the requisite frisson of horror. Romaniw’s lithe grace and agile-as-a cat athleticism in avoiding his predatory advances was matched by the musical grace and soul-searching of her Vissi D’arte prayer, giving her the courage to wield the knife and stab him several times.Andrés Presno’s Cavaradossi was a bit too shouty for comfort, but the tenderness of his adoration of Tosca was apparent in the final act and in their last duet – sporting their tattoos of republican and Bonapartist allegiance – they raised fists and voices in vibrant exultance. Equally defiant was Tosca’s leap to her death, standing in a Leonardo Vitruvian woman pose silhouetted against the rising sun before falling backward, heart broken but spirit uncrushed.It was another sign of the difficult times facing WNO that they used Tony Burke’s reduced score, but tribute to the musicians that they could still bring richness to the sound, with conductorGergely Madarasfinely attuned to the dramatic ebb and flow of Puccini’s score.At Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff, on 18, 24 and 27 September; touring until 18 OctoberExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicWalesWelsh National Operalive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

If you wanted to learn much about the women in Mozart’s life you would probably have been disappointed, although several were at least mentioned in the informal scripted links from the presenterLauren Laverne, who slipped into friendly interviewer mode to ask the singers for more personal contributions. It was a big ask of the singers, who were required to appear at ease as themselves on stage, offer seemingly unscripted insights into the microphone, and then switch seamlessly into character – often to portray that character at a moment of peak emotional stress.View image in fullscreenMozart’s Women: A Musical Journey.Photograph: Chris Lobina/Sky ArtsIn the circumstances it wasn’t surprising that generally the arias – some sung in English translation, some not – felt a bit constrained. The lighter numbers came off best in Annilese Miskimmon’s sometimes updated direction: Golda Schultz as the Countess and Ailish Tynan as Susanna turning the letter-writing scene from The Marriage of Figaro into a texting duet, their moment of friendship sealed as they pressed send; Tynan sparring ridiculously with Rainelle Krause as the rival divas of Der Schauspieldirektor. Shorn of context, Nardus Williams’s introspective way with Donna Anna and Fiordiligi’s arias – with Filipe Manu filling in the tenor roles sweetly – came across less vividly than her sisterly duet with Bethany Horak-Hallett’s Dorabella. At the end, Krause nailed the Queen of the Night’s second aria fromThe Magic Flute, every high note crystal clear.

The theatre’s seven-year renovation has been hard. In that time, many have been lost, including the victims of the pandemic and, only last month, the mightyGiles Havergal, the company’s artistic director from 1969 to 2003.Fitting, then, that the opening production should be a requiem. Less a drama than a mass, it is a eulogy to those killed in the Lockerbie bombing in 1988, the single biggest terrorist loss of life on UK territory. The powerful act one closing song has just three words: “Let us remember.”The nearest parallel to this sentiment-laden music-theatre piece by Frances Poet and Ricky Ross isCome from Away. Both shows are concerned with how small communities deal with global events. In the musical by Irene Sankoff and David Hein, the locals in a Newfoundland town care for those stranded after 9/11; here, the people of a small Scottish town cope with the grief of the downing of Pan Am flight 103 in the most practical way they can.The heartening moral of a heavy story is in the small acts of love they show towards the bereaved families, primarily American, who are otherwise unknown to them. They piece together belongings, clean clothes and create memorials. In the face of tragedy, they offer hope.Poet’s script is strong on detail: the stench of aircraft fuel, the debris causing punctures and the first responder who moves a child’s body for fear it will be eaten by foxes. Uninterested in the reasons for the attack, she presents the personal as political. If Small Acts of Love wallows in sadness, it does so unashamedly.Carrying much of the emotion are Ross’s songs, sweet celebrations of community, their Americana-tinged folk melodies given gentle force by the large – and excellent – ensemble and delicate arrangements by a chamber orchestra under the musical direction of Gavin Whitworth. In Dominic Hill’s consummate production, Tom Piper’s bare-bones set is dynamically lit by Bruno Poet, and even if you miss the grit of conflict, you would need a hard heart not to be moved by its humanist intent.At Citizens theatre, Glasgow, until 4 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreLockerbie plane bombingScotlandGlasgowreviewsShareReuse this content"

Pollock even gave it a personal touch, adding his handprints near the top.The painting, currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art inNew York, is almost 9ft (2.7 metres) wide. Scientists had previously characterized the reds and yellows splattered across the canvas, but the source of the rich turquoise blue proved elusive.In a new study, researchers took scrapings of the blue paint and used lasers to scatter light and measure how the paint’s molecules vibrated. That gave them a unique chemical fingerprint for the color, which they pinpointed as manganese blue.The analysis, published in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first confirmed evidence of Pollock using this specific blue.“It’s really interesting to understand where some striking color comes from on a molecular level,” said study co-author Edward Solomon, a professor at Stanford University.The pigment manganese blue was once used by artists, as well as to color the cement for swimming pools. It was phased out by the 1990s because of environmental concerns.Previous research had suggested that the turquoise from the painting could indeed be this color, but the new study confirms it using samples from the canvas, said Rutgers University’s Gene Hall, who has studied Pollock’s paintings and was not involved with the discovery.‘Art became a means of survival’: the Gaza Biennale lands in New York CityRead more“I’m pretty convinced that it could be manganese blue,” Hall said.The researchers also went one step further, inspecting the pigment’s chemical structure to understand how it produces such a vibrant shade.Scientists study the chemical makeup of art supplies to conserve old paintings and catch counterfeits. They can take more specific samples from Pollock’s paintings since he often poured directly onto the canvas instead of mixing paints on a palette beforehand.To solve this artistic mystery, researchers explored the paint using various scientific tools – similarly to how Pollock would alternate his own methods, dripping paint using a stick or using it straight from the can.While the artist’s work may seem chaotic, Pollock rejected that interpretation. He saw his work as methodical, said study co-author Abed Haddad, an assistant conservation scientist at the Museum of ModernArt.“I actually see a lot of similarities between the way that we worked and the way thatJackson Pollockworked on the painting,” Haddad said.Explore more on these topicsJackson PollockArtPaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

The actor talks about tech shocks, doomscrolling and the agent who told her to go back to CanadaMon 15 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 07.26 EDTShareThis summer, Sandra Oh stood behind a lectern at a graduation ceremony in New Hampshire, preparing to give university-leavers words of hope at a time of permacrisis. She rose to the challenge, opening up about her past battles with depression and anxiety, before making a heartfelt case for embracing discomfort and kindness “so we can meet cruelty again and again and not lose our humanity”. This was increasingly important, she explained, when many world leaders “claim power through fear and oppression”. And then came the moment that would go viral. Oh instructed everyone to stand up and do something Cristina Yang,her career-making character on Grey’s Anatomy, used to do when times got tough. “Dance it out!” she exhorted as David Guetta’s Titanium washed over the crowd. “Remember this feeling!”“I was very, very,verynervous about it,” says Oh. “I worked really hard.” She had been putting herself into the mindset of 20-year-olds not just worried about their own futures but about the larger picture. “The world is burning!” she says, imagining their dark thoughts. “There’s wars all over!My heart is so heavy, so all I’m going to do is doomscroll.” But, crucially, Oh wanted her audience to find their way to joy – thus the dancing. “Sitting there trying to bear the pain in the world,” she says, neatly summing up the philosophy she shared that day, “will help you figure out how to be in the world.”There are now T-shirts emblazoned the words Oh said at the Emmys: ‘It’s an honour just to be Asian’That speech – with its vulnerability and compassion, its awareness of the world’s cruelties while still finding moments of joy – feels particularly on-brand for Oh. Born near Ottawa to Korean immigrant parents, the actor, whose star turns in Grey’s Anatomy and Killing Evemade her the first Asian woman to win multiple Golden Globes, has since gained fans for her fierce support of wider representation in the industry. There are now popular T-shirts emblazoned with the words Oh famously said at the Emmys: “It’s an honour just to be Asian.”View image in fullscreenMultiple awards … with Jodie Comer in Killing Eve.Photograph: David Emery/BBC AmericaWarm and sparkling, her own speech today is filled with plenty of laughs. “Hold on baby!” is the first thing I hear as she speaks to me by phone from New York, playing for time as she tries and fails to turn on her camera. But Oh soon becomes more reflective, prone to lengthy pauses as she talks about everything from the climate emergency to AI to racial equality.Fittingly, Oh’s latest project – the indie Canadian sci-fi film Can I Get a Witness? – is about finding salvation amid the burning. After an apocalyptic, AI-engineered disaster hits Earth in the very deliberately chosen year of 2025, human life has been rebuilt. It’s 2040: peace has been achieved. Offices, computers and smartphones are relics of a damned civilisation. People spend their days tending to their gardens. But there are conditions: they don’t travel, electricity is restricted and – the biggest catch – everyone must die a government-mandated death at 50. Oh plays Ellie, a survivor of the 2025 catastrophe, who is supporting her daughter into her new job as a “documenter” of these “end of life” ceremonies. These can be picked from a brochure, with options including church memorials and beachside goodbyes with champagne.When your primary source of love is the phone, something is happening to you at an unconscious, very powerful level“I was most interested in the script’s contemplation of dying,” says Oh, in particular how the knowledge of one’s impending death would change one’s approach to life. It’s an increasingly urgent question, Oh says, recalling an early screening last year in Santa Barbara while wildfires raged across Los Angeles. It brought home the idea that the film is not really about the future. “It is what’s happeningright now,” she says. “We are in the burningright now.”When they were making the film, Oh asked director and writer Ann Marie Fleming to include AI in the script. How does she think technology is changing our lives? “Phones and social media,” she says, “are retraining human beings.When your primary source of love is the phone, something is happening to you at an unconscious, very powerful level.”Her own solution to this retraining – “I’m already struggling, and I didn’t grow up with this technology” – is choosing to do “small, profoundly meaningful” films such as this latest one, as well as theatre. She has been playingOlivia in Twelfth Night at the Delacorte in New York’s Central Park. “I’m engaging with 2,000 people in an open-air theatre. You can feel people really want to come to the show to laugh, have a good time, for it to be joyous, out in nature. You’re in community and you’re communing – through Shakespeare.” In the age of the machine, “such true human interactions become way more important”.View image in fullscreenSearch for salvation…Can I Get a Witness?Photograph: Ed AraquelOh talks a lot about making conscious choices, active decisions. “This is the gift of midlife,” says the actor, who has just turned 54. “There is so much in culture, in society, that you’ve been living in unconsciously. But you see that crack of light coming through – and realise that’s what you want to follow. I think that’s what midlife is about. And it’s very engaging.”Oh has also spoken about unlearning the racism she internalised from her early years, singling out a wounding experience with an agent when she arrived in LA in 1995. The agent advised her to go back toCanadaas there weren’t any opportunities for Asian actors in the US. Decades later, on receiving the Killing Eve script, Oh couldn’t work out which supporting part was intended for her. “Honey,” her agent said. “It’s Eve.”In recent years, Oh has put her considerable heft into stories from the Asian diaspora, acting in Domee Shi’s Pixar romp Turning Red, Iris Shim’s intergenerational horror Umma, and Jessica Yu’s family comedy Quiz Lady. She’s also played secretary Sofia Mori in Vietnam war drama The Sympathiser and frazzled academic Ji-Yoon Kim in Netflix series The Chair.All theseroles, unlike the ones that made her famous, specifically consider her character’s heritage in the script.“I remember being at the Oscars whenEverything Everywhere All at Onceswept the awards,” she says. “It was so important. To build something, you need a larger community – to get traction, to get the experience, to know how to support each other. When I started, actors like Daniel Dae Kim or John Cho – we’d known each other for ever, but we never shared a stage or set, because we were always on our own. It’s still a tough industry, veering towards, honestly, a patriarchal white mainstream.”View image in fullscreenFrazzled academic … Oh in The Chair.Photograph: Eliza Morse/APDiversity, equity and inclusion may be under attack today, but Oh believes in them wholeheartedly. “I find the people who vilify it, or are scared of it, are very, very questionable.” She hopes that for Asian-Americans in Hollywood, “the door that’s opened in the past 10 years – or not even that –sevenyears – remains open. And enough of us have passed through, and gained a foothold, to make projects that will bring others through.”It’s a useful segue to the question I’ve been burning to ask. “You said one of my favourite quotes of all time,” I tell her. “Oh god,” she replies. “What is it?”Two years ago, theNew Yorkerasked Oh about the comparatively fewer opportunities she’s had from white male directors and major studios. “It’s like being able to get over a bad boyfriend,” she responded. “They’re not going to call. Just move on and hang out with the young women who want you to be their mom.”“Did Isay that?” Oh laughs in disbelief. “Can you tell me the quote again?” I repeat it. “Well,” she says, recovering a little. “That’s a simple way of saying, ‘Go where you’re wanted.’”‘Hollywood has everything to do with the terrible state of the world’: Charlie Kaufman on AI, Eternal Sunshine and toothacheRead moreTo prove the point, she reels off the names of the various creators behind her biggest breaks: Shonda Rhimes with Grey’s Anatomy, Phoebe Waller-Bridge with Killing Eve, Amanda Peet with The Chair, Park Chan-wook with The Sympathiser. One exception, she says, is Robert Wuhl, who cast her in sports agent sitcom Arliss, one of her first major roles in LA. It did not lead to a stampede. Or as Oh puts it: “The old white patriarchy hasn’t knocked on my door yet!” Then she adds: “I’m glad I said that quote now. I said it because it’s like – where am I going to put my power? I’m going to put it in the young women who see something in me.”This summer, at alive podcasting eventin New York, Oh read aloud from her old diary, with entries that stretch all the way back to childhood. One, written right after her upsetting meeting with the LA agent, goes: “The pain’s the same and overwhelming and you try not to take it so personally or cosmically, but you feel it. Nothing she could think of to send me out on? Nothing? There’s nothing there for me? Why am I here?”What would she say to that past self now? “I’m so sorry it’s so painful right now,” she says, her voice full of tenderness. “But it will change. I’m not saying you’ll get everything you think you want. And I know you have no idea how it’s going to change.” Oh pauses, gathers her thoughts. “That lesson on how things will change,” she says. “The impermanence of things. It’s hard to figure that out. I think that takes a lifetime.”Can I Get a Witness? is in UK cinemas from 19 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmCanadaAsia PacificinterviewsShareReuse this content"

So not really the type of thing that you would go to weekly,” she says.Since she graduated in 2023, Ella has found that nights out with her friends “take a lot more planning and coordination. Partly I think it’s because of Covid: some venues never reopened. And partly because of the costs. And if you can see there aren’t a lot of tickets sold, you won’t go in the first place – if you worry that a night is going to be dead, you’re not going to buy a ticket in advance.”View image in fullscreenElla Stranger.One in fourlate-night venues across the UK have closed since 2020– almost 800 in total – with closures accelerating this year. Three venues have shut each week on a net basis over the past three months, according to the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA). The NTIA has warned of a potential for “night-time deserts” if there are not urgent tax cuts for nightclubs and music venues.Nick, 51, an electronic musician from Oxford, says the live music scene has noticeably changed in the city over the 13 years he has lived there. “In central Oxford, we now have almost no music venues,” he says. “I’m having to look for gigs in London.” In recent years, Oxford’sPurple Turtlenightclub,the Cellarmusic venue and most recently the grassroots gig venuethe Wheatsheafhave all closed.“You have to go to Jericho or down Cowley Road,” says Nick. “If bands like Radiohead, Supergrass and Foals started up now, they would have to join the queue to play, as there are more bands than venues can handle. The more popular local acts get the first choice of gigs, while many artists have to be more creative and either put gigs on themselves, or use other spaces such as the Modern Art museum or the Old Fire Station.”It’s a similar story in bigger cities such as Birmingham. David Garside, 51, a musician, recalls a livelier scene in decades past. “TheOld Railway in Digbethwas an old-fashioned pub with live music pretty much every night. That was knocked down to make way for the Millennium Point.“The Hibernian in Stirchley, where Pulp played, has been an empty shell for years. [It has since beenrenamed and turned into a restaurant.] South of the city, Moseley was always swarming with musicians. But pretty much all of its live music bedrock has vanished.The Jug of Ale– a touring venue – was demolished. There are a few open mic nights in some of the bars. Not very inspiring.”In Redhill, Surrey, there are no established late-night music venues at all. It’s something Steve Trigg, 63, wants to remedy. “Since I’ve lived here, Redhill has never really had much in the way of venues,” he says. “We hada little nightclub, Liquid & Envy, that was open for a while. We have things like corners of pubs where people play, but generally there’s been very little music.”View image in fullscreenSteve Trigg, co-founder of Redstart, a community charity that promotes music in the Redhill, Merstham, Reigate and Earlswood areas.Photograph: Guardian CommunityTrigg is one of the co-founders of Redstart Community, a charity that for six months has run pop-up music gigs in the town’s shopping centre.“We’ve had some rappers, and a punk night, quite a lot of indie music and an acoustic night. It has been very positive. One night we had a crowd of over 130, and we normally get in 40 to 60. It’s new to quite a lot of the people here to actually have music here, without having to go by train into London to try and see some.”Meanwhile, London’s own late night venues have declined. “People move to London because it’s a creative cultural global city,” says Kate, 32, from Camberwell. “And then they realise they can’t cope with the noise and they complain to the council – and the council can be too quick to side with the residents. That’s what happened tothe Sekforde pub in Clerkenwell, which is run by a friend of mine.“I get that living near a venue can be noisy, but the council should have regulation that accommodates that. I feel like we’re forgetting that the positives – the people who enjoy it – outweigh the people who don’t.”Kate grew up in south London. “As a teenager you felt like the city is yours and you can do anything you want. The older I’ve got, that feeling has gone. I’m not sure if it’s me getting older, or London getting boring. But I have a couple of friends in bands and every time they’re doing a gig, I know it’s going to be one of four places.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPubsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Aside fromAdolescence, which had the limited series category all sewn up, it felt like every single nomination was either forSeveranceor The Studio.Emmys 2025: full list of winnersRead moreOf these,The Studio’s ascendancy seemed most locked in. Here, after the controversy over The Bear’s deliberate lack of laughs, was acomedycomedy; something designed from the ground up to be funny. Plus, it was about the entertainment industry, which always appeals to the myopic interests of the Emmy voters. True, all of this equally applied toHacks, but The Studio’s lead character wasn’t routinely described as a comedy genius, so there was far less dissonance when his jokes failed to land.Emmy awards 2025: red carpet looks at TV’s big night – in picturesRead moreAnd so it came to pass. The Studio ended theEmmysas the most awarded comedy ever, picking up 13 wins. Writing, directing, acting, a wealth of technical awards. What’s more, Seth Rogen is now in joint first place for the most Emmy wins in one night. It was, by any metric, a resounding victory.Severance was slightly less of a dead cert – this year’s second season largely traded its momentum for style, frustratingly – but it still very much remained the drama series to beat. Sadly for Severance, someone beat it.View image in fullscreenStunning in a way television was 20 years ago … Noah Wyle in The Pitt.Photograph: AlamyFor the most part, that show wasThe Pitt. And this was entirely warranted, because The Pitt is stunning in a way that television was 20 years ago. Essentially 24 set in a hospital, The Pitt is the sort of frenetic, unapologetically entertaining drama that network television used to excel at. Tellingly, it’s made by some of the people who made ER and The West Wing. In total, The Pitt won five Emmys, including best drama.But it is the writing and directing losses that will really sting for Severance. Severance is sold almost entirely on those two things – it’s a complex mystery-box show that is most frequently promoted by its movie star director – so to lose those categories seems particularly egregious.But the shows that did win those categories –Andorfor writing, Slow Horses for direction – probably deserved them. On an otherwise quiet night for Andor, Dan Gilroy’s writing win marked perhaps the most political moment of the entire ceremony. Gilroy, after all, managed to take goofy old Star Wars and transform it into the most stinging indictment of our times imaginable. Not for nothing was itthe only show nominated to explicitly invoke genocide.View image in fullscreenThe only show nominated to explicitly invoke genocide … Diego Luna in Andor.Photograph: LucasfilmMeanwhile, Slow Horses’ Adam Randall was a perfect example of rock solid direction, unfussily squeezing every ounce of tension and humour from the script. Had there been a Most Direction category, Severance would have walked it, but this seems fair.Still, the awards that Severance did win were well earned. Britt Lower did magnificent work playing two characters who were horrified by each other, and you sense that Tramell Tillman – the first Black person to win best supporting actor in a drama – is on a rocket ship to permanent A-list stardom, so this fits too.View image in fullscreenOn a rocket ship to A-list stardom … Tramell Tillman in Severance.Photograph: APHowever, if we’re talking snubs, then some space must be set aside for The White Lotus, which left empty-handed last night. This is the first time this has happened in the show’s history, and there are perhaps a few explanations. Broadly, this was the loosest and least focused season of the show, shot through with any number of frustrating plotholes and threads left dangling. There was also no Jennifer Coolidge-style centre of gravity, which likely split the voting. The show did win one Creative Arts Emmy this week. However, that award went to Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, thecomposer who quit the showafter publicly lashing out at its showrunner, Mike White, which probably only compounds the disappointment.View image in fullscreenLittle short of spectacular … Cristin Milioti in The Penguin.Photograph: APIn happier news, Cristin Milioti won best lead actress in a limited series for her role in The Penguin. Adolescence (rightly) locked out most of the limited series awards, for all the reasons you already know about. But Milioti was little short of spectacular in her role as an ascendant crime boss. Variously scheming, angry, haunted and heartbreaking, her performance gave untold depths to a character that ran the risk of coming off as two-dimensional. Of course, it might have also helped that Adolescence had no identifiable lead actress, but let’s not dwell on that.Finally, it should be mentioned that there was nothing for The Bear. But if you’ve seen any ofThe Bearrecently, you will understand that this doesn’t really qualify as a surprise. If it can hit the strengths of its first two seasons when it returns, however, it might end up giving The Studio a run for its money.Explore more on these topicsEmmysTelevisionEmmys 2025Awards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A solo trip made me realise who I was again – and taught me to embrace the thrill of trying something newJenny HollidayMon 15 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTShareIused to pride myself on being a gung-ho kind of person, embracing change and thrills in life, whether that was travelling alone to South America or doing standup comedy. But, as my 40s progressed, I found myself becoming more cautious. I started to choose the safer option, such as booking a package holiday instead of a DIY adventure, or hesitating before sending a work email, worried it didn’t sound “right”.I felt anxiety, low mood and brain fog – all symptoms of perimenopause – creeping in. I was in what I would call a menopausal funk: weighed down by my feelings and my slightly aching body. I began experiencing this two years ago. I’m 47 now. Taking HRT (hormone replacement therapy) helped, but I felt as if I had reached a point in my life where I had to accept that I was just going to be a bit less “me” and not so brave.So, when I received an email from the charity Calm (Campaign Against Living Miserably) asking for volunteers at Glastonbury, I surprised myself by saying yes. The deal was to work in a bar, for three eight-hour shifts, in return for a free ticket. I would go alone, camp alone, and leave myself at the mercy of making friends with my fellow volunteers. If not, I would be there by myself for six days.I had been before – eight times – but always with friends. Would I even remember how to work in a bar? It had been more than a decade since I’d worked in a mountain bar during ski season in the French Alps.Was I too old? Was I too menopausal?People said I was brave, but I was petrified. The thrill of arriving by myself was tinged with nerves. But, even as I put up my tent, people said hello. The team was a mix of ages, from early 20s to those in their 60s. Because we all camped together, it was easy to make friends.I felt my confidence rise as I remembered how to be “barmaid Jenny”. I realised I wasn’t quite so “past it” after all. I was by no means the oldest, either – proving to me that, actually, 47 is only as “old” as I tell myself it is.View image in fullscreen‘I remembered how to be “barmaid Jenny”.’Photograph: Courtesy of Jenny HollidayBeing at Glastonbury alone was like a golden ticket to being “me” again. I did things I wouldn’t normally do, like eating outand going to a gig alone. And, as I watched Pulp with happy tears streaming down my cheeks, I felt more aligned with my old self. I felt a sense of freedom as the self-doubt started to ebb away.I didn’t expect the experience to be so liberating when it came to my menopause funk.Since Glastonbury, I’ve booked my next holiday – no package deal this year. Instead, I’m staying at an Airbnb on an island off the Italian coast. I am also embracing my work as a career coach much more confidently than I did before. My daily mindset has changed, too.

This wasn’t even what you could charitably call “fashionably late”, given theformat was already on its last legs, but I loved it, and because nobody else was interested, blank discs were dirt cheap. I have a vague recollection of grabbing packs at Poundland, allowing me to create a glorious self-curated library of cheap music, five years before the birth of Spotify.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’m reminded of this because this week I’ve published a piece on the Filter about the portable audio technology that killed them:MP3 players. Or digital audio players, to give them their more accurate name, given MP3 playback is just one of many supported file formats.For some time, I’ve had a nagging feeling that music streaming wasn’t cutting it. Yes, having all the world’s music at your fingertips is a technological marvel, but you have to deal with “kid in a sweetshop” choice paralysis – and even more importantly, it’s notyourmusic.Rage against the algorithmWhile collecting modern players for the piece, I was delighted to find I wasn’t alone in experiencing this disconnect from the modern streaming world. Chris Laidler, office manager atAdvanced MP3 Players, gave me an insight into the kinds of people who reject streaming modernity. My kind of people.When he started in 2017, the customer base was primarily the niche audiophile community, “pursuing high-res audio as a hobby”, he says. People who “talk more about the tech than they do about the music”.But since Covid, these buyers have been joined by a new, more casual customer. For some, there’s an element of nostalgia, but there are more logical reasons, too.“It gets them off an algorithm,” Laidler says. “It’s music they’re seeking out themselves. But it also means they have a device that can store music that they actually own, rather than leasing it from Spotify.”And for audiophiles, smartphone audio just doesn’t cut it. “When you think about it, if your phone’s about that size,” Laidler says, gesturing with his hands, “it means that the DAC [digital-to-analogue converter] that’s in there is only going to be one tiny component of this thing.” Whereas, with dedicated MP3 players, “the entire infrastructure is designed for as accurate music recreation as possible.” And yes, that means wired audio ports as standard.Take that, Apple!Some people will balk at the price of entry, even if they like the idea in principle. For the purposes of the piece, I capped the eligible price at £650, although the technology can go into the thousands. Don’t worry too much, though. Not only is my budget pick, the excellentSnowsky Echo Mini, from an astonishing £66.99, but after a certain price point, it becomes more about chasing a specific sound signature than any noticeable increase in quality.The tyranny of choiceIronically, there are so many devices that trying to choose one can echo the paralysis you feel when opening Spotify. “At the audio trade shows, people come in with their little notebooks, and they go around each room making notes about the character of each player and the price,” Laidler says. “But then you see these same people come back the next year, and you ask them, ‘Oh, which one did you end up going for?’ and they’re still deciding.”Should you buy an old MP3 player? Probably not, due to limited storage, weak file-format compatibility and the lack of warranty. “As a nostalgic thing, I think they’re great,” Laidler says, recalling his first one: a “hideous-looking thing” built in to headphones that wrapped around your head.“I like when people bring out these old players and show them off to me when I’m doing trade shows and meetings. We still have an iPod Classic rattling around in the office because we just can’t bring ourselves to part with it. We should really start a museum or something.”This week’s picksThe best beauty Advent calendars in 2025, tested (yes, we know it’s early!)The finishing touch: great buys for under £100 to lift your living space, chosen by interiors experts‘It’s better than plastic and cheaper’: 20 sustainable swaps that worked (and saved you money)How to get your garden ready for autumn: 17 expert tips you can do now – and what to skip‘The crunch?

The food has been cooked on-site and is free for everyone, part of India’s ambitious “midday meal” –PM Poshan– programme to incentivise school enrolment.The scheme covers more than 1m state-run schools across the country, but the menu at Laitsohpliah is hyperlocal, thanks to a recent charity initiative in the state.View image in fullscreenA lunch of rice, dal, potatoes with east Himalayan chives, cured dry fish andsohryngkham, a wild berry pickleThis lunchtime, apart from the staple rice and dal, there is a dish of potatoes with east Himalayan chives, cured dry fish andsohryngkham, a wild berry pickle.Much of it has been sourced from local farmers, including parents of the pupils, while the rest has been grown in the school’s kitchen garden.“Our students don’t like skipping meals any more,” says the headteacher, Nestar Kharmawphlang, who has taught at the school for 30 years.Across the remote state of Meghalaya – originally part of Assam and home to the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo communities – fresh, locally sourced ingredients such as millet, fruit and wild greens are used to supplement the carbohydrate-heavy fare of rice, lentils and the occasional egg that dominate the programme’s menus.The shift is courtesy of an initiative by theNorth East Society for Agroecology Support (Nesfas), which aims to make school lunches healthier, more sustainable and climate-resilient. Since 2022, Laitsohpliah has been one of 26 government-run schools in the state where lunches are transforming children’s appetites and energy levels through the use of locally grown and nutrient-rich ingredients.View image in fullscreenThe school’s headteacher, Nestar Kharmawphlang, in his kitchen gardenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenEast Himalayan chives and cured fish add nutritional value to the children’s foodExperts say the model is promising because while the government scheme, launched in 1995, has aimed to provide free, nutritious meals to its poorest children, itsimpact has been limitedby budget constraints and other challenges in a country where more thanhalf of children under five are chronically malnourishedand more than a third are stunted.“The results would need more independent scrutiny,” says Reetika Khera, a development economist who teaches at Delhi’s Indian Institute of Technology. “But in principle, decentralisation initiatives like these can reduce costs, ensure fresher produce and better nutrition.”The local government in Meghalaya has taken note too, inviting the charity to train more than 7,000 school cooks with the aim of diversifying menus using indigenous foods.Back at the school in Laitsohpliah, the cook serves lunch through a window of the school’s cramped kitchen.View image in fullscreenAt another local school, rice is served with dal, tomato salad mixed with wild edible leaves, lemon slices, and a cauliflower and vegetable gravyView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenIarap Bor Lang Khongsit waits for his lunch at the kitchen window; and Offiliana Syiemlieh shows off her foodIn the queue with his friends, 10-year-old Iarap Bor Lang Khongsit says he “loves the food at school”, and his favourite dish isan omelettemade with finely chopped fiddlehead ferns and turmeric.Millet, once disliked by many of the children, is now baked in cakes or brewed into a thick tea; grated carrot salads have sesame seeds, salt, onion andnei lieh (perilla seeds); potato cheese balls are made with chives; and dal is enriched with local pulses such as rice beans, similar to mung beans.But it is about more than just appetising meals.Schoolsorganise regular outings to nearby forests to teach the children to identify edible fruit and vegetables from the wild.View image in fullscreenA school lunch of rice, pumpkin dal withchayotegourd, dry fish, chutney, egg, wild fish mint and pineappleOffiliana Syiemlieh, 14, says she first discovered wild edibles at school. “Now, sometimes, I bringjamyrdoh[fish mint] grown by my mother at home to contribute to the school meal.”Kharmawphlang says one goal of the scheme is to restore the relevance of traditional foods to everyday diets. “Jarain– our version of buckwheat – is rich in micronutrients, climate-resilient and able to withstand extreme temperatures,” he says. “Yet it was considered as feed for pigs.”A months-longmapping exercise, conducted with community members, recorded more than 200 edible plant species across Meghalaya.View image in fullscreenKharmawphlang protects himself from the rain with a traditional bamboo rainshield as he inspects the school vegetable gardenView image in fullscreenPosters on classroom walls show the nutritional values of common foods and traditional alternatives.

This is especially significant in Meghalaya, which reports the highest rate of stunting in India:47% among children under five, well above the national average and twice the rate of states such as Kerala.At Laitsohpliah, Kharmawphlang says attendance has improved. And at the nearby Dewlieh government school, one of the teachers, Cheerfillius Khongngain, says he has observed a increase in pupils’ energy levels.“The good part is that it supports both children’s nutrition and local farmers,” Khongngain says.The reduced dependence on supply chains also means it is environmentally more sustainable and a community effort.“These are no longer just school meals,” says Bada Nongkynrih of Nesfas. “They are community-led school meals – everyone is involved.”View image in fullscreenNine-year-old Ibansari Mawlong collects her food.

The sharpness of a fresh, herby chutney with salty butter, meanwhile, makes the perfect topping for barbecued corn on the cob. I often cook the corn straight on the hob, which is a bit tricky, but it’s how we did it when I was growing up in India.Corn on the cob curry (pictured top)Prep10 minCook45 minServes4-6For the curry4 corncobs, cut in half widthways2-3 tbsp peanut oil, or sunflower oil1 tsp cumin seeds4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped20 curry leaves400ml coconut milk1 tsp saltFor the curry paste40gfresh coriander, leaves and stalks10gfresh mint,leaves only6 garlic cloves,peeled2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled4 green chillies, stalks discarded, flesh roughlychopped (remove the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)1 medium-sized red onion, peeled and roughly chopped1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp black pepper2 tsp soft brown sugar½ tsp ground turmeric4 tbsp lime juicePut the corn pieces in a pan, cover with water and bring to a boil.

It responded by sending a letter to her late mother thanking her for letting it know of the change. When Stevens complained, Direct Line dispatched its apology and a goodwill cheque to her mother.She then notified her mother’s electricity supplier,E.ONNext. Rather than sending a bill to the estate, the company’s response was to write complaining that her mother’s direct debit had been cancelled and warning that her charges would increase if she did not reinstate it. It followed this up with two bills demanding payment within seven days.Stevens notified her mother’s gas supplier, British Gas. It replied with a letter in incomprehensibly poor English, followed by bills addressed with a cheery “hello” to her late mother.She notifiedFacebook, which offered her late mother its condolences over her loss and at the same time informed her it was memorialising her account.“It’s been excruciating,” Stevens says. “I don’t understand how these huge companies can treat something so common, but that requires sensitivity, with such a lack of care.”Three of the four companies apologised to Stevens after Guardian Money got in touch. E.ON said it was reviewing its bereavement procedures, and Direct Line promised to update its IT system to prevent a recurrence of the mistake. British Gas said the wording of the bills should have made clear that payment was not expected until probate had been granted. Facebook did not respond.Poor communicationsStevens’s experience is not an isolated one. Bereaved families who have contacted Guardian Money report being thwarted by poor communications, unnecessary bureaucracy and unreasonable delays when they notify companies of the death of a customer. Some claim they have been financially penalised because slow responses have delayed probate applications or because of failures to close accounts.A bank sent a credit card default notice to a customer’s widower three months after he had informed the bank of her death. Several readers have received letters and bills addressed to late relatives after reporting their deaths to banks and utilities firms.In the most egregious case seen by Guardian Money, a 91-year-old widow wasleft for three months without access to her moneyafter her bank mistakenly recorded her as deceased and froze her account when she reported the death of her husband. Branch staff refused to deal with her complaint because the system said she was dead.View image in fullscreenThe Financial Conduct Authority has found failings in bereavement support among banks and insurance companies.Photograph: FCA/PARecent reports by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found widespread failings in bereavement support among banks and insurance companies. The regulator concluded that disjointed processes, inexperienced staff and inadequate technology were in some cases forcing relatives to repeat information about a death on each call, and complicating access to accounts of the deceased.Under the FCA’sconsumer dutyregime, which first came into force in 2023, financial firms are required to support customers in vulnerable situations and ensure they are not disadvantaged by systems and processes. Most large service providers spell out a bereavement policy on their websites, but some fail to follow through in practice.Similarly, the energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, expects companies to offer effective and tailored support to the bereaved customers under its consumer vulnerability strategy.A range of obstaclesDespite working in financial services as the manager of an investment company, Mark Sanderson was surprised by the difficulties he faced when his father died.“The experience of managing my own father’s financial affairs has revealed a stark gap between the level of service many firms claim to offer and what they actually deliver in these moments of vulnerability,” he says.View image in fullscreenCompanies should offer one-stop channels of communication to bereavement support agents, says Mark Sanderson.Photograph: Wavebreak Media ltd/Alamy“I encountered a bewildering range of obstacles: unnecessarily complicated forms, impossible-to-reach customer service representatives, long response times and a general lack of transparency. I’m certain that without my experience working in financial services, I would not have been able to navigate the process.”Sanderson says companies should offer one-stop channels of communication to bereavement support agents, who can guide relatives sympathetically through the process instead of forcing them to navigate convoluted call centres.He is calling for simplified paperwork to replace the “dauntingly complex” forms he had to fill in, and investment in technology to allow documents to be uploaded and signed digitally and the status of a case to be tracked online.Too many institutions still rely on repeated paperwork, inflexible phone lines and opaque decision-makingFairer Finance’s Tim Hogg“One of the most distressing aspects was the lack of certainty over whether my documents had been received,” Sanderson says. “In some cases I was left waiting days for any acknowledgment, leading to unnecessary anxiety.”These failings are not uncommon, according to the campaign group Fairer Finance.“Too many institutions still rely on repeated paperwork, inflexible phone lines and opaque decision-making, leaving families to chase approvals and explanations at a time when they can least cope,” says Tim Hogg, its director.He adds that while a handful of companies have begun to streamline their bereavement procedures, “the majority have yet to make this a priority”.The FCA says it has written to the companies it surveyed and reminded them of its expectations.Emad Aladhal, the FCA’s director of retail banking, says: “When banks and building societies get it right for their customers, they can make a real difference at a difficult time. But when they fail to recognise and respond to customers who need more help, it adds to the stress. All firms should consider where they can make improvements.”View image in fullscreenThe deceased’s water company will be among the firms and organisations you will need to inform.Photograph: Chris Ison/PAWhich companies to inform when someone diesMake a list with headings to help you work out which companies will have to be contacted. This will vary depending on the person’s financial affairs, and whether there is a spouse or partner who shares some of their property and accounts.MoneyHelper, a government-sponsored website, gives details of who needs to be informed and when and tells you what, if any, costs will be involved with the administration.Companies will require a death certificate before they can close the account of a deceased customer; some will need a grant of probate or other evidence that you are authorised to act on behalf of the customer’s estate.It is worth checking with each organisation as soon as possible what documents it needs. Some allow you to fill out an online bereavement form, while others require a phone call. An internet search for the company and its bereavement process should take you to a page explaining what you need to do.A simpler option is to sign up to a free bereavement service such asSettld. This allows you to submit an online form that simultaneously informs relevant participating companies, from banks to social media, of a customer’s death. TheDeath Notification Servicewas set up by the financial services company Equiniti to perform a similar function within the financial sector. One online form will notify all relevant financial firms who have signed up to the platform.In most cases, you are likely to have to identify the following companies and contact them if accounts were in the deceased’s name, or held jointly with them.FinancialBanks or building societies.Pension providers.Insurers, for example about car, private healthcare, critical illness, vet or travel policies.Investment companies.Car leasing or financing firms.Accountants.Credit or store card providers.PropertyMortgage lender, managing agent or landlord as appropriate.Insurer (buildings and contents).Energy and water companies.TV, landline and broadband providers.PersonalMobile phone providers.Solicitor.Personal or domestic service providers, for example, carers, healthcare services, gardeners or cleaners.Subscription services.Financial companies are bound by theConsumer Dutystandard, introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority, which requires them to treat vulnerable customers, including the bereaved, promptly and sensitively. Regulators of other sectors such as telecoms and utilities also require companies to have bereavement strategies to ensure relatives are treated fairly.* Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsConsumer affairsBereavementDeath and dyingInsurance industryUtilitiesE.ONCentricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I even found acountycourtjudgment (CCJ) had been issued against me without my knowledge.It turns out I shared my maiden name with the person who does own the debt, although we have different middle names and live in different counties. I’ve repeatedly asked the debt collectors to remove me from their records.I’ve involved a solicitor, and even reported it to the police but nothing works.The latest letter insists I owe £146 to a telecoms company I’ve never been with.My credit score has been affected and I was refused a mortgage. When will it end?KS,WolverhamptonThe sense of stress and impotence caused by a threatening demand for a stranger’s debt is incalculable. Some of those you have received over the years threaten bailiff visits and legal action. When the CCJ was taken out in your name, fines were added to the sum you were said to owe.You have now successfully applied for the CCJ to be set aside.Your namesake, who was identified to you by one of the collection agents, in itself a GDPR breach, appears to owe money to payday lenders and a telecoms company, among others.You have been contacted by more than half a dozen debt collection agents and their legal representatives over the years. Your log of communications with each of them shows the dizzying number of emails, letters and phone calls you’ve had to send or make. As soon as one company falls silent, another pops up.One collector, which resumed its demands months after removing you from its records, concluded insultingly that the debtor must be an ex-partner of yours and told you to disassociate your accounts from them.The core of the problem is the long chain of businesses involved in enforcing a debt. Big companies that can’t get a customer to pay up often sell the debt to a collection agency. The collection agency will typically use a debt tracing firm to locate the errant debtor. And debt tracing firms may subcontract to other companies.The depressing truth is that anyone can set up as a debt tracing firm and there’s no official oversight of their methods and sources.According to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which regulates data protection, creditors must take “reasonable steps” to ensure that the information unearthed by a trace is accurate before contacting an individual. A matching name and birth date is not considered sufficient to link someone to a debt.Anyone who is chased for an unrecognised debt should write to the collection agency requiring it to send evidence of money owed and to put the account on hold in the meantime.If evidence is not supplied and the company continues to send demands, they cancomplain to the ICO, or, in the case of a financial company, to theFinancial Ombudsman Service.However, an upheld complaint will not necessarily stop other companies using the inaccurate link. I contacted the latest agency to pursue you, CRS Recovery, whose website promises “to do everything we can to help you get to a better place”.A month after promising to leave you in peace, it resumed demands for an unpaid phone bill.

Currently, they might includeHarrison Ford in shortsin the 1970s and90s Oasis. But there are also some that are canon – such as Buffalo, the look masterminded by stylist Ray Petri and photographer Jamie Morgan in the mid-80s.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Shaped largely through fashion shoots forthe Facemagazine, the duo created a look that reflected the culture and creativity of London at the time, but gave it the classy and cinematic feel of a Marlon Brando portrait or a shot by Henri Cartier-Bresson. This beautifully lit black-and-white photography of street-cast models and people – including a then-unknown Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Neneh Cherry and Nick Kamen, who later went on to star inLevi’s famous 1985 launderette advert– went on to shape both fashion photography and fashion.Still, defining the Buffalo aesthetic is not easy. Speaking to the Guardian, Morgan covers everything from Buffalo as “a collective” rather than a look, to the genesis of its name (they took inspiration from Bob Marley’s 1983 track Buffalo Soldier and the buffalo as used by Native Americans). “It’s grown to be more of an attitude,” he says. “It’s being independent, being authentic in who you are, being a bit of a maverick, being an outsider, not curtailing to the industry.”Morgan is speaking ahead of the publication of a new book,1985 Buffalo, published by Idea Books, which features images from shoots by Morgan and Petri from 1985. Naomi Campbell was pivotal in the book’s commission. “She did herexhibition at the V&A[and asked to feature these images],” Morgan says. Looking for the images, he discovered a box in his archives labelled “1985”. As well as the Campbell shots, it had “all the shoots you see in the book”. This chance discovery speaks to the time. “We never thought of a legacy,” he says. “We had no idea that [Buffalo] was going to become so much part of British culture. We were just doing our thing.”View image in fullscreenNick Kamen, right, with Talisa Soto, in a Buffalo shoot from 1985.Photograph: Jamie MorganMorgan met Petri in 1982 but he says it wasn’t until 1985 that “we were in our full flow”. As well as young supermodels, the year boasts what is probably the most iconic Buffalo image – that of 12-year-old model Felix Howard (the son of a friend) dressed in a suit, polo neck and fedora featuring a ripped piece of newspaper showing the word “killer”, staring directly at the camera. Part punk, part James Cagney via Bugsy Malone, it’s a provocative image, and it becamethe cover of the Face in March 1985.View image in fullscreenHoward, right, in a shoot with Jack Negrit.Photograph: Jamie Morgan“We were changing the nature of styling quite quickly,” he says. “This shoot crystallised the fact that fashion photography was not about clothes … It was about attitude, styling, DIY, [an] accumulation of ideas, cultural references, film references … I think that’s why it really resonated with so many people.”Rather than designer clothes, Buffalo was about secondhand finds, army surplus pieces and dressing up. “We’d get a secondhand double-breasted pinstripe and then mix it with a tracksuit that we’d get from a sports shop,” Morgan says. Characters were crucial, from the gangster movies that inspired the Howard shoot to Black cowboys. “We realised they had been very instrumental in the American culture, but had been whitewashed completely,” he says. “Now withLouis Vuitton, it’s become a thing. But at the time, we were like, ‘Wow, look at these incredible Black cowboys.’”View image in fullscreenA model called Tony in a shoot inspired by Black cowboys.Photograph: Jamie MorganSome of the images haven’t dated well 40 years on – a Native American headdress worn as an accessory, which could be viewed as cultural appropriation. Morgan also says he put an image of a topless Howard on social media, and was inundated with comments on how he was “sexualising young kids” with others saying, “‘What are you talking about? You must be perverted if you see that as a sexual image.”’ He concedes that doing the same picture in 2025 would have a different reaction. “Now, you couldn’t do it,” he says.Even with these caveats, part of the lasting legacy of Buffalo comes from the diverse group of people who were involved in it. “Most of the Buffalo people were from immigrant families, strangely enough, myself being Jewish, Neneh (whose parents were from Sweden and Sierra Leone), the Kamens were half Burmese,” says Morgan. Street casting was central. “Ray would say, ‘Oh, look at that guy on the fruit and veg shop,’” Morgan remembers. “I would go up and ask him to come to the studio … Of course, you didn’t have mobile phones, you’d just hope they’d turn up.”This approach initially came about through frustration around the fashion establishment. “When we first started we thought we’d look at the agencies and see who’s out there,” says Morgan. “We asked for Black models and the first we asked, they sent us Nick Kamen. He’s half Burmese, half Scottish. But that was the closest they could get to a Black model.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She had a hard path, she had to fight the corner of diversity pretty well singularly for many years.” Moss, meanwhile, was a “cheeky chappy”, “but also straight away, we were like, ‘Oh, this girl, she can do glamour as well.’” (The Moss images here were shot a few years later, when the model was about 14.)View image in fullscreenA young Kate Moss in the Buffalo book.Photograph: Jamie MorganKamen had a different kind of star power. “When you walked into a room with Nick Kamen, it was just over. You didn’t exist,” says Morgan. This wasn’t, perhaps, as nice as it sounds. “He was just unbearably beautiful,” says Morgan, “and very shy. Nick had quite a difficult life, and he didn’t like being loved for his beauty, he found it quite awkward.”If 1985 was a key year, Morgan said Buffalo was over relatively quickly, particularly after Petri died from Aids-related complications in 1989 at the age of 40. “The other kids were coming in, David Sims and Glen Luchford, and it was heroin chic and skinny white girls.”Buffalo, he says, “went underground”, to emerge again in 2009 when Morgan worked onan issue of Arena Homme Plus dedicated to Petri, 20 years after his death. More recently, Morgan has also had newer creatives pay tribute to his and Petri’s work. “I started getting contacted by a lot of students at Central Saint Martins –Campbell Addy,IB Kamara,” he says. “A lot of gay Black kids were like, ‘I see there’s a place for me in the industry.’” Morgan went on to work with Kamara, when he was editor at Dazed, and he has since collaborated with a new generation in London, includingMartine Rose. “It’s inspired so many people, and they’ve taken it into their own work and their own life,” he says. “It’s taken a life of its own.” Forty years on from that 1985 moment, it looks like Buffalo is as strong as ever.1985 Buffalolaunches on 18 September 2025 via Idea and Dover Street Markets worldwide.

However, there was a twist. Instead of a luxury brand staging the show on Sunday, it was the high street label Cos.The Swedish label, founded in 2007 by the H&M group, welcomed guests including the British actors Jodie Turner-Smith and Naomi Watts as well as the singer Lauryn Hill to a former 1890s rope factory in Brooklyn.Now used as a warehouse space, the brand had erected a vast cracked concrete-effect catwalk around which were rows of steel benches. The brutalist style also extended to the clothing, with a colour palette of metal greys and charcoal. Oversized coats ranging from cashmere to leather were tightly cinched with skinny belts. Trousers pooled around glove-like leather shoes, while lapels on shirts and jumpers were knife sharp.View image in fullscreenCos’s signature slinky silhouette in gunmetal grey.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesSandwiched between heritage American brands such as Ralph Lauren and Coach, the appearance of Cos on this week’s schedule reflects a wider attempt by the high street to move beyond its fast fashion reputation.On Thursday, Cos’s sister brand H&M will kick off London fashion week with a show styled by Katie Grand, a British creative director who works regularly with Marc Jacobs and Prada, and starring the Vogue models Alex Consani and Paloma Elsesser. In August, Topshop returned to the catwalk after a seven-year absence with a show in Trafalgar Square that featured Cara Delevingne.Joy Montgomery, the shopping editor at British Vogue, says high street brands are under growing pressure to win customer loyalty, a feat that is “becoming increasingly tough when you consider headwinds such as the cost-of-living crisis, high-street closures, and the stratification of the market between ultra-fast fashion and ultra-high-end luxury. The middle-ground is where the battle is being fought.”View image in fullscreenCos’s catwalk pieces are typically priced higher than its main collection.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesThis type of “luxe-washing” also extends to high street brands collaborating with designers and celebrities. Zac Posen, who carved out a name for his eponymous label by dressing Rihanna and Sarah Jessica Parker, designs for Gap. Uniqlo’s creative director is the ex-Chloé and Givenchy designerClare Waight Keller,best known for designing Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex’s wedding dress. Meanwhile, Zara has partnered with everyone from Kate Moss to Stefano Pilati, and Mango has worked withVictoria Beckham, a trend spearheaded by H&M when itlaunched its first collectionwith Chanel’s Karl Lagerfeld in 2004.While Cos’s catwalk pieces are typically higher than its main collection, they are still a fraction of the price of designer brands. Sunday’s show included a leather funnel-neck top for £299 and draped midi skirt that costs £229. There were also severalfour-figure coats, including glossy pony hair and collarless shearling versions.While Cos previously demarcated its catwalk collection from its main line in stores by using the sub-brand Cos Atelier, this season the brand decided to drop the name.View image in fullscreenSombre tones such as burgundy and navy dominated the Cos collection.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesSpeaking before the show, its design director, Karin Gustafsson, who has been with the brand since its inception, said it was to avoid customer confusion. “All our work is about making the best type of product. Everything we do is rooted in craft and innovation, so having a special label didn’t make sense.”While higher prices and limited availability are part of the perception of luxury, often the care labels on high street brands tell a different story. Synthetic fabrics such as petroleum-derived polyester and nylon are frequently listed.Montgomery says while catwalk shows can “cut through the noise of online marketing”, it is “by no means a one-size-fits-all solution. There is a risk that it becomes just another gimmick for brands to jump on without consideration or strategy. “Consumers are more tuned into authenticity than ever before, and all it can take is one wrong move for their loyalty to be placed elsewhere.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Previously known as the G Label and sold on her wellness and lifestyle website, Goop, it is now named Gwyn.The rebrand comes as part of a wider reconfiguration at Goop, the company she founded in 2008. Last year, it laid off 18% of its 216-person workforce and reduced its wide-ranging product lines to focus solely on fashion, beauty and food.While Goop is regularly mocked, Paltrow understands the power of marketing and regularly plays into its controversies. Stunts include a “This smells like my vagina” candle and recommending a $15,000 24-carat gold-plated vibrator in its annual gift guide.The Gwyn collection, however, is gimmick-free. Echoing the soft, power dress code she honed during her 2023Utah court case, it consists of cosy knitwear and softly tailored pieces.Paltrow said chunky jumpers and splash-proof barn jackets were influenced by her time spent living in England but that her style ultimately remained rooted inNew York. “I have a style that hasn’t changed that much. I was raised on the Upper East Side, mixing preppy button-downs with my own stuff, so my clothes still reflect that to this day.”This article was amended on 15 September 2025. Karin Gustafsson is the design director of Cos, not the creative director as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsNew York fashion weekH&MFashion weeksGwyneth PaltrowNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There are many ways to make an entrance, but lurching into a pub full of smartly dressed diners while windswept, muddy and more than a little frayed wouldn’t be my first choice. At 7.30pm on a sunny Sunday evening, theWelldiggers Arms– a country pub just outside Petworth in West Sussex – is full of people tucking into hearty roasts, the glass-walled restaurant overlooking glorious downland scenery, the sun all but disappeared behind the hills. For my husband, Mark, and I, it’s more than a stop for supper; the pub marks the halfway point on our two-day walking adventure along a brand new trail, the 25-milePetworth Way.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Twenty-five miles may not sound like much (I have keen walker friends who would do it in a day) but, for us, it’s the perfect length, with plenty of pubs along the way. The first leg, from Haslemere to Petworth, covers countryside we’re both entirely unfamiliar with; the second, Petworth to Arundel runs through landscapes I’ve known since childhood. Happily, the start and finish points can be reached by rail – meaning we can leave the car at home and set off with nothing but small rucksacks, water bottles and detailed printed instructions.A map showing the Petworth Way and the South Downs national parkThings start easily enough; a brief weave through Haslemere’s residential streets before the first serious ascent, through fields and shady, fern-rippled woodland that opens out on to Black Down, the highest point in the South Downs national park. After the dim light of the wood, the heathland blazes with colours; bursts of butter-yellow gorse, purple heather and bottle-green pine trees, all set beneath an intensely blue sky.It reminds me of Ashdown Forest, which inspired Winnie-the-Pooh, and Mark and I bicker happily about who would be Christopher Robin and who Pooh, before arriving at the Temple of the Winds viewpoint, where we sink gratefully on to the seat and soak up the view. It is spectacular; green velvet hills and blueish-tinged valleys, church spires and the odd country estate dotted between the trees, all of Sussex laid out before us, half drenched in sunlight, half darkened by ominous clouds throwing down grey mists of rain on the horizon.View image in fullscreenSunset over Blackdown.Photograph: Roy Wylam/AlamyKeen not to miss lunch at theNoah’s Arkpub in Lurgashall, we set off again, at which point the bickering becomes slightly less good-humoured as we realise we’re going the wrong way. Ten minutes’ later, we’re properly lost, with an OS app on a phone that has unhelpfully lost all signal and directions that make no sense. Thankfully, a pair of local walkers point us in the right direction, and we make it down the hill, past vineyards and on to the pub, where we settle in with a couple of cold halves, some local salami and warm bread, eaten while watching a cricket match on the village green.Fortunately, the next few miles are more straightforward, until a final ascent that leads intoPetworth House’s great park; a glorious end to the day that makes us feel as if we’ve got this walking thing licked. That is, until we realise there are very few taxis in Petworth and we’ll have to walk the extra mile and a half to theWelldiggers, which, fortunately, proves to be a cocoon of loveliness; all soft clean linens, piping-hot showers, and staff who politely pretend not to notice our slightly catatonic state over dinner.As the Arun valley unfolds, I think of how many decades I’ve driven the road alongside and how different the countryside looks when taken at a slow paceNext morning, fuelled by deliciousshakshuka(poached eggs in a hot tomato sauce) and several buckets of tea, we hop in a taxi back to Petworth park to continue the walk across the Sussex Weald. The route drops in on a short section of theSerpent Trail– a 65-mile route from Haslemere to Petersfield that we pencil in for next year – before veering away past Burton Park, a grandiose, privately owned Greek revival mansion, all Doric columns and vanilla-hued walls. From here, the path heads downhill, which, we agree, is not a good thing, as it means going uphill is not far off.Uphill is something of an understatement, and the pull up through the villages of Barlavington and Sutton was made even more challenging as theWhite Horse Inn, earmarked for a restorative half, turns out to be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Fuelled instead by lukewarm water and half a Twix each, we carry on towards Bignor, the gradient steepening with every step. By the time we’re walking east along the South Downs Way, the 360-degree views – across a patchwork of faded cornfields and khaki grassland – are quite some reward. Even so, it’s a welcome change to begin the descent into Houghton village, where I know (because I’ve checked) lunch awaits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the Arun valley unfolds beside the wooded hills of the Arundel estate, I think of how many decades I’ve driven the road that runs alongside and how different the countryside looks when taken at a slow pace, with the chance to stop and look, rather than snatched glances through the windscreen. Thirty years ago, I’d sit over lunch with my mum and dad in theGeorge & Dragon’s garden, watching hikers amble down the very hillside we’re walking on. I’ve not been back to the pub for many years and it’s lovely – if slightly lump in throat – to return and have my parents suddenly conjured up so vividly.It’s tempting to stay all afternoon, but after a classic ploughman’s (what else?), we lace up our boots for the final stretch, past Houghton’s thatched, flint-walled cottages and along the River Arun, before one final ascent into the Arundel estate. Clouds glower, but we’re lucky; the rain holds off as we skirt the edge of Swanbourne Lake and pass the Hiorne Tower, built by architect Francis Hiorne in 1797, as part of his (failed) bid to rebuild Arundel Castle. When we pop out on to London Road and amble towards the familiar outline of the castle, we’re almost too focused on finding large slabs of cake to properly celebrate the fact we’ve arrived at our destination.Later, once the train has taken us back to our corner of the East Sussex countryside, I think about how little I know, really, of the landscapes I’ve visited since childhood. We’ll probably never be long-distance walkers, but weekend trails like this prove you don’t have to be; a couple of days is enough to see a familiar landscape in a whole new light.Accommodation was provided by theWelldiggers Arms, which has double rooms from £115 B&BExplore more on these topicsWalking holidaysSussex holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When he met his future wife, he found his ‘bulwark’ and has never looked backPaula CocozzaMon 15 Sep 2025 01.55 EDTShareOn Grady Harris’s wedding day, his father, a Presbyterian preacher, presided over the vows. “And when my father told us to kiss, and we did, I felt a sense of joy that I’d never felt before,” Harris says. “I’ve had a life full of happiness … But that was a new joy.”Harris was 60, and marrying for the first time. Now 69, he lives in Atlanta, Georgia, with his wife, Marcia Wood, 66, who has an art gallery in the city. At times, their relationship must have seemed unlikely – 12 years separated their first and second dates, and they met by chance through a long chain of friends of friends.“Coincidence is about as close to magic as we get in the real world,” Harris says.All his life, he had moved around. In childhood, the family followed his father’s ministry. When Harris – “the only son of an only son of an only son” – was seven, they moved to the Brazilian highlands, “about 200km past where the paved road ended”. He loved reading adventure stories. “I had a horse and my folks would encourage me to just head off,” he says.In adulthood, he kept on moving. He left college and hitchhiked – “the usual adventure”. The list of jobs lengthened: bicycle mechanic, security guard, stints on farms, at a furniture factory in Michigan, an ice-cream factory in Georgia, a spice factory in Maryland.View image in fullscreen‘I admired her … I get infatuated easily, but love takes time.’Photograph: Galen BurkeThrough it all, Harris played guitar and sang in a band calledTwo Legs. “We did have some hope, delusion … of it being a thing,” he says. Each job or place he lived felt provisional. “Well, this is good for now. But I am a musician. One day I’ll get paid for it.”In his 30s, to keep a relationship going, he moved to Germany, and when that fizzled out, to the Czech Republic, where he taught English, before returning to the US in his 40s. His parents were getting older, so was he, and he wanted a job to build a pension.When he got a position at Emory University, near his parents’ home, the phone kept ringing for the woman Harris was replacing. One day the woman herself called, they discovered a mutual acquaintance and she connected Harris to old school friends, and an art crowd in Atlanta – among them, Wood. They went on a date.The role, and all that came with it, was the start of something new for Harris – and an end to the moving around.For the first time in his life, he earned enough to live alone. “And it was extraordinary … Money is an incredible insulator,” he says. “The lack of it makes you very vulnerable. Not having a career meant no dependable income, no pension building.”For a while, he enjoyed the freedom of solitude. He and Wood would see each other around. Neither pushed for another date.One night, 12 years after the first date, Harris attendeda retrospectiveWood had organised at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Georgia. When they hugged in greeting, Wood’s hand lingered on Harris’s cashmere jacket. Along with living alone, he was also, he says, “the first owner of most of my clothes for the first time in my adult life”. He asked her out.“I admired her … I get infatuated easily, but love takes time,” Harris says.Four years later, it was Wood who asked Harris if he wanted to marry. She had to be sure she wanted marriage herself … so he waited till she knew. They wed in Harris’s parents’ back yard in Florida.For most of Harris’s adult life, lasting commitment “hadn’t been a possibility”. Wood was “the first person with whom I thought I could live with for a long time. That whatever our frictions – and we do argue – that our arguments wouldn’t be the end of it,” Harris says. “She is my bulwark.”He’s had the same job for 25 years and doesn’t miss moving around. “Living with Marcia is an adventure. I guess that sounds pat. But it’s true. Living well with someone is a challenge. Not because of them, but because of oneself …”Harris likes to quip that with marrying late, the scale of commitment had diminished. But clearly marriage has brought him to a new place. “I think that’s it,” he says. “I have found home. It took a while to recognise. I had not been there.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60MarriagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The pieces cannot overlap and must fit in to the given template. Flipping pieces is allowed.View image in fullscreenFor an interactive versionclick here.For a printable versionclick hereScroll below for the answer. (I didnt want to put the solution high on the page, just in case you haven’t seen it before and want to try it out first onthis interactive app.) You can move the pieces with your thumb/mouse and rotate them by clicking, or pressing the buttons. The third button is for flips.The T-puzzle is simple, a primary school standard, and yet challenging to many. According tothis research paper, out of five undergraduates given the puzzle the fastest took 2mins 20, the second about 9mins and the other three more than 15mins (and required a hint.)The interactive app, created by reader Phoebe Fletcher, has a timer and I was interested to see how you all got on.The statsNumber who gave it a go: 24,256Number who solved it: 9,650 (39.8 per cent)Fastest time. 6sSlowest time: 52m 46sMedian time: 1m 57sMean time: 3m 6sThe 6 second response was I’m sure by someone who had seen the puzzle before, although I am extremely impressed by their nimble fingers. The 52 minute response might have been someone who fell asleep.The median, at just under two minutes, is about the same as the fastest undergraduate in the academic paper, which makes me think that the paper is more or less correct. Of those who can get it, it comes quite quickly – but for many people it really is quite tough.And now for the solution. The key insight is that the pentagonal piece must be diagonal. People who fail to solve it assume that it must be placed vertically or horizontal.View image in fullscreenI hope you enjoyed the puzzle and I’ll be back in two weeks.Thanks to Phoebe Fletcher for designing the interactive puzzle.I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015.

Here, he talks about the loss of his brother, leaving soap acting and his wildest storylinesZoe WilliamsMon 15 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 06.02 EDTShareStefan Dennis joined the cast of Neighbours as Paul Robinson, the git, for its first episode in 1985. He declines to tell me how old he was then. “See,” he says, with a glint of that Paul cunning: “That’s gonna give my age away if I tell you.” If I were to take a guess – looking at him today, in Boxpark in Wembley, pin neat and ready for anything (he could nip to the shops or go clubbing) in a Lacoste polo shirt, leaping on and off high chairs as gracefully as a cat, I would say early 60s. Wikipedia says he is 67 in October. My first and enduring impression is not his age, but the fact that he must, in some bigwig showrunner’s imagination, be this year’sStrictly Come Dancingcrown prince. That’s just how it works – there are some irredeemably bad dancers who are fun to watch, there are some perfect physical specimens in their prime who look like the obvious contenders but then flame out, and then there’s the person who thinks they can’t cut a rug but has some inner dancer, that’s waited a lifetime to be activated, like a sleeper agent. Sorry to spoil it, everyone, but he is definitely that guy.Anyway, back to his age, which he insists is undisclosed. “The reason is, I was doing Flying Doctors …” This is the Australian drama about the outback. It was on in the daytime, if you were at school in the 80s you only watched it when you were ill, and I wonder how much the memory of it –veryhigh drama, slightly terrifying, wide-open scenery, absolutely millions of sheep – was coloured by having a temperature. Anyway, Dennis was in the original miniseries but didn’t return for the series because, by that time, he was already Bad Paul inNeighbours. “And in the green room, I’m reading a magazine, and there was my wife on the cover, my first wife.”This would have been Roz Roy, at that time a hostess on the Australian version of The Price is Right – they divorced in 1989. “And I turned round and said: ‘That’s my wife!’” It’s funny, you can hear the disbelief in his younger self, that he has a job as an actor and a beautiful wife on a magazine, and someone’s been employed to teach him to ride a horse. But anyway, he was playing a 19-year-old, and the director let it be known, “jokingly, but I could see the seriousness under it” that if they’d known how old he really was, he wouldn’t have got the gig. “I actually did lose a job after that, when they found out how old I really was.”View image in fullscreen‘Paul, you’re a very naughty boy’ … Paul Robinson gets punched by David Bishop (Kevin Harrington) in Neighbours.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockIt is impossible to overstate or explain how important Neighbours was, to those of us born in the 70s and 80s. Neighbours first aired in 1985 in Australia. It came to the UK in 1986 on BBC One and went out twice a day, like The Archers, the lunchtime one a repeat of the previous afternoon’s. The title was cheesy, and when Dennis was originally asked to sign for six months, he said: “It probably will only last that long anyway – Neighbours, what a corny name.” The title had nothing on the theme tune, which ended: “That’s when good neighbours become good friends.”I wonder how the show ever became a drama when everyone in it was sonice. Kylie Minogue (Charlene) was nice, Jason Donovan (Scott) was nice, Anne Charleston (Madge) was nice, Alan Dale, playing Dennis’s dad, was nice. But Dennis thinks this is the root of its popularity. “A lot of soaps are quite dark and quite heavy, you don’t get a break from it. We still had the drama in there, but it was interspersed with lightness, be it comedy or just … lightness.” But that, to my mind, is what makes its popularity so mysterious; how do you get engrossed in the love arc of two nice people who are nice to each other and are certainly soon to marry, or nine nice neighbours who are about to become good friends? And yet we were.View image in fullscreenEveryone is sonice… an early cast photo of Neighbours.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThis wasn’t lost on Dennis, who nearly broke his wrist in the late 80s, hanging on to a building, trying to escape a baying mob of teenage fans in Ireland. “It was Beatlemania, it was insane.” In a town in the north of England, a lady came up to him and smacked him on the arm, saying, “Paul, you’re a very naughty boy,” then scuttled off. He acts all this out, slapping me for effect, then hastily apologising. Paul was a scheming ratbag, always looking for a chance to get the better of people. Dennis is quite defensive of him and underlines stoutly that he was only like that because he got shot by his wife, Terry, after he had found out she had killed her former bank-robbing husband (a detail I’d completely forgotten, because he seemed just born bad). “Every soap has a villain, and I happened to be the resident,” says Dennis. “But Paul was always a likable one. He did some pretty nasty stuff but he always managed to turn it round with people.”When the audition for Paul first came up, Dennis didn’t want to do it. He was up for a part in a film, The Lighthorsemen, for which he thought he was destined, and not only because he could ride a horse. It’s a great story about the Australian mounted cavalry in the Sinai and Palestine campaign of the first world war, but it was not a good film – and flopped – so it was probably just as well he didn’t get the part. Neighbours, on the other hand, though dropped after seven months by its original channel – Seven (“The CEO, Ron Casey, went to his grave with that”) – was picked up by another network, Channel 10, where it ran for the next 39 years.People sometimes explain Neighbours’ popularity by its cast, which reads like a roll call of pretty much every Australian actor ever to be exported, except for Nicole Kidman. But the original cast had only 12 members (Minogue and Donovan were yet to join, Natalie Imbruglia was still at school and Margot Robbie was yet to be born). Dennis describes Dale, who played the widowed Robinson family patriarch Jim as a “lifelong friend”. While Dale has cropped up in various shows since, from West Wing to Ugly Betty, other Neighbours cast members were straight-down-the-line soap actors – whatever made that peculiar magic, it wasn’t star power. “It was very intimate, we really trusted each other, they were brilliant, Paul Keane [Des], Jason, although Jason was the second Scott, I was also dear friends with Darius [Perkins], who played the first Scott. Unfortunately, he died a few years ago.”When Dennis was a child, his older brother was killed aged 12 by a drunk driver. He’s said of this previously: “The repercussions of someone getting behind the wheel on drugs or drink, it’s devastating to the people around them. This happened decades and decades ago, and it still affects me today – I’m more affected today than I was back then.” The family were thick as thieves growing up on the Gold Coast – “like Australia’s Honolulu” – always “putting on shows” (he leans into the microphone and says: “Don’t forget I put inverted commas round ‘shows’). His mum had acted at the Theatre Royal in the 50s, his dad was in the navy.He always wanted to be an actor, but trained as a chef – this was the 70s, a boring time for food, a great time for everything else, he says. If he could time travel anywhere in history, he says: “Other people would go to the dark ages, I’d go back to the 70s.” Seriously? Why? “It was a naughty era. Promiscuous in every way, not just sex.” He does an elaborate mime, starting with smoking a joint, then some completely indecipherable gesticulating. “I’d be branded as a bad boy if I started telling you stories.” Show business suits him in every way: he doesn’t overthink it, he loves performing, but he doesn’t, one senses, love the discretion it requires. He’d rather tell everyone everything.View image in fullscreenThe resident villain … Paul Robinson, in trouble with the law in Neighbours.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockBy 1992, he had done Neighbours long enough, and thought: “I don’t want to be typecast, I don’t want to be working my whole life on a soap. Every young Australian actor has Hollywood in their sights.” He did go over to the US, but says: “I didn’t know how the machine worked.” Plus, this was a time before they realised that Australian actors could also do other accents. “They used to say: ‘Your voice is so cute’, but they didn’t want to use it.”He had been back and forward between Australia and the UK, doing publicity – he calls that gruelling 24-hour flight, “the long bus ride” – and “having doors opened because of Neighbours”, so when he moved to London, the work was nonstop, with more voiceover work than he could do and back-to-back stage jobs. He was in Blood Brothers in the West End: “There’s another one, like Neighbours, it’s pure entertainment.” Is it? It’s the least light entertainment you can think of, I say, given that the brothers both [spoiler alert] die, tragically, at the end. “Well, sure, it’s gut-wrenching, but it’s also side-splitting.” He met his second wife, Gail Easdale, when they were both doing a panto – she’s a “sensational dancer. She gave it up to have children.” They married in 2000 – before that, he lived for seven years with his best friend, the TV executive Nick Milligan. “I’d come over to England, and he said: ‘Stay with me while you get on your feet.’ So I said: ‘I’ll stay for about six months.’ And I lived with him for seven years.” Twelve years ago, Milligan and his eight-year-old daughter died in a horrific speedboat accident in Cornwall. “It’s so sad, what happened,” he says.In the late 1990s, he started a production company. “I was passionate about it, I was just not good at it. And I think I realised that I wasn’t good.” He and Easdale had their first son, Cameron, in 2002, and were intending to go back to Australia to build a house and raise their children. A last ditch success with his film company meant that Easdale went ahead: “I left her by herself in a foreign country with a baby. I think she was very lonely. I still feel terrible about it.” She must have forgiven him – 25 years married with three just about or almost adult children, and they are still on the phone every quarter hour, talking about soya milk and being nice to each other. Cameron is studying law and is a beautiful singer, Declan is a marvellous actor but wants to be an astrophysicist, Darci is interested in neuroscience and is a natural dancer, has been since she was five. “She’s the one I have to impress on Strictly.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s my job to make it work’ … Dennis, shot on location at BOXPARK Wembley.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianBy the time he settled back in Australia in 2004, the call came to rejoin the Neighbours cast, because of course it did, and again, he didn’t want to do it. “I had the greatest respect for it. It’s a brilliant show. But I felt I’d been over in the UK, and I’d done a lot of stuff that nobody in Australia would know about because it was on stage, or it was local TV, and I’d just look like I’d come back …” – he mimes a tail between his legs, at least, I think it was a tail – “and said, can I have a job on Neighbours, please?” Dale, who was living in the US by then, talked him into it. “He said: ‘Don’t be stupid, Stef. This is a great gig. And besides, you’re not an actor unless you’re working.’”Two years later, in 2006, he got fired. “They said: ‘We have to fire you, for doing your job so well.’” Wait, what? “They said: ‘It doesn’t matter what we’ve thrown at you, and some of the things have been quite ridiculous and a bit over the top, you’ve always made it work. It’s our fault, not yours. The character has now almost become a caricature, he’s too big for what we’re trying to do.’ Paul’s return to Neighbours was was like evil on steroids - he would marry seven times in total, have unnumbered affairs, and it was this, more than his constant scamming of his associates (the phrase “fool me once” does spring to mind - he’d been at this game for over two decades) that earned him a reputation for unalloyed mischief.After the firing, he told the production company: “I’m an actor. It’s my job to make it work.” Then, two days later, they had thought of a fix; instead of getting rid of him, they were going to make him an amputee. Originally, they were just going to remove his foot, but the stunt coordinator on Neighbours had himself lost his leg at the shin, and the producers figured they could use him as a stand-in for closeups. I don’t understandat allwhat problem this solves, but I have to admit, the making of Neighbours sounds exactly like a plot in Neighbours – grisly and horrific but serendipitous and collaborative, engrossing and completely incomprehensible.Neighbours made it through Covid – indeed, the distancing protocols that were adopted for TV sets worldwide were devised on Neighbours, which just could not stop production, there would have been panic – and then had its finale in 2022, before returning in 2023 and lasting until 2025. It was an unbelievably star-studded affair, featuring not just Minogue but Donovan, Holly Valance, Robbie – Guy Pearce came back! Because of the UK hiatus, Dennis wasn’t its longest serving character, but he was the only person to be in the first episode and the last, and it has certainly shaped his life. “I wouldn’t be sitting here talking to you today had it not been for my time in Neighbours. I wouldn’t be doing Strictly. Whether it was the first seven years or whether it was the 29 years in total, I’ve been extremely lucky.”Strictly Come Dancing is on BBC One from 20 September"

Day to day the 10 Pro feels rapid, and it handled games just fine, though there are better options for those who want the absolute best graphics and frame rates.The Pixel has solid battery life, managing up to about two days between charges with about seven hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi. Most people will need to charge it every other day, but on heavy use days out and about in London on 5G it still managed to reach midnight with at least 25% left.View image in fullscreenThe Pixel 10 Pro takes 90 minutes to fully charge using a 30W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting 52% in just over half an hour.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G5RAM:16GBStorage:128, 256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:Android 16Camera:50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfieConnectivity:5G, nano + e-sim (US: e-sim-only), wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mmWeight:207gAndroid 16 with AI everywhereView image in fullscreenGoogle’s take on Android is colourful, fairly simple and easy to use with a reasonable amount of customisation.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe phone ships with Android 16 installed, with security and software updatesuntil August 2032, ensuring it stays up to date for the life of the phone. It is the same software as theregular Pixel 10with a bold, colourful and fun design.Google has shoved AI in almost every corner of the phone, most of it powered by the latest local Gemini Nano models, which means your data doesn’t have to leave your device to be processed, preserving privacy.The advancedGemini chatbotis capable of interacting with your apps, seeing what is on your screen or through your camera, and having live back-and forth-conversations via voice.View image in fullscreenMagic Cue provides quick access to contextual information from the data stored on your phone across a number of Google and third-party apps.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBut the standout new feature isMagic Cue, which runs in the background and combines information from your Google account with data on your phone to offer help or quick suggestions in a number of Google apps. For instance, when you ring a business, Magic Cue pops up a card directly in the phone app showing your emails with your order confirmation details for one-tap access when you need them.Magic Cue works locally with about 10 days’ worth of data so it is not keeping a permanent log of everything you do, but has been genuinely useful in testing. It only works in Google’s and a select number of third-party apps, such as eBay, but not WhatsApp, so its utility is limited if you don’t use the right apps.The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription toGoogle AI Pro, which usually costs £19 a month, and provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image and video-generating models, plus 2TB of cloud storage for Google Drive, Photos and Gmail.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app is simple to use with plenty of modes to make the best of your photography, including manual controls.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 10 Pro has some of the most powerful cameras on a smartphone with a 42-megapixel selfie, 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera capable of an optical zoom quality up to 10x. But it is also the first to feature generative AI image processing directly in the camera, which is impressive but calls into question what a photo really is.The main camera is one of the best in the business, effortlessly capturing great photos that are rich in detail across a range of lighting conditions. The ultrawide camera is also very good for landscapes and group shots, and is used for the great macrophotography mode for fun closeups. The 5x telephoto is one of the very best on a phone and can shoot photos at 10x, which remain good quality, particularly in bright conditions.Google excels in difficult lighting conditions such as very bright or contrasting scenes, while in dark environments its night sight produces sharper images with more accurate colours than rivals. The Pixel’s portrait mode is greatly improved this year, too.View image in fullscreenPro Res Zoom above 30x uses a local generative AI model to recreate the detail lost by digital zoom, saving both pre- and post-processed images for you to choose from.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianZoom beyond 30x up to 100x and the phone uses a local genAI model to put back into the photo the detail and sharpness lost from digital zoom. Generally it works well but not flawlessly. It can get the perspective wrong or superimposes the wrong details, creating images that are clearly made by AI. But shoot predictable subjects such as buildings, cars or trees, and it firms up the digitally stretched details making the 100x zoom surprisingly usable.When it detects a person it does not even attempt to use the genAI model, which is probably for the best, and like all genAI systems it can struggle with words, often producing something that looks like an alien script.The camera app addsC2PA content credentialsto all photos that records how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved, including for the new zoom and popular Add Me feature from last year. Best Take has been made automatic, allowing the camera to capture multiple images when you press the shutter button to try to get one where everyone’s looking at the camera.The 10 Pro also has the same new AI Camera Coach feature as the regular 10, which teaches you how to get a better shot by analysing the scene through the camera and giving you options for different angles and framing.The camera also has plenty of fun photography and video modes, shoots great films as well as photo, and cements the 10 Pro as one of the very best on the market.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe front and back of the Pixel are covered in scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus 2.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe batterywill last in excessof 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.

But it still upgrades its already market-leading camera and AI features.It is snappy in operation, has decent battery life and still looks good, though hardcore gamers may want to look elsewhere for more powerful graphics. Google’s take on Android is one of the best and comes with long-term support so you can keep using it for years.Gemini’s various new tools are generally useful and less gimmicky than many. Magic Cue has great potential to be a time-saver without getting in the way, but needs to be expanded to more apps.Injecting genAI directly into the camera app improves its extended zoom images, but further blurs the line between what is and isn’t a photo – a philosophical debate most will probably gloss over because the tool is useful and avoids doing anything outlandish.The Pixel 10 Pro is easily one of the best smaller phones available and really hammers home just how much more advanced Google’s AI tools are than Apple’s and other rivals.Pros:seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, solid battery life, great screen and size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included.Cons:quite expensive, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical sim card slot in the US, not a big upgrade from the standard Pixel 10.Explore more on these topicsPixelGoogleAlphabetSmartphonesMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities said they were found to be in possession of a live chameleon and other “assorted charms”, including a red cloth, an unidentified white powder and an animal’s tail.“The motive of the crime was to kill the head of state,” the magistrate Fine Mayambu said in his ruling at a court in Lusaka. “The convicts were not only enemies of the head of state but all Zambians.”The men were sentenced to two years in prison with hard labour.The prosecution said they had been hired by the brother of the opposition MP Emmanuel “Jay Jay” Banda, who is facing trial for robbery, attempted murder and escaping custody.The conviction, under a British colonial-era law that criminalises so-called witchcraft, comes as Hichilema has faced growing criticism for cracking down on free speech and political opposition.Hichilema is using the courts to suppress his opponents, appointing allies to the election commission and “rewriting constitutional rules” for his own benefit before national elections next year, Sishuwa Sishuwa, a senior lecturer at Stellenbosch University said in acolumnfor the Mail & Guardian, a South African newspaper.Human Rights Watch saidin its 2024 annual global human rights report: “The administration of President Hakainde Hichilema increasingly exhibited tendencies toward authoritarianism … the authorities harassed and intimidated journalists, youth activists and political opposition leaders for expressing dissent or criticism of the government.”Meanwhile, a furious row is raging over the burial of Hichilema’s predecessor and bitter rival Edgar Lungu, who died in South Africa in June. Lungu’s family have beenfighting the repatriation of the bodyfor a state funeral, claiming he did not want Hichilema to attend. A South African court is weighing whether to allow the Lungus to appeal against an earlier decision that the body should be sent back to Zambia.US destruction of contraceptives denies 1.4m African women and girls lifesaving care, NGO saysRead moreAccusations of witchcraft are not uncommon in Zambian politics. Amid the legal battle over Lungu’s funeral, rumours have been circulating that Hichilema wants to use the body for occult purposes.“Personally I don’t believe in witchcraft, never believed in witchcraft, as a person, as a family, as a Christian,” Hichilema told the journalist Martine Dennis last month when asked about the allegations on her Africa Here & Nowpodcast.However, many people in Zambia argue that traditional spiritual beliefs should not be criminalised.“I hate that colonial piece of legislation that attempts to outlaw a practice that it does not understand,” Gankhanani Moyo, a cultural heritage lecturer at the University of Zambia, told Associated Press.Agence France Presse and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsZambiaAfricaWitchcraftnewsShareReuse this content"

The charcoal is shipped chiefly to Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Turkey and labelled as “ecological” but is “produced in a state of absolute modern slavery”, the report said.The investigation began after the UN special rapporteur on slavery, Tomoya Obokata, presented areport on forced labour by prisonersto the UN Human Rights Council in 2024, andPrisoners Defendersvolunteered to investigate the issue in Cuba.Between April and August 2025, interviews were conducted with 53 individuals from 40 prisons, selected through a random sample drawn from a total population of about 90,000 inmates and 37,000 in open-regime detention.Speaking to the prisoners or their families, the NGO carried out a 61-question survey; to avoid reprisals, all remain anonymous in the report.The NGO said it carried out a further 60 interviews and cross-checked them with documentary sources, resulting in an estimate that at least 60,000 people are being subjected to forced labour in Cuban prisons.All of the respondents said they were forced to work “under coercion, threats, violence or reprisals”, 98% without the necessary tools, education or training, and 45% said they “suffered physical violence during work”.A former inmate interviewed by the Guardian on condition of anonymity said that if a prisoner refused to work, “they put a note in your file. When it’s time for parole or when you might get a visit with your family, they use this as justification to strip you of your rights.”View image in fullscreenCigars are produced in prisons unbranded, the report says, but are destined for export under ‘all the best-known and most revered brands’, including Cohiba.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAt the Quivicán maximum security prison, also known as Aguacate, at least 40 inmates reportedly have a daily production target of 60 hand-rolled Habanos cigars – but the quota is reportedly only counted if it meets “export quality standards”.The report says it confirmed cigar production in at least seven prisons, involving the forced labour of 505 inmates and yielding 11,671,560 cigars a year, equivalent to about 7.5% of Cuba’stotal annual national production.It was not possible to determine, however, what percentage of cigars or marabu charcoal exported by Cuba comes from forced labour.The president of Prisoners Defenders, Javier Larrondo, said it was difficult to know under which brands the goods reached consumers because they were produced unbranded by inmates.But the NGO states in the report that the production was “destined for export to the global market”, including the UK, and covers “all the best-known and most revered [cigar] brands, such as [the Habanos] flagship brand Cohiba, which Fidel Castro smoked”.The Guardian contacted Corporación Habanos SA – a joint venture 50% controlled by the Cuban government and 50% by foreign investors, which oversees all Cuban cigar exports – but received no reply.Of the 53 people interviewed for the report, eight were women: two said they had suffered sexual harassment from officers, and one reported being raped by another prisoner without being offered medical or psychological care by the prison.The report also states that afro-Cubans – who make up about 34% of the general population but 58% of those incarcerated in the country – were “disproportionately affected”, a point mentioned by a Black former inmate interviewed by the Guardian.“Most of those sent to forced labour are Black; white prisoners are employed in cleaning military offices and cars – in other words, easier tasks – in canteens, food stores, kitchens, and so on. Racism and racial discrimination are rife in prison,” he said.The NGO said it had submitted the report to the governments and parliaments of all countries where these products are consumed, as well as to the UN and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.Prisoners Defenders says the Cuban government “must be held internationally accountable for these crimes”, calling for the prison system to be opened to independent international missions and for a ban on the trade of products derived from forced labour.“Cuban prisons are not rehabilitation centres, but spaces of punishment, control and exploitation. And their structural transformation is a debt owed to human dignity,” the report states.Explore more on these topicsCubaForced labourPrisonsModern slaveryHuman rightsRaceAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Retail sales, a gauge of consumption, expanded 3.4%, the slowest pace since November 2024, and cooling from a 3.7% rise in the previous month.A spokesperson for China’s statistics bureau said on Monday that more efforts were needed to support China’s ailing property sector and that the “external environment is very severe”.China’s economy remains heavily reliant on exports which have been dealt a blow by the trade war with the US. Although the two countries agreed a pause on tariffs until 10 November, China recorded a slump in US-bound exports last month. China’s exports to the US fell by 33.12% year on year in August, according to customs data. Overall exports increased by 4.4% in August.“The activity data point to a further loss of momentum,” Zichun Huang, China economist at CapitalEconomics, wrote in a note. “While some of this reflects temporary weather-related disruptions, underlying growth is clearly sliding, raising pressure on policymakers to step in with additional support.”Factory activity was hit by the hottest conditions since 1961 and the longest rainy season for the same period.Authorities are leaning on manufacturers to find new markets to offsetTrump’s unpredictable tariff policiesand weak consumer spending.Separate data this month showed factory owners have had some success diverting US-bound shipments to south-east Asia, Africa and Latin America, but the drag from the property crisis continues.Lynn Song, the chief economist for Greater China at ING, suggested the weak data indicated “further stimulus support could be needed to ensure a strong finish to the year”.She said: “While it is too early to gauge the impact of the consumer loan subsidies coming into effect in September, it is likely that more policy support is still needed, given the broader slowdown across the board.” Song said there was a “high possibility” of further interest rate cuts in coming weeks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of the workers told local media about appalling conditions during their arrest, including allegations they were held without being informed of their rights.When asked about those allegations, the presidential office in Seoul said it was conducting a “thorough review”.“Both our side and the US are checking if there were any shortcomings in the measures taken and companies are also looking into it,” the presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung told a press briefing. “Together with the company concerned, we are conducting a more thorough review into possible human rights infringements.”One of the workers told Yonhap News Agency that their rights were not read when they were arrested. The worker also told the agency they were angry that Ice agents mocked them with remarks about “North Korea” and “rocket man” – an insult Trump has previously used about Pyongyang’s leader, Kim Jong-un.South Korea’s president, Lee Jae Myung, called the raid “bewildering” and noted it could have a chilling effect on future investment. South Korean companies “can’t help but question whether setting up a plant in the US is worth the potential risks”, Lee said.In what seemed to be a response,Trump said on Sunday that foreign workers were “welcome”and he did not want to scare investors.“I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize investment,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.Explore more on these topicsIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)South KoreaDonald TrumpAsia PacificUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Eight victims were found in Denpasar, the island’s capital, and rescue teams continue to search for several others who remain missing.Most deaths occurred when victims were swept away by flood water. More than 385mm of rain was recorded within a 24-hour period, leading to the evacuation of hundreds of people. The floods submerged roads and damaged bridges, severely disrupting transport across the island.Flooding is common in Indonesia during the wet season, which typically runs from September to March. However, scientists say the climate crisis is intensifying the rainy season, bringing heavier rainfall and more frequent flash floods. Overdevelopment and widespread deforestation are believed to be worsening the impact of flooding.Meanwhile, the Indian monsoon is in full force with devastating consequences. Half of the country is experiencing flooding, with the state of Punjab facing its worst floods since 1988.Landslidesand flood waters have already killed hundreds of people across the country.In neighbouringPakistan, more than 2 million people have been evacuated from the eastern Punjab province. Since late June, monsoon-related floods have killed more than 900 people nationwide.This year’s monsoon season began unusually early after India’s wettest May in 125 years. Traditionally, the monsoon starts in early June and lasts through to September.View image in fullscreenA tornado towers over the countryside near Young in New South Wales.Photograph: NSW rural fire service/AFP/GettyIn Australia, parts ofNew South Walesare recovering after record-breaking rainfall and severe storms.

But the council decided in June 2024 to reverse the judging panel’s move, citing previous narrower eligibility rules which called for entries from emerging authors. The move effectively disqualified Masters, the author of four previous books.Eligibility for the 2022 award was broadened by the judging panel to include established authors.Correspondence seen by Guardian Australia suggests the council decided in June 2024 to reverse the judging panel’s move and recommit to the pre-2022 “emerging author” guidelines – although sources insist the judging panels were not informed of this decision.Council member and RSL national president, Greg Melick, told Guardian Australia the council was unaware that Masters had been awarded the prize before it intervened in the process.“At the time that decision was made by council, we had no idea who had won the prize or who’d been nominated for the prize,” he said.“We hadn’t even seen the shortlist, and to suggest that council decided not to go ahead because of the book or the subject was rubbish.”Flawed Hero is a detailed account of investigations by Masters and the award-winning journalist Nick McKenzie into alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan by Roberts-Smith, whose final appeal bid in his failed defamation action against the journalists wasrejected by the high courtthis month.The book details the institutional and political support given to Roberts-Smith,including by the memorialand prominent figures associated with it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guardian Australia contacted the Maementcurves.com site for comment.Customers have reported seeing Facebook ads for similar “weight-loss drops” linking to an array of other websites.In one example reviewed by Guardian Australia, the site Greatrfg.com uses an Australian flag banner and sells a “GLP-1 Oral Solution For Weight Reduction”. Guardian Australia attempted to contact the site for comment but received an email bounce-back saying its “remote server is misconfigured”.View image in fullscreenThe box Guardian Australia received said the treatment was ‘made in the USA’ and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.Photograph: Jon Beves/UNSW school of chemistryThe site claims the product is made locally and approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). But the terms of service say the website is operated by Hamjouy Limited, a company in Hong Kong.Similar “weight-loss drops” – which come in distinctive green boxes – are readily available elsewhere on the internet, including on eBay and Amazon.It’s not clear if companies selling these products are making other fraudulent claims or mimicking registered corporate and health logos on their packaging.Australian consumer watchdog issues public warning about ‘ghost stores’ and urges Meta and Shopify to crack downRead moreThe TGA, Australia’s medicines regulator, would not comment directly on the UNSW analysis but urged consumers to “exercise extreme caution”.“Prescription medicines purchased online may contain undisclosed harmful ingredients or may be counterfeit/fake,” a TGA spokesperson said.“We strongly advise consumers against using prescription medications that are offered or issued without a valid prescription and consultation with a health practitioner.”They said counterfeit therapeutic goods could not be imported, advertised or supplied under any circumstances.“So if this or similar products are found to be counterfeit, if intercepted at the border they will be seized and destroyed,” they said.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission earlier this year urged the e-commerce platform Shopify and Facebook owner Meta to take responsibility for enabling the creation of ghost stores and allowing them to run false advertising.The ACCC declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsScamsHealthObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

This includes bail accommodation in Moree which is yet to be delivered.Almost a year later, the NSW government extended its controversial youth bail laws for three years, despite internalopposition from some Labor MPsand concerns they were extended before the government evaluated how effective they had been.Experts and advocates say the overall drop in the regions over the past two years is likely due to a number of factors.Roy Butler, the independent MP for Barwon, thinks the bail laws have had minimal impact, arguing imprisoning people increases criminal behaviour in the long term rather than deterring it. His electorate takes in the far west and Orana region – which includes Bourke and Broken Hill.It experienced a 42% drop in youth crime over the past two years, the highest drop in the regions. Specifically, car thefts dropped by 57%, and break and enters by almost 65%.Meanwhile, the New England and north-west region, which takes in Moree, experienced a drop of 24%. It has remained stable in all other regions except the Hunter Valley, which increased by 17%.Butler credited the drop in his region to local initiatives and the work of police.However, with the base rate of crime still high in his region and New England, he said there was still more work to be done.He wants residential programs in the bush as a “third option” beyond custody or placing alleged offenders back into the community.James Clifford, a solicitor at the Aboriginal Legal Service, said it was hard to explain the 12% overall drop in the regions.“What we can say, though, is that we’re definitely not in the grip of a youth crime wave,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The FISI confirmed on Monday that he did not recover after “cranial trauma” and a subsequent swelling of his brain.“It is a tragedy for the family and for our sport,” the FISI president Flavio Roda said in a statement on Monday. “It is absolutely necessary to do everything possible to ensure that such episodes do not happen again.”“At this sad and painful time, I want to tell all athletes and coaches, in all sports, that the federation is by their side and that they will find all the support they need,” Roda added. “I ask for the utmost respect for Matteo’s family, whom we will stand by for as long as necessary.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

He is the second elite Italian skier to die in a training incident within the past year, afterthe death of junior champion Matilde Lorenziat Val Senales in October 2024.A part of Italy’s World Cup team since 2021, Franzoso was training alongside other Italian skiers including Dominik Paris, Christof Innerhofer and Mattia Casse in Chile. The team are preparing to race on home snow at the Milan-Cortina Olympics in February, but those preparations have now been marked by tragedy.The US skier and Olympic gold medallist Lindsey Vonn posted a black and white picture of Franzoso on Instagram. “This is incredibly sad,” Vonn wrote. “I was skiing this exact slope three weeks ago … RIP Matteo. My sincere condolences to his family and loved ones.”Franzoso made 17 World Cup appearances and finished 28th in the Super-G event at the Olympic host venue, Cortina d’Ampezzo, in 2023 – his best performance at alpine skiing’s highest level.He also won a super-G race on the second-tier Europa Cup circuit in 2021, having finished fourth in the downhill at the world junior championships in 2020.Explore more on these topicsSkiingItalyWinter Olympics 2026EuropeWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

What Nato decides to and where it decides to deploy them will be for Nato. That’s part of our contribution to the alliance.”Last Wednesday, 19 unarmed Russian drones crossed the border into Poland as part of a broader attack on Ukraine, prompting Nato to scramble jets and activate Patriot air defence systems in a major defensive operation.Though there were no casualties, only three or four of the drones were shot down, raising questions about the effectiveness of western air defences. In response, Nato’s military commander called for an increase in the number of fighter jets available for air policing.On Friday, Nato leaders announced the creation of Operation Eastern Sentry, a plan to better protect the skies over alliance members in eastern Europe, starting withPoland. The alliance’s most senior military chief, Gen Alexus Grynkewich, said Nato was “bringing additional resources to bear” in the effort.The US, however, has not announced any additional commitments, in line with previous statements made by Donald Trump and his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that European members of Nato are expected to take the lead on defending the continent against Russian aggression and spillover from the war in Ukraine.Earlier on Monday, the former chief of defence staff Tony Radakin said that he and Healey had met Hegseth in Brussels in March and were told with “incredible clarity” that “America is focusing more on the Indo Pacific and its homeland security and that would mean that Europe would have to do more and take more responsibility”.Healey said the Typhoons would be “operational and involved within days”. Though based in Lincolnshire, from where it takes about 90 minutes to reach Poland, they are supported by a dedicated Voyager air-to-air refuelling aircraft, allowing them to prolong their missions if necessary.The British effort would be supported by 400 military personnel in the UK, the minister added. “It’s not just a few planes in the air, it’s a significant operation, part of a much bigger Nato exercise on the eastern flank,” Healey said.There was no further update on whether the UK believed that the Russian drone incursion into Poland was deliberate. Healey said: “There’s no firm confirmation on intent, but in the end that’s not the point. It’s still reckless, it’s still dangerous.” It was, he added, “straight out of the [Vladimir] Putin playbook”.Explore more on these topicsMilitaryNatoDrones (military)John HealeyPolandRomaniaRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The statement offered support for the efforts of mediators Qatar, Egypt and the US to halt the aggression on Gaza, noting that the attack undermined efforts aimed at halting the violencein Gaza.Trump’s retreat from Nato was priced in. But his humiliation of Qatar and India spells total chaos | Nesrine MalikRead moreIsrael, the statement read, was seeking “to impose a new reality in the region”.Masoud Pezeshkian, the president of Iran, the country most supportive of Hamas and which fought a12-day war with Israel in June, said “no Arab or Islamic country is safe from the attacks of the Zionist regime [Israel] and we have no choice but to unite our ranks”.Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the president of Egypt, a US ally which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, said Israel’s actions “put obstacles in the way of any opportunities for any new peace agreements and even aborts existing ones”.Before the summit, Qatar had been pressing the UAE to take some kind of symbolic step to distance itself from Israel such as expelling the Israeli ambassador to the UAE.At the summit, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed, the chair of the UAE presidential court, said Qatar “is not standing alone” and that “the united voice of Arab and Islamic countries today must lead to change”, the state news agency Wam reported.The Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, said the real target of recent Israeli aggression was mediation efforts and the principle of solutions through dialogue.“The aim of the attack was not an attempt to assassinate negotiators. Rather, it was to eliminate the very idea of ​​negotiation,” he said.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said Israel’s attack on the Hamas negotiating team in Qatar had taken “Israel’s banditry” to a different level.“We are facing a terrorist mentality that feeds on chaos and blood, and a state that embodies it,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpIsraelUnited Arab EmiratesLebanonTurkeyQatarnewsShareReuse this content"

On arrival in the UK, the patients and their families have been granted access to NHS treatment, appropriate housing and comprehensive support services for an initial two-year period.They are the first children to be brought to the UK for treatment as part of agovernment operationbeing coordinated by the Foreign Office, the Home Office and the Department of Health and Social Care.Between 30 and 50 young Palestinians are expected to be treated, while two critically ill children and their families arrived inScotlandfor treatment, according to Holyrood.Cooper told the Mirror newspaper at the weekend that “it was a lot of diplomatic work in order to help them actually leave Gaza”.She added: “But that work is under way and I’m determined to make sure that we can do our bit to help those injured families and also to help students get into their courses this autumn.”Neil Gray, the Scottish health secretary, said the Scottish government had committed to supporting the treatment of up to 20 Palestinian youngsters who are expected to arrive in Scotland in the coming weeks.Gray, the SNP MSP for Airdrie & Shotts, said: “This initial support is a small step towards restoring some humanity to the catastrophic situation in Gaza as a result of the Israeli government’s actions.”Gray added the Scottish government had been working closely with the health boards that will be treating patients and the local authorities that will accommodate their families to ensure they have somewhere to live and receive the “essential support they need”.Downing Street is also working to evacuate students with places to study at British universities.Some Palestinian children have been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, a humanitarian initiative founded by a group of senior doctors and healthcare leaders.Since UN-backed global food security experts declared a famine in Gaza City on 22 August, the territory’s health ministry reported that at least 142 people have died from starvation and malnutrition.More than 50,000 children are estimated to have been killed or injured in Gaza by Israeli forces since the attacks by Hamas on 7 October 2023, according to the charity Unicef.Explore more on these topicsGazaChildrenNHSIsrael-Gaza warScotlandYvette CooperMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Hamas had in August accepted a phased ceasefire agreement along the lines put forward by the US envoy Steve Witkoff.Rubio did not address possible ceasefire terms in Jerusalem, other than to say that the US would “continue to explore and be dedicated to” a peaceful outcome that he said depended on the elimination ofHamas.“At the end of the day, no matter what has happened or happens, the objective remains the same, and that is all 48 of those hostages, both living and deceased, need to be home. They need to be returned,” he said.“Hamas needs to cease to exist as an armed element that can threaten the peace and security of the region. And the people of Gaza deserve a better future. But that better future cannot begin until Hamas is eliminated.”Rubio warned that theintended recognition of Palestineby several US allies, including the UK, France, Canada, Belgium and Australia, would make peace less likely.“It actually makes it harder to negotiate … because it emboldens these groups,” he said, referring to Hamas and other Palestinian militants. He added that the Trump administration had warned states preparing to recognise Palestine “there will be an Israeli counter reaction to those moves” – in what may have been a reference to a possible Israeli move toannex occupied areas of the West Bank.Rubio refrained from commenting on the planned Israeli ground offensive on Gaza City. Before that offensive, the Israel Defense Forces have been destroying blocks of flats across the city, andordering its inhabitants to evacuate, drawing international condemnation.Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled Gaza City for the south, but most of the estimated million people sheltering in the urban sprawl have opted to stay, either because they are unable to move or because they have nowhere to go. Humanitarian agencies have said there is nowhere left in Gaza that is safe or suitable for displaced people.The UN relief agency, Unrwa, said 10 of its buildings had been hit by Israeli strikes in the past four days, including seven schools and two clinics.Netanyahu defended Israel’s tactics. “We’re not bringing down those towers to intimidate people. Those towers are serving as Hamas strongholds,” he said. “But what we’re doing is we’re telling the population … we ask you to leave. And what is Hamas doing? They’re asking them to stay, because they want to use them as human shields.”The UN rapporteur on human rights in the occupied territories, Francesca Albanese, said the aim of the Gaza City offensive was to make it uninhabitable. “This is the last piece of Gaza that needs to be rendered unlivable,” Albanese said on Monday.The Israeli mission to the UN rejected her remarks, blaming Hamas for the destruction. “According to her, Hamas doesn’t embed itself in civilian infrastructure, doesn’t cynically use civilians as human shields, and generally doesn’t really exist,” it said.The IDF chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, is widely reported to have deep misgivings about the Gaza City offensive, arguing it would not destroy Hamas and would be costly in the lives of Israeli soldiers and hostages. According to the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, the commander told a Knesset committee on Friday that he had been left in the dark about the objectives.“The prime minister hasn’t told us what the next stage is. We don’t know what to prepare for. If they want military rule, then they should say military rule,” Zamir is reported to have told the committee. According to the same report, he described the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, theUS-Israeli backed scheme to distribute foodinstead of the UN, as a “failure” and questioned why money was being spent on expanding it.In an open letter to Zamir on Monday, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum asked to meet him to put its case against the Gaza City offensive.“We demand that the fate of our loved ones not be abandoned!” the forum said in a social media post. “The IDF must present a clear policy to the public and families: no more living hostages murdered in captivity as a result of military pressure, and no more bodies disappearing under rubble, losing any chance to locate them and return them for proper burial.”At the Doha summit, Qatar’s emir accused Israel of not caring about its hostages held in the Gaza Strip. He said its aim instead was to “ensure Gaza is no longer livable”.Hamas leadership aides and a Qatari security officer were killed in the Israeli missile strike. The leaders reported to be the intended target were in another building at the time, according to Israeli reports.Trump is no ‘strongman’ when it comes to Russia or Israel. If other democracies don’t step up, anarchy awaits | Simon TisdallRead moreNetanyahu said the Qatar raid was a “wholly independent decision by Israel” for which his government assumed “full responsibility”. He declined to give details of the casualties but insisted the mission had not failed.“It didn’t fail because it had one central message … and that is, you can hide, you can run, but we’ll get you,” he said.Axios reported on Monday that Netanyahu had spoken to Trump to inform him of Israel’s plan to attack Hamas leaders in Qatar, citing three Israeli officials. Trump officials have said warnings of the impending strikes on Qatar came so late that US officials were only informed of the attack by the time that Israeli F-16 jets were already en route to the Gulf.Israel has so far killed more than 64,000 Palestinians in Gaza according to official estimates, though many thousands more are feared buried in the rubble. The overwhelming majority of the victims have been civilians, evenaccording to internal IDF estimates.Netanyahufaces an arrest warrantfor war crimes from the international criminal court, and the international court of justice is weighing allegations that his government is committing genocide. Israel denies the charge, claiming to be acting in self-defence after the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis, more than two-thirds of them civilians.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMarco RubioDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuQatarHamasPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

That is no longer the caseAamna MohdinMon 15 Sep 2025 01.36 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTShareGood morning. Last Monday, Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, announced that his country had accepted the US ceasefire proposal to end the devastating war in Gaza. The very next day, Israel attempted to kill Hamas’s negotiating team while they were in Qatar’s capital to discuss that same proposal.Israel, initially bullish about the success of the operation, has since grown more doubtful that it killed any Hamas leaders in Doha. Hamas said that while six people were killed in the bombing – including the son of Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy head of its political bureau – the top leadership including the negotiating team survived.Qatar condemned the strike in its capital as an act of “state terror”. The international community, including the US, denounced the bombing. Israeli media reported that Washington had given a green light and warned Qatar in advance – a claim the Gulf state fiercely denied.Today, the shocked Gulf nation is hosting an unprecedented emergency Arab-Islamic summit in Doha in response to becoming the sixth Middle Eastern country struck by Israel in the past few months. For decades, Qatar, like the rest of the Gulf, believed that a closer relationship with the US would guarantee its security. No longer.To understand the unprecedented path Israel is charting, and how Qatar is reassessing once established geopolitical boundaries, I spoke to Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik. That’s after the headlines.Five big storiesUK news|Britain will “never surrender” to far-right protesterswho use the English flag as cover for violence and to instil fear, Keir Starmer has said, condemning attacks against police officers and racist harassment after more than110,000 people attended an extremist London rally.Crime|Christian Brueckner, prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, has refused to be interviewed by the Metropolitan police before his pending release from prison in Germany, Scotland Yard has said.US| The Utah governor, Spencer Cox, has said22-year-old Tyler Robinson, the man accused of killing Turning Point USA executive director Charlie Kirk, “does come from a conservative family – but his ideology was very different than his family”. Robinson was not cooperating with authorities, said Cox.Europe| Poland’s foreign minister has said the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace was anattempt by the Kremlin to test Nato’s reactionsby incremental escalations without prompting a full-scale response, as Romania became the second Nato country to report an incursion in a matter of days.Television| It was a full sweep for Adolescence at the Emmys, winning every award in which the show was nominated tonight.

Its population is about 3 million, only 13% of whom are Qatari citizens. The rest of the population is made up largely of migrant workers.Qatar made a calculation about a decade ago that in order to remain safe, it must be indispensable to geopolitical superpowers that shape the region. It did so by becoming the global capital of diplomacy. Nesrine Malik sketches out just how Qatar became so crucial in mediation efforts in herbrilliant long readon the Gulf state.As she notes, Qatar was central to the negotiations with the Taliban as the US withdrew its troops from Afghanistan; the return of some Ukrainian children from Russia; the return of US hostages from Iran; the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners in Israel; as well as a brief ceasefire in Gaza. The rich Gulf country is running 10 active mediations, aiming to cement its status as the Switzerland of the Middle East.“It has to keep a lot of people sweet and, as we say in Arabic, play on both ropes, because it can’t really afford to alienate anyone dramatically,” Nesrine told me. “It has to be the US partner in the region. It has to be the party that can speak to everyone: to Hamas, the Taliban, to all sorts of disparate groups that the US and other countries do not have direct links with. That becomes its sort of protective raison d’être.”That strategy of protection has suffered a major blow after Israel’s deadly strike on Qatari soil, coming on the heels of Iran’s barrage of rockets earlier this year during its war with Israel. So what comes next?A crack in the US shieldYou may be surprised to learn that Qatar is the second largest purchaser of US foreign military sales (FMS). I certainly was.This is part of Qatar’s long established partnership with the US. “It is the US’s largest security partner in the region. There’s a large airbase which has more than 10,000 US troops. That base is entirely funded by Qatar and actually hosts the central command for the US military in the region,” Nesrine said.For Qatar, that airbase has acted like a shield. “It was supposed to mean that no one could really attack Qatar meaningfully, because that would put US military assets and personnel in the line of fire. What that calculation did not assume was that Israel would attack [Qatar] to try to eliminate Hamas individuals, because the assumption was that Israel and the US were of the same mind, right?”There are conflicting reports on what the US knew about the attack. While Israeli media suggests the US gave the green light, US outlets have reported that Donald Trump was unhappy and in the dark about it.“From the Qatari perspective, if you cannot control Israel, or if the US and Israel are not reliable partners, then investing in the US relationship, which Qatar has done massively, is no longer a guarantor of security,” Nesrine said.She points to a recent report that the Qatari prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, told US special convoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff that if the US can’t protect Qatar, then it will need to look to other partners. This marks a profound shift in how the Gulf state thinks about sovereignty.Israel’s crushing dominanceIt is notable how quickly Israel took responsibility for the attack. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, defended the strike amid mounting international criticism, and warned Qatar that either it must “expel” Hamas members or “bring them to justice, because if you don’t, we will”.Qatar pushed back at Israel’s rhetoric – calling it a “shameful attempt … to justify the cowardly attack that targeted Qatari territory, as well as the explicit threats of future violations of state sovereignty”. But in reality, it is in an extremely difficult position.Nesrine tells me that for Qatar to retaliate militarily, using the equipment it has bought for billions, would be a terrifying escalation.Nesrine describes Israel as having “been given carte blanche to do what it wants”, pointing to the“Gaza riviera” planto ethnically cleanse Palestinians and forcibly resettle them in Jordan and Egypt.“They’re constantly squeezing Arab countries to accept ever more subordination, subjugation and humiliation. And now the violation of the sovereignty of the US’s most reliable, closest partner in the region pushes all these Arab states from the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] to the rest of the region into undeniable vassalage,” Nesrine said.She added that the latter is desirable for Israel. “It seems the wider campaign is to not only dominate Palestinians but the entire region. The point is that the prior settlement where there was implicit trust and quid pro quo, which gave Gulf states some sense of control over their fate, is gone.”Possible end of the Abraham accordsThe question facing countries in the region that have been staunch US allies is the same one that Europe has been trying to answer: what happens after the US abandons us?Nesrine describes Gulf countries as being like siblings. “They’re not close on a day to day basis and actually [they are] even often hostile. But when one of them is attacked, they rally together really quickly because they realise that the security and integrity of one country is the security integrity of all.”After Qatar was attacked, the sharpest condemnation came from other countries in the GCC. Leaders from the UAE touched down in Qatar to offer their solidarity, followed by Saudi Arabia. It is worth noting that the UAE has diverged sharply on Israel from its neighbours, normalising their relations during Trump’s first term. But as Nesrine explained: “What might happen, and what it looks like is happening, is the death of the Abraham accords.”Those accords, among other things, normalised relations with Israel on the agreement that it would not annex the occupied Palestinian territories. So on 4 September, in a rare public rebuke, a UAE diplomat told Israeli media that annexation of the West Bank was a red line and would lead to the accord’s unravelling.That warning did not appear to be heeded – within days Netanyahu announced approval of the controversial E1 settlement, which slices the West Bank in two, destroying any remaining hope of a two-state solution. The Israeli prime minister declared “there will be no Palestinian state” and vowed to annex the West Bank.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So … any contemplation of challenging Israel, or going against it, becomes a question of annihilation.”But that also comes with a cost to Israel. “If Gulf countries freeze Israel out, that sends the message: your fate is to remain an isolated, belligerent state in the region that can only operate through brute force. In the short term, Israel’s right is fine with that. In the long term, it’s corrosive, draining and costly,” Nesrine said.The next few days will determine whether Gulf and other Arab countries are willing to finally stand on their own two feet.What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenThe Registration Numbers Club annual rally at Wytham Transport Museum near Birmingham, July 2025.Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianI was charmed by Simon Hattenstone’sprofile of the former taoiseach Leo Varadkar.

Trump will later travel to Chequers on Thursday for a business reception, working lunch and press conference with Keir Starmer.Meanwhile, ministers will be hoping that Tuesday’s roundtable with financial bosses from the City and Wall Street will secure further foreign investments that can generate growth and positive headlines before a challenging budget in November.That is expected to include a £100bn investment from Blackstone, the alternative asset manager known for its private equity investments and which manages about $1.2tn (£880bn) worth of assets. It is due to confirm the investment out of the $500bn it is due to invest in Europe over the next decade.Sky News, which broke news of Blackstone’s investment on Monday morning, said the funds would involve private equity buyouts as well as other forms of investment.Blackstone, which is led by Steve Schwarzman, is marking 25 years in London this year, having launched operations in the City in 2000. The office currently employs 650 people, and has about $100bn already invested in the UK. That includes real estate investments, including a datacentre in the north of England. Schwarzman told Bloomberg in June that “the UK government has been really helpful, really focused to make that happen”.Blackstone’s investment pledge will be welcome news, helping to offset challenging decisions in the upcoming autumn budget. Rumours are swirling that the chancellor is considering a number of potential tax increases – including on banks, property and landlords’ rental income – in an effort to plug a shortfall of up to £40bn in the public finances.The government has launched a fresh charm offensive to try to keep businesses onside, and Reeves last weekpledged to shut down more regulators across the UK to encourage growth.Reeves – who in July claimed regulatorswere a “boot on the neck” of business– told private equity bosses that there was “still more to do”, having already sacked the chair of the competitions watchdog, shut down the payments regulator and “severely” constrained the Financial Ombudsman Service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Well, not any more | David LammyRajeev SyalHome affairs editorMon 15 Sep 2025 17.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 18.00 EDTSharePublic servants who deliberately cover up state-related disasters will face up to two years in jail under a new Hillsborough law,David Lammyhas promised, following concerns from campaigners that it could be watered down.Writing in the Guardian, the deputy prime minister and lord chancellor said legislation would ensure that state actors from “the bobby on the beat to the highest office in the land” will face “serious punishments for serious wrongdoing”.The long-awaited public office (accountability) bill will be introduced to parliament on Tuesday after months of behind-the-scenes wrangling between lawyers for the Hillsborough families and officials.It means that ministers, senior civil servants and chief constables who mislead the public could be dragged before the courts and imprisoned, Whitehall sources said.Keir Starmer had previously pledged to introduce the legislation by the 36th anniversary of the tragedy, which was on 15 April, but Downing Street then said more time was needed to redraft it.Some campaigners had raised fears the bill’s contents had been diluted and would not include a legal duty of candour.Lammy wrote: “This law … includes a new professional and legal duty of candour. When something has gone badly wrong, public servants – from the bobby on the beat to the highest office in the land – will be under a duty to act with honesty and integrity at all times. Anyone who fails to do so faces criminal prosecution.“And it will be supported with a new offence for flagrantly misleading the public, with those found in breach of the law facing up to two years behind bars, along with replacing the current offence of misconduct in public office with two new offences. These are serious punishments for serious wrongdoing.”Under the bill, legal aid will automatically be available to bereaved families at inquests whenever the state is represented by an “army of taxpayer-funded lawyers”, Lammy said.“Those grieving will never again have to pass the hat around to have their voices heard,” he said.Pointing to his own experience of losing a friend in the Grenfell Tower disaster, Lammy said the bill was a tribute to the work of campaigners involved not just in Hillsborough, but also Windrush, the Manchester arena bombing and the Post Office scandal.“I lost a dear friend,Khadija Saye, in Grenfell,” he said. “I know what it is to sit with families whose lives have been torn apart, and to feel the weight of a system that too often meets grief with defensiveness and delay.”TheHillsborough disasterin 1989 during the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the football ground in Sheffield led to the deaths of 97 football fans.Sue Roberts, whose brother Graham was unlawfully killed at Hillsborough, described the bill’s introduction as a “huge step in the right direction” but said the families would be “watching closely to ensure this bill is passed in its entirety and enacted in full.“The government must resist any pressure from those who don’t believe the public deserves to know the truth about when the state fails,” she said.Some families and campaigners are expected to attend Downing Street on Tuesday to mark the bill’s introduction.Lawyers for the Hillsborough families remain concerned that the “duty of candour” offence has been drafted too narrowly, and could let off some public officials who should face the law.The bill only applies to some inquiries. Lawyers for the families have been reassured that the government plans to amend it to cover combined authorities and local authorities.The “duty to assist” definition could also be widened, lawyers said. Officials have promised that other bodies will be covered by the law including the Care Quality Commission, the Health and Safety Executive and official “ombudsman” investigations.Pete Weatherby KC, an architect of the original bill who represents many of the Hillsborough families, told the Guardian that survivors and bereaved families will be closely involved as the bill proceeds through parliament.“This bill is a major step forward,” he said. “It is sufficiently strong to affect culture change so public bodies tell the truth as matter of course rather than be dragged kicking and screaming.“The government has agreed that we will be involved in the process to pass the bill and will be involved in what happens next.”The expansion of legal aid for bereaved families, with non-means tested help and support for inquests, has been welcomed. Julia Waters, the sister of headteacher Ruth Perry who took her own life after an Ofsted report downgraded her school, said her family had been “forced to crowdfund to cover our legal costs at an already emotional and stressful time”.“Hillsborough law will help ensure families like mine are no longer left to fight for truth and accountability on our own – in the hope that those in power can finally be held responsible when things go catastrophically wrong,” she said.Natasha Elcock, from Grenfell United, said: “It has been so easy for public and private agencies to escape accountability and scrutiny. By establishing a duty of candour, Hillsborough Law will prevent this, help us learn from failures and ensure bereaved and survivors are properly supported.”Lobby Akinnola, who lost his father, Femi, early on in the Covid pandemic, said he and others had seen “first-hand how easily the truth is delayed, diluted or denied”, adding that this new bill is “a huge step towards” justice.Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justiceHillsborough disasterDavid LammyLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Allies of alternative leaders are talking up their candidates’ prospects of rescuing the government’s standing.One MP who has so far been loyal to Starmer said: “Downing Street needs to start improving things very quickly, otherwise they are going to lose control of this whole situation.”A Labour official said that the departure of Ovenden – one of the prime minister’s longest-serving and closest allies – would weaken Starmer further.“The more Keir loses people around him, the more people start to realise the problem is not them, but him,” the person said.Starmer accepted Ovenden’s resignation after he was revealed to have exchanged messages with a friend eight years ago in which he jokingly recounted a conversation that had happened at a party the previous evening.In those messages, which are revealed in a forthcoming book about Starmer called The Fraud, Ovenden talked about how those at the party had played a game of “shag, marry, kill” involving Abbott, before describing how they might have sex with her.Abbott called the messages “very unpleasant”, likening them to messages revealed by theMartin Forde inquiryinto bullying, racism and sexism in the Labour party.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “These messages are appalling and unacceptable. As the first black woman to be elected to parliament,Diane Abbottis a trailblazer who has faced horrendous abuse throughout her political career.“These kinds of comments have no place in our politics.”Starmer has long had a difficult relationship with Abbott, with his allies havingtried unsuccessfullyto persuade her to step down before the last election.Ovenden said in a statement: “I am accused of, eight years ago as a junior press officer, sharing with a female colleague the details of a silly conversation that I was party to with other female staff members.”He added: “As an adviser, my duty is to protect the reputation of the prime minister and his government.“Most people could find a private conversation they’ve had in the last decade, whether in the pub or on WhatsApp, that would be distasteful or embarrassing if it were published.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But his immediate departure has caused alarm among some of Starmer’s allies, who say the PM looks increasingly exposed, with his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, one of his few remaining long-term advisers.One Labour official said: “Keir threw away his closest confidant over a trivial comment made eight years ago.”Another said: “Paul was the best brain in government, and without his instincts and intellect battling for the priorities of the voter, this government risks turning inwards.”But even as Starmer tries to turn the agenda to his meetings with Trump, he is also facing further questions over what he knew about Mandelson’s relationship with the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him in Washington.Ministers will be pressed on that question on Tuesday after the Conservatives secured an emergency Commons debate on the Mandelson controversy.The Tories are demanding to know when the prime minister knew about the messages in which Mandelsongave Epstein his effusive backing, even while the financier was facing charges of child sex trafficking.0:51Keir Starmer: 'Had I known then what I know now, I’d have never appointed Mandelson' – videoStarmer told Channel 4 News on Monday: “I wouldn’t have appointed him had I known the nature and extent of the relationship – the fact that he was questioning and challenging [Epstein’s] conviction.”But many MPs are irritated not just by the missteps, which have led to the departure of several key members of staff, but also by the prime minister’s perceived failure to denounce the resurgent hard right.Starmer attempted to rectify that later on Monday, telling Channel 4: “I’m absolutely determined to lead in this fight of our times between renewal, the patriotic cause of the Labour party, and the division and toxic chaos and decline that would come under Reform.”But with events moving quickly, some believe the prime minister may face a challenge before next May’s elections – even before one of his chief rivals, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, has time to find a Commons seat.One Labour source said: “At this rate Wes [Streeting, the health secretary] is going to have to get organised earlier.

The consultant anaesthetist had asked another nursing colleague to monitor the male patient, who was under general anaesthetic, so he could go to the bathroom.Instead, Anjum, a married father of three, went to another operating theatre at the hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne,Greater Manchester, where sexual activity took place with Nurse C on 16 September 2023.A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) hearing was told another nurse at the hospital described seeing Nurse C “with her trousers around her knee area with her underwear on display” and that Dr Anjum was “tying up the cord of his trousers”.Anjum was absent from the operating room for eight minutes and the patient came to no harm.The matter was reported to management and Anjum was dismissed in February 2024 following an internal investigation. Last week he told an MPTS disciplinary tribunal he wanted to resume his career in the UK and relocate with his family after they had since moved to his native Pakistan where he worked as a doctor.Anjum promised there would never be a repeat of a “one-off error of judgment”. Giving evidence, he said: “It was quite shameful, to say the least. I only have myself to blame. I let down everybody, not just my patient and myself but the trust and how it would look.“I let down my colleagues who gave me a lot of respect.”On Monday, the tribunal determined that Anjum “had put his own interests before those of the patient and his colleagues” and the incident involving Nurse C “had the potential to distract Dr Anjum … and he may not have been able to give his full attention to the patient’s care”.The tribunal chair, Rebecca Miller, said his actions, while they did not harm the patient’s safety, were “significant enough to amount to misconduct that was serious”.However, she was satisfied that Anjum was determined not to repeat his past misconduct and considered the risk of repetition to be “very low”.No sanction will be imposed on the doctor and the hearing will reconvene in Manchester on Tuesday to decide whether to issue a warning on Dr Anjum’s registration.Anjum had admitted engaging in sexual activity with Nurse C and that he knew she was “likely to be nearby” when he left his patient. He also admitted his actions had the potential to put his patient at risk.Explore more on these topicsGreater ManchesterDoctorsNHSHealthHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

In his remarks on Monday, the president cited a slew of crime statistics and vowed to end the “savagery” and to “makeMemphissafe again”.1:39Trump deploys national guard to Memphis as he eyes Chicago next – videoLee thanked the president for the deployment. “I’m tired of crime holding the great city of Memphis back,” the governor said.Trump told Lee that the crime-fighting crackdown “will be your proudest moment” and predicted that crime in the city would “plummet” within weeks.Trump was also joined at the Oval Office signing by the state’s Republican senators, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty.Trump deployed national guard troops to Washington last month and federalized the city’s police force to “crack down” on crime in the nation’s capitol. Violent crime was already at a 30-year low in the city.Speculation had centered on Chicago as Trump’s next city to send in the national guard and other federal authorities. But the administration has faced fierce resistance from Illinois’s Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, and the city’s Democratic leaders.Trump says he will send national guard to Democratic-run MemphisRead moreTrump on Monday said: “We’re going to be doingChicagoprobably next” while also suggesting that a deployment wasn’t imminent.“We don’t want to lose Chicago,” Trump said, noting that he has a “great, beautiful building” on the city’s skyline.Speaking earlier on Monday, Pritzker told reporters that sending troops into a US city was a “terrible idea” and was hopeful Trump would ultimately decide against action in Chicago. “We never really know what he intends to do,” Pritzker added.Hours later at the White House, Trump said his administration would not be deterred by Pritzker’s opposition.“We hope we have the governor’s help,” Trump said. “But if we don’t, we’re doing it without him.”Trump also floated St Louis, New Orleans and Baltimore as potential future targets. “We want to save these places,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationMemphisTennesseeDonald TrumpChicagoIllinoisUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

US district judge Carl Nichols in Washington said FAA had satisfied its obligation “to take a hard look at the effects of light on nearby wildlife”.Donald Trump signed anexecutive orderon 13 August – titled Enabling Competition in the Commercial Space Industry – that wouldrelax environmental rulesfor commercial spaceship companies, apparently benefitting Elon Musk. The companies may be able to forgo the environmental reviews that are required under the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa).Private space companies are required to obtain launch permits from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). And, as part of that process, companies are subject to review under Nepa.These environmental reviews are required because rocket launches and landings can be enormously disruptive to local towns and residents, along with the natural surroundings. Exhaust, smoke plumes and sonic booms created at launch can injure and kill endangered species, and detritus from exploded rocket parts returning to Earth can harm fish and marine animals with hazardous material spills, fuel slicks and falling objects.Trump said it was imperative to national security that the private rocket-ship industry increase launches “substantially” by 2030.SpaceX has beenseeking to increase its rocket launchesand landings around the country even as it has been embroiled in the lawsuit brought by environmental groups for violating the National Environmental Policy Act. The groups say the FAA did not do a thorough enough environmental assessment of SpaceX’s impact to endangered species regarding its rocket launches in Boca Chica, Texas.The lawsuit looked at the first launch of SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket inTexasin April 2023. The rocket, which is designed to one day make it to Mars, pulverized its launchpad on takeoff, sending chunks of concrete flying six miles (10km) away. The blast ignited a grassfire that burned nearly 1.5 hectares (4 acres) of state park and, from what is known, destroyed a nest of bobwhite quail eggs and a collection of blue land crabs.The FAA announced in May that it had given SpaceX permission to increase its number of Starship launches in Texas from five per year to 25. SpaceX has also been seeking toincrease launchesof its smaller Falcon rockets from Vandenberg space force base in California from 50 per year to 95.Dara Kerr contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsSpaceXTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.” Bessent added that the Chinese team had made “aggressive asks” during negotiations, but did not explain what they were.Li Chenggang, the top Chinese trade negotiator, confirmed later on Monday that two sides had reached a basic framework consensus on resolving issues related to TikTok through cooperation, reducing investment barriers and promoting trade. Li said friction between the two economic giants was normal, but warned Washington against continued “suppression” of Chinese companies.“We would like to stress that the outcomes of the trade and economic consultations are hard won, and the US side should not, on the one hand, askChinato accommodate its concerns, whilst at the same time continue to suppress Chinese companies,” Li said in Madrid.The framework agreement is a breakthrough in the long-running dispute over TikTok’s ownership, which has raised national security concerns in Washington over the app’s Chinese parent company ByteDance. In April 2024,Joe Biden signed legislationthat gave ByteDance nine months to sell the platform to a US-approved buyer or face a total ban – a deadline thatDonald Trumphasrepeatedlyextended.The US is estimated to have over135 million active userson the platform, including the White House, which launched its own official account in August, despite the fact that government devices themselves arestill prohibitedfrom using the app under federal law.TikTok briefly went dark in January when the ban took effect, displaying messages that the app was unavailable under US law. Trump reversed the shutdown within hours of taking office, signing an executive order to delay enforcement for 75 days before extending the deadline again and again. Apple and Google had removed TikTok from their app stores during the brief blackout but restored access after government assurances they would face no penalties.Washington’s security concerns center on fears that Beijing could manipulate the massively popular platform to spy on Americans or influence public opinion. Christopher Wray, the former FBI director,warned senatorsthat China’s national security laws could compel ByteDance to hand over user data or suppress content, and the Department of Justice last year said TikTok had gathered the sensitive data of American users based off gun control, abortion and religion through its use of Lark, a workplace communication platform similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams,according to court documents.Security experts have long pointed to three main areas of concern: Chinese influence campaigns, mass data collection on US citizens, and potential vulnerabilities that could compromise users’ devices.The TikTok ownership saga stretches back to 2020, when Trump first ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a shutdown. Microsoft initially pursued a potential acquisition worth billions of dollars, with CEO Satya Nadella engaging directly with Trump, but it fell apart in what Nadella dubbed at the time “the strangest deal” he has ever worked on.Soon after, Walmart and Oraclecame closeto buying TikTok’s US arm, proposing a joint acquisition of a new entity called TikTok Global, but it was shelved indefinitely after the Biden administration conducted its own review of Chinese tech companies.Oracle has remainedTikTok’s US cloud providersince 2022 in a deal aimed at addressing security concerns.Bessent said final details would be settled when Trump speaks with Xi Jinping, China’s president, on Friday. Trump hinted that the deal was in the making while all sides were still at the table, posting onTruth Socialthat “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much want to save. They will be very happy!”Greer confirmed that the agreement was now awaiting approval from both leaders.“We’re not going to be in the business of having repetitive extensions,” Greer said. “We have a deal.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokChinaTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It also disproportionately affects minorities.The bill would amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to stop employers from requiring job applicants to disclose their credit history, or suggesting they should, and from procuring consumer or investigative reports on applicants. It also would prohibit credit reporting agencies from providing reports to employers, and prevent employers from disqualifying job applicants based on credit information.A year under CEO Niccol: Starbucks workers’ long fight for a union contractRead more“Nobody should be discriminated against and miss out on a job opportunity because of their financial history,” Warren said in a statement to the Guardian. “While the Trump administration tanks the labor market, our bill prohibits employers from using credit scores in their hiring process so that everyone can have a fair chance.”Versions of the legislation have beenproposedsince the aftermath of the 2008-09 economic recession, when Americans’consumer and credit debt swelled.Credit reports in the hiring process are “disproportionately used to disqualifypeople of color from open positions”, according to Warren’s office, which said that women are also more likely to have poor credit.About half of employers use information from credit reports in their hiring processes, according to areportpublished last year by the Urban Institute.One in 10 respondents to a 2012 Demossurveysaid they had been denied a job due to information in their credit report, despite a lack of correlation between credit history and job performance. Poor credit is most often associated with medical debt, or periods of unemployment.“Using a job applicant’s credit history to deny employment is not just unfair, it also makes no sense. Credit scores are an inaccurate way to predict future job performance or ability,” said Cohen in a statement. “We should be making the job application process fairer so people can succeed with good jobs, not adding obstacles to prevent them from being hired.”Several states, including California, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, and municipalities have already enacted local laws that ban employers from using credit reports in hiring, albeit with some exemptions, such as national security roles or positions in financial services. New York Citybannedthe practice in 2015, and state legislators are currentlypursuinga statewide ban.Explore more on these topicsUS CongressElizabeth WarrenWorkers' rightsUS SenateHouse of RepresentativesDemocratsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

I have been in that position a few times before and I just tried to stay calm.

But are they finally ... watchable?Read moreBurrow suffered the injury in the second quarter of Sunday’s game and limped off the field, and was initially listed as questionable to return. He was not available to reporters after the game and left the locker room on crutches, with his left foot in a protective boot. Reports on Sunday said he had strained toe ligaments.Burrow is one of the best quarterbacks in the league and is part of a fearsome tandem with wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase. But he has struggled to stay fit since being drafted No 1 overall by the Bengals in 2020, with some critics saying the Bengals have not done enough to build an offensive line that provides him with the necessary protection.Although Burrow, who will turn 29 in December, led the Bengals to the Super Bowl in the 2021 season, he has suffered season-ending injuries in 2020 and 2023. He led theNFLin passing yards (4,918) and passing touchdowns (43) last season, although the Bengals missed the playoffs for the second season in a row.

But are they finally ... watchable?Russell Wilson’s team looked as disappointing as always in their season opener. But in their loss to the Cowboys, they produced sloppy mistakes and offensive fireworks in equal measureMelissa JacobsMon 15 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 11.14 EDTShareWhen Fox analyst Greg Olsen noted that this week’s version of Russell Wilson was “unrecognizable from Week 1,” he could have referred to the entireNew York Giantsteam.Limping into Dallas after their dismal opening loss to the Commanders, the Giants picked up where they left off – with a lot of stupid mistakes. Offensive tackle James Hudson III stole the limelight as he somehow amassed four consecutive penalties on New York’s first possession. Hudson was duly benched but the Giants’ penalties kept coming – they gave away 160 yards’ worth on Sunday.And yet … despite the penalties, the Giants we saw on Sunday in Dallas were nothing like the hapless team we saw last week – and for large parts of the last decade. This squad showed fight, moxie, and an offense at its best. Wilson was sensational, proving his critics wrong by, simply put, producing one of the best games of his career. His 450 passing yards and three touchdowns were the result of his command of the offense, smart decision making, improved offensive line play, and a special connection with Malik Nabers.RUSSELL WILSON MOON BALL TO MALIK NABERS.GIANTS LEAD.pic.twitter.com/Chl9HdjldL— NFL (@NFL)September 14, 2025Nabers, once again, reminded us that he’s superhuman. Wilson connected with Nabers time and again, including on a jaw-dropping 48-yard moonball touchdown to take a 37-34 lead – one of five lead changes in the fourth-quarter – with 25 seconds remaining. Nabers clasped his hands together in a night-night pose, Wilson reached his arms out to thank the heavens. But the celebrations were premature.New York’s lax defense on the ensuing drive allowed Dallas to line up for a 64-yard game-tying field goal. For many kickers, this distance would be out of reach. Cowboys phenom Brandon Aubrey made it look like a chip shot. This thrilling back-and-forth continued into overtime. Wilson threw an interception – his one serious mistake on the day – that led to Aubrey’s 46-yard game winner. Not too shabby from Aubrey, a professional soccer player turned software engineer turned USFL kicker turned Cowboys star.It was a thrilling win for Dallas and a heartbreaking loss for the G-Men who fall to 0-2. But something changed in this game. The Giants were entertaining. Stars emerged. It felt like progress, like we are witnessing a watchable squad.In addition to Wilson and Nabers, rookie offensive left tackle Marcus Mbow fortified the line and looks like starting material moving forward. Fellow rookie Cam Skattebo, preformed like a competent running back. Wan’Dale Robinson proved to be a vertical threat, hauling in 142 receiving yards (Nabers had 167). The defensive line dominated for much of the day. Even backup quarterback Jaxson Dart saw action on a few trick plays.This is a game that the Giants unquestionably win without the dumb penalties. Until they prove otherwise, the Giants should be expected to make sloppy mistakes. It’s their hallmark in recent years with Brian Daboll at the helm. At 0-2, the Giants’ playoff hopes are slim. It’s their seventh 0-2 start since 2015, and with the Chiefs, Chargers, and Eagles looming in three of their next four games, the road only gets rougher. From a win-loss standpoint, another painful year may be ahead.But despite the painful loss to Dallas, something feels different. With Wilson under center and so much promising young talent, the Giants, are dare I say, watchable. If there are more thrilling games like this, overflowing with highlights, the Giants may even deliver their fanbase that most precious of things – hope.MVP of the weekDaniel Jones, QB, Indianapolis Colts.Is that Peyton Manning? Andrew Luck? Um, no that would be Danny Dimes, who has led the Indianapolis Colts to a 2-0 start for the first time since 2009, when Manning took them to the Super Bowl. Before the Colts were 2-0, for a split-second, they looked like they would be 1-1. They were down 26-28 to the Broncos, when Spencer Shrader missed a 60-yard field goal as time expired. Denver celebrated but the Broncos were penalized15 yards on a controversial leverage penaltythat will be widely discussed this week. Shrader then nailed the 45-yarder to give the Colts the 29-28 win. Jones was sensational for the second time in two weeks, he went 23 of 34 for 316 yards and two touchdowns, one with his feet. To lead the Colts to three field-goal scoring drives in the final minutes against one of the NFL’s best defenses is quite the statement. Given the murmurs and disgust when the Colts named Jones starter, not to mention his tumultuous time in New York, his success is quickly becoming one of the great narratives of this season.View image in fullscreenDaniel Jones was superb late in the game for the Colts.Photograph: Michael Conroy/APVideo of the weekHere’s Puka Nacua’s 45-yardrushingtouchdown. What can’t the wide receiver do? The Rams dialled up a sneaky call on fourth and one in the first quarter, shifting Nacua in front of rusher Kyren Williams. Nacua took a clean handoff from Matthew Stafford to the house, forcing multiple missed tackles on the way, looking like a natural running back. Nacua’s score set the tone for Los Angeles’s 33-19 win over Tennessee, which takes them to 2-0 on the season. Add in new toy Davante Adams, who was good for 106 receiving yards, and OC Mike LaFleur, and Rams head coach Sean McVay should have plenty of fun with the offensive playbook. Nacua was also productive Sunday as a receiver, finishing with eight receptions and 91 yards.Puka Nacua takes the handoff 45 yards for a TD on 4th & 1!LARvsTEN on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/1bioXMJ7rd— NFL (@NFL)September 14, 2025Stat of the week2-0.The Bengals have won their opening two games of the season for the first time since 2018. Most NFL teams with lofty expectations expect to be 2-0 after being gifted Cleveland and Jacksonville to open the season. But for the Bengals in the Joe Burrow Era, this is new territory after an odd win over the Jaguars. What started with Burrow, who left with a toe injury in the first half – on Monday morningreports emergedBurrow requires toe surgery and will miss at least three months – ended with an improbable hero in his backup, Jake Browning. Browning threw three interceptions before going 9-for-10 on the final drive and jumping over a pile of players for a tush-push, game-winning touchdown. Browning summed up his mindset for the game neatly: “Be delusional.”View image in fullscreenThe Bengals are 2-0 but Joe Burrow left the game early.Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/APThe extent of Burrow’s injury isn’t official, but as he sat on the ground pointing to his foot, a collective“not again”rippled through Cincinnati. Lacking even a gator cart, the Bengals had him hobble away on a foot scooter. Have the team’s decision-makers learned nothing from their offensive line’s toll on him, most notably the knee injury that ended his rookie year? Since their 2022 Super Bowl appearance, this franchise has drifted back into mediocrity. Despite boasting a franchise quarterback in Burrow and elite receivers like Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, they’ve repeatedly dropped close games and failed to retain key defensive talent.So, yes, the Bengals are in an odd position with this 2-0 thing, not to mention the fact that enjoy sole possession of first place in the AFC North. Browning is a solid backup but is, of course, no Burrow. The schedule gets nasty in Weeks 5 and 6 with the Lions and Packers on the schedule. If Burrow is indeed out, prospects for the Bengals as a season-long powerhouse don’t look good. But the Bengals should still savor being 2-0 – it’s been a while.Elsewhere around the leagueThe Super Bowl rematch arrived on Sunday, and it won’t be much comfort to the Chiefs that their 20-17 defeat to the Eagles was less one-sided than February’s game. As was the case last time, the Eagles defense was at its formidable best and, aside froma beauty of a touchdown pass from Mahomes, the Eagles stifled the Chiefs. Kansas City are 0-2 for the first time since 2014, which is also the last time they failed to make the postseason. They should still make it this season, and the Giants should provide relief next week, but next after that is a tricky meeting with the Ravens.View image in fullscreenJalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley were understandably chipper after Sunday’s win.Photograph: Ed Zurga/APsteelers explain yourselves because what was thatpic.twitter.com/QKNU52FWMZ— Annie Agar (@AnnieAgar)September 14, 2025There are regular rookie mistakes, then there is thecatastrophic kickoff returnby the Steelers’ Kaleb Johnson. Early in the fourth quarter, after Seattle took a three-point lead, Johnson let the ensuing kickoff bounce through his hands and settle in the end zone. It appeared Johnson did not understand the kickoff rules which state that the ball is live if the returning team does not possess it. Seattle recovered the ball for a touchdown, putting them up 24-14. The Seahawks would eventually win 31-17. “If I wasn’t sure [of the rule], if I was sure, it doesn’t matter,” said Johnson after the game. “I still got to do what I got to do, and I still got to go in there and execute the way it needs to be executed.” Welcome to the NFL, poor rookie.Ben Johnson’s return to Detroit did not quite go as he planned. An extra motivated Lions squad took it to Johnson’s Bears, winning 52-21. Jared Goff tore up Chicago’s defense with a whopping 82% completion rate, five touchdowns, and 334 yards. The Lions came in motivated – eager to knock off their former offensive coordinator and desperate for a rebound after their Week 1 loss to Green Bay. They did both. For Johnson, though, two weeks in Chicago have underscored the vast gulf between being a successful coordinator and a being a head coach, even for the so-called wunderkinds.An ESPN reportsurfaced over the weekendclaiming that the Baltimore Ravens had intended to pick Shedeur Sanders in the fifth round of this year’s draft. But Sanders let it be known that he did not want to be stuck behind a superstar like Lamar Jackson. Well, looks like Cleveland are the perfect situation for Sanders. The 40-year-old Joe Flacco continued to look his age in Cleveland’s 41-17 loss to the Ravens. Not only did Flacco throw an interception and had a fumble returned 60 yards that led to a touchdown, his throws lacked zip and his mobility was nonexistent. Second-stringer Dillon Gabriel made his NFL debut late in the game; Sanders saw no action. Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski said Flacco will remain the starter as the Browns prepare to play Green Bay next week. But the leash has to be getting shorter.Pity Panthers fans (if you didn’t already). After trailing Arizona 27-3, Carolina mounted a legitimate comeback on Sunday, but fell short in their 27-22 loss. Bryce Young and the offense need a complete four quarters, which is a challenge given Carolina’s offensive line issues and lack of elite skill players. Aside from Chuba Hubbard and an emerging connection between Young and Hunter Renfrow, the Panthers are desperate for playmakers. Xavier Legette was certainly not that guy on Sunday. The Panthers wideout ended the game with -2 receiving yards on eight targets.Per ESPN’s Ben Solak, Legette’s “performance” is only the second game in NFL history when a receiver has recorded negative yards on eight or more targets. Chiefs RB Jamaal Charles had -6 yards on eight targets in 2013.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew York GiantsDallas CowboysUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The former world road race champion posted on social media: “If the UCI and the responsible bodies couldn’t make the right decisions early enough, then long‑term it’s very bad for cycling that the protesters managed to get what they wanted.“From now on, it’s clear that a cycling race can be used as an effective stage for protests and next time it will only get worse, because someone allowed it to happen and looked the other way.”The three-week Vuelta a España, the final Grand Tour of 2025, was characterised by multiple pro-Palestine protests which caused crashes that forced two riders to quit the race, several changes to stage finishes and distances, and the cancellations of podium ceremonies.A huge protest forced theabandonment of the final stageand the cancellation of all the planned celebrations. But it was also a glimpse of one possible future for World Tour road racing if the Israel-Premier Tech (IPT) team continue to compete.For the Vuelta itself, the race has been catastrophic with increased policing cost, lost television audiences, disenchanted sponsors and stage-winning riders, including Kwiatkowski’s teammate Egan Bernal, being denied their moment of podium glory.On Sunday evening in the car park of their team hotel in suburban Madrid, Jonas Vingegaard, Joāo Almeida and Tom Pidcock, the top three finishers, stepped on to a makeshift podium of drinks coolers, and sprayed each other with champagne. It wasn’t quite the sunset podium on live TV that they and their sponsors had expected after three weeks of tumultuous, fractured and occasionally dangerous racing.“It’s a shame that a moment for eternity was taken away from us this way,” Vingegaard, the victor, said of the Madrid finish cancellation. “I’m really upset about it. Everyone has the right to protest, but only without influencing or endangering our race.”In little more than a fortnight, an initiative which began targeting the IPT team’s participation in the race morphed into a far bigger anti‑Israel protest movement.With further protests promised for other races, including the Tour de France start in Barcelona next year, the European racing scene is now in a bind. There were also demonstrations on Sunday in Canada, at the one-day GP Montreal, where a large yellow sign accused the IPT team of being an “ambassador of genocide”.Although there was a growing sense in the peloton that the team owner, Sylvan Adams, and his riders should have pulled out of the Vuelta, Adams steadfastly refused, saying acceding to a request from the race organiser, ASO, to withdraw would have seen no end to the protests against them and potentially other teams.“They asked us to quit the Vuelta, but we did not surrender to the terrorists,” Adams said during the race. “I told them that they were wrong and that we had the right to stay.”Adams’s stance was welcomed by Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, while the billionaire team owner said he had also received support from the UCI. Israel-Premier Tech declined to comment on the latest suggestion that teams may not race at events where their riders participate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, in a sport now heavily reliant on nation-state sponsorship and branding, politicised mass protest, no matter how peaceful, will not be.Unlike stadium-based sport, road racing – in need of public goodwill – remains uniquely vulnerable to protest and disruption on almost every kilometre of the route. Fully securing 175km of French, Italian or Spanish countryside is logistically impossible and prohibitively expensive. It also goes against the positioning of cycling as a free “people’s festival”.Richard Plugge, Vingegaard’s team manager at Visma-Lease a Bike and one of the most influential World Tour bosses, said on Sunday evening: “These days, sport is used as a platform for addressing social issues. But the participants must be protected. They must not become victims of this social debate.“That debate must be kept out of the athletes’ arena at all times. Athletes must be able to fight their battles unhindered in the stadium, or in our case, on the road. Otherwise, the unifying essence of sport will be jeopardised.”The UCI declined to comment on its handling of the situation, instead praising race organisers’ professionalism in the face of the protests and criticising the Spanish government. In a statement, it noted its “total disapproval of and deep concern about the events that marked the 2025 edition of La Vuelta Ciclista a España”.“We also regret the fact that the Spanish prime minister and his government have supported actions that could hinder the smooth running of a sporting competition and, in some cases, expressed their admiration for the demonstrators.”Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

There was his trademark To Da World pose before the 100m finals. The cheers and adulation of 60,000 fans in Tokyo’s National Stadium. A reminder of glories past.The 39-year-old Jamaican had not watched athletics at allsince retiring in 2017until seeingMelissa Jefferson-WoodenandOblique Seville win gold. And, as he also admitted, he now spends his time streaming movies and building Lego – and even gets out of breath when he walks up stairs.Simbu snatches world marathon gold from Petros in historic photo finishRead moreHowever, when asked why the new crop of sprinters is not as quick as his generation, despite the advances in spike and track technology, Bolt’s competitive instincts fired back to life. “You want the real answer? We’re just more talented,” he said. “That’s all I’m saying. Of course, it shows when it comes to the men. You can see the women are different. They’re running faster times and faster times. So it shows – it has to be the talent.”Bolt, who won eight Olympic gold medals and 11 world titles, still holds three world records – 9.58sec in the 100m, 19.19 in the 200m and 36.84 in the 4×100m relay – that stand tall. The athletes he used to beat – including Tyson Gay, Yohan Blake, Asafa Powell and Justin Gatlin – were also quicker than the cream of the 2025 generation. Indeed, no one has broken 9.70 since the Lausanne Diamond League meeting that followed London 2012.While Gay, Blake, Powell and Gatlin were all banned at various stages for doping offences, Bolt said the fact that Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce improved her times once the super spikes arrived showed that talent was key. “You have Shelly, who has got the new spikes, and she ran faster. So it’s just the talent. We’re just way more talented men over that time. It shows if you look at it.”Bolt also urged track and field athletes to show more of themselves to engage with casual fans. “It’s the personality,” he said. “I think a lot of people try to be fun but it comes off different. It’s just having a good time. If you try too hard, it’s not going to be the same.”He also pointed to a moment at the 2012 Olympic Games, when he was the flag bearer for Jamaica, and saw Queen Elizabeth II at the opening ceremony. “When I was in London, I knew the queen, so I waved,” he said. “I tried to engage with fans and that’s why they gravitated to it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But these days he confessed to a more sedentary lifestyle at home.Asked what he did on a typical day, he replied: “Well normally, I wake up just in time to see the kids off to school, and then it depends on what I have to do. If I have nothing to do, I just chill out. I might work out sometimes if I’m in a good mood. I just watch some series and chill until the kids come home.“I spend some time with them, hang out, until they start annoying me then I leave. And then afterwards, I just stay at home and watch movies or I’m into Lego now, so I do Lego.”Bolt, who ruptured an achilles last year, said he no longer runs. “No, I mostly do gym workouts. I’m not a fan, but I think now that I’ve been out for a while I have to actually start running. Because when I walk up stairs I get out of breath. I think when I start working on it fully again, I will probably have to do some laps just to get my breathing right.”However, he insisted that watching track and field again had made him want to bring his children, Olympia Lightning Bolt, five, and his twin sons, Saint Leo and Thunder Bolt, four, to the world championships in Beijing in two years’ time.That, of course, is where his legend began at the 2008 Olympics. “I’m excited because I get to bring my kids and I can tell them: ‘Listen, this is where it all happened.’ I’ve shown my kids videos and stuff like that. They’ll be six and seven, and they’ll kind of understand the moment, and I can explain to them what their dad has done over the years.”Explore more on these topicsUsain BoltWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

He may or may not be, but he is an exceptional goalkeeper.Manchester Uniteddidn’t offer enough of a test even to begin to assess whether Donnarumma is good enough with the ball at his feet to allow City to play as Guardiola would like them to. Nor did they test whether his starting position is advanced enough to sweep up behind a high defensive line and prevent the sort of chances City yielded up to Tottenham and Brighton. But his save to keep out a Bryan Mbeumo volley, hurling himself to his right to push the ball wide, was spectacular, and drew congratulations from pretty much all his teammates. Even if he is not the perfect stylistic fit, Donnarumma’s presence, his commanding stature and the aura he projects make him the right goalkeeper for now as City begin the process of rebuilding with a notably young squad.Jonathan WilsonMatch report:Manchester City 3-0 Manchester UnitedView image in fullscreenManchester City’s Gianluigi Donnarumma is congratulated by Tijjani Reijnders after his save from Bryan Mbeumo.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters2Kerkez causing a dilemma for SlotSince the days of Franny Lee, the art of diving in football has been difficult to perfect. With cameras covering every angle at Premier League grounds, if simulation is to be performed in the hope of winning a penalty, it has to be perfect.Milos Kerkez’s effort at Burnleywas desperate, throwing himself down in the box, fearful that Josh Laurent was breathing in the vicinity and this might be worthy of a foul. The left-back was cautioned by Michael Oliver and it put the Hungarian under pressure, leaving him another yellow card away from being dismissed. A foul soon after was not worthy of a second booking and dismissal, but Arne Slot realised he had to act to avoid needlessly losing a man. Kerkez is yet to impress at Anfield and is at risk of losing his place to Andy Robertson, who replaced the former Bournemouth defender before half-time. It will be interesting to see who will start against Atlético Madrid on Wednesday and how long it could take Kerkez to win back the spot.Will UnwinMatch report:Burnley 0-1 Liverpool3Hammers’ dismal defending goes onGraham Potter hunted for positives. The good news, he reckoned, was that West Ham defended the first nine or 10 set pieces from Tottenham pretty well. Hooray! Progress! Unfortunately the zonal marking system was utterly abysmal when the unchallenged Pape Matar Sarr headed Spurs into the lead after 47 minutes. It was a pathetic concession; West Ham’s fourth from a corner this season. What are they doing at Rush Green? Mads Hermansen is not commanding his area and the centre-backs are poor.There is no organisation. West Ham are also conceding from second phases and are vulnerable to crosses (they have conceded six headers this season), while they offer next to no threat at attacking set pieces. Something is amiss. West Ham lag behind other clubs when it comes to innovation. With direct football making a comeback, why have they not considered hiring a set-piece coach?Jacob SteinbergMatch report:West Ham 0-3 TottenhamView image in fullscreenPape Matar Sarr rises to score Tottenham’s first goal against West Ham.Photograph: Chloe Knott/Tottenham Hotspur FC/Shutterstock4The verdict on Woltemade’s debutThe good news for Newcastle is that Yoane Wissa, theirnew £55m attacking signing from Brentford, did not, as feared, suffer an anterior cruciate ligament injury while on international duty with the Democratic Republic of the Congo last week. Instead, a less serious knee problem will sideline Wissa for about six weeks. While that is not an insignificant blow for Eddie Howe, at least his other new striker, Nick Woltemade, has hit the ground running. Not content withscoring the winner against Wolves– a fabulous header from Jacob Murphy’s cross – the tall, angular, thoroughly unorthodox Germany striker shone throughout his 65-minute stint against a still pointless, yet far from hopeless, Wolves. Moreover, Woltemade’s clever feet, ability to hold the ball up and penchant for dropping deep to link play suggest he could operate as a highly effective No 10 behind Wissa one day. More immediately, he is set to lead the line against Barcelona at St James’ Park on Thursday night when the Catalan club must find a way of neutralising Howe’s imperious midfield dictator, Italy’s Sandro Tonali.Louise TaylorMatch report:Newcastle 1-0 Wolves5Madueke enjoys dream weekNoni Madueke capped a great week with an eye-catching display in Arsenal’s one-sided victory over Nottingham Forest. Four days afterscoring his first England goal, the winger’s direct approach frequently placed the Forest defence on the back foot and helped supporters forget the absence of the injured Bukayo Saka as Arsenal made it three wins from their first four Premier League games. A penny for the thoughts of those Arsenal fans who took to social media in the summer to complain about the player’s arrival in a £52m deal from Chelsea. Another big winner on Saturday was Arsenal’s sporting director, Andrea Berta, who saw the summer signings Martín Zubimendi, Viktor Gyökeres, Eberechi Eze, Cristhian Mosquera and Maduekeimpress. Last season, the absence of Martin Ødegaard, Kai Havertz, William Saliba and Saka would have severely tested Arsenal, now there’s not an obvious weakness in their squad.Stephen FlynnMatch report:Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest6Carvalho’s chance arrives at BrentfordAt Brentford, it is hoped Fábio Carvalho’slate equaliser against Chelseacan be a building block towards reviving what was once a highly promising career. “With Fábio, I’ve just asked for a little bit of patience, because I truly believe he’ll be a big player for this club,” said Keith Andrews. Signed in the summer of 2024, he has found chances restricted by injuries and the form of Thomas Frank’s favoured frontline of Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Kevin Schade. Mikkel Damsgaard is also a high-grade playmaker. Two of those players have been sold off. Meanwhile, the new manager developed a working relationship with the former Fulham starlet as Frank’s set-piece coach. “Fábio probably hasn’t had as many minutes as he deserves, because his application to his craft and his dedication to his craft is pretty special,” Andrews said. Mutual respect is clear. “Keith is making his mark, the team are on board,” said Carvalho. “We’ve got enough quality to do well this season.”John BrewinMatch report:Brentford 2-2 Chelsea7Incisive Iraola the complete packageWhen Bournemouth sold Illia Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez – three-quarters of last year’s first-choice back four – along with Dango Ouattara, their relentless progress looked set to stall. But after four games they sit fourth in the table with three wins, their performance at Spurs one of the league’s best so far this season, and one defeat, at Anfield in a game they were drawing until two minutes from time. Part of the credit for this must go to their recruitment team, with Bafodé Diakité –absent injured against Brighton– Veljko Milosavljevic, who replaced him, and Adrien Truffert looking smart additions. But at the centre of it all is Andoni Iraola, his brave, calculated and intelligent aggression reflected perfectly by his team. Part of the excellence is tactical – Iraola is an incisive, original thinker about the game – but without the ability to communicate and inspire, it would mean nothing. Or, in other words, he is the complete package, which is, unfortunately, a double-edged sword: predators will surely be circling.Daniel HarrisMatch report:Bournemouth 2-1 BrightonView image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo scores Bournemouth’s second goal against Brighton from the penalty spot.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/Shutterstock8Martínez back to being Villans’ heroEmiliano Martínez spent deadline day waiting patiently at Aston Villa’s training complex for a call from Manchester United that never came. A fortnight later, Martínezearned Villa a point at Evertonvia stunning stops from Jack Grealish and Michael Keane. Was Unai Emery ever really going to leave the Argentinian out? Nope. “I am so, so happy. We need him,” Emery said. “We struggled in his situation, but we have to get [our] feelings together and feel the collective objective. Today, his comeback has been fantastic. We have to protect him and feel him inside the group, so he is comfortable and confident. He was fantastic.” The supporters who assumed they had seen the last of the man they christened “the world’s No 1” were belting out his name again come 5pm on Saturday.Sam DallingMatch report:Everton 0-0 Aston Villa9Leeds looking lightweight up frontTo misquote Mötley Crüe, Daniel Farke has “goals, goals, goals” on his mind and with very good reason. Four games in and Leeds have scored precisely one – and that a penalty in their first match of the season. The German watched his players score 95 times on their way to winning the Championship but, sensibly, he is not expecting the same thing this year. He knows they will have to adapt their approach. “It’s not like this team that was outstanding in the Championship, with 100 points and nearly 100 goals and dominating, will cut the Premier League into pieces,” he said. “We know we don’t have the best individual quality so we have to come with other skills. Fitter, tighter, show fighting spirit.” Farke signed Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the summer on a free transfer from Everton and,after defeat at Fulham, he highlighted what he expects of his centre-forward. “He will need to play a crucial part in our survival. We need him in top form and top shape in order to achieve our goals.”Conrad LeachMatch report:Fulham 1-0 LeedsView image in fullscreenLeeds’ Brenden Aaronson holds off Fulham’s Ryan Sessegnon.Photograph: Javier García/Shutterstock10Roefs is on fire for SunderlandSunderland’s excellent start to the season has been all the more impressive given the number of new arrivals there were in the summer.

Nordi Mukiele – who joined from Paris Saint-Germain for £12m – also put in a solid display in central defence and the France international believes they will only improve as the season progresses. “The beginning has been really good and to be honest, I don’t think the team is 100% yet,” he said. “We have new players, like I have just come now. We have done some positive things already but we haven’t known each other for a long time, so I’m waiting for the future to see how we do because we are doing well for the moment but we will get better.”Ed AaronsMatch report:Crystal Palace 0-0 SunderlandPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool45122Arsenal4893Tottenham Hotspur4794AFC Bournemouth4195Chelsea4686Everton4277Sunderland4278Man City4469Crystal Palace43610Newcastle40511Fulham4-1512Brentford4-2413Brighton4-2414Man Utd4-3415Nottm Forest4-4416Leeds4-5417Burnley4-3318West Ham4-7319Aston Villa4-4220Wolverhampton4-70Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballManchester CityManchester UnitedBurnleyLiverpoolWest Ham UnitedTottenham HotspurfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When he was a teenager, everybody knew how good he was. He had been probably the key player shortly after turning 17 as England won the Under-17 World Cup in 2017, and there had been a clamour for him to play for Manchester City long before Pep Guardiola began to start him regularly in 2020-21. For four seasons he was one of the best players in the league and then, suddenly, there was nothing – at least by the exceptionally high standards he had set.Foden had not had a good Euros in 2024. He has never really produced his best for England, a function perhaps of him playing for a club with such a specific style of play. Take him out of that regimented environment where he knew exactly what runs to make, exactly where his teammates would be moving, and he found it hard to adapt. And England generally did not play well at that Euros, despite reaching the final; the front end of the team was a mess, lacking the balance of previous Gareth Southgate sides.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreBut why did Foden’s form fail to return when he got back to City? It’s not uncommon for players who have played for sides who have gone deep at summer tournaments to start the following season slowly. But Foden never regained his form. He suffered a couple of bouts of illness and an ankle injury, and although that did disrupt his season, there was no long-term ailment. He started 20Premier Leaguegames, came off the bench on eight occasions, scored seven goals and only very rarely looked like himself. For all the new signings at City this year, one of Guardiola’s more important jobs as he looks to restore his side to greatness is to get Foden back to his best.Foden came off the bench in the defeat to Tottenham and started for the first time this seasonas City beat Manchester United 3-0. It would be reckless to read too much into a performance against Ruben Amorim’s underperforming side – opposing attackers and creators have a tendency to play well against them – but there were promising signs. The partnership with Jérémy Doku, a very different sort of wide forward, is intriguing: Doku runs at players, dribbles, beats them with close technical skill; Foden drifts inside and creates chances through the quality of his passing and movement.The opening goal on Sunday was typical of this. As Rodri released Doku on the right, Foden found space in the middle of the box – despite every United player being in their own defensive third. Again, only the fact that it was against United, who seem pathologically unable to concentrate, diminishes the achievement. When the cross came in, he then guided a smart header past a weirdly flat-footed Altay Bayindir. The broad grin in his celebration suggested just how much the goal meant, just how relieved Foden was to score his first league goal since January.“We missed him so much,” said Guardiola. “This season, we need him so much. He moved behind the strikers in that position, he had a sense of goal, a sense of where to turn, a sense of quality to keep the ball. I like the players that play behind the strikers – most of them pass the ball and stay to look at how well they made the pass, but he’s a guy who makes a pass and goes to the penalty spot like an animal, and scores. When he receives the ball he’s angry, because he and the ball are going to score.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last season, for injuries, for other reasons, he couldn’t be with us. This season he’s also had knocks and injuries but hopefully step by step he can get back to his best and hopefully show that in a game like today against United. It feels like a special game for him, because he played an incredible match: he’s in with the support, he can do what he’s able to do. We enjoy the happiness in his face.”For somebody from Manchester, the derby probably does mean more. But the sense with Foden is that playing with freedom and belief again, and scoring, means a lot in itself. Foden needs to be playing well if he is to make England’s squad for next year’s World Cup. He offers a cerebral approach that sets him apart, but there is no shortage of other candidates for those creative roles.If City needed Foden last season, with Kevin De Bruyne sold they really need him now. It’s early days and there will be far tougher tests thanManchester Unitedahead, but Sunday offered reasons for optimism.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Which he was,” Raleigh said of visiting Yankee Stadium with his father when he was younger. “It’s kind of cool to think about that.”Mariners manager Dan Wilson paid tribute to Raleigh’s attitude. “To do what he has done offensively, to do what he does defensively, to do what he does with our pitching staff, you just marvel at all the things that he’s accomplishing,” Wilson said. “On top of that, making history, and just in a very humble way, that’s the kind of guy he is. He just wants to win, and that’s where it all comes from. That’s the driver.”The Mariners’ last division title came in 2001, when they won 116 games. Raleigh said he is concentrating on helping his team end their drought.“You know, in today’s age it’s hard not to go on your phone and people are talking about it, texting you about it,” Raleigh said. “I’m trying to do my best to block that out.

The defender could not help himself, he needed to make his views known, but when all of the pieces were put together from last season and into the summer, it was difficult to see that he was planning on staying at the club.There was the repost of a social media message last September that claimed he was tired because Spurs had not flown him back on a private jet from Argentina duty. Note: reposts can be endorsements. There was the complaint in December that the club’s lack of spending meant they were falling behind Premier League rivals. “You have to realise that something is going wrong – hopefully they [the board] realise it,” he said.New legal challenge to plan for Spurs football academy in London parkRead moreThere was the moment in March of this year when Romero thanked the Argentina medics for his return to fitness after injury while making no mention of the physios at Spurs. There was the interview in April when he said he would love to play in Spain’s La Liga. And he appeared to sign off on more than one level in mid-June as he paid tribute to the club’s outgoing manager, Ange Postecoglou – just after Thomas Frank had been confirmed as his successor.“You paved the way despite the many obstacles that always existed and always will exist,” he wrote. Romero was being linked at the time with Atlético Madrid.Romero’s story is the dictionary definition of a volte-face. That he has remained at Spurs might be attributed in part to how Atlético were never likely to find the money to make a compelling offer. But there are additional layers, deeper ones – primarily the fact that he ended up signing a four-year contract extension. Also, that hedid so as the captain, having agreed to be the on-pitch leader of the Frank era after Son Heung-min’s departure for Los Angeles FC.View image in fullscreenCristian Romero celebrates Micky van de Ven’s goal at West Ham with Lucas Bergvall and Xavi Simons.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe excitement is bubbling at Spurs as they prepare to make their grand Champions League return; they kick off with a home tie against Villarreal on Tuesday night – the reward for that night in Bilbao, as the Europa Leaguevictory against Manchester Unitedwill always be known.Frank’s European experience stretches no further than a handful of Europa League qualifying ties with Brøndby more than a decade ago. It has been quite the journey for him, taking in managing Brentford at Griffin Park in the Championship and it was touching to hear him talk of how he could not wait to hear theChampions Leaguearia; to feel the vibes inside the stadium during the opening minutes of the game.Frank is not the only important change at Spurs. There are new people in charge in the shape of Vivienne and Charles Lewis after theeasing aside of the chairman Daniel Levy. There is a new chief executive in Vinai Venkatesham; a new non-executive chairman in Peter Charrington. But it is hard to see a clearer symbol of the fresh direction and hope than Romero. And the more he spoke at the pre-Villarreal media conference, the more it was possible to read into the reasons for his optimism.“I did a lot of interviews which seemed like I was talking badly about people inside the club but in the end I’m a person who sometimes makes mistakes and that’s it,” Romero said.“I always want the best for the club. Sometimes, things have been said that aren’t true as well but always everything I said is because I want there to be a structure of a club that can be at the top level, part of the big clubs.“That’s why I was sometimes so angry before. But today I see a very organised club with a clear idea and a coach who is organising things. Everyone is seeing that in a short space of time we are with him. Absolutely everyone inside is looking in the same direction and that is the important thing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there was plenty to grill him about, including his comments from December about the “people responsible” for the relative lack of investment in the squad.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Bentancur puts an arm around Cristian Romero in training before Tuesday’s visit of Villarreal.Photograph: John Walton/PA“As I said before, it’s a bit of everything,” Romero said. “It’s about the group of players, the coaching staff, the people that work for us, the executives obviously. In the end, it depends on everyone that we pull in the same direction. I think that since Thomas arrived, they have started to take all those decisions to go in the same direction. And then when it’s like that, everything runs a lot more easily.“We’ve had a great start to the season. There’s a lot we can still improve upon but we’ve created a lovely group to work with. The previous manager, Ange, brought this group together and now Thomas has arrived. He has brought in new players and they are fitting in nicely. When you are a family like this off the field, it’s much easier to achieve things on the field.”Romero was asked for his thoughts on Levy’s departure. “I don’t know what’s happened but it’s not something I’ve had the chance to speak with him about personally,” the 27-year-old said. “He’s a person who’s been at the club for a good many years. We need to thank him because he’s the person who brought me here. Fortunately, we could crown his reign with a trophy, which would have made everyone happy, including him. I just desire the very best for him and it’s his decision …”The last half-line was open to question but Romero was in no mood to brook many arguments. The past is the past.

That was addressed with the £250m spent on strengthening the squad this summer; now the test comes on the pitch as they embark on their 23rd season in the competition.Bit of unprocessed Gyökeres helps transformed Arsenal finish off Forest | Barney RonayRead moreWhen it was put to Arteta thatArsenalmay be the biggest club never to have won the competition, he said: “That with our long history [we haven’t won it] tells you how difficult it is. That’s the history of our club and that’s what we want to change.“The pressure is the opportunity that drives us, that gives us energy, and every decision has to be up to those standards and those expectations so that we have our best chance. It is that in that moment [of defeat] that you get deflated and have to understand what you have to do to get back in the same position.“It is painful: not just in how we feel but [because of] the expectation we created and the real conviction that we could go all the way because we showed a very high level of consistency and quality. So we have to learn from that and try to get better.”Asked what the main lesson had been, Arteta said: “That we are good enough and can compete against any opposition on the day. Then two or three things have to go your way. You need your full squad in key moments. The margins are so small. We were training with eight or nine key players and going into games with 13. It is very difficult but we gave ourselves an unbelievable chance and we were very unlucky not to get through.“But it’s not that simple. You are so willing and you want to do better. There is a very clear intention with us to get better every day – that is the start and the end [point]. We have the understanding that we can compete against everyone. [We have spent but] like the rest of the teams have done and continue to do – and they have won it.“Winning it is the aim at the beginning but we know it is a long journey and the margins are fine. The big clubs try seven, eight, nine times and win two.

Viewers in Germany and Italy will be able to access it from the Champions League’s third matchday.Amazon’s new approach has been imported from the US, where Prime Vision has operated successfully on NFL coverage for three years. For the viewer it essentially recreates the experience of watching an analyst explain a match using a telecaster, but in real-time.Further data points captured by Prime Vision include shot speed, jump height and the position of all 22 players on the pitch (displayed in a graphic at the bottom of the screen). The xG of each goalscoring opportunity will also be captured and displayed, putting a metric new to the game a decade ago at the heart of coverage. Amazon hasbuilt its own xG modeland designed an algorithm that will calculate “momentum” in a match, another live stat.View image in fullscreenPrime Vision will offer the viewer extensive data points related to the individual players.Illustration: Prime VideoAndrew Hornett, Prime Video’s director of live sports production for Europe, said the innovation was optional for viewers but showed that Amazon was trying to “innovate with a purpose”. He also acknowledged the influence of games such as EA Sports’s FC in developing a more data-led way to watch. “Gaming has had an influence and [Prime Vision] has been developed by gamers,” he said. “But we haven’t defined a target audience, we’ve done it because we think it’s a cool thing to do.”Prime Vision has been a success in the US, where it won an Emmy for outstanding interactive experience in 2023. In the following year audiences for Amazon’s NFL coverage grew by 11%. Internal figures also show that the Prime Vision audience was on average nearly seven years younger than that watching a linear broadcast, and that the audience was almost equally split between NFL obsessives and those who knew little about the sport.Amazon is a fringe player in UK sports broadcasting but its roster is growing and the tech company is able to reach sizeable audiences with its coverage; last season four of its Champions League matches reached audiences of more than 5 million people. Hornett said Amazon’s technological expertise allowed it to innovate at pace and that “it will take our rivals a bit of time to get where we are” in relation to Prime Vision.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Marcelino insisted that Partey would be able to handle the game – if selected.Partey, 32, faces five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault. The allegations relate to three women, who reported incidents which took place between 2021 and 2022.“I’m totally convinced that he is mentally prepared and technically prepared to play,” Marcelino said. “For sure he’ll be ready. We are really happy that Thomas is with us for his football capacity and ability and his presence as a human. He’s a great player with lots of experience. He’s played in some top sides. We know he’s got a great ability and great level.“I think he ended last season and started this season well. He settled in during pre-season really, really well. I think he will get back to his top level which we all know that he’s got and I’m very happy he’s with us in the team.”Marcelino was peppered with questions about Partey by English journalists at Villarreal’s pre-match press conference, at one point exclaiming that “we are talking more about Thomas than the game”. Marcelino sought to steer the conversation on to the football.“We’re interpreting stuff and talking about a player that could be totally innocent,” he said. “We’re playing a game of football tomorrow where the important thing is football.

Well, not any more | David LammyRajeev SyalHome affairs editorMon 15 Sep 2025 17.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 18.00 EDTSharePublic servants who deliberately cover up state-related disasters will face up to two years in jail under a new Hillsborough law,David Lammyhas promised, following concerns from campaigners that it could be watered down.Writing in the Guardian, the deputy prime minister and lord chancellor said legislation would ensure that state actors from “the bobby on the beat to the highest office in the land” will face “serious punishments for serious wrongdoing”.The long-awaited public office (accountability) bill will be introduced to parliament on Tuesday after months of behind-the-scenes wrangling between lawyers for the Hillsborough families and officials.It means that ministers, senior civil servants and chief constables who mislead the public could be dragged before the courts and imprisoned, Whitehall sources said.Keir Starmer had previously pledged to introduce the legislation by the 36th anniversary of the tragedy, which was on 15 April, but Downing Street then said more time was needed to redraft it.Some campaigners had raised fears the bill’s contents had been diluted and would not include a legal duty of candour.Lammy wrote: “This law … includes a new professional and legal duty of candour. When something has gone badly wrong, public servants – from the bobby on the beat to the highest office in the land – will be under a duty to act with honesty and integrity at all times. Anyone who fails to do so faces criminal prosecution.“And it will be supported with a new offence for flagrantly misleading the public, with those found in breach of the law facing up to two years behind bars, along with replacing the current offence of misconduct in public office with two new offences. These are serious punishments for serious wrongdoing.”Under the bill, legal aid will automatically be available to bereaved families at inquests whenever the state is represented by an “army of taxpayer-funded lawyers”, Lammy said.“Those grieving will never again have to pass the hat around to have their voices heard,” he said.Pointing to his own experience of losing a friend in the Grenfell Tower disaster, Lammy said the bill was a tribute to the work of campaigners involved not just in Hillsborough, but also Windrush, the Manchester arena bombing and the Post Office scandal.“I lost a dear friend,Khadija Saye, in Grenfell,” he said. “I know what it is to sit with families whose lives have been torn apart, and to feel the weight of a system that too often meets grief with defensiveness and delay.”TheHillsborough disasterin 1989 during the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the football ground in Sheffield led to the deaths of 97 football fans.Sue Roberts, whose brother Graham was unlawfully killed at Hillsborough, described the bill’s introduction as a “huge step in the right direction” but said the families would be “watching closely to ensure this bill is passed in its entirety and enacted in full.“The government must resist any pressure from those who don’t believe the public deserves to know the truth about when the state fails,” she said.Some families and campaigners are expected to attend Downing Street on Tuesday to mark the bill’s introduction.Lawyers for the Hillsborough families remain concerned that the “duty of candour” offence has been drafted too narrowly, and could let off some public officials who should face the law.The bill only applies to some inquiries. Lawyers for the families have been reassured that the government plans to amend it to cover combined authorities and local authorities.The “duty to assist” definition could also be widened, lawyers said. Officials have promised that other bodies will be covered by the law including the Care Quality Commission, the Health and Safety Executive and official “ombudsman” investigations.Pete Weatherby KC, an architect of the original bill who represents many of the Hillsborough families, told the Guardian that survivors and bereaved families will be closely involved as the bill proceeds through parliament.“This bill is a major step forward,” he said. “It is sufficiently strong to affect culture change so public bodies tell the truth as matter of course rather than be dragged kicking and screaming.“The government has agreed that we will be involved in the process to pass the bill and will be involved in what happens next.”The expansion of legal aid for bereaved families, with non-means tested help and support for inquests, has been welcomed. Julia Waters, the sister of headteacher Ruth Perry who took her own life after an Ofsted report downgraded her school, said her family had been “forced to crowdfund to cover our legal costs at an already emotional and stressful time”.“Hillsborough law will help ensure families like mine are no longer left to fight for truth and accountability on our own – in the hope that those in power can finally be held responsible when things go catastrophically wrong,” she said.Natasha Elcock, from Grenfell United, said: “It has been so easy for public and private agencies to escape accountability and scrutiny. By establishing a duty of candour, Hillsborough Law will prevent this, help us learn from failures and ensure bereaved and survivors are properly supported.”Lobby Akinnola, who lost his father, Femi, early on in the Covid pandemic, said he and others had seen “first-hand how easily the truth is delayed, diluted or denied”, adding that this new bill is “a huge step towards” justice.Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justiceHillsborough disasterDavid LammyLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Change is visible all around the Meinau: in its recently developed stands and on the pitch where, in two years, they have gone from perennial relegation strugglers to Champions League candidates. The motor for change was BlueCo’s purchase of the club in 2023. The takeover was met with stout opposition and the team’s upward trajectory since has done little to remould public opinion.“I feel like we are back at the beginning. I am so disappointed with the reaction,” complained Liam Rosenior on Sunday, exasperated by the latest fan protests. You needn’t scratch too much to uncover the resentment that bubbles beneath the surface of the Meinau. The 15-minute strike, where the club’s ultras remain silent at the start of matches, is now just a common feature of Strasbourg fixtures, and you are never more than a few weeks away from a lengthy and often explosive supporters group communique denouncing some facet of the management of the club.BlueCo have always been the target of the fans’ ire – and that remains the case – but recent protests have also seen other figures caught in the crossfire. Marc Keller, who played for Strasbourg in the 1990s and came to the club’s rescue when it went bankrupt in the early 2010s, is the latest target. He built the club back up from the amateur divisions but fans are furious that he sold up to BlueCo. Strasbourg’s supporters federation called for him to “face his responsibilities” and leave before their match againstLe Havreon Sunday. “We will never accept what Marc Keller has done to the club by selling to BlueCo,” read the statement.And what the club has become is acquiescent. WhatChelseawant, Chelsea get. Ben Chilwell hardly fits the team’s needs but that is largely irrelevant to BlueCo given their extensive portfolio of players. He needed a new club and interest wasn’t forthcoming, so Chelsea sent him to Strasbourg to join Mathis Amougou and Diego Moreira, who have also made the same move in recent seasons. Chilwell made his debut in the 1-0 win over Le Havre. He was hooked at half-time.View image in fullscreenBen Chilwell had a forgettable Strasbourg debut.Photograph: Icon Sport/Getty ImagesStrasbourg fans are unimpressed by BlueCo’s opaque dealings and asset juggling. Ishé Samuels-Smith joined Strasbourg from Chelsea on a permanent deal this summer before returning to Stamford Bridge and then being sent out on loan to Swansea City – all within the same window. “They’re taking us for fools,” read a banner unfurled by the Strasbourg fans in response to the saga.A more disparaging banner was reserved for Emanuel Emegha, who will move to Chelsea next summer. The power dynamics within the BlueCo “family” mean that Chelsea get the pick of the crop. Emegha scored 14 league goals last season and was handed the captain’s armband over the summer, but he is now preparing to move to Stamford Bridge.The announcement of the deal was not well received in Alsace. “Emegha, pawn of BlueCo, after changing shirts, hand back your captain’s armband,” read a banner. Rosenior said that Emegha was “devastated” by the banner. “I don’t know why they want him to leave straight away,” added Moreira. “OK, he has signed for Chelsea, but he is still here.”Emegha’s insistence that he is “100% focused on Strasbourg until the end of the season” has not appeased fans. However, that he remains in Franceat all this season is a testament to Strasbourg’s newfound exceptionalism. While the financial realities of French football force others to sell, Strasbourg are able to retain their assets and resist even the advances of “top European clubs that play in the Champions League” – as revealed by Emegha himself.View image in fullscreenStrasbourg fans express their fury with Emegha.Photograph: Icon Sport/Getty ImagesHaving brought in 18 players this summer for a combined €110m, making them the top spenders inLigue 1, above even PSG, Strasbourg are now the envy of French clubs. And yet, despite joining the elite, fans are reminiscent of the times of hardship, of relegation struggles and financial worries. Rosenior pleaded for fans to applaud his players after a hard-fought win against Le Havre; he was met with hostility, boos and jeers. “Please, please,” he shouted, but the Englishman cut the image of a man fighting a hopeless battle.The win, secured through Joaquín Panichelli’s late penalty, takes them up to fifth in Ligue 1 and level on points with third-placed Monaco. Having finished seventh last season, their performances so far this campaign suggest they will be in the race for a Champions League place. It would be quite the achievement but, for many Strasbourg fans, it still won’t be enough.Quick GuideLigue 1 resultsShowLille 2-1 ToulouseBrest 1-2 Paris FCMetz 1-1 AngersPSG 2-0 LensStrasbourg 1-0 Le HavreRennes 0-1 LyonNice 1-0 Nantes 0Auxerre 1-2 Monaco 2Marseille 4-0 LorientWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsPSG continued their winning start to the season but it came at a cost. Luis Enrique, head shaven and in a sling afterbreaking his collarbone in a bike accident during the international break, watched on as Bradley Barcola scored both goals in a 2-0 win against Lens. Ousmane Dembélé and Désiré Doué missed the game after picking up injuries on France duty, much to the frustration of PSG, who said they “deplored”Les Bleus’management of Dembélé in particular. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Lee Kang-in and Lucas Beraldo also came off injured on Sunday. PSG may just be a victim of their own success last season, going all the way in the Champions League and the Club World Cup, affording them a pre-season that lasted merely seven days. The effects are already being felt.View image in fullscreenLuis Enrique watched PSG win 2-0 at the weekend.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersLyondefied expectations at the start of the season. They only stayed in Ligue 1 after an appeal and are now without key players such as Rayan Cherki, Lucas Perri and Georges Mikautadze, who all left in order to redress the financial balance and fulfil the promises made to authorities. So it was a surprise when Paulo Fonseca’s side won their first three games without conceding a single goal. However, their luck turned at the weekend against Rennes. They conceded three in a late collapse after the England youth international Tyler Mortonwas harshly shown a red card in the 75th minute. Lyon were 1-0 up when he was sent off; they ultimately lost 3-1, handing Rennestheir first win since their season opener.Perhaps Éric Roy was not catastrophising when he said that Brest, who competed in the Champions League last season, would be fighting for their survival in Ligue 1 this time around. Key players such as Pierre Lees-Melou, Mahdi Camara and Abdallah Sima were part of a mass exodus, and the impact is being felt on the pitch. After a draw on the opening weekend, Brest have since lost three on the bounce. Their latest defeat – 2-1 at home toParis FC– leaves them in the relegation zone, exactly where Roy feared they would be.PosTeamPGDPts1PSG47122Lyon46123Lille48104Monaco4395Strasbourg4296Marseille4567Lens4068Nice4069Toulouse4-1610Paris FC4-2611Angers40512Rennes4-4413Le Havre4-2314Nantes4-2315Auxerre4-3316Lorient4-7317Brest4-5118Metz4-51This is an article byGet French Football NewsExplore more on these topicsLigue 1Guardian Sport NetworkEuropean club footballParis Saint-GermainLensLyonStrasbourgChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fact, for a little while on Saturday night, it feels like everything. At the end of each game when the final whistle goes, so does Diego Simeone: sprinting down the tunnel and straight up the stairs, not a word to anyone and not outrun by anyone either, no stopping and no looking back. This time, though, is different. Juan Martínez Munuera brings Atlético Madrid’s 2-0 win over Villarreal to a close a little before 11pm, 63,312 fans erupting; a littleafter11pm, at the top of the steps under the stand where the fourth official awaits his colleagues and the visitors trudge past tearing off tape and turning right, there’s still no Simeone.Uefa delays decision on allowing domestic games abroad and vows to consult fansRead moreUsually the first through, not even slowing here once he’s safely out of sight of supporters and cameras, a figure in a skinny black suit dashing past a pair of security guards, down the corridor to the left and into an empty dressing room, this time Atlético’s manager is outside under the lights instead. He heads on to the pitch, embracing his players. He screams at Koke, his captain, crushing him with a cuddle. Pulls Antoine Griezmann close and whispers something in his ear, only he has to shout to be heard over the noise. High fives his son Giuliano, who is also one of his wingers. And then joins the rest of them celebrating before the south stand, communion complete.“This was not just another game,” he says later.Maybe it should have been – it is only week four of his 15th season, the 743rd game since he took over with a 0-0 draw at Málaga two days after Christmas 2011 – but Simeone is right. He had needed this, they all had. Three games in, Atlético had not won. Beaten on the opening weekend, they came into Saturday’s match with only two points and go into the weekend 17th, having slipped seven points behind Real Madrid and five behind Barcelona before August is over. It is no quirk of a cruel fixture list either: that’s next. They have played Espanyol, Elche and Alavés. Coming up are six games in 17 days, including Liverpool and Real Madrid, starting with unbeaten Villarreal, who they have only defeated once in five home games.It is, one paper says, a final. Which admittedly they say just about every game, even literal quarter-finals, semi-finals and meaningless group games, but still. Lose and the league has gone, most agree, and it’s not even really that; it’s something deeper. There is, Simeone admits, an “anxiety” about the place, a tension, that goes beyond just the results even while ultimately it is all about that – especially for him. He has started to feel the pressure, ifstartedis the word, weighed down over a managerial spell that is three weeks away from being the longest in Spain’s history, a victim in part of the transformation he brought, a sense of having begun something that might have left him behind.View image in fullscreenDiego Simeone celebrates with his Atlético players on the pitch instead of heading down the tunnel at the final whistle as he usually does.Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty ImagesA victim of something certainly, things not the same as they once were. “When I came I was happy,” Simeone told Cope radio station in an interview five days before Saturday’s game. “I was happy when we won. Today, winning is a relief, you understand? A relief. And I don’t like that. But that’s the responsibility I have.” There was reflection but also, he added, a reality – and right now that’s not what it is supposed to be. Atlético spent €173m on eight players this summer. Only Real Madrid spent more. Add last season’s €188m outlay, and it’s more than €360m in two summers. Over the last five years, the total is above €500m. No one in Spain has spent more. And while the net spend is different – Madrid lead there – that comes with demands, as does being Spain’s best-paid coach.“We have built a team that enables us to dream,” the club’s CEO, Miguel Ángel Gil, insists. Whether that is actually true is debatable: eight came in this summer but eight went out too; Koke and Antoine Griezmann are 33 and 34 now, in theory getting phased out, almost impossible to truly replace; and looking at the arrivals, waiting to see how good Thiago Almada and Álex Baena can be, it’s not so clear that the starting XI is as strong as it was last year, let alone better. Madrid and Barcelona, meanwhile, are still Madrid and Barcelona.And yet it is true that the old underdog discourse, which Simeone says he has dropped now, no longer stands up like it did, that the Robin Hood of football thing doesn’t hold. Simeone’s success provided a platform for the growth of the club, securing 13 top-four finishes in a row at a club that had only two of them in the previous 16 years, but also created a new normal, higher aspirations. Demands are made, although some would argue not forcefully enough. As the coach puts it: “the team was ahead of the club, now the club is ahead of the team ”, and they must catch up.No oneexpectsAtlético to win the league, their two titles truly remarkable achievements, but they are expected to compete for it. It is five years since they won anything, a decade since the Champions League final, longer since they lifted the cup. Last season they won 15 league games in a row, went top … and then fell apart. Some pointed tothatpenalty; plenty pointed to Simeone, insisting that if the club has moved on, the coach has not. Nor is it just about results. There may be no club, Barcelona apart, where thewaythey play occupies people as much as it does about Atlético. Every season it seems there’s talk about how withtheseplayers,thisinvestment, Atlético might evolve only for them to evolve back again, or so it goes. A circular debate on style ensues, ebbing with results but always there and partly based on assumptions that don’t really hold either, the same old cliches and conversations on a loop, the same arguments from the same tribunes and the same trenches.View image in fullscreenNico González runs off to celebrate in front of the crowd after helping to give Atlético Madrid their first league win of the season.Photograph: Diego Souto/Getty ImagesSimeone hears them all, of course. “What is ‘defensive’?” he asked this week; “we like pizza,” as an old line of his runs. This season those conversations came early and Simeone stepped into the midst of it, the fact that he gave an unexpected set-piece interview almost as telling as the things he actually said. “It’s a good time to talk,” he began. “You shouldn’t hide. You. Should. Not. Hide. Let me make that clear.” What followed was a call to arms to the people he says Atlético need,heneeds, and to his players as well. There was a line about not wanting eulogies when he is gone but support when he’s still there. “We’re alive,” he said.He got it too. Villarreal’s visit was projected as a kind of plebiscite, and for all the noise it was only ever going to have one result: on the day set up to celebrate the supporters’ clubs, music and giant paellas outside the Metropolitano, they were on his side. His name was chanted from the start and as he paraded the touchline he was conductor again. On the pitch, his team responded too. Led by Koke and Griezmann – “I get emotional thinking about them; they are living history of Atlético Madrid,” Simeone said – they scored early, through Pablo Barrios. And although that was no guarantee having led in all three previous games, and while Alberto Moleiro had two wonderful chances to draw Villarreal level, this time Atlético did secure the win.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowSevilla 2-2 Elche, Getafe 2-0 Real Oviedo, Real Sociedad 1-2 Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao 0-1 Alaves, Atlético Madrid 2-0 Villarreal, Celta Vigo 1-1 GironaLevante 2-2 Real Betis, Osasuna 2-0 Rayo Vallecano, Barcelona 6-0 ValenciaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nico González had arrived on Monday, Atlético’s eighth signing finally done on deadline day, flown to join the Argentinian national team on Tuesday, not come back until the following Thursday, and was presented on Friday. Now, having trained just twice, he scored the second here, everybody able to breathe again, the roof blown off. “I knew it would be good; but I didn’t expect it to be this good,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s a weight off, but we needed three points,” Barrios admitted. “Stay calm, it’s just the start,” Koke said, which he could say now. “This felt like a referendum, but Simeone will sleep easy now; this win might stop some of the wildly exaggerated conclusions,” wrote former Atlético striker Kiko Narvaez. However absurd they are no one is entirely impervious to it all, the significance shown at the final whistle when Simeone headed off in a different direction to normal, able to let go under the lights and with his people.“I experienced the same relief I have experienced for a long time, borne of the responsibility we feel for the club and the team,” Atlético Madrid’s manager said. “I thought it was a good time to enjoy the tiny little window we get before tomorrow morning at 10am when we’ll be back thinking about Liverpool.”PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid46122Barcelona410103Athletic Bilbao4294Getafe4295Villarreal4576Espanyol3277Alaves4178Elche4269Osasuna41610Real Betis50611Atletico Madrid41512Sevilla40413Rayo Vallecano4-1414Celta Vigo5-2415Valencia4-4416Oviedo4-6317Real Sociedad4-2218Levante4-4119Mallorca3-4120Girona4-91Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballAtlético MadridfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With their club’s very existence under very real threat, most Sheffield Wednesday fans had resigned themselves to relegation at best before a ball was kicked, as long as their owner Dejphon Chansiri refused to sell up. A month on, the presence of their bitter city rivals one place below them at the foot of the table must be a rare source of happiness for Owls fans, in what looks likely to be a long season of unrelenting misery mixed with trepidatious uncertainty. Having lost last season’s Wembley playoff final to a late, late Sunderland winner, the Sheffield United hierarchy elected to end Chris Wilder’s second spell in charge of their club and embark on a new direction. And while “downwards into League One” might not have been the specific one they had in mind, it is certainly the new direction they appear to have taken after losing their first five games by an aggregate score of 12-1.When Scott Parker opined on Sunday that, in defeat by Liverpool, his crestfallen Burnley players “had to go to places that not many humans go to”, he clearly hadn’t factored in the suffering endured by die-hard Blades fans who made the seven-hour round-trip to Portman Road on Friday night. They sawa 5-0 shellackingthat led to Wilder’s replacement, Rubén Sellés, being fired from his role as head coach after just 88 days in charge, bringing what the club’s owners had previously described as “a new chapter for Sheffield United” to an unedifying but inevitable end. In talking up Sellés’s understanding of “the power of potential and how to unlock it” upon his appointment, the club’s USA USA USA-based COH Sports ownership group conveyed the impression they might have listened to one episode of the High Performance Podcast too many, even if there was no hint that things would go so pear-shaped, so quickly for the 42-year-old Spaniard who has achieved much more with much less backing elsewhere.While Sellés’s “ability to integrate academy talent, employ innovative recruitment and analytic strategies, play an exciting brand of football, and adapt dynamically to the modern game” were the tenets COH Sports believed “that the next great chapter of Sheffield United football [would] be built upon”, they are now reported to be in the process of performing a volte-face so extreme all involved may end up with a painful case of whiplash. Having already been fired twice by the club, most recently in May, it seems the man being tasked with writing the next new, hopefully less abrupt chapter for Sheffield United, is a well known local author. Less than three months after being told to clear away his quill, ink-pot and parchment, Wilder has madea sensational return to Bramall Lane. Quite what the 57-year-old, who is famously intolerant of the kind of “do-gooders” and “lefties” who won’t let him criticise his players, will make of his club’s woke attempts to implement artificial intelligence and data-led recruitment remains to be seen but at the very least, he might start playing established stars such as Callum O’Hare and Gus Hamer in their proper positions.QUOTE OF THE DAYAfter the goal, Marcus said ‘well done’, with the eyes of a brother, but he wasn’t laughing. He teases me about headers, and so does Dad, so I’m happy” – Khéphren Thuram enjoyed scoring in Juventus’s madcap 4-3 win over Inter – especially so given that he got one over his big brother, who was also on the scoresheet.

The FISI confirmed on Monday that he did not recover after “cranial trauma” and a subsequent swelling of his brain.“It is a tragedy for the family and for our sport,” the FISI president Flavio Roda said in a statement on Monday. “It is absolutely necessary to do everything possible to ensure that such episodes do not happen again.”“At this sad and painful time, I want to tell all athletes and coaches, in all sports, that the federation is by their side and that they will find all the support they need,” Roda added. “I ask for the utmost respect for Matteo’s family, whom we will stand by for as long as necessary.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

He is the second elite Italian skier to die in a training incident within the past year, afterthe death of junior champion Matilde Lorenziat Val Senales in October 2024.A part of Italy’s World Cup team since 2021, Franzoso was training alongside other Italian skiers including Dominik Paris, Christof Innerhofer and Mattia Casse in Chile. The team are preparing to race on home snow at the Milan-Cortina Olympics in February, but those preparations have now been marked by tragedy.The US skier and Olympic gold medallist Lindsey Vonn posted a black and white picture of Franzoso on Instagram. “This is incredibly sad,” Vonn wrote. “I was skiing this exact slope three weeks ago … RIP Matteo. My sincere condolences to his family and loved ones.”Franzoso made 17 World Cup appearances and finished 28th in the Super-G event at the Olympic host venue, Cortina d’Ampezzo, in 2023 – his best performance at alpine skiing’s highest level.He also won a super-G race on the second-tier Europa Cup circuit in 2021, having finished fourth in the downhill at the world junior championships in 2020.Explore more on these topicsSkiingItalyWinter Olympics 2026EuropeWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "6h ago16.05 EDTTanya AldredAutumn unpacked her suitcase as eight Championship games were called off without a ball bowled due to rain and hazardous high winds. It was only in a small pocket of south London that play was possible, a full day’s worth in the big title battle at The Oval.Division One leaders Surrey, who had a one-point lead over second-placedNottinghamshirecoming into the game, sent their East Midlands visitors in and had bowled them out after tea. It was a disciplined and, at times, fierce display of bowling led by Matt Fisher (five for 61) and Gus Atkinson (four for 41).Atkinson, who is almost sure to play his first Ashes series this winter, was particularly slippy. He made the first breakthrough, sending Haseeb Hameed on his way for nine. The Notts captain was caught in the slips, where he’d been dropped a few overs before. Freddie McCann (34) and Ben Slater (50) then batted fluently until Fisher removed them both after lunch.As the wind continually buffeted the flags on top of the pavilion, and scattered leaves and sticks from the poplar trees around the concourse, Surrey’s relentless bowlers pressed on. A boundary-laden cameo from Joe Clarke (29) and an unbeaten 30 from Brett Hutton apart, the visiting batsmen struggled to assert their authority.Fisher enjoyed his first five-wicket haul for Surrey since he moved fromYorkshirelast winter. “We did what we usually do, hunt like a pack,” he said after play. “I felt like I’ve put in decent areas all season, sometimes I’m lacking that little bit of nip but I had it today.” And on watching his bowling partner: “I’m purring at mid-on watching Gus.” Ben Foakes finished with five catches.As the shadows spread over the ground like a rash, Rory Burns and Dom Sibley did what they do, playing a straight and steady bat. Then from nowhere, Dillon Pennington made one spit off the pitch and Sibley got a lick as it passed by. The batter threw his head back in frustration as he had to trudge back to the pavilion, out for 14 with just nine balls left.The high winds which delayed play around all the grounds (except the Riverside, which was affected purely by rain) did so because of the risks to ground staff and spectators in handling flat covers, including the covers lifting staff off the ground, or blowing loose and hitting the crowd.Share"

Both players are appealing against the sanctions.England still favourites to lift Rugby World Cup, but betting on them is another matter | Robert KitsonRead moreThe pair were cited on Sunday evening and faced disciplinary ­panels on Monday. Berthoumieu was handed a 12-match ban which was reduced from 18, while Feleu was given a three-match suspension which could be reduced to two if she completes the coaching intervention programme. The bans mean they will both miss the rest of the World Cup.Feleu is appealing against the decision as, while she admitted foul play, she did not think it met a citing threshold. Berthoumieu accepts her actions warranted a red card but is appealing against the length of the ban. Both appeals have been provisionally scheduled for Tuesday.

It was 10.09pm, and his final rival for bronze stood at the top of the runway. American Sam Kendricks – then in fourth behind the Australian – had his pole over his shoulder eyeing a clearance that would slide Marschall off the podium.His rival’s success would be to his detriment, but the South Australian did something otherwise unnatural in competitive sport. He raised his arms above his head and clapped, appealing to the crowd to join him and rally support for the American.View image in fullscreenKurtis Marschall of Australia celebrates after coming third in the pole vault.Photograph: Alex Plavevski/EPA“Any other individual sport, you’re all out there trying to go for each other’s throats,” Marschall said afterwards. “But, pole vaulters, we’re all out there basically just trying to be our best.”Seconds later and the bar went tumbling, and Marschall stood with his arms aloft. A cameraman was in his face capturing the moment the Australian won his country’s first medal at the world championships. The 28-year-old had managed to secure the second bronze of his career,repeating his feat from two years ago in Budapest.‘A nobody who became really good’: Gout Gout takes his bow on the world stageRead more“I’m super happy with how I performed and going clean through 90 [clearing 5.90m without a miss], I’ve never done that before,” Marschall said. “To put myself in the mix the whole way, keep the pressure on, keep the foot to the floor, pedal to the metal, that’s the way you’ve got to go about it.”Minutes earlier, Kendricks had made it over the bar at 5.95m to put himself into third behind Marschall. The other competitors were falling away, and the American’s delight was obvious. As the pair passed each other alongside the runway, Kendricks jumped up and down with delight and shared a warm greeting with the Australian. “To have people out there that genuinely have your back, win or lose is so special,” Marschall said. “It’s not like that, I don’t think, in any other sport really, other than team sports.”A memorable evening reached its climax when the other competitors watched on and celebrated Duplantis’ towering clearance of 6.30m – a new world record – and Marschall and silver medallist Emmanouil Karalis joined the Swede on a lap of honour. “This generation of pole vault is outrageous, like it’s ridiculous, but to be a part of it and mixing it with the big boys, I couldn’t be happier,” Marschall said.By that stage the American was already in the tunnel speaking to press, empty-handed after his fourth-placed finish. In this same city four years ago, Kendricks – then one of the favourites for Olympic gold – was forced from competition at the 11th hour due to a positive Covid test. “I didn’t come into this competition trying to medal,” he said. “I came into this competition trying to make better memories about Tokyo.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pair have known each other for years, regulars on the world circuit in an event that forces athletes to spend hours alongside each other every time they compete. On Monday night there they were again, supporting and pushing each other.“I put the pressure on him at 95 [5.95m] and he closed the book on me, and I was so thankful for that,” Kendricks said. “He kept me honest this whole year, it hasn’t been my best year, and Kurtis has been right there with me, encouraging me through defeat and success.”USA’s Olympic 1500m champion Cole Hocker disqualified from world championships for ‘jostling’Read moreAlthough he hadn’t seen Marschall applauding to the crowd before his final attempt, Kendricks wasn’t surprised. “Once you get into this life long enough, you’re realising that maybe I want a friend more than I want a medal,” he said.The Australian’s bronze is a triumph of recovery after his sickening injury last year. A severely dislocated ankle turned into a problematic wound, and he was below his best at Paris. But he has returned to form this year, and entered this meet ranked fourth in the world, behind only Duplantis, Karalis and Kendricks. “This has been my most consistent year, and just to finish it off with this and 5.95m and almost six [metres], perfect,” he said.And although he genuinely wanted success for Kendricks when he applauded him before that decisive attempt, he still felt he had a clearance at 6m – which would have been a personal best – in him. “I feel like that first attempt was so close, probably the closest I’ve ever been, and I back myself to get it either way, even if Sam cleared it.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the 57-year-old’s third spell in charge of his boyhood club – and comes just three months after he was dismissed by the hierarchy. He takes over a team bottom of the Championship after defeats in all five of their league matches.United said in a statement that promotion remained the ambition for the season. The club are nine points off the playoffs and 13 behind the leaders, Middlesbrough, after the5-0 loss at Ipswichon Friday that triggered Sellés’s dismissal.Football Daily | Sheffield United and a volte-face so extreme it could lead to whiplashRead moreIt is thought Wilder has returned empowered after clashing previously with the US ownership, the COH Sports consortium, around its transfer strategy shift. The club’s attempts to implement artificial intelligence-led recruitment have so far backfired.Wilder, who had two stints as a United player, was the manager from 2016 to 2021 and 2023 to 2025. He led the club into the Premier League in 2019, finishing ninth in 2019-20, their first season back in the top flight. They struggled in 2020-21, however, with Wilder departing in March 2021 as the side faced a return to theChampionship. He returned as manager in December 2023 and last season his side accumulated 90 points in the regular league season. But he was shown the exit door once again after defeat by Sunderland in the playoff final, losing 2-1 to a stoppage-time winner.“Following a difficult start to the season, the board felt it necessary to make a change in order to stabilise performances and strengthen our push for promotion,” a club statement said. “While the adoption of a different style of play was pursued with ambition, results have clearly not met expectations.“Chris Wilder returns with proven leadership and an unparalleled understanding ofSheffield United. We are confident he is the right person to restore momentum, unite the squad and supporters, and deliver the results necessary to achieve our objectives this season.“We would like to thank Rubén Sellés for his hard work and professionalism during his time at the club. Responsibility for recent results lies with us as owners, and we remain fully committed to supporting the team and pursuing promotion.”Wilder’s first game back in the dugout will be when Sheffield United host Charlton at Bramall Lane on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsSheffield UnitedChampionshipFootball LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

That season saw former head coach Bruce Arena placed on administrative leave by the organization due to insensitive and offensive remarks, with Arena eventually resigning from his position.Porter’s 2024 squad was largely constructed by Arena and suffered one of the worst seasons in team history, scoring the fewest goals in the league and conceding the second-most. Porter, along with sporting director Curt Onalfo, oversaw a near-total roster reconstruction in the offseason, but results in 2025 have not improved much. Since opening the season with five wins, four losses and one draw in their opening 10 games, the Revs have won just three times in their last 20 games, including a nine-match winless run in June and July that saw them pick up just two points from a possible 27.Across all competitions, New England went 23-13-39 under Porter, who now faces an uncertain future. Once seen as a bright young coaching prospect after winning the 2013MLScoach of the year award, Porter has two MLS Cups to his name – with Portland in 2015 and with Columbus in 2020. However, his teams have endured tough seasons more often than they have succeeded – Porter’s teams have only made the playoffs four times in his 11 seasons as head coach.“I am very grateful to Caleb Porter for the energy, effort, and dedication he has brought to the Revolution over the last two years,” said sporting director Curt Onalfo. “I have the utmost respect for Caleb and all the tireless work he’s invested in the club, and we wish him the best moving forward.”Explore more on these topicsMLSNew England RevolutionUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Unlike other manufacturers, all eligibleAppledevices will be able to download and install the update the moment it is released rather than in a staggered fashion.Which devices can get it?All Apple smartphones from2019’s iPhone 11or newer can install iOS 26. All tablets from the2018 iPad Proor 2019 iPad Air (3rd gen), iPad mini (5th gen) oriPad (8th gen)and newer can install iPadOS 26. All Apple Watches from the2020’s Series 6or newer can install watchOS 26. AllMacBook Airs from 2020, 16in MacBook Pros from 2019, 13in MacBook Pros from 2020, Mac minis from 2020, iMacs from 2020, Mac Studios from 2022 and the 2019 Mac Pro or later can install macOS 26 Tahoe.How do I get it?Open the Settings app on an iPhone or iPad then navigate to General >SoftwareUpdate. Tap install if available to download, verify and then reboot to finish. You can also install the update using a Mac or iTunes on a Windows computer.WatchOS 26 requires an iPhone 11 or later to be runningiOS26 first. Then open the Watch app on the phone and navigate to General > Software Update to begin the installation. You will need to put the smartwatch on its charger to complete the update.Macs are updated in System Settings, navigate to General > Software Update.How much will it cost?The updates are free from Apple. If you are being asked to pay for an update it is a scam.What happened to iOS 19 to 25?Apple has switched to a new year-based naming format for its software. That means iOS 18 and others that were released in September 2024 for the 2024-2025 period are being replaced with iOS 26 et al for 2025-2026. It’s a bit like sports seasons now.Liquid Glass everywhereAll of Apple’s operating systems now sport the same semi-translucent design that looks a little like frosted glass bubbles floating above a flat background, bringing the depth-based interface from theVision Pro headsetto the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac. Icons, notification banners, buttons and menus are more rounded with a sheen to them that reacts to movement, allowing you to partly see through them to your wallpaper, app or content beneath.iOS 26View image in fullscreenThe Liquid Glass look for the home screen and icons is one of the biggest changes for iOS in many years.Composite: AppleThe Liquid Glass redesign has changed the shape and look of the icons and widgets on the home screen. In addition to the reworked standard app icons, you can now turn them all colourless and translucent, tint them with your choice of colour or use a dark version of the original icon.Notifications and other elements now bounce into view from the top of the screen. Widgets display at the bottom of the lockscreen and the clock can dynamically scale in size depending on how many notifications take up the display.Dynamic and hiding buttonsVarious buttons now shrink away when you don’t interact with them. For example, the camera app has been streamlined to hide additional modes behind a slider or big pop-up menus. The address bar and navigation buttons in Safari now condense down to a small button at the bottom of the screen as you scroll. To get to your tabs and controls you need to swipe the address bar button upwards or press the three-dot button.Filter spam more easilyView image in fullscreenImproved spam filtering is now part of the phone and messaging apps.Composite: AppleThe phone app can automatically screen calls from unknown numbers with the iPhone answering and asking for their name and reason for calling before alerting you so you can decide not to pick up. Messages can now screen texts from new senders and detect spam, filtering them out to separate inboxes. The phone app can also wait on hold for you until a customer services agent picks up and is ready to speak to you.The phone app, FaceTime and messages now all have live translation built in too.Games appA new Games app acts as the home for gaming on the iPhone. It contains your games library, highlights what your friends are playing and replaces Game Centre for tracking achievements, competitions and other gaming events.iPadOS 26View image in fullscreeniPadOS 26 marks a huge upgrade for multitasking on the iPad, bringing it more into line with macOS.Composite: AppleThe iPad gets the same visual redesign as the iPhone with clear icons and hiding buttons, but with more dramatic changes to the wayiPadOS 26works thanks to new multitasking capabilities designed for those that use an iPad as a computer replacement.Mac-like menu bar and full windowingView image in fullscreenThe familiar macOS menu bar is now on the iPad.Composite: AppleOne big new addition to theiPadis the menu bar and window management abilities from the Mac. Swipe down from the centre of the top of the screen in an app to reveal its menu bar with all of the various functions, including the familiar settings, file, edit, view, window and help menus from the Mac.It also has Apple’s traditional red, yellow and green three-dot menu for closing, minimising, shrinking or expanding the window. Press and hold the buttons to reveal tiling and moving controls, just like a Mac, or manually resize and move the window to any position you’d like. Swipe up and hold for Exposé, flick an app to the left or right to snap it to the side of the screen, or flick it up to go full screen.You can open multiple windows and have them overlap, tile them side-by-side or just have a mess with the home screen acting like the desktop on a Mac.Preview and Files appThe Files app has been revamped to make it easier to manage documents and files on your iPad, including being able to set the default app for opening particular file types as you would on a computer. Folders such as Downloads or Documents can be added directly to the Dock for easier access.The Mac’s Preview app has been brought to the iPad, which can handle PDFs, images and various other documents, allowing you to view, edit or mark them up with an Apple Pencil.watchOS 26View image in fullscreenWatchOS 26 improves the workout experience and adds most of the new features from iOS 26.Composite: AppleThe glass-like design of the iPhone is even more apparent on theApple Watchwith notification bubbles overlaid on top of the watch face, floating buttons in apps and a softer look to the smart stack of widgets.Workout BuddyApple’s new chatbot for fitness is Workout Buddy, which can talk to you, offering advice and encouragement while exercising similar to an Apple Fitness+ coach. It flags when you’ve hit certain milestones, goals, pace or thresholds during activities, such as a faster last kilometre, and then recaps your workout at the end.

Turn your wrist quickly away from you and back to dismiss notifications, alarms and other alerts. It joins the double-tap gesture as handy ways to clear things or use the watch without touching it.New watch facesView image in fullscreenThere are various new and revamped watch faces to choose from as part of watchOS 26.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThree new watch faces have been added. Flow is a large digital face that uses the Liquid Glass design to change colour and react to movement.

The Ultra-exclusive Waypoint encircles the time with a live compass pointing to various landmarks and points of interest. A revamped Photos face is also available with floating numerals.macOS 26 TahoeView image in fullscreenMacOS 26 Tahoe incorporates the same Liquid Glass design elements.Composite: AppleMacOS gets most of the new features and design changes made to the iPhone and iPad, including more rounded window corners and glass-like effects.Phone appView image in fullscreenThe phone app allows you to make, take and review calls without your phone.Composite: AppleApple has brought the full Phone app to the Mac for making calls through wifi calling and the connected iPhone. It shows recent calls, voicemails, contacts and supports the new call screening and hold assist features from the iPhone.Live activities such as sports scores or delivery apps from the iPhone now appear in the menu bar on the Mac.SpotlightActions have now been integrated into the Spotlight search system, which allows you to send messages and emails, create notes, add reminders and other actions straight from the search bar.

Multibillion-dollar investment deals with some of Silicon Valley’s biggest tech companies are expected to be announced during the US president’s state visit to the UK, which starts on Tuesday.How Google dodged a major breakup – and why OpenAI is to thank for itRead moreKeir Starmer’s governmenthas forecasta 13-fold rise in the amount of computer processing power AI will use by 2035 and is scrambling to supply the datacentres to meet that demand in the hope the technology will boost Britain’s insipid economic productivity. Deals involving Nvidia, the world’s largest AI chip maker, and OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT AI assistant, are anticipated.But campaigners have said a wave of massive new computer warehouses will crank up Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions and put pressure on finitepowerandwater resources.If allowed, the Thurrock complex will include up to four datacentres on “grey belt” land part-occupied by a former speedway and stock car track. It “will lead to a net increase in GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions of 568,727 tonnes CO₂е [carbon dioxide equivalent] per year during the operational phase”,planning documentsexamined by the Guardian show.That amounts to about 500 flights from Heathrow to Málaga every week, according to the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization’scarbon calculator. Google’s planning application stresses this remains a “minor adverse and not significant impact when compared to the UK carbon budgets”, but campaigners disagree.“Google’s planned facility in Essex will produce carbon emissions several times higher than those of an international airport,” said a spokesperson for Foxglove, a campaign group for fairer technology. “But this is just one of many ‘hyperscale’ datacentres that US big tech wants to impose on the UK – in pursuit of their own profits and regardless of the cost to our environment.“Starmer’s government needs to stop bowing to the Trump-big tech agenda and start standing up for the interests of the UK public – otherwise we will all be paying for the tech giants’ datacentres, whether in terms of soaring energy bills, dwindling water supplies or a heating planet.”Datacentres nowconsume about 2.5% of the UK’s electricity, and demand on the grid is expectedto increase fourfold by 2030, according to the House of Commons library.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rather it is worried that without massive investment in new datacentres, the UK will fall behind international rivals, including France, resulting in a “compute gap” that “risks undermining national security, economic growth, and the UK’s ambition to lead in AI”, according to a July research paper from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.Other important datacentre projects include a £10bn scheme on the site of a former coal-fired power station near Blyth in Northumberland that was granted planning permission in March. It is poised to be at the heart of a UK-US deal involving Nvidia and OpenAI. It was also reported at the weekend that Google is in early-stage talks about building a mammoth datacentre on Teesside.Bain & Company, a global business consultancy, said on Monday that AI and datacentres could account for 2% of global emissions and 17% of industrial emissions by 2035, with the impact highest in countries where fossil fuels still dominate power generation.Google declined to comment on its planning application for the Thurrock site. On Teesside, it said: “We do not comment on rumours or speculation.”Explore more on these topicsGoogleAlphabetTechnology sectorGreenhouse gas emissionsEnergy industryPlanning policyArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That makes it a contender for the top smaller phone with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro, offering the best of Google’s hardware without an enormous screen. It is also the cheapest of threePixel10 Pro phones starting at £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699) sitting below the bigger 10 Pro XL and the tablet-phone hybrid the 10 Pro Fold.The 10 Pro looks almost identical tolast year’s versionand has the same size 6.3in OLED screenas the Pixel 10but slightly brighter, slicker and crisper. It is one of the best displays on a phone, while the polished aluminium sides and mat glass back look expensive even if the colour choice is rather staid compared with its cheaper sibling.View image in fullscreenQi2 support makes the Pixel compatible with magnetic chargers, such as the Anker 5K MagGo Slim that attaches to the back of the phone.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 10 Pro is one of the first phones to come with Qi2 wireless charging built into the back, which offers compatibility with a range of magnetic accessories, including those made for Apple’s MagSafe.Google Pixel 10 review: the new benchmark for a standard flagship phoneRead moreInside is Google’s latest Tensor G5 chip, which is about 35% faster than last year’s model but falls short of the best-in-class performance of Qualcomm’s top Android chipused in rivals. Day to day the 10 Pro feels rapid, and it handled games just fine, though there are better options for those who want the absolute best graphics and frame rates.The Pixel has solid battery life, managing up to about two days between charges with about seven hours of active screen use on a mix of 5G and wifi. Most people will need to charge it every other day, but on heavy use days out and about in London on 5G it still managed to reach midnight with at least 25% left.View image in fullscreenThe Pixel 10 Pro takes 90 minutes to fully charge using a 30W or greater power adaptor (not included), hitting 52% in just over half an hour.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsScreen:6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi)Processor:Google Tensor G5RAM:16GBStorage:128, 256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:Android 16Camera:50MP + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x tele; 42MP selfieConnectivity:5G, nano + e-sim (US: e-sim-only), wifi 7, UWB, NFC, Bluetooth 6 and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions:152.8 x 72.0 x 8.6mmWeight:207gAndroid 16 with AI everywhereView image in fullscreenGoogle’s take on Android is colourful, fairly simple and easy to use with a reasonable amount of customisation.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe phone ships with Android 16 installed, with security and software updatesuntil August 2032, ensuring it stays up to date for the life of the phone. It is the same software as theregular Pixel 10with a bold, colourful and fun design.Google has shoved AI in almost every corner of the phone, most of it powered by the latest local Gemini Nano models, which means your data doesn’t have to leave your device to be processed, preserving privacy.The advancedGemini chatbotis capable of interacting with your apps, seeing what is on your screen or through your camera, and having live back-and forth-conversations via voice.View image in fullscreenMagic Cue provides quick access to contextual information from the data stored on your phone across a number of Google and third-party apps.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBut the standout new feature isMagic Cue, which runs in the background and combines information from your Google account with data on your phone to offer help or quick suggestions in a number of Google apps. For instance, when you ring a business, Magic Cue pops up a card directly in the phone app showing your emails with your order confirmation details for one-tap access when you need them.Magic Cue works locally with about 10 days’ worth of data so it is not keeping a permanent log of everything you do, but has been genuinely useful in testing. It only works in Google’s and a select number of third-party apps, such as eBay, but not WhatsApp, so its utility is limited if you don’t use the right apps.The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription toGoogle AI Pro, which usually costs £19 a month, and provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image and video-generating models, plus 2TB of cloud storage for Google Drive, Photos and Gmail.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app is simple to use with plenty of modes to make the best of your photography, including manual controls.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 10 Pro has some of the most powerful cameras on a smartphone with a 42-megapixel selfie, 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera capable of an optical zoom quality up to 10x. But it is also the first to feature generative AI image processing directly in the camera, which is impressive but calls into question what a photo really is.The main camera is one of the best in the business, effortlessly capturing great photos that are rich in detail across a range of lighting conditions. The ultrawide camera is also very good for landscapes and group shots, and is used for the great macrophotography mode for fun closeups. The 5x telephoto is one of the very best on a phone and can shoot photos at 10x, which remain good quality, particularly in bright conditions.Google excels in difficult lighting conditions such as very bright or contrasting scenes, while in dark environments its night sight produces sharper images with more accurate colours than rivals. The Pixel’s portrait mode is greatly improved this year, too.View image in fullscreenPro Res Zoom above 30x uses a local generative AI model to recreate the detail lost by digital zoom, saving both pre- and post-processed images for you to choose from.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianZoom beyond 30x up to 100x and the phone uses a local genAI model to put back into the photo the detail and sharpness lost from digital zoom. Generally it works well but not flawlessly. It can get the perspective wrong or superimposes the wrong details, creating images that are clearly made by AI. But shoot predictable subjects such as buildings, cars or trees, and it firms up the digitally stretched details making the 100x zoom surprisingly usable.When it detects a person it does not even attempt to use the genAI model, which is probably for the best, and like all genAI systems it can struggle with words, often producing something that looks like an alien script.The camera app addsC2PA content credentialsto all photos that records how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved, including for the new zoom and popular Add Me feature from last year. Best Take has been made automatic, allowing the camera to capture multiple images when you press the shutter button to try to get one where everyone’s looking at the camera.The 10 Pro also has the same new AI Camera Coach feature as the regular 10, which teaches you how to get a better shot by analysing the scene through the camera and giving you options for different angles and framing.The camera also has plenty of fun photography and video modes, shoots great films as well as photo, and cements the 10 Pro as one of the very best on the market.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe front and back of the Pixel are covered in scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus 2.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe batterywill last in excessof 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repair,with manualsandparts available.The Pixel 10 Pro contains 30% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down thephone’s environmental impactin its report and willrecycle old devicesfor free.PriceThe Google Pixel 10 Pro costs from£999(€1,099/$999/A$1,699) in a choice of four colours.For comparison, thePixel 10starts at£799, the Pixel 10 Pro XL at£1,199, thePixel 9acosts£399, theSamsung Galaxy S25costs£799, theGalaxy S25 Ultracosts£1,249and theiPhone 16 Procosts£999.VerdictThe Pixel 10 Pro doesn’t reinvent the wheel or set a new bar in quite the same way as the base-modelPixel 10 managed this year. But it still upgrades its already market-leading camera and AI features.It is snappy in operation, has decent battery life and still looks good, though hardcore gamers may want to look elsewhere for more powerful graphics. Google’s take on Android is one of the best and comes with long-term support so you can keep using it for years.Gemini’s various new tools are generally useful and less gimmicky than many. Magic Cue has great potential to be a time-saver without getting in the way, but needs to be expanded to more apps.Injecting genAI directly into the camera app improves its extended zoom images, but further blurs the line between what is and isn’t a photo – a philosophical debate most will probably gloss over because the tool is useful and avoids doing anything outlandish.The Pixel 10 Pro is easily one of the best smaller phones available and really hammers home just how much more advanced Google’s AI tools are than Apple’s and other rivals.Pros:seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x and 10x optical magnification plus AI zoom, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, solid battery life, great screen and size, fast fingerprint and face recognition, 12 months of Google AI Pro included.Cons:quite expensive, face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical sim card slot in the US, not a big upgrade from the standard Pixel 10.Explore more on these topicsPixelGoogleAlphabetSmartphonesMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

This wasn’t even what you could charitably call “fashionably late”, given theformat was already on its last legs, but I loved it, and because nobody else was interested, blank discs were dirt cheap. I have a vague recollection of grabbing packs at Poundland, allowing me to create a glorious self-curated library of cheap music, five years before the birth of Spotify.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’m reminded of this because this week I’ve published a piece on the Filter about the portable audio technology that killed them:MP3 players. Or digital audio players, to give them their more accurate name, given MP3 playback is just one of many supported file formats.For some time, I’ve had a nagging feeling that music streaming wasn’t cutting it. Yes, having all the world’s music at your fingertips is a technological marvel, but you have to deal with “kid in a sweetshop” choice paralysis – and even more importantly, it’s notyourmusic.Rage against the algorithmWhile collecting modern players for the piece, I was delighted to find I wasn’t alone in experiencing this disconnect from the modern streaming world. Chris Laidler, office manager atAdvanced MP3 Players, gave me an insight into the kinds of people who reject streaming modernity. My kind of people.When he started in 2017, the customer base was primarily the niche audiophile community, “pursuing high-res audio as a hobby”, he says. People who “talk more about the tech than they do about the music”.But since Covid, these buyers have been joined by a new, more casual customer. For some, there’s an element of nostalgia, but there are more logical reasons, too.“It gets them off an algorithm,” Laidler says. “It’s music they’re seeking out themselves. But it also means they have a device that can store music that they actually own, rather than leasing it from Spotify.”And for audiophiles, smartphone audio just doesn’t cut it. “When you think about it, if your phone’s about that size,” Laidler says, gesturing with his hands, “it means that the DAC [digital-to-analogue converter] that’s in there is only going to be one tiny component of this thing.” Whereas, with dedicated MP3 players, “the entire infrastructure is designed for as accurate music recreation as possible.” And yes, that means wired audio ports as standard.Take that, Apple!Some people will balk at the price of entry, even if they like the idea in principle. For the purposes of the piece, I capped the eligible price at £650, although the technology can go into the thousands. Don’t worry too much, though. Not only is my budget pick, the excellentSnowsky Echo Mini, from an astonishing £66.99, but after a certain price point, it becomes more about chasing a specific sound signature than any noticeable increase in quality.The tyranny of choiceIronically, there are so many devices that trying to choose one can echo the paralysis you feel when opening Spotify. “At the audio trade shows, people come in with their little notebooks, and they go around each room making notes about the character of each player and the price,” Laidler says. “But then you see these same people come back the next year, and you ask them, ‘Oh, which one did you end up going for?’ and they’re still deciding.”Should you buy an old MP3 player? Probably not, due to limited storage, weak file-format compatibility and the lack of warranty. “As a nostalgic thing, I think they’re great,” Laidler says, recalling his first one: a “hideous-looking thing” built in to headphones that wrapped around your head.“I like when people bring out these old players and show them off to me when I’m doing trade shows and meetings. We still have an iPod Classic rattling around in the office because we just can’t bring ourselves to part with it. We should really start a museum or something.”This week’s picksThe best beauty Advent calendars in 2025, tested (yes, we know it’s early!)The finishing touch: great buys for under £100 to lift your living space, chosen by interiors experts‘It’s better than plastic and cheaper’: 20 sustainable swaps that worked (and saved you money)How to get your garden ready for autumn: 17 expert tips you can do now – and what to skip‘The crunch?

It was an underground hobby that could never trouble Tinseltown’s accountants. And yet here we are in 2025, withthe news in the Hollywood Reporterthat Legendary Pictures has just paid at least $3m – (£2.2m) – an unprecedented amount – for the screen rights to a forthcoming novel called Alchemised that began life as an unauthorised and kinky Harry Potter spin-off.The backstory behindAlchemised, by SenLinYu, sounds pretty freaky. SenLinYu’s original book, titled Manacled, inhabited a strange sub-niche of Potterverse named “Dramione” in which Hermione Granger finds herself regularly involved in unlikely and transgressive romantic encounters with Draco Malfoy. Now stripped of all reference to Hogwarts, butterbeer and Nimbus 2000s, and with renamed characters, Alchemised will hit shelves and online bookstores later this month as the dark fantasy tale of a young woman with memory problems who finds herself at the mercy of a powerful and cruel necromancer.As well as Alchemised,The Love Hypothesis is heading to cinemas, with Lili Reinhart as a PhD candidate who falls for professor Tom Bateman. If you thought Hermione and Draco were strange bedfellows, this one is based on a subgenre of Star Wars fanfic known as Reylo, which focuses on the forbidden love between Rey and Kylo Ren.This is not the first time Hollywood has plumbed the depths of fanfic for its next big thing, and there currently looks like no let-up. Where once studios might have relied on pulp novels, classic plays or New Yorker-approved short stories to fill the multiplexes, producers are increasingly turning to Tumblr and Archive of Our Own (AO3). In 2019, Sony Pictures Television signed a first-look deal with Wattpad, the online clearing house that has become a farm system for aspiring authors, to develop scripted series and films from the site’s most popular stories. Wattpad was also the source forthe After series, which started out as a cheeky riff on One Direction’s Harry Styles, and miraculously led to five films (some straight-to-streaming) between 2019 and 2023, with more on the way.Then of course there’sFifty Shades of Grey, which began life as Twilight fanfic but ended up as a trilogy of films that despite being almost universally rubbished by critics somehow made more than $1.3bn at the global box office. Its success showed studios that provenance didn’t matter: a story could start out as Edward and Bella with the serial numbers filed off, and still become a billion-dollar franchise.What exactly is the attraction for Hollywood here? The logical answer is that, in a twisted sort of way, all these projects benefit from a kind of brand recognition by proxy. Given the choice,Harry Potterfans would probably prefer to see the real Hermione and Draco enjoying a bout of magically enhanced heavy petting on screen than a reimagined take that wipes away all the wizarding world stuff. But readers of the “original” on AO3 have themselves been part of this strange journey from slash fiction to multiplex, often along with millions of others, and that brings a sense of ownership that studios value hugely.From a corporate vantage point, all that pre-existing fervour is catnip. Such huge online readerships provide proof of concept without the bother of focus groups or test screenings; it arrives trailing a ready-made, highly motivated community. In a climate where genuinely original scripts are treated like financial landmines, that sort of data means these films look less like a gamble and more like a franchise incubator, one that’s already warmed and fed by the fandom itself.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekHarry Potter (Film)Fifty Shades of Grey (Film)Fifty Shades of Grey (Books)Harry Potter (Books)Star WarsTumblrfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Plenty of conspiracy theories, some of which have never been put to rest, were floated and debated. But the difference between what happened then and what we are seeing now is that, in the aftermath of those violent deaths, there was a sense of shared grief, of national mourning. Those tragedies seemed to bring us, as a country, closer together in our shock and sorrow.Obviously, tha is quite unlike what is occurring today, when the president has publicly declared that he “couldn’t care less” about healing the divisions plaguing and weakening our society. The instinctive and widespread response to Kirk’s death has been to demonize and blame a perceived enemy.Donald Trump, Stephen Miller and their minions were quick to accuse the “lunatic radical left”.Charlie Kirk’s killing was a tragedy. But we must not rewrite his life | Moira DoneganRead moreDespite the emerging evidence, they seem unwilling to amend their version of what happened. I will admit that, on hearing the news, my first thought was that the Maga movement had orchestrated the killing to distract us from the Epstein files, or that this was the modern-day equivalent of the 1933 Reichstag fire, which occurred when the German parliament building was torched, and the National Socialists blamed the communists, and used the event as a pretext for suspending civil liberties and installing an authoritarian regime.The motives of the suspected killer,Tyler Robinson, are still unclear. But it appears that both the right and the left both had it wrong to some degree. Robinson was a studious young man from a solidly Republican, Mormon family, used anti-fascist slogans and apparently disliked Kirk for his hateful views.Regardless of what we thought of Kirk, it is profoundly and dangerously immoral to sanction political violence, regardless of its object. It is unseemly to celebrate the shooting of a human being with a wife and children – even a man whose rhetoric we may have despised.In another country, in another era, the death of Kirk might have served to remind us of the essential importance of free speech, of the concept that even the most polarizing figures should be able to speak publicly without fear of violent retribution. In drafting the first amendment, the founding fathers affirmed the idea that even racists, misogynists and anti-immigrant bigots have the right to express their beliefs and to engage in a free and fair debate with those who hold very different views. In fact, it’s the essence of democracy, the cornerstone on which our nation was founded and that every patriot (however that word is construed now) should affirm.Instead, Kirk’s death has been weaponized as a pretext to further undermine first amendment protections, to circle the wagons around the worst aspects of censorship and blind obedience to authority. It is being employed to foster the fear of saying anything that runs contrary to what those in power believe and allow us to express. Already, teachers, soldiers,government officials, firefighters and reporters – most prominently, MSNBC news analystMatthew Dowd– have beencensured or lost their jobsafter saying in public or on social media thatKirk’s rhetoricwas a form of not-so-thinly-disguised hate speech.Charlie Kirk’s death is a tragic marker of the indiscriminate nature of political violence | Margaret SullivanRead moreThere has been somepushback, among the public and on the floor of Congress, against the directive that prayers should be said and flags lowered to half mast in Kirk’s memory. Personally, I’m fine with the idea of prayers and lowered flags, except that I think that these gestures of mourning, honor and respect are being deployed too selectively.The flags should have been lowered for, among others, another recent victim of political violence:Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, who was murdered, along with her husband, Mark, in June. Prayers should be said for theColorado high school students woundedin one of the latest school shootings, on the very same day as Charlie Kirk’s murder. Flags should be lowered and prayers said for every victim lost to senselessgun violence, until we are tired of all the praying and flag-lowering, until we decide, as a nation, to take action to prevent these tragic deaths.My great fear is that we are nearing the day when, if we are being honest, the flag should be lowered in memory of our fragile, flawed, precious democracy. In that case, we may have to wait a while to see it flying proudly and at full mast, once again.Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and SciencesExplore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingOpinionUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS crimeGun crimecommentShareReuse this content"

But as masculinity researchers, we see her work differently. It’s a cultural marker of a wider phenomenon: young women’s increasing withdrawal from dating andcommitted relationships.Carpenter bottles the palpable exasperation of young women’s experiences with emotionally unprepared partners. And her feelings show up in the data. Women are more likely than men to saydating is harder than it was 10 years agoand they are twice as likely to cite physical and emotional risk as the reason why. Thedisproportionate emotional laborplaced on women in relationships, paired withrising economic insecurity, does not compute.If Taylor Swift’s pop ballads embodied millennial aspirations of love, then Sabrina Carpenter, for gen Z, instead captures the sense that healthy relationships are out of reach. In her song Nobody’s Son, Carpenter sings: “There’s nobody’s son / Not anyone left for me to believe in,”a growing sentiment we have found in our research.Gen Z is undoubtedly divergingby gender, as 62% of single women report they arenot looking to date at all, compared with 37% of men. And the gen Z women whoaredating areincreasingly choosing older men. This has wide-ranging implications, from political futures to fertility rates.The manosphere’s narrative has spread, blamingmale lonelinesson women while ignoring thedecline in male friendships, or the communal spaces lost to austerity measures. In reality, it is often young women on the receiving end of the loneliness crisis. Carpenter captures this in the title Man’s Best Friend:the feeling of dating men who release long-bottled emotions in romantic relationships rather than friendships. This undue pressure has led to fewer young women willing to enter relationships, a trend amplified as both genders are told to turn away from each other online.Why fear the tote bag-wielding, matcha-drinking ‘performative male’? At least he makes an effort | Rachel ConnollyRead moreIn Tears, Carpenter highlights this shift in young men’s respect for women: “A little respect for women will get you very, very far / Offering to do anything, I’m like (Oh my god!).” This low bar reflects a broader trend among gen Z men, who increasingly adhere to restrictive masculine norms and push back against gender equality. As of 2023,55% of menfeel entitled to knowing their partner’s whereabouts, 42% believe they should always have the final say in relationships and men aged 18-23 are theleast likelyto agree with the statement that “feminism has made America a better place”.As the market for digital intimacy balloons, the concerns raised in Man’s Best Friend show no clear path toward resolution. Instead, emerging technologies purporting to solve this “loneliness crisis” exploit a gendered gap – tapping into male insecurities, emotional suppression and the stigma around seeking help. AI girlfriend platforms such as Candy.ai and Kindroid are exploding in popularity. Nor is it just men, as72% of teens report using AI “companions”. Instead of offering real support, they paywall intimacy and hyper-sexualized “connection.”. Socialized to avoid vulnerability, boys are being funneled into digital relationships where emotional connection costs money and care is reduced to a buyable commodity. These platforms profit from keeping men emotionally isolated.In an online ecosystem where men’s outrage fuels engagement, Carpenter’s album art – showing her on all fours as a man pulls her by the hair – ignited a sensationalist stir, condemned by critics as“soft porn for the male gaze”. But was Carpenter pandering to or provoking the manosphere? When the album dropped, her lyrics confirmed what fans familiar with her discography could have guessed all along: a sharp, hyperaware take on gender power dynamics. Through irony and provocation, she makes clear that she controls the narrative, rather than being consumed by it.Carpenter is not the only pop star expressing the exasperation of gen Z women. The meteoric rise of stars like Olivia Rodrigo and Carpenter ask us to question: so whose problemisthis? Carpenter gives us an answer in the song Manchild: “I choose to blame your mom.” Knowing that he is not her responsibility, she sums up the problem with ourcurrent momentof “masculinity crisis”: its blame and solutions continually land on women.It leaves us asking: how can young people move through this exasperation to form healthy relationships, when we aren’t directly talking to each other? Despondency about dating isn’t new – but the prevailing belief had been that persistence would eventually lead to partnership. But as the gender divide continues to widen, whatwillthe future of relationships, and thus the fabric of our society, look like? How can women voice frustration over the emotional labor that jeopardizes future relationships without getting stuck in resentment? And if young men do become more emotionally available, will we even recognize it when it happens?Caroline Hayes is a researcher and narrative strategist, specializing in the intersection of tech, culture and gender; Carolina Hidalgo-McCabe is an organizer, researcher and the host of The Masking Tapes, a podcast that explores 21st century masculinity and the gender divide; Alice Lassman is a policy expert, with her forthcoming book exploring how AI’s influence on gender and emotions are reshaping economic life.Explore more on these topicsSabrina CarpenterOpinionGenderRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

This didn’t have to happenDavid DaleyA handful of party figures warned about the power of redistricting. Too many leaders ignored themMon 15 Sep 2025 06.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 11.21 EDTShareThere are many reasons whyDemocratsfind themselves on the wrong end of a gerrymandering armageddon.There’s John Roberts and the US supreme court, who pretended partisan gerrymandering is just politics as usual, left voters naked to extreme power grabs, and failed the nation when voters most needed the courts’ protection.That 5-4 decision in 2019 would have been different if not for Mitch McConnell, who prevented Democrats from filling an open seat on the court in 2016, and preserved it for the Republican party and Neil Gorsuch.But perhaps the most important reason is the brilliant 2010 Republican strategy called Redmap – short for the Redistricting Majority Project – which leftRepublicansin charge of drawing lines for four times as many congressional seats as Democrats, and close to 70% of state legislatures nationwide.Just a few years earlier, jubilant Democrats had celebrated Barack Obama’s 2008 victory and dreamed that America’s changing demographics would lead to a decade of triumphs and a new permanent majority. It did not work out that way – because they fell asleep on redistricting.The following election, Republicans captured the approximately 110 state legislative districts they needed to dominate congressional redistricting. They held the House in 2012 despite winning 1.4 million fewer votes than Democrats, and haven’t looked back since. Democrats are still trying to catch up – and now, even as the party insists it’s going to fight back against Republican gerrymandering, remain hamstrung by snoozing more than a dozen years ago.How could a party with such a genuine demographic edge get out-organized, out-strategized and out-energized in election after election? How could no one have seen the looming redistricting nightmare? How did they do nothing about this when they controlled a trifecta in Washington with a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate?Turns out some people did issue warnings. When I wrote my book Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn’t Count, the definitive history of how Republicans gerrymandered the nation, I went in search of the wise men and would-be Paul Reveres, the people who knew all about the importance of redistricting, but whose shouts vanished into a black hole of complacency, overconfidence and unimaginative thinking.Had Democratic leadership listened to Steve Israel, John Tanner and Martin Frost then, all of this could have been avoided.After the Republican rout of 2010, Israel, a New York congressman then in his sixth term representing suburban Long Island, took over as chairman of the Democratic congressional campaign committee. If Washington is a city filled with unpleasant jobs, Israel stepped into one of the most hopeless. The DCCC chair serves a two-year sentence as a party road warrior, raising money, barnstorming chicken dinners and county barbecues, and most importantly, trying to recruit congressional candidates who might actually be able to flip a district. A successful term pole-vaults a politician into leadership. But swing districts are few – and few ambitious mayors or state senators want to sacrifice careers and endure those barbecues themselves only to lose an unwinnable race. So the chairman bounces from one Hampton Inn to the next, marshalling every drop of persuasion.Israel spent four years doing this. His second marriage collapsed. The late nights, the loneliness, the flight delays all seemed so unbearable that the only relief came from writing a novel on his iPhone that was a vicious satire of Washington ridiculousness.You can imagine why all that travel might have seemed worth it. The 2010 spanking meant that basic competence would look good by comparison. Also, 2012 brought a presidential cycle, and Democrats actually turn out to vote in presidential years. Sometimes that enthusiasm even trickles down-ballot and helps elect Democrats to Congress. But that was before it became clear how the Republicans had used gerrymandering to push their 2010 advantage into a durable and lasting majority. As he studied the new districts and criss-crossed the country, Israel may have been the first national Democrat to realize how ratfucked his party was – and how long it would last.“What shocked me when I first came into the DCCC was when I learned that the expansive battlefield that I thought I would have at my discretion was actually a pretty small map,” Israel told me. “There are a couple dozen competitive districts, maybe … You can have the best recruit, the best candidate, the best fundraising. But if you have an uncompetitive district, there’s no path.“I mean, the math proves it,” he says, and you hear the anguish of every night at a chair hotel bar with a burger and a bad Syrah. “Look, we won 1.4 million more votes than they did in 2012 and we only picked up eight seats. That tells you that this whole thing was jury-rigged in order to stop Democrats from playing in competitive districts. It worked brilliantly for them. I’m just sorry we didn’t figure that out in 2008.”As Israel sees it, that’s the year when Democrats really screwed up. He thinks the party should have been thinking ahead then to redistricting and down-ballot races. Instead, they planned for nothing. Redistricting, he says, never seemed to cross the mind of Democratic leadership. It was, he says, “a catastrophic strategic mistake”. In 2006 and 2008, Democrats “won districts that we had no business winning. But then we started losing state legislatures and governors across America – and that’s what destroyed us in 2010 and 2012. Had we devoted resources to protecting Democrats in state houses across America, the Republicans still would have won the majority in 2010. But we would have had a seat at the table in redistricting and we might have been able to take it away from them in 2012.“The DNC,” he says, shaking his head, “they just whistled past the graveyard. I don’t understand why.”Republicans, he says, “have always been better than Democrats at playing the long game. And they played the long game in two fundamental ways. Number one, on the judicial side. They realized they had to stock courts across the country with partisan Republican judges and they did it. The second long game was on redistricting. The center of gravity wasn’t an immediate majority in the House. It was rebuilding the infrastructure in courts and state houses across the country so when they got the majority back they could stay in it for a long, long time.”Israel walks me to his office door. “I’ll tell you one thing,” he says. “This wouldn’t have happened if Martin Frost was still here.”Frost, a Texas Democrat who served from 1979 until 2005, and Tanner, a Tennessee Democrat who held office from 1989 until 2011, were the two Democrats in previous Congresses who really understood the long-term ramifications of redistricting and agitated, usually alone, for action. Both are long gone from the Capitol, but when I hunted them down for my book I found them where I half expected: steps from K Street, along the Washington DC legal and lobbying corridor where former pols cash in on years of connections and experience.Tanner, then the vice-chair of Prime Policy Group, had a cushy corner office with a putting green, a cushy landing for an 11-term Democrat from Tennessee. Exhausted by partisanship, and well aware that even his reputation for bipartisanship would not save him when Tennessee Republicans redrew congressional lines after 2010, Tanner chose not to seek re-election. And so Republican gerrymandering claimed one Democrat who had repeatedly tilted at a then lonely windmill: redistricting.As his fellow moderateBlue Dog Democratsdisappeared, white southern Democrats went extinct, and congressional partisanship began to harden, Tanner was moved to take action. In three successive Congresses, under both Democratic and Republican control, he tried to put a stop to partisan gerrymandering. He proposed national standards that removed the power to draw distinct lines from state legislatures and handed it to commissions. His plan also prohibited redrawing lines more than once in a decade, which would have prevented the gerrymandering armageddon now under way. This was not an issue that made the otherwise garrulous Tanner a lot of friends. Neither Democrats nor Republicans wanted anything to do with it.“Here?” Tanner says of Washington. He pushes at a cup of coffee. “Ha! They’re drawing their own districts. I had many members come up to me and say, ‘What are you doing?’ They have deals. ‘Don’t come around here fucking with the maps. I won’t fool with your map if you don’t fool with mine.’”Tanner first introduced his plan in 2005, when Republicans ran the House. Tanner knew it would be an uphill battle, and indeed, his bill never earned as much as a committee hearing. When Democrats took back the chamber after the 2006 election, he thought he might convince his leadership to listen. He flagged down the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the majority leader, Steny Hoyer, who ignored him and wriggled free.“I told them, if you don’t do this, all the population growth is under Republican control. The only stronghold left for Democrats is cities … They didn’t want anything to do with it.”Tanner remembers Pelosi saying: “We’ll take a look at it.” But he couldn’t get a hearing on his bill in 2007 or 2009 either. Partisan warriors, he suggested, never really want to reform the process. They might fight to take away the other side’s advantage, but never, ever do they want to risk their own.Might Democratic elders regret ignoring him now, as leaders of a permanent minority? Tanner snorts again. “It’s just not something anyone wants to take up. I went through (redistricting) three times. There’s a lot of power connected to that system.”Tanner says that far more than 300 seats are responsive only to the most partisan elements.“We can’t even do the small problems now, let alone the big ones,” he says. “These guys are trapped in this system where the only threat is from their base in a primary … No one will do what they all know has to be done to keep the country from going adrift. Is that because of redistricting? Hell, yes.”Tanner speaks with appealingly frank disgust for a man whose living was long based on his relationships with these same pols. “Democracy? The people’s will? It doesn’t matter,” he says. “That’s redistricting, too. The average citizen is a pawn. Without the protection of a fairly drawn district, the citizen is a pawn of billionaires who use the map of the country as a checkerboard to play politics on.”Hidden behind owlish glasses, Frost doesn’t look the part of an aggressive warrior, but he is the last hardened Democratic street fighter to serve in the House. When we spoke, he escorted me into a conference room with a well-appointed cookie tray and explained how he had learned the importance of redistricting after Texas gained three seats in Congress after the 1990 census.In the 1990s and 2000s, Frost watched asRepublicans sought mapsthat packed as many voters of color as possible into one district – knowing that doing so would create whiter and more Republican seats in the surrounding areas. Sometimes they even worked together with Black Democrats.Frost represented the Dallas-Fort Worth area and it became clear that one of these new seats would be a majority Black district, which had the potential to cut into his base. Frost wanted to stay in Congress, and wanted white and Black Democrats to work together to create districts that would benefit both. As he wrote in his book The Partisan Divide: “The survival of white Southern Democrats would be determined by how many Black voters were left over for their districts after the new majority Black seats were created.“So I started asking the question, ‘Who is doing redistricting for the Democratic party? I wanted to talk to that person. I was stunned by the answer. No one.”Texas by the 1980s was trending red, but Democrats still controlled the legislature and the governor’s office, and therefore redistricting. They came up with a plan that added three new districts whose voters were largely people of color without dismantling the bases of the white incumbents. Frost calls it “a classic example of what could be done when all members of a state Democratic delegation work together for the common good.” Texas Democrats extended their advantage in the US House from 19-8 to 21-9. The Frost gerrymander held until Republicans took the state house in 2002, and the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, pushed the legislature into a mid-decade redistricting plan, much as is happening now.The problem for Democrats is that despite these repeated lessons in the importance of line-drawing, no one continued Frost’s work after the DeLay map knocked him out of Congress. “For a while, we fought them to a standstill because we had good legal talent and technical help. Then we just got overcome on the political side.”How is this possible? I ask. “I’m not the right one to ask that question to,” he demurs, but says he thinks about it all the time. He has concluded that the party’s coastal and white leadership simply doesn’t understand what it’s like to run for office as a Democrat outside of Pelosi’s San Francisco. “Leaders in the Democratic party come from safe, white districts. So they don’t worry about these things, because nothing can be done to them. You can’t do anything to Nancy Pelosi’s district.“White northern leaders don’t think of this the same way that white southern politicians think about it. We instinctively understand the problem, but white liberals didn’t really focus on this very much. They said, ‘Well, everything’s fine. We’ll just continue what we’re doing’ and didn’t make this a priority. I argued for 20 or 30 years about the importance of paying attention to state legislatures, but I couldn’t get enough people in the party to really embrace that. The Republicans understood that and had a strategy. We didn’t.”Frost even became chairman of the DCCC after the 1994 Newt Gingrich rout, but, like Israel later, could never convince anyone else in power to take redistricting seriously. I tell him what Israel said, that this wouldn’t have happened had anyone listened to Frost, and he gives a quick nod that suggests he agrees.“No one else in the party cared about this or understood how important it was, for whatever reason.” The Republicans not only got it, but knocked out the one Democrat who did too. “Maybe I wouldn’t have been able to change history, but we sure as hell would have gone down fighting.“It didn’t have to be. If the Democrats had put the same type of emphasis on redistricting that the Republicans did, there might have been a different outcome. Could have been. Should have been. We’ll never know.”David Daleyis the author of Antidemocratic: Inside the Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections as well as Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn’t CountExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionRepublicansDemocratsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Last week, afterIsrael’s strike against Hamas leadersin Doha – a colossal violation of the sovereignty of a country that is not only a close ally of the US, but an anchor of Gaza peace talks – Gulf leaders sprang to show solidarity. The president of the United Arab Emirates, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan,arrived on an unscheduled visitto Doha and embraced the Qatari emir. It was a public show of fraternity that would have been unfathomable only a few years ago when the two countries were locked in a bitter feud. Qatar’s other adversary in that feud, Saudi Arabia, called after the Israeli strike for “an Arab, Islamic and international response to confront the aggression” and Israel’s “criminal practices”. On Sunday, heads of Arab and Muslim states wereen routeto Doha for an emergency summit.A little more than a week before, another gathering pointed towards other new coalitions. The leaders of India, China and Russia met in Tianjin,producing an imageof smiling warmth that is likely to be an artefact of this era. The summit was convened in the wake of Donald Trump’s alienation of another ally, Narendra Modi. After Trump’s second election, Modi was one of the first leaders to visit Washington DC, where he was called a “great friend”, and the two countries set the target of doubling their trade to half a trillion dollars by 2030. A few months after that, Trumpslapped India with a 50% tariffon the country’s imported goods, a tariff doubled as punishment for India’s purchase of Russian oil. He then proceeded to call the Indian economy “dead”, and commented on the Tianjin summit by posting: “Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China.” He isnow lobbyingthe EU to impose tariffs of up to 100% on India and China.Only a few months before the Israeli strike on Doha, Trump – while visiting the Qatari capital – said “let us give thanks for the blessings of this friendship”. It seems that being called a friend of Trump is now less a guarantee of good relations, and more an augur of being thrown under the bus. Some of these gatherings, new statements of solidarity and concentration of regional alliances are, in certain respects, for show. Neither India nor Qatar has any interest in openly antagonising Trump. Their expressions of anger and performances of friendship are to demonstrate to the US that these states are not quislings, and other mates are available. Allies betrayed by Trump also have to manage their response to US humiliation with an eye on their domestic and regionalreputations.But in other ways, these are also genuine attempts to explore what blocs of power can be formed. What Trump, and in a way Benjamin Netanyahu, are also counting on is that they can afford to be what is known in finance as a “price-setter” or a “price-maker” – a party that has the ability to determine the cost of goods and services because of an uncompetitive market. Israel can bomb whoever it likes, the US can violate security pacts and dictate economic terms, and no one has the right to retaliate.Do that for too long,however, and rational actors start to look for ways to adjust to these imperfect marketconditions. That is less because these newly alienated nations have an objection to the US and Israel being militarily powerful; Gulf states in particular have energetically wooed and flattered the US, and either tolerated or normalised relationswith Israel. Pivots are being studied because, simply, Trump is unhinged, and Israel is out of control. People begin to pat their pockets, make some calls, try to figure out what capital they have (and they do have it) and how it can be pooled. There will be no shortage of nervous and like-minded others to join forces – because when you betray a close ally, everyone realises that no one is safe. It has been striking how the UAE, a signatory tothe Abraham accords, has beenuncharacteristically, loudly critical of Israelsince the Qatar strike.Already, the fate of those accords isbeing questioned. In Tianjin, China urged members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation to leverage their“mega-scale markets” to support trade and investment between each other, andannounceda “global governance initiative”, a clear bid to cast China and its allies as the underwriters of a new world order. In attendance at the summit were other countries such as Turkey and Egypt, who are also in the political and economic crosshairs of the Middle East crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A ruthless deal-maker is only worth engaging with when they observe one fundamental rule: once the deal is made, even if it is a bad one, it is abided by. Trump has violated that tenet. And when it comes to Israel, Trump no longer appears as someone who can be persuaded, flattered and wooed by Arab states. Hesimply does not have the attention span to prevent the conflict from sprawling in ways that are increasingly redrawing the physical and political map of the Middle East. He is a lazy and capricious emperor, sitting on the heap of a nation roiled by violence and crisis.The global realignment is fledgling, slow and gnarly, and potentially unsettling and chaotic for those countries bound to the US through economic and military ties. The US is the largest consumer economy in the world, and its security umbrella and arms sales constitute a pillar of the stability of many states, particularly in the Arab world. But the choice now for many US allies is between handing their sovereignty over to Trump, or finding ways to shore it up by other means, while not making an enemy of the US president.That the latter needs to happen carefully may create the impression that the tectonic plates are not shifting. The unprecedented alacrity with which states are literally embracing each other suggests otherwise. For the moment, Trump and Netanhayu may look at the summits and statements and see them as pointless demonstrations by the weak, but the power of their two nations is partly psychological. Indulging them was premised on the understanding that everyone was in it together to preserve a status quo, which meant allies wouldn’t be bombed or their economies savaged. Once that spell is broken, all bets are off.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionIndiaQatarUnited Arab EmiratesSaudi ArabiaMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Thousands of Liverpool fans set out for Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, full of excitement for the FA Cup semi-final. Ninety-five of themnever came home. Two more died of their injuries years later. The terrible images from the ground still haunt us today.What happened on the day of the disaster was appalling enough. But what came afterwards was a national disgrace. The authorities closed ranks to cover up their own failings – concerned more with protecting their own reputations than the public they were supposed to serve. And families, who had already lost everything, wereforced to watch onas their loved ones were smeared and blamed for their own deaths.At the first inquest, senior police officers were flanked by an army of taxpayer-funded lawyers, while the families scraped together what they couldfor a single barrister– all the might of the state against ordinary people, raw with grief. And it was only after decades of struggle that further inquests finally confirmed what the families had always known: that the 97 wereunlawfully killedand bore no responsibility for the disaster. We can never allow this to happen again.View image in fullscreenFrom second left: David Lammy, justice minister Alex Davies-Jones and attorney general Lord Richard Hermer lay wreaths at the Hillsborough memorial at Anfield, Liverpool, 15 September 2025.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAOn Monday, inLiverpool, it was an honour and a privilege to meet the Hillsborough families. I was deeply moved by their dignity, resolve and, above all, selflessness in ensuring that no others suffer as they have.For 36 years they havefought for justice, and so often in the face of hostility and indifference. And it is because of their strength that this government will now deliver something that should have been done long ago: a Hillsborough law.This law will bring about the cultural change that so many have campaigned for. It includes a new professional and legal duty of candour. When something has gone badly wrong, public servants – from the bobby on the beat to the highest office in the land – will be under a duty to act with honesty and integrity at all times. Anyone who fails to do so will face criminal prosecution.And it will be supported with a new offence for flagrantly misleading the public, with those found in breach of the law facing up to two years behind bars, along with replacing the current offence of misconduct in public office with two new offences. These are serious punishments for serious wrongdoing, and are no less than victims and their families should expect.And, learning the lessons of Hillsborough, and other tragedies since, we will transform the experience of families at inquests. For the first time, legal aid will automatically be available to bereaved families at inquests whenever the state is represented – so those grieving will never again have to pass the hat around to have their voices heard.View image in fullscreenA silent march, in 2022, to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianWhile this government is bringing forward the Hillsborough law, the credit is not ours. It belongs to the families of the 97, whose courage and determination, in the face of so much adversity, has never faltered. And it belongs to the families and communities scarred by other disasters and scandals, who have fought with the same persistence for accountability: Grenfell, the Manchester Arena bombing, Windrush, the Horizon scandal, and for everyone betrayed by the institutions meant to protect them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are enoughMon 15 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 19.52 EDTShareI might have lasered off my moustache years ago, but there’s one Groucho Marx* trait I still cling to: a deep resistance to join any club that will have me.Until the We Do Not Care Club (WDNC Club) slipped into my algorithm.WDNC is an online club for women navigating perimenopause, menopause and beyond founded by the US-based influencerMelani Sanders.Each session opens with Sanders (the queen of deadpan delivery) sporting a handwritten club note pinned to her chest, several pairs of prescription glasses and a highlighter, inviting followers to share what they – you guessed it – no longer give two figs about.Kathy Lette looks back: ‘Older women are invisible, so I make sure to do something outrageous every day’Read moreYes, we’re talking about the usual annoyances: untouching the grey, going out without a bra or ignoring the laundry, but thanks to an eclectic and untapped talent pool, you’ll also find gems like “We do not care if our face is using our outside voice. What our face says is out of our control”, and a personal favourite: “We do not care if our clothes are tight. They fit when we bought them.”Turns out, we women of a certain age care a lot about confessing what we don’t care about at all.Since starting the club in May, Sanders’ social media has exploded – she has 1.7 million followers on Instagram and about 1 million each on TikTok and Facebook at the time of writing.What began as an exasperated sigh casually filmed on an iPhone has become a rallying cry for women aged over 50 (and an upcoming book) – sparking sister WDNC clubs across the globe, (among them one from Shelly Horton, who is enthusiastically taking upthe WDNC Australian baton).Not everyone is a convert. In aKansas City Star article, Yvette Walker provides a salient counter argument, writing that “it’s too important a time not to care”.“I need to care about so many things, some more important than others: My doctor has told me to cut fat out of my diet and exercise more,” she writes. “My news apps remind me I need to keep up on what’s happening in my nation’s capital as well as in my neighborhood. With prices so high, I just can’t shop randomly any longer. White supremacists just marched through Kansas City during Memorial Day Weekend. I have to care.”I’m there with Walker, sitting, fidgeting in that unease. Right now it feels as though our grip on what’s fair, moral and right is so strained, so white-knuckled, that if we let go, we might never find our way back to it.I’m finding it hard not to care about being out of work (even though it was my choice), the scars from a fire injury, the things I forget mid-action. About the processed food my kids eat, the lunch I still haven’t organised, the cat who has definitely packed on more than winter weight … and, honestly, how muchdoyou water indoor plants, anyway?Almost every second woman I speak to seems caught at an existential crossroads – exhausted from caring too much, too often, about things far beyond their control. And it’s not just anecdotal. Research from the national women’s mental health organisation The Liptember Foundationshows that almost 40% of Australian women going through menopause or perimenopauseare experiencing depression or anxiety.Little wonder it’s left us full of angst yet empty inside – always chasing validation we never quite catch. That’s why the WDNC Club is so appealing. It doesn’t just lift the weight of needing to prove ourselves; it lifts the lid onwhywe feel we have to. And then, right when we need it most, it says exactly what we’ve been needing to hear:Take a breath, sister. You’ve earned it. You are enough.It’s also a reminder that there’s not just light – but life – at the end of the menopausal tunnel. AsHorton told ABC Radio Nationallast month, this is our time of “menopausal zest”: a phase when we stop waiting to be valued by others and start valuing ourselves.Not just resisting, but leading the fight: five women who refuse to be ignoredRead moreYes, this is our way back; back to what really matters. It’s our opportunity to funnel all that care that’s been chipping away at us, slowly, like a thousand tiny cuts, and redirect it towards something more intentional. Towards making the most of our brief, miraculous time on this Earth.As my mentor and occasional philosopher Groucho Marx also once said:“Life is a whim of several billion cells to be you for a while.” So let’s not waste another second – or cell – on meaningless worry or performative care.Remember, we havezest.Now’s our time to polish those billion cells into the crazy diamonds we’re meant to be.*Groucho Marx performed with a fake moustache during most of his comedy careerJen Vuk is a writer based in MelbourneExplore more on these topicsMenopauseOpinionHealthWomencommentShareReuse this content"

Do your eyes glaze over at the mention of foreign fiction? Is your reading diet missing the vibrant flavours of stories from Africa, Asia and Latin America? Restricting your reading to novels from Europe and North America is like going to an all-you-can-eat Mexican buffet and just eating tortillas. Why do that?I have been getting to know about countries in the global south through literature. Being an intrepid traveller, current events addict and avid reader led me inexorably to read books from around the world. The book that most reeled me in to the ability of literature to open the door to another country was Gabriel García Márquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude, a dazzling, magic-realist ride through Colombia’s fortunes and misfortunes. Eventually, a cocktail of wonder, wishfulness and wanderlust inspired me to write a book about the joy of seeing the world through books.It’s easy to stick close to a literary home, but it’s also limiting, maybe illogical. Non-western nations are home tomore than 6 billion people–about 85%of the world’s population. Little wonder they are also referred to as the “majority world”.There’s a whole gamut of storytelling out there that is as colourful as an Indian textile bazaar, as rich as the spices of an Ethiopian stew and as passionate as a tango in Buenos Aires. Tales that encompasses love, loss, joy, revolution and even stretch to exploding mangoes, a ferociously funny Frankenstein and ghosts with strong political views.There are other ways to get facts. Newspapers are full of them, as are podcasts and documentaries. Travel shows proliferate, take your pick. But even then, there is nothing like the view of the world via a novel. Novels can go beyond merely being set on location. They can describe and landscape, but they can also capture a nation’s spirit and reveal something of its soul, offering a gateway to understanding the world in all its complexity, richness and absurdity. Seeking out authors from different cultural backgrounds, races and genders means reading books that challenge assumptions and broaden horizons as we venture into new worlds and learn about people who live different lives. It’s a cure for cultural myopia.Nigeria’s civil war in the 1970s?Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Half of a Yellow Sunis unputdownable. Seoul searching?Nobel prize-winner Han Kang, with works such as Human Acts and We Do Not Part, delves deep into South Korea’s psyche. A slice of life from Cuba?Leonardo Padura’s crime-busting Havana cop Mario Conde is on the case. And there’s a lot more where these came from – tales told with vim, vigour and narrative verve by writers such as Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Isabel Allende, Arundhati Roy, Naguib Mahfouz and Abdulrazak Gurnah.With independence a seminal event for many global south nations in the 20th century, the anti-colonial struggle pulses at the heart of some novels (so loud sometimes that you can almost hear it beating). The Nigerian writerChinua Achebe, considered the grandfather of modern African literature, said that “until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter”. As the literary lions of the global south roar, they not only tell us about their own countries but also about their former colonial masters. Salman Rushdie called it “the empire writes back”.My world tour spanned about 200 books, but it was never meant to be an exercise in worthiness. These books aren’t heavy-going and humourless, they are page-turning, plot-twisting, keep-you-up-till-late-in-the-night good. And they offer worldview-altering experiences.Confronting the western canon and freeing yourself from the anglophone autocracy is more about gate-opening than gatekeeping. I found that diversifying reading makes your literary world bigger, richer and more exciting. And reading around the world helps explode the oft-perpetuated myths that Africa is riddled with conflict and famine, that the Middle East is an unremitting war zone, and that Latin America is a heady mix of drug cartels, military coups and carnivals.The writer and activist Elif Shafak has talked about “the vastness of Storyland, where there are no borders, no hierarchies, no ‘us versus them’”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its purpose was to rule over people as subjects, not serve them as citizens. It was built to command and control. Clever people with the right sort of education who knew the decisions they made were better. Brains at the centre, obedience at the edge. Endless statistical knowledge, precious little experience on the ground.It is plain to see this inheritance iscreaking at the seams. We expect much more of the state than we did in its imperial past.In particular, it has three problems. First, it’s not good at dealing with complexity. Take knife crime, for instance. It’s a complex social problem. We can’t know the answers from a desk in Whitehall.Second, the state is too centralised. Thestate collects95% of all UK tax revenue, compared with 50% in Germany. Third, it is too slow. Parliamentary democracy has been displaced by vetocracy, where dozens of organisations or people in the hierarchy can slow or stop things but few can speed them up.The answer is to create a dynamic state. In our paper,A Progressive Case for State Reform, we argue for Labour owning this space – radical state reform – and reclaiming it from the right. Because we believe in the state’s power to improve the lives of working people, we must be its most strident reformers, especially when it fails to deliver.This is the big call for Keir Starmer this autumn. Does he continue to pursue government in the usual way, relying on lumbering, uncoordinated departments to slowly do their thing? Or does he create more agile, dynamic and urgent mission teams to get the big jobs done?Building 1.5 million homes, moving to clean power, tackling violence against women, dealing with small boats and asylum hotels are all good examples of what we mean. When people used to speak of a “Rolls-Royce” civil service, they never had Whitehall, as it is today, in mind. No single department has the power, capacity, sole responsibility, or sense of urgency to solve these problems. The result is too little co-ordination, joint planning, or skilful implementation. In short, difficult cross-cutting issues are not being systematically gripped.View image in fullscreenCivil servants at work in the House of Commons committee office in London, November 1919.Photograph: AR Coster/Getty ImagesAnd so, problems are being solved on Whitehall’s schedule, rather than to the deadlines the public demands. This may have worked in the past, but not now. News travels too quickly, and the public is too disillusioned.Compare this with the Covid vaccine taskforce. It reported directly to the prime minister. That taskforce had brilliant talent – the best possible people from the private and public sectors brought together – and the resources and powers it needed. And crucially, it had all the usual bureaucracy cleared away. It’s a no-brainer to create a similar taskforce of multidisciplinary experts dedicated to solving the thorniest problems of government.When Donald Trump, orJavier Mileiin Argentina, or other populists talk of “draining the swamp”, they are tuning in to something real and powerful. People are used to having smartphones with a bewildering capacity in their hands. At the same time, they too often see the state finding even the simplest of tasks difficult to accomplish. The right’s answer is to take a chainsaw to the state, because its adherents don’t really believe it should achieve the aims we on the left want it to.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This will require the government to change the culture and operating manual of the state that has too many echoes of its past.The answer is for the state to become more agile and dynamic, and for communities and regions to do more. To inject pace, we have to cull veto points. To improve performance, we have to overhaul recruitment, incentivise civil servants to develop expertise and ensure they have a record of achievement and high performance before being promoted. The state should borrow from Netflix’s performance culture, where the reward for “adequate performance is a generous severance package”.Most of all, it needs a missions mindset, focused on solving big problems for working people – with the resource, power and political backing to achieve bold goals.The growth in Reform UK’s support since the election has been among people who have lost faith in the two main parties to “get the job done”. Reform is waiting in the wings ifLabourdoes not get a move on.

And what she calls the striking awareness children have of being poor requires us to find a modern-day Dickens to hear their voices.For the past two years – and from my experience of working with a new charity, Multibanks UK, which complements food banks by offering clothing, bedding, hygiene goods and baby goods for families in need – I, like the children’s commissioner, have been seeing the hidden injuries of poverty. It’s not only the shortage of basic essentials asfood prices risefar faster than wages and child benefits. It’s the totality of the conditions in which so many of the generation I call austerity’s children – young people born into poverty in the Tory years – are living: homes without heating, bedrooms without beds, kitchens without kitchen utensils, floors without coverings and even toilets without toilet rolls.For many it is much worse: damp mouldy rooms, outside toilets and no kitchen table to eat at or write up their school work on, only a cold floor. “In our kitchen there’s loads of holes that rats come through at night and sometimes they bite through our walls,” a girl of seven said in thechildren’s commissioner’s report. And for the nearly 170,000homeless childrenin England, there is no stability: entire families are being housed in cramped temporary accommodation on top of each other. “I’ve moved houses seven times,” a 10-year-old girl reported.It is the huge increase in the number of children in deep abject poverty that should worry us most. These children are living in families whose income is less than 50% of the median, the government’s own baseline for absolute poverty. It is difficult to see how we can meet themost recent government target– getting 75% of five-year-old children ready for school by 2028 – if we cannot lift these children up. As the Trussell Trusthas just shown, the inequities of the two-child benefit cap mean a family with three or more children is twice as likely to call on food banks for emergency help. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, one million children aredestitute or near-destitute, usually going without three or more essentials – food, clothes, toiletries and a roof above their heads.But poverty now runs even deeper, and hits children even harder, than this. I grew up in a town where I could see poverty in slum houses, the prefabs and the estates that were flooded most years as waves crashed over the harbour walls. But that did not prepare me for what I see now – the anguish of parents, unable to cope, some surrendering their children into care because they know they cannot provide for them; and, above all, the humiliations children suffer when they go without, the ostracisation they experience at school, shunned for being poor. Their poverty is not their fault, but still they feel shame.This summer,up to 3 million childrenwill have been skipping meals, while more than 2 million households willrarely have known the benefitof fresh food or hot food at home. “Mum would cry every time she was going to pay the bills,” reported a boy of 16. Another child told her younger brother to stop asking for toys, and explained how for three years she had been holding off asking for trainers. “I used to play the violin until it broke,” a girl told the commissioner. Another teenager I spoke with told me about having to share football boots with his brother, each missing training once a fortnight until they both grew out of the boots and neither could join in football practice at all.The pain of these children may be invisible to most of us, but children have a “hyper-awareness” of what their poverty means and how different they are from the other kids at school. “A lot of us who were on free school meals used to get bullied for it,” reported a teenage girl. But even worse are their stories of being humiliated because they don’t have the shoes or kit that their fellow pupils are wearing, and how they are shunned because they don’t use soap, shampoo and toothpaste.Children themselves do not talk about “poverty” as such, the commissioner reported. Instead, they talk about living without food and furnishings in insecure, crowded, even unsafe houses, like the eight-year-old boy who reported “there’s stuff like robbing and sometimes there’s drunk people and stabbing”.For most of my life, the tide of poverty had been turned back in one way or another.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is time to do more than chronicle this pain as Dickens and Orwell did. The next few weeks are decisive. Today, actor David Tennant will launch an appeal to end the suffering of millions of Britain’s children. Hope for our poorest children lies in the child poverty review’s recommendations and November’s budget: to fairly taxthe excess profits of gambling, and if more money is needed to remove some of the interest rate subsidy enjoyed by commercial banks when they deposit money at the Bank of England. That would be the first step, stopping child poverty’s inexorable rise by taking an initial 500,000 out of poverty and by relieving the sufferings of another 900,000.The party conference season and the Labour deputy leadership hustings must now become platforms for an urgent discussion on how we end the biggest cause of social division in Britain today.

School term begins, parliament returns to session,new novels flood the marketfor awards season, and television and radio stations air their latest programmes. Among all the new starts, though, many people want to go back to basics. An episode ofL’amour est dans le Pré(Love is in the Meadow) can do the job. The most popular dating show in France just premiered its 20th season, and 3.6 million fans (19% of the total TV audience) were glued to their sofas. The opening credits rolled to the tune of Michael Bublé’s Haven’t Met You Yet, and loyal viewers were captivated by 15 new candidates (12 men and three women), looking for true love.Just like Farmer Wants a Wife, its British equivalent (both are produced by Fremantle media), the reality TV programme depicts a cast of farmers from every part of rural France – including overseas territories – trying to find their soulmates. The contenders’ video bios are broadcast, people write in expressing their interest, and shortlisted suitors embark on a speed-dating session on a riverboat, docked at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. Two of them are then invited to stay with their chosen farmer for a week. With the camera’s lens as a witness, Cupid does his magic … or not, as the case may be. Over 20 years, dozens of love stories have mushroomed, andat least 60 childrenhave been born to couples brought together by the show.This concept never managed to win over many British viewers: only two seasons of the original show were broadcast in the UK, in 2001 and 2009 – although a possible new season was mootedin May this year. It’s a different story on this side of the Channel. In a shattered society and a fast-changing world, the programme has struck a chord with French audiences.I used to watch the show, never missing an episode, and would invite friends over to join me. As a rural kid turned Parisian hipster, however, I developed mixed feelings about the programme: it sometimes made fun of candidates’ regional accents, cultural tics, eating habits, faulty grammar, and their physical appearance. French cinema, literature and television have long focused on the urban upper class, leaving out a large part of the population. And when they have featured country folk, many popular comedy shows, such as Les Deschiens, Les Bronzés or the series and films of Les Bodin’s, routinely ridiculed them and depicted them as stupid. This is the paradox that bothered me: L’amour est dans le Pré does allow for more representation, but it often does so from a superior point of view.In the years since the show started running in 2005, however, things have begun to change. Urban viewers’ stereotypes were sometimes reinforced by characters who corresponded to their idea of what a farmer was. After all, the show was supposed to be entertaining, and 80% of French people live in urban areas. What could be more fun or “cute” (a word used a lot by Karine Le Marchand, the show’s anchor for 15 years) than showing the hillbillies of the French countryside – an exotic world just at your doorstep – fall in love at first sight or get heartbroken? But it also provided a window into that world, and was one of the few spaces where rural French people saw themselves represented in the media. “Yes, L’amour est dans le Pré may have been created by city people, but it remains a rural show,” Romain Doyen, a member of the French Young Farmers union (Jeunes Agriculteurs), told me. “Growing up, what I watched on TV seemed like another world. I was 23 when I launched my farm – and when I first saw the programme. For the first time, I felt me and my people were being represented.”Over time, the programme has challenged viewers’ assumptions in interesting ways. Yes, some farmers are desperate single men struggling on dairy farms, as you might expect. But others are hippies growing herbal essences, while some breed llamas, oysters and race horses, or harvest salt using traditional methods. They can work from wheelchairs, be rich men or old lesbians, or young tech enthusiasts. Viewers of L’amour est dans le Pré can find a lost or unexpected part of themselves. City folk can connect with farmers or their suitors through their shared desire to be loved or through their work ethic. In season 15, a gay bull breeder from the south shared his long-held dream of becoming a father with his suitor, as well as all the taboos he had to face.If the rural and urban parts of France have long been pitted against each other, recently things have begun to change: people from across the country have been gathering to protect agricultural land from predatory projects (an airport, a highway, a fancy development). When villagersstarted to don yellow vestsat every roundabout in the country to protest against the taxes on diesel, for once, the Parisian intelligentsia was forced to listen and put themselves in their shoes. And more recently, in January 2024, whenthousands of farmers blocked roadsto protest against food prices and potential subsidy cuts, Le Marchand climbed over the barricades for a special delivery: fresh croissants for the farmers. “So cute!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But planning is more than just paperwork waiting to be automatedGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastSun 14 Sep 2025 22.09 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 02.26 EDTShare“This is a gamechanger”.That’s how Paul Scully, New South Wales minister for planning and public spaces,describedthe state government’s launch of a tender for an artificial intelligence (AI) solution to the housing crisis earlier this month.The system, which is aimed at cutting red tape and getting more homes built fast, is expected to be functioning by the end of 2025.It is “allowing construction to get under way and new keys into new doors,” Scully added.The announcement was laterendorsedby the federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, as a model for other states and territories to replicate, to “unlock more housing” and “boost productivity across the economy”.Speeding up building approvals is a key concern of the so-calledabundance agendafor boosting economic growth.Those wheels are already in motion elsewhere in Australia. Tasmania isdeveloping an AI policy, and South Australia istrialling a small-scale pilotfor specific dwelling applications to allow users to submit digital architectural drawings to be automatically assessed against prescribed criteria.In Paris it’s normal to raise a family in a three-bedroom apartment. Why aren’t we building more in Australia?Read moreBut will AI really be a quick fix to Australia’s housing crisis?Cutting red tapeHousing and AI were both key themes at last month’s productivity roundtable.In ajoint media release, the federal minister for housing, Clare O’Neil, and minister for the environment and water, Murray Watt, said easing “the regulatory burden for builders” is what Australia needs.They point to the backlog of 26,000 homes currently stuck in assessment under environmental protection laws as a clear choke point. And AI is going to be used to “simplify and speed up assessments and approvals”.None of this, however, explains AI’s precise role within the complex machinery of the planning system, leaving much to speculation.Will the role of AI be limited to checking applications for completeness and classifying and validating documents, asVictorian councilsare already exploring? Or drafting written elements of assessments, as is already the case in theAustralian Capital Territory?Or will it go further? Will AI agents, for example, have some autonomy in parts of the assessment process? If so, where exactly will this be? How will it be integrated into existing infrastructure? And most importantly, to what extent will expert judgment be displaced?A tempting quick fixPresenting AI as a quick fix for Australia’s housing shortage might be tempting. But it risks distracting fromdeeper systemic issuessuch as labour market bottlenecks, financial and tax incentives, and shrinking social and affordable housing.The technology is also quietly reshaping the planning system – and the role of planners within it – with serious consequences.Planning is not just paperwork waiting to be automated. It is judgment exercised in site visits, in listening to stakeholders, and in weighing local context against the broader one.Stripping that away can make both the system and the people brittle, displacing planners’ expertise and blurring responsibility when things go wrong. And when errors involving AI happen, it can be very hard to trace them, with research showingexplainabilityhas been the technology’s achilles heel.The NSW governmentsuggestsputting a human in charge of the final decision is enough to solve these concerns.But the machine doesn’t just sit quietly in the corner waiting for the approve button to be pressed. It nudges. It frames. It shapes what gets seen and what gets ignored in different stages of assessment, often in ways that aren’t obvious at all.For example, highlighting some ecological risks over others can simply tilt an assessor’s briefing, even when local communities might have entirely different concerns. Or when AI ranks one assessment pathway as the “best fit” based on patterns buried in its training data, the assessor may simply drift toward that option, not realising the scope and direction of their choices have already been narrowed.Lessons from RobodebtCentrelink’s online compliance intervention program – more commonly known as Robodebt – carries some important lessons here. Sold as a way to make debt recovery more “efficient”, it soon collapsed intoa $4.7bn fiasco.In that case, an automated spreadsheet – not even AI – harmed thousands of people, triggered a hefty class action and shattered public trust in the government.If governments now see AI as a tool to reform planning and assessments, they shouldn’t rush in headlong.The fear of missing out may be real. But the wiser move is to pause and ask first: what problem are we actually trying to solve with AI, and does everyone even agree it’s the real problem?Only then comes the harder question of how to do it responsibly, without stumbling into the same avoidable consequences as Robodebt.After four decades of stalled attempts, there’s a new plan to ‘transform’ Sydney’s ugliest roadRead moreResponsible innovation offers a roadmap forwardResponsible innovationmeans anticipating risks and unintended consequences early on – by including and deliberating with those who will use and be affected by the system, proactively looking for the blind spots, and being responsive to the impacts.There are abundant research case studies, tools and frameworks in the field of responsible innovation that can guide the design, development and deployment of AI systems in planning. But the key is to engage withroot causes and unintended consequences, and to question the underlying assumptions about the vision and purpose of the AI system.We can’t afford to ignore the basics of responsible innovation. Otherwise, this so-called “gamechanger” to the housing crisis might find itself sitting alongside Robodebt as yet another cautionary tale of how innovations sold as efficiency gains can so go wrong.Ehsan Nabavi is a senior lecturer in Technology and Society, Responsible Innovation Lab, Australian National University.

I bow before Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton’s many career achievements: Perrier award-winners, makers of successive hit TV series, not to mention megastars (as I shall soon discover) in China. But can they convince us that there are old ghosts haunting the 90s-built New Victoria theatre, located in a shopping mall? Such is the challenge faced by theInside No 9duo as they take their hitshow-of-the-serieson tour. “We made it very much about the ghosts of Wyndham’s theatre,” says Shearsmith of the show’s West End run. “Now we have to change it so that every place we’re in, that’s where there’s a legend of bloody Belle, and that’s where she haunts.”Over the tour, that may mean the 100-year-old Liverpool Empire or Edinburgh Playhouse: no problem. Or it might be the rather fresher Marlowe in Canterbury or Milton Keynes theatre, which opened in another shopping precinct in 1999. “That doesn’t lend itself to a legend,” admitsShearsmith, chatting over lunch at a London rehearsal room. “So we are amending the phraseology to make it sound older than it is. We’ll say ‘a quarter of a century’ rather than ‘25 years ago’. One sounds recent and the other sounds old.”View image in fullscreenGrotesques … as Edward and Tubbs in The League of Gentlemen.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyNone of this was anticipated when the pair created Inside No 9: Stage/Fright earlier this year. “We never intended it to tour,” says Pemberton. Nor did they take it for granted that a stage show based on their 10-year anthology series would necessarily fly. That seems bizarre to me: the avalanche of praise for Inside No 9 since its final series makes the success of a live outing feel nailed on. But its creators made no assumptions. The TV show’s popularity “crept up”, says Pemberton. “There were times when people used to go ‘Any more League of Gentlemen?’” – theircult sketch show that ran from 1999 to 2002– “and we’d say, ‘Well, we’re doing Inside No 9’, and they’d say, ‘Oh, I’ve never seen it.’”He continues: “Sometimes you’d feel, because it was on BBC Two at 10 o’clock, you were falling into a crack, and it wasn’t the show everyone was talking about. It’s only when you announce something’s ending that you start to feel this enormous love for it.” Making the stage show reinforced the point. “I remember feeling with League of Gentlemen as well,” adds Shearsmith, “that you never get a sense of who’s watching it, apart from your mum and dad telling you that there’s someone in the post office who said, ‘I saw your son last night.’” With Stage/Fright, “you get to meet your audience at the stage door”, says Pemberton, “and hear what it means to them. That’s been amazing. We now feel,” he says, with satisfaction, “that it’s been a good decade’s work.”Inside No 9 was far from a surefire hit when it launched in 2014. There may have been, as Shearsmith contends,a noble tradition of anthology showson TV (Alfred Hitchcock Presents; Tales of the Unexpected) – but the tradition was dormant. TV orthodoxy demands recurring characters with whom audiences can build a relationship. The only constant in Inside No 9 was Shearsmith and Pemberton as stars (or cameos), and their horror-meets-comedy sensibility. And the quality and variety of their ideas – which became ever harder, says Shearsmith, to sustain.“Doing six new stories every series for the last 10 years, it was always, ‘Wow, we got away with it again,’” he says. “All we were ever thinking was, ‘What next? Have you got any more new ideas?’” To the viewer, I say, it felt effortless. “It may look effortless,” responds Shearsmith, “but under the surface, the swan’s feet are …”, and then Pemberton finishes his sentence: “arthritic”.The challenge with Stage/Fright was to capture the spirit of the TV show – not just its laughter-meets-chills vibe, but its tonal variety. And so Stage/Fright re-used existingInside No 9content (they reprise most of the series four episode Bernie Clifton’s Dressing Room, about a clapped-out comedy double act), featured a celebrity guest star at each performance (Lee Mack at press night, along with Ian McKellen, David Tennant and Bob Mortimer), and also addressed the question: “What can we do – with the bows at the end, even with the pre-show message about mobile phones – that can really play with the idea of being in a theatre?”That led to the decision not to spin a purely fictional tale, but to appear – unprecedented this, for both of them – as themselves. “We were reticent about that,” says Shearsmith. “We were terrified of looking indulgent in any way. But [director Simon Evans] said, ‘No, the fact that you’re there, and it’s live, is a massive new thing for anybody coming to see it. People don’t see you, ever: you’re always hidden behind the characters in the stories.’ So we put ourselves in it. It’s not a fourth-wall show. We acknowledge we’re all in this building together, and then things happen” – spooky things, as the ghosts of each individual theatre are summoned to the stage.View image in fullscreen‘We were terrified of looking indulgent’ … playing themselves in Stage/Fright at Wyndhams Theatre.Photograph: Wyndhams TheatreWithout ever stinting on the entertainment, this all makes for a wonderfully tricksy and destabilising show, its strands united by Shearsmith and Pemberton’s palpable love for theatres and their hauntings – and for old-school entertainment, its double acts in particular. Is that a personal concern? “We never really thought of ourselves as a double act in the traditional sense,” says Pemberton. “We’ve sort of accidentally become one, haven’t we?” says Shearsmith. Their relationship isn’t toxic, like Tommy and Len (AKA Cheese and Crackers) in Bernie Clifton’s Dressing Room, with “one always feeling stuck in a certain role”, says Pemberton. “We’ve always been able to change it up. We often don’t know until days before we shoot who’s going to play which character.”“All that proves,” says Shearsmith, “is that we’re interchangeable.”And as for all those theatre ghosts, that’s been an obsession since at least their League of Gentlemen days, when they considered setting that show’s movie spin-off in a haunted playhouse. “I wouldn’t want to be the last person to leave the theatre at night, making sure it’s all closed up,” says Pemberton. But is it harder frightening people on stage than on screen? Shearsmith had prior experience with that, having starred in League co-writer Jeremy Dyson’slong-running stage hit Ghost Stories. “How do you frighten people who’re aware they’re surrounded by lots of other people, in a theatre, who’ve all been laughing together?” he muses. “It’s hard to switch gears like that. But they’re linked, aren’t they, laughter and fear? Playing with that is fun.”It’s also a technical feat on stage. “There’s a lot of special effects,” says Shearsmith, “a lot of magic, gore and blood. Timing is everything: there’s a ballet of stage hands and crew working in tandem with what we’re doing.” But it works: I teetered on the edge of my seat for the entirety of Stage/Fright – and you might too if you catch it on its tour. Its creators are delighted to be bringing it to their home patches of Hull and Manchester in particular. “If you’re a fan of a thing and it turns up in your town,” says Shearsmith, “you can’t believe it. I used to go to Hull NewTheatreand once saw Peter Davison from the telly in some play, and couldn’t believe he was right there. It’s great!”In the Shanghai Grand there’s an Inside No 9 experience. It’s like walking into our mindsIt’s unlikely, mind you, that the good burghers of Hull and Manchester will be as excited as the Chinese, who – as surprising as anything in Inside No 9, this – turn out to be obsessive fans of the series. “They’ve got their own live show of it that’s been running for two years now,” reports Shearsmith. “We went to Shanghai last year to see it. We got to the fifth floor of the Shanghai Grand, which is massive, and there’s a whole interactive Inside No 9 experience. It’s like walking into our minds. The show is far bigger there, andwewere massive,” he says, a 56-year-old man bewildered to be treated like a pop star. “We had security, people trying to grab us – it was mad.”There are no plans, as yet, to tour Stage/Fright to the Middle Kingdom – but then, the Inside No 9 boys have no plans at all right now. “We don’t have next year set up,” says Pemberton. “It’s the first time in a decade we don’t have anything at all that’s definite. We’ve just been rolling along with Inside No 9 for the last 10 years.” This tour lets them roll along with it for a few months more, soaking up the love. And then? “Who knows? And that’s scary, but it’s freeing as well,” says Pemberton. “We’re used to the feeling of, ‘Oh God, what are we going to do now?’ – because that’s what writing Inside No 9 has felt like all along.”Inside No 9: Stage/Fright is touring to 6 DecemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreComedy (Stage)Inside No 9Reece ShearsmithSteve PembertonComedy (Culture)featuresShareReuse this content"

We’d grown up in a divided country and had tried many times to play in EastGermany, but they would never let us in. When we did our first gig in what was then Leningrad, the atmosphere was a bit grey, not very colourful or rock’n’roll – but hearts started opening up over the course of the 10 gigs we did in the city. It ended up a bit like Beatlemania, with fans circling our cars after every show.In Leningrad, we realised we were being watched by the KGB. But when we played the Moscow Music Peace festival the following year, the soldiers in the stadium turned to face the bands, joined in the cheering and became part of the audience. It was like the world was changing in front of our eyes. Suddenly, with Mikhail Gorbachev in the Kremlin – and perestroika and glasnost – it was possible for this Russian Woodstock to happen. It was hard to believe that people had been sent to prison for listening to western rock music – because now there was a Russian audience going nuts to Rock You Like a Hurricane.In September, after I came home, I started fiddling around with my little keyboard. Wind of Change was not some kind of fantasy: it was one of those songs that comes from deep in your soul and you just try to express what you’ve lived through. The lyric refers to Moscow’s landmarks because when we played the festival there, all the bands went for a boat ride on the Moskva, all the way to Gorky Park.MTV wanted Bon Jovi to headline. The fans went crazy while we played – then Bon Jovi came on and they all leftThe whistling was a result of me having no guitar when I was writing it. The record company in the US later called me and said: “You have to take the whistle out.” I said: “No way.” When the song went through the roof, the same guy came to me, bending over and saying: “Klaus, I was wrong. Please forgive me – you can kick my ass!”Matthias Jabs did a wonderful kind of Hendrix guitar intro, while Rudolf Schenker played a fantastic guitar solo – and it all just came together. But not one of us thought about the political side of Wind of Change. Nobody had a master plan. For me, it was just a reflection of what we saw, this change in the air. It’s a song of hope for a peaceful future, perfect for that historical moment.When Patrick Radden Keefe – a very serious journalist from the New Yorker – confronted me with the theory that the CIA wrote Wind of Change to bring the cold war to an end, I had to laugh. Not in your wildest dreams would you think of something like that. But in the end,his podcastwas a huge promotion for the song.A line in Wind of Change says: “We could be so close, like brothers.” That was exactly the way we felt at the Moscow Music Peace festival. Now, 35 years later, it’s like the clock is ticking backwards. It’s very sad.Rudolf Schenker, guitarIn Leningrad, we were playing to over 10,000 people each night. By the time of the Moscow Music Peace festival, we were big in Russia. But MTV wantedBon Jovito headline. The fans went crazy while we played – then Bon Jovi came on and they all left the stadium. We saw Jon Bon Jovi do an interview later that night and he said: “I’ll never play after the Scorpions again!”We could already feel the world drastically changing. And after we came back from Moscow, Klaus called me and said: “I have a song.” Normally, Klaus didn’t write music, just lyrics. But he played me Wind of Change and I told him: “It’s great, but there’s one thing missing – a chorus.” He came back with the full song when we went to Vancouver to record the Crazy World album.I worked hard on the guitar solo, because I’d realised the song’s potential. I’m not the best guitarist – normally I’m the rhythm player. So I remember sitting with my headphones on, tracking take after take, trying to put down a solo that would lift up the lyrics for a powerful finale.Wind of Change was released in January 1991, and I said to Klaus: “You know what? We also have to record a version in Russian.” Pirate radio was born at that time in Russia, and at six every morning, they’d start by playing that song. It became the soundtrack to the most peaceful revolution on Earth. Now, we have a whole different world. In 2022, Klaus said, “I can’t sing Wind of Change the way it was” – and he changed the lyrics he sings live to ones that support Ukraine.The new Scorpions compilation, From the First Sting, is out on 26 September via BMGExplore more on these topicsCultureHow we madeBon JoviGermanyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Aside fromAdolescence, which had the limited series category all sewn up, it felt like every single nomination was either forSeveranceor The Studio.Emmys 2025: full list of winnersRead moreOf these,The Studio’s ascendancy seemed most locked in. Here, after the controversy over The Bear’s deliberate lack of laughs, was acomedycomedy; something designed from the ground up to be funny. Plus, it was about the entertainment industry, which always appeals to the myopic interests of the Emmy voters. True, all of this equally applied toHacks, but The Studio’s lead character wasn’t routinely described as a comedy genius, so there was far less dissonance when his jokes failed to land.Emmy awards 2025: red carpet looks at TV’s big night – in picturesRead moreAnd so it came to pass. The Studio ended theEmmysas the most awarded comedy ever, picking up 13 wins. Writing, directing, acting, a wealth of technical awards. What’s more, Seth Rogen is now in joint first place for the most Emmy wins in one night. It was, by any metric, a resounding victory.Severance was slightly less of a dead cert – this year’s second season largely traded its momentum for style, frustratingly – but it still very much remained the drama series to beat. Sadly for Severance, someone beat it.View image in fullscreenStunning in a way television was 20 years ago … Noah Wyle in The Pitt.Photograph: AlamyFor the most part, that show wasThe Pitt. And this was entirely warranted, because The Pitt is stunning in a way that television was 20 years ago. Essentially 24 set in a hospital, The Pitt is the sort of frenetic, unapologetically entertaining drama that network television used to excel at. Tellingly, it’s made by some of the people who made ER and The West Wing. In total, The Pitt won five Emmys, including best drama.But it is the writing and directing losses that will really sting for Severance. Severance is sold almost entirely on those two things – it’s a complex mystery-box show that is most frequently promoted by its movie star director – so to lose those categories seems particularly egregious.But the shows that did win those categories –Andorfor writing, Slow Horses for direction – probably deserved them. On an otherwise quiet night for Andor, Dan Gilroy’s writing win marked perhaps the most political moment of the entire ceremony. Gilroy, after all, managed to take goofy old Star Wars and transform it into the most stinging indictment of our times imaginable. Not for nothing was itthe only show nominated to explicitly invoke genocide.View image in fullscreenThe only show nominated to explicitly invoke genocide … Diego Luna in Andor.Photograph: LucasfilmMeanwhile, Slow Horses’ Adam Randall was a perfect example of rock solid direction, unfussily squeezing every ounce of tension and humour from the script. Had there been a Most Direction category, Severance would have walked it, but this seems fair.Still, the awards that Severance did win were well earned. Britt Lower did magnificent work playing two characters who were horrified by each other, and you sense that Tramell Tillman – the first Black person to win best supporting actor in a drama – is on a rocket ship to permanent A-list stardom, so this fits too.View image in fullscreenOn a rocket ship to A-list stardom … Tramell Tillman in Severance.Photograph: APHowever, if we’re talking snubs, then some space must be set aside for The White Lotus, which left empty-handed last night. This is the first time this has happened in the show’s history, and there are perhaps a few explanations. Broadly, this was the loosest and least focused season of the show, shot through with any number of frustrating plotholes and threads left dangling. There was also no Jennifer Coolidge-style centre of gravity, which likely split the voting. The show did win one Creative Arts Emmy this week. However, that award went to Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, thecomposer who quit the showafter publicly lashing out at its showrunner, Mike White, which probably only compounds the disappointment.View image in fullscreenLittle short of spectacular … Cristin Milioti in The Penguin.Photograph: APIn happier news, Cristin Milioti won best lead actress in a limited series for her role in The Penguin. Adolescence (rightly) locked out most of the limited series awards, for all the reasons you already know about. But Milioti was little short of spectacular in her role as an ascendant crime boss. Variously scheming, angry, haunted and heartbreaking, her performance gave untold depths to a character that ran the risk of coming off as two-dimensional. Of course, it might have also helped that Adolescence had no identifiable lead actress, but let’s not dwell on that.Finally, it should be mentioned that there was nothing for The Bear. But if you’ve seen any ofThe Bearrecently, you will understand that this doesn’t really qualify as a surprise. If it can hit the strengths of its first two seasons when it returns, however, it might end up giving The Studio a run for its money.Explore more on these topicsEmmysTelevisionEmmys 2025Awards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In this 1930 painting, lent by the Musée Picasso in Paris, a body with no defined gender contorts into an insoluble puzzle, a leg sprouting above its anus, the head, eyes closed, bulging where genitals might be, the other leg standing on the ground balanced by an arm whose hand functions as a foot while the other arm, fist clenched, bends like a tail. In just this way, Picasso turned art inside out and upside down, twisted it unrecognisably, yet made it all the more compelling, human and passionate.Born into a Europe of realistic sculptures and perspective pictures, he blew up those conventions, put them back together, then smashed them again, and a few times more. It’s hard not to be awed by his achievements, his turmoil of creative energy, the scale of his artistic breakthroughs, althoughTate Moderntries its best. Theatre Picasso starts with coughing noises and references to gender and artistic borrowing. But those concerns go nowhere, vanishing in what becomes – almost despite itself – a riotous celebration of his genius.View image in fullscreenTwisted reality … The Acrobat, 1930.Photograph: © RMN-Grand Palais (Musée national Picasso-Paris) / Adrien Didierjean/© Succession Picasso/DACS, London 2025.It breaks Picasso up, as he broke up what he saw. There is no chronology or historical context. A piece of film shot by Man Ray of Picasso in a wig as Carmen – a holiday movie shot just after he’d painted Guernica – is followed by a selection of much later “obscene” images. In one of them, The Kiss, a man and woman give it a lot of tongue, practically eating each other, trying to get inside each another. In the same way, Picasso’s art wants to swallow the entire physical world. You can feel the fleshy wetness in your own mouth. He rejects realism to make you taste the real.An artist who makes kissing look as filthy as this is hardly going to hold back when it comes to the nude. His 1968 painting Nude Woman with Necklace gets a spotlit wall to itself and a wall text drawing attention to his possessive depictions of women. As if we needed telling. In this blue-green tinted painting, we can see the model’s vulva and anus simultaneously as she fingers the necklace against her breasts. The critique misfires. Picasso was in his late 80s when he painted this, its rawness and anger as much to do with death as with sex. There is a pathos in his determination to go one better than Dylan Thomas and rage, rage against the dying of desire.Death raises its hollow-eyed head insistently from this point in the exhibition. Picasso’s 1952 painting Goat’s Skull, Bottle and Candle is a memento mori that makes you glad to be alive. It’s a painting with the sharp lines of a drawing. The canvas is broken up into white, grey and black disharmonious lozenges, the skull delineated in harsh sections with crystalline force to make you see and feel what he saw on the table in front of him, fresh from the butcher, starting to attract flies.View image in fullscreenCrystalline force … Tapestry Le Minotaure 1935.Photograph: François Fernandez/© Succession Picasso/DACS, London 2025.Death comes in the afternoon in a nearby 1960 drawing, in wet flowing black ink, of acorrida, a bullfight. A man on a horse has stuck his lance into the mighty bull that lowers its head as if in a willing self-sacrifice. Theatre Picasso claims to view the artist as “performative”, setting his works in a dark stage-like space, on theatre flats, with spotlights and mood music. The gimmick’s real effect is to illumine his Spanishness. (Cue castanets.) From his unlikely drag act as Carmen to this heartbreaking bullfight scene, the country he left as a young artist haunts the show just as its suffering haunted him.In his 1937 comic strip The Dream and Lie of Franco, the fascist leader in the Spanish civil war is a genuinely obscene Don Quixote, his eyes on phallic stalks protruding from a hairy pig’s arse of a face as he squares up to a mighty bull representing the Spanish workers. As his violence becomes crueller, a woman flees a burning house with her dead baby in her arms, a timeless, devastating image of war.Close by is Tate’s Weeping Woman, the great painting he did in 1937 alongside Guernica. You can see the Luftwaffe bombers reflected in her eyes. What you notice in front of the original here is how he added a stroke of blue over one plane, just in case it was too strident. So Picasso, tough guy artist, comes courageously close to bathos in this painting. As this woman weeps, her hair is a flowing river of hope while a bee feasts on her tears. Some good must come of the horror.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is he even figurative? He is the inventor (with Braque) of abstraction and collage. In his early cubist art, there is no sex or death – just an eye engrossed by the small stuff of reality in which it sees infinities. You are brought back to basics by the dots of grapes in Bowl of Fruit, Violin and Bottle from 1913. So much beauty, so much mystery. It is because Picasso loves the little good things so much that he can face modernity’s horrors without despair.

This sharp 90s satire – the Conservatives have been in power for 17 years – has the misfortune of being McEwan’s only novel to win the Booker prize in his 50-year career, despite being widely considered one of his slightest. But it fizzes along like the champagne that is part of the euthanasia pact hatched by the two men in a plot that even theauthor conceded was “rather improbable”. New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani was right when she concluded that it wastestament to the author’s skillthat he had managed “to toss off a minor entertainment with such authority and aplomb” to win the gong he had so long deserved.View image in fullscreen9First Love, Last Rites(1975)A pickled penis, cat-roasting, incest, cross-dressing and child abuse are just some of the unsettling fare served up in McEwan’s first short story collection, published when he was just 27. The literary world was shocked and enthralled. “Even the positive reviews were scandalised,”McEwan wrote later. “What monster had come among us?” The monster was here to stay.View image in fullscreen8The Cement Garden(1978)Everyone remembers the first time they readThe Cement Garden. “I did not kill my father, but I sometimes felt I had helped him on his way,” begins the chillingly impassive voice of the teenage narrator Jack. Four children bury their dead mother in the cellar and the oldest siblings end up having sex. McEwan’s first novel is as hard and smooth as the concrete in which both parents fetch up, and it left a dark imprint on the psyche of a generation of teenagers. He didn’t earn his nickname Ian Macabre for nothing.View image in fullscreen7Black Dogs(1992)Bernard and June Tremaine, married but unable to live together, represent “the twin poles” of rationalism and spiritualism at the heart of this novel of ideas. Set against the fall of the Berlin Wall, McEwan’s fifth novel isconsidered a “neglected gem”by critics. It is also, apparently, one of the author’s favourites. The eponymous slavering black dogs may be metaphors for man’s capacity for evil, but in the novel’s climax they are terrifyingly real. “They will return to haunt us, somewhere in Europe, in another time”: the final line seems depressingly prophetic today.View image in fullscreen6Saturday(2005)For those early McEwan devotees bemoaning that he had gone over to the light side, Saturday was the point of no return. Set on 15 February 2003, when 2 million people took to the streets of London to protest against the invasion of Iraq, the novel follows a day in the – very comfortable – life of neurosurgeon Henry Perowne: early-morning lovemaking with his wife; a game of squash; a visit to his elderly mother; and a lovingly prepared bouillabaisse for supper.John Banville declared it a “dismayingly bad book”, and the ending might be preposterous (Matthew Arnold saves the day!), but the novel hums with the same technical mastery and polish as the silver Mercedes in which Perowne drives around Fitzrovia.The prince of darkness ascended to “England’s national author”.View image in fullscreen5Nutshell(2016)McEwan’s 14th novel is a rewriting of Hamlet told by a foetus in utero – but don’t let that put you off. Reflections on mortality, the climate emergency and neuroscience are all squeezed into 200 pages. “Not everyone knows what it is to have your father’s rival’s penis inches from your nose,” gives a whole new perspective on the Oedipal undertones of Shakespeare’s original.McEwan once compared comic novelsto being pinned down and tickled. Here he is on ticklish form: funny, weird and deadly serious.View image in fullscreen4Enduring Love(1997)The balloon accident at the beginning of Enduring Love cemented McEwan’s reputation as the master of the gripping opening set piece. A picnic on a sunny afternoon. A nice bottle of wine. A cry for help. Five men hold on to the ropes of a hot-air balloon to try to save a 10-year-old boy in the basket. One by one they let go. “Hanging a few feet above the Chilterns escarpment, our crew enacted morality’s ancient, irresolvable dilemma: us, or me.” The reader remains suspended in a state of high anxiety until the last page of this story of a stalker’s obsession.“I wanted to write a book in praise of rationality, which gets a poor showing in literature,” McEwan told Radio 4’s Bookclub.View image in fullscreen3On Chesil Beach(2007)“They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible,” begins this slim, elegant novel. It is 1962, the year before “sexual intercourse began”, as Philip Larkin has it, but begin it must for the newlywed art graduate Edward Mayhew and violinist Florence Ponting. It doesn’t go well. Each misinterprets the other’s moves in a way that would be comic were it not so sad. McEwan dismantles this nascent marriage with the same forensic attention he oncedismembered a corpse in The Innocent.View image in fullscreen2Lessons(2022)Spanning a 70-year stretch from the postwar period to the present day, Lessons is McEwan’s longest and also most autobiographical work, “anovel of the backwards look”, as the author put it. The novel interweaves the story of Roland Baines from his army childhood in Libya to boarding school in Suffolk (both also apply to the author), unsatisfactory jobs, love affairs and marriages, with global events from the Suez and Cuban crises up to Brexit and the pandemic. The unsettling opening section about an intense affair between 14-year-old Roland and a young piano teacher is vintage McEwan. Lessons charts a generation’s decline from youthful optimism to political disillusionment and despair. A friend of McEwan’s wrote to say it had the feel of a last novel. Fortunately, they were wrong: a new book,What We Can Know, set in a future UK partly submerged by rising tides, will be published this month.View image in fullscreen1Atonement(2001)A 1930s country-house romance, a bravura account of the British retreat from Dunkirk in 1940 and a metafictional coda that made some readers want to start the novel from the beginning and others hurl it at the wall – this is McEwan at the height of his powers and determined to show what he could do with them. All his favourite themes are here: loss of innocence, morality, the possibility of absolution and the workings of fiction itself. His old friend Martin Amis described the first 200 pages of Atonement as McEwan’sgreatest achievement. John Updike called it “a beautiful and majestic fictional panorama”. It might not have won the Booker, but its success (andthe starry film adaptation) made McEwan a household name. Nearly 25 years after it was published, Atonement remains one of the finest novels of this century.Explore more on these topicsBooksRankedIan McEwanFictionShort storiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s installation day for the sculpture he’s created for this year’sLondondesign festival and, like the many other visitors to one of the capital’s best known public spaces, he’s enjoying the sunshine.His new work – What Nelson Sees – looks good in the bright light. The fused bundle of weathered steel industrial pipes is eye-catchingly at odds with the grand fountains, statues and Victorian pomp of the massive bronze lions. But this sculpture is completely site-specific: press a play button and look into one of the eyepieces embedded into three of the five pipes and you see images of the surrounding city from the viewpoint of naval commander Horatio Nelson’s statue 45m up in the sky. Keep watching and the eyepiece plays a film which runs through AI-generated imagery of the view since before Nelson’s Column was first erected and then goes on into a possible future of pedestrianised streets and rooftops covered in hydroponics.“I grew up in London,” Cocksedge says, “and I always looked at Nelson’s solitary figure and wondered what it would be like up there. I’ve got sketchbooks going back to when I was a teenager full of ideas about how seeing that view could be possible.”View image in fullscreenAI-generated imagery … What Nelson Sees.Photograph: Mark CocksedgeMany of Cocksedge’s artworks plough this slightly eccentric furrow: concepts that come from a childlike imagination but realised with exceptional craftsmanship and engineering skills. His pieceCoalescenceconsists of 2,500 pieces of anthracite – suspended like a starburst – which represent the amount of coal needed to power a continuously burning lightbulb for a year. TheBourrasqueseries is inspired by light playing on airborne sheets of paper. The spectacle of magically floating paper is delightful (fashion brand Dior now has the artwork permanently installed in their Avenue Montaigne boutique in Paris), but the simple idea can only be achieved using hi-tech materials powered by an electric current.For What Nelson Sees, Cocksedge collaborated with Google to create a mainly AI film of Nelson’s field of view from when the column was first erected in the 1840s. Each scene – from the Blitz through the swinging 1960s to a future landscape adapted for London’s ageing population – is created using meticulous written prompts to ensure historical accuracy and to reflect statistically probable outcomes from research.“Technology had to be part of the work so it felt the right moment for me to experiment,” he says. “It’s very different to my art college days when you had paint and canvas, but I’ve got a four-year-old daughter and an almost 80-year-old dad – I want him to see the city change and I want her to see what the past was like. How else could I do that?”View image in fullscreenPaul Cocksedge in Trafalgar Square, London.Photograph: Stephen Chung/Alamy Live NewsThis whimsical creativity has a clear purpose. Cocksedge’s optimistic vision of London’s future is based on research from experts in climate change and urban planning. “Do you know, in Paris food production is 60% local, whereas in London it’s only 3%? That’s why in the future, we created hydroponics and a much greener city.”The artist believes that public art can be a great way to engage a diverse audience with issues, especially those who don’t often visit galleries.This piece isn’t finished until I see people gazing through the sculpture – their bodies are the last ingredient“My background is working class and my entry point into creativity came very late on. Looking around Trafalgar Square I can see people from different backgrounds interacting with things and that’s great to me. I’m so excited that you can use design to create open situations where you can reach more people and deal with quite important issues in an engaging way. This piece isn’t finished until I see three people gazing through the sculpture – their bodies are the last ingredient.”As the site of many protests, celebrations and rallies over the years, Trafalgar Square has seen all sorts of engagement between different factions, but Cocksedge is still optimistic. “I’m very aware of the challenges this city has. This square is a place that’s always charged. But we keep on going even if it feels dicey. I think London will cope.”The next day, I head down to the installation’s technical test with Elizabeth Dellert, head of development for the festival. Even in the brief time I’m there, about 20 passersby stop to peer into the eyepieces or touch the pipe structure curiously. A businessman whose meeting has been cancelled due to the transport strikes stops to ask about the sculpture. It turns out that he runs a mentoring service inspired by Nelson’s leadership strategy. A conversation instantly starts with Dellert, who studied history, about the influence of military infrastructure on business hierarchy, team loyalty and how Lady Emma Hamilton, Nelson’s mistress, deserves recognition.Watching tourists and locals pause at the sculpture and listening to this spontaneous conversation, I thought back to my conversation with Cocksedge and how his piece wouldn’t be finished until people – the missing ingredient – were there. I wished he’d been there to see this moment when it finally became complete.What Nelson Sees is in Trafalgar Square, London, until 18 September.

The actor talks about tech shocks, doomscrolling and the agent who told her to go back to CanadaMon 15 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 07.26 EDTShareThis summer, Sandra Oh stood behind a lectern at a graduation ceremony in New Hampshire, preparing to give university-leavers words of hope at a time of permacrisis. She rose to the challenge, opening up about her past battles with depression and anxiety, before making a heartfelt case for embracing discomfort and kindness “so we can meet cruelty again and again and not lose our humanity”. This was increasingly important, she explained, when many world leaders “claim power through fear and oppression”. And then came the moment that would go viral. Oh instructed everyone to stand up and do something Cristina Yang,her career-making character on Grey’s Anatomy, used to do when times got tough. “Dance it out!” she exhorted as David Guetta’s Titanium washed over the crowd. “Remember this feeling!”“I was very, very,verynervous about it,” says Oh. “I worked really hard.” She had been putting herself into the mindset of 20-year-olds not just worried about their own futures but about the larger picture. “The world is burning!” she says, imagining their dark thoughts. “There’s wars all over!My heart is so heavy, so all I’m going to do is doomscroll.” But, crucially, Oh wanted her audience to find their way to joy – thus the dancing. “Sitting there trying to bear the pain in the world,” she says, neatly summing up the philosophy she shared that day, “will help you figure out how to be in the world.”There are now T-shirts emblazoned the words Oh said at the Emmys: ‘It’s an honour just to be Asian’That speech – with its vulnerability and compassion, its awareness of the world’s cruelties while still finding moments of joy – feels particularly on-brand for Oh. Born near Ottawa to Korean immigrant parents, the actor, whose star turns in Grey’s Anatomy and Killing Evemade her the first Asian woman to win multiple Golden Globes, has since gained fans for her fierce support of wider representation in the industry. There are now popular T-shirts emblazoned with the words Oh famously said at the Emmys: “It’s an honour just to be Asian.”View image in fullscreenMultiple awards … with Jodie Comer in Killing Eve.Photograph: David Emery/BBC AmericaWarm and sparkling, her own speech today is filled with plenty of laughs. “Hold on baby!” is the first thing I hear as she speaks to me by phone from New York, playing for time as she tries and fails to turn on her camera. But Oh soon becomes more reflective, prone to lengthy pauses as she talks about everything from the climate emergency to AI to racial equality.Fittingly, Oh’s latest project – the indie Canadian sci-fi film Can I Get a Witness? – is about finding salvation amid the burning. After an apocalyptic, AI-engineered disaster hits Earth in the very deliberately chosen year of 2025, human life has been rebuilt. It’s 2040: peace has been achieved. Offices, computers and smartphones are relics of a damned civilisation. People spend their days tending to their gardens. But there are conditions: they don’t travel, electricity is restricted and – the biggest catch – everyone must die a government-mandated death at 50. Oh plays Ellie, a survivor of the 2025 catastrophe, who is supporting her daughter into her new job as a “documenter” of these “end of life” ceremonies. These can be picked from a brochure, with options including church memorials and beachside goodbyes with champagne.When your primary source of love is the phone, something is happening to you at an unconscious, very powerful level“I was most interested in the script’s contemplation of dying,” says Oh, in particular how the knowledge of one’s impending death would change one’s approach to life. It’s an increasingly urgent question, Oh says, recalling an early screening last year in Santa Barbara while wildfires raged across Los Angeles. It brought home the idea that the film is not really about the future. “It is what’s happeningright now,” she says. “We are in the burningright now.”When they were making the film, Oh asked director and writer Ann Marie Fleming to include AI in the script. How does she think technology is changing our lives? “Phones and social media,” she says, “are retraining human beings.When your primary source of love is the phone, something is happening to you at an unconscious, very powerful level.”Her own solution to this retraining – “I’m already struggling, and I didn’t grow up with this technology” – is choosing to do “small, profoundly meaningful” films such as this latest one, as well as theatre. She has been playingOlivia in Twelfth Night at the Delacorte in New York’s Central Park. “I’m engaging with 2,000 people in an open-air theatre. You can feel people really want to come to the show to laugh, have a good time, for it to be joyous, out in nature. You’re in community and you’re communing – through Shakespeare.” In the age of the machine, “such true human interactions become way more important”.View image in fullscreenSearch for salvation…Can I Get a Witness?Photograph: Ed AraquelOh talks a lot about making conscious choices, active decisions. “This is the gift of midlife,” says the actor, who has just turned 54. “There is so much in culture, in society, that you’ve been living in unconsciously. But you see that crack of light coming through – and realise that’s what you want to follow. I think that’s what midlife is about. And it’s very engaging.”Oh has also spoken about unlearning the racism she internalised from her early years, singling out a wounding experience with an agent when she arrived in LA in 1995. The agent advised her to go back toCanadaas there weren’t any opportunities for Asian actors in the US. Decades later, on receiving the Killing Eve script, Oh couldn’t work out which supporting part was intended for her. “Honey,” her agent said. “It’s Eve.”In recent years, Oh has put her considerable heft into stories from the Asian diaspora, acting in Domee Shi’s Pixar romp Turning Red, Iris Shim’s intergenerational horror Umma, and Jessica Yu’s family comedy Quiz Lady. She’s also played secretary Sofia Mori in Vietnam war drama The Sympathiser and frazzled academic Ji-Yoon Kim in Netflix series The Chair.All theseroles, unlike the ones that made her famous, specifically consider her character’s heritage in the script.“I remember being at the Oscars whenEverything Everywhere All at Onceswept the awards,” she says. “It was so important. To build something, you need a larger community – to get traction, to get the experience, to know how to support each other. When I started, actors like Daniel Dae Kim or John Cho – we’d known each other for ever, but we never shared a stage or set, because we were always on our own. It’s still a tough industry, veering towards, honestly, a patriarchal white mainstream.”View image in fullscreenFrazzled academic … Oh in The Chair.Photograph: Eliza Morse/APDiversity, equity and inclusion may be under attack today, but Oh believes in them wholeheartedly. “I find the people who vilify it, or are scared of it, are very, very questionable.” She hopes that for Asian-Americans in Hollywood, “the door that’s opened in the past 10 years – or not even that –sevenyears – remains open. And enough of us have passed through, and gained a foothold, to make projects that will bring others through.”It’s a useful segue to the question I’ve been burning to ask. “You said one of my favourite quotes of all time,” I tell her. “Oh god,” she replies. “What is it?”Two years ago, theNew Yorkerasked Oh about the comparatively fewer opportunities she’s had from white male directors and major studios. “It’s like being able to get over a bad boyfriend,” she responded. “They’re not going to call. Just move on and hang out with the young women who want you to be their mom.”“Did Isay that?” Oh laughs in disbelief. “Can you tell me the quote again?” I repeat it. “Well,” she says, recovering a little. “That’s a simple way of saying, ‘Go where you’re wanted.’”‘Hollywood has everything to do with the terrible state of the world’: Charlie Kaufman on AI, Eternal Sunshine and toothacheRead moreTo prove the point, she reels off the names of the various creators behind her biggest breaks: Shonda Rhimes with Grey’s Anatomy, Phoebe Waller-Bridge with Killing Eve, Amanda Peet with The Chair, Park Chan-wook with The Sympathiser. One exception, she says, is Robert Wuhl, who cast her in sports agent sitcom Arliss, one of her first major roles in LA. It did not lead to a stampede. Or as Oh puts it: “The old white patriarchy hasn’t knocked on my door yet!” Then she adds: “I’m glad I said that quote now. I said it because it’s like – where am I going to put my power? I’m going to put it in the young women who see something in me.”This summer, at alive podcasting eventin New York, Oh read aloud from her old diary, with entries that stretch all the way back to childhood. One, written right after her upsetting meeting with the LA agent, goes: “The pain’s the same and overwhelming and you try not to take it so personally or cosmically, but you feel it. Nothing she could think of to send me out on? Nothing? There’s nothing there for me? Why am I here?”What would she say to that past self now? “I’m so sorry it’s so painful right now,” she says, her voice full of tenderness. “But it will change. I’m not saying you’ll get everything you think you want. And I know you have no idea how it’s going to change.” Oh pauses, gathers her thoughts. “That lesson on how things will change,” she says. “The impermanence of things. It’s hard to figure that out. I think that takes a lifetime.”Can I Get a Witness? is in UK cinemas from 19 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmCanadaAsia PacificinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We asked how it is affecting our readersAlfie Packhamand Anandita AbrahamMon 15 Sep 2025 08.49 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 19.01 EDTShare‘There’s just not that much on offer in Cambridge,” says Ella Stranger, 22. “We’ll either just go to the pub, or go out in London, or honestly, not do anything at all.” Ella, who moved to Cambridge to study in 2020, says there has been “a real lack of spontaneity” to nightlife in the city since the Covid pandemic restrictions were lifted in 2021.“The main big venue is Cambridge Junction, with regional or UK DJs or acts, and tickets would be £20 to £30. So not really the type of thing that you would go to weekly,” she says.Since she graduated in 2023, Ella has found that nights out with her friends “take a lot more planning and coordination. Partly I think it’s because of Covid: some venues never reopened. And partly because of the costs. And if you can see there aren’t a lot of tickets sold, you won’t go in the first place – if you worry that a night is going to be dead, you’re not going to buy a ticket in advance.”View image in fullscreenElla Stranger.One in fourlate-night venues across the UK have closed since 2020– almost 800 in total – with closures accelerating this year. Three venues have shut each week on a net basis over the past three months, according to the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA). The NTIA has warned of a potential for “night-time deserts” if there are not urgent tax cuts for nightclubs and music venues.Nick, 51, an electronic musician from Oxford, says the live music scene has noticeably changed in the city over the 13 years he has lived there. “In central Oxford, we now have almost no music venues,” he says. “I’m having to look for gigs in London.” In recent years, Oxford’sPurple Turtlenightclub,the Cellarmusic venue and most recently the grassroots gig venuethe Wheatsheafhave all closed.“You have to go to Jericho or down Cowley Road,” says Nick. “If bands like Radiohead, Supergrass and Foals started up now, they would have to join the queue to play, as there are more bands than venues can handle. The more popular local acts get the first choice of gigs, while many artists have to be more creative and either put gigs on themselves, or use other spaces such as the Modern Art museum or the Old Fire Station.”It’s a similar story in bigger cities such as Birmingham. David Garside, 51, a musician, recalls a livelier scene in decades past. “TheOld Railway in Digbethwas an old-fashioned pub with live music pretty much every night. That was knocked down to make way for the Millennium Point.“The Hibernian in Stirchley, where Pulp played, has been an empty shell for years. [It has since beenrenamed and turned into a restaurant.] South of the city, Moseley was always swarming with musicians. But pretty much all of its live music bedrock has vanished.The Jug of Ale– a touring venue – was demolished. There are a few open mic nights in some of the bars. Not very inspiring.”In Redhill, Surrey, there are no established late-night music venues at all. It’s something Steve Trigg, 63, wants to remedy. “Since I’ve lived here, Redhill has never really had much in the way of venues,” he says. “We hada little nightclub, Liquid & Envy, that was open for a while. We have things like corners of pubs where people play, but generally there’s been very little music.”View image in fullscreenSteve Trigg, co-founder of Redstart, a community charity that promotes music in the Redhill, Merstham, Reigate and Earlswood areas.Photograph: Guardian CommunityTrigg is one of the co-founders of Redstart Community, a charity that for six months has run pop-up music gigs in the town’s shopping centre.“We’ve had some rappers, and a punk night, quite a lot of indie music and an acoustic night. It has been very positive. One night we had a crowd of over 130, and we normally get in 40 to 60. It’s new to quite a lot of the people here to actually have music here, without having to go by train into London to try and see some.”Meanwhile, London’s own late night venues have declined. “People move to London because it’s a creative cultural global city,” says Kate, 32, from Camberwell. “And then they realise they can’t cope with the noise and they complain to the council – and the council can be too quick to side with the residents. That’s what happened tothe Sekforde pub in Clerkenwell, which is run by a friend of mine.“I get that living near a venue can be noisy, but the council should have regulation that accommodates that. I feel like we’re forgetting that the positives – the people who enjoy it – outweigh the people who don’t.”Kate grew up in south London. “As a teenager you felt like the city is yours and you can do anything you want. The older I’ve got, that feeling has gone. I’m not sure if it’s me getting older, or London getting boring. But I have a couple of friends in bands and every time they’re doing a gig, I know it’s going to be one of four places.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPubsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cause if you chat shit you will get banged. Rest in peace Charlie Kirk, you piece of shit.”In a statement, organisers said: “While we understand that these statements were made in the context of punk and activism, and that the reporting on them is sometimes less nuanced than what actually happened, we still believe these new statements go too far. They no longer fall within the scope of what we can offer a platform.”The 013 venue said it had initially decided to let the duo perform “despite the controversy that arose after their Glastonbury performance”. At this year’s festival, the frontman led chants of “death to the IDF”, prompting an ongoing criminal investigation by Avon and Somerset police. The band also had their US visas revoked, scuppering an autumn tour.After the band clarified that the chant was “not an antisemitic slogan, but rather criticism of the Israeli army”, 013 decided to go ahead with the show.The UK branch of Turning Point, the right-wing youth group that Kirk founded, claimed that in footage of the Paradiso show, Bobby Vylan “mocks and glorifies the brutal murder” of Kirk.In response to the show’s cancellation and allegations that the band celebrated Kirk’s death, Bobby Vylan said in a video: “At no point during yesterday’s show was Charlie Kirk’s death celebrated. At no point whatsoever did we celebrate Charlie Kirk’s death. I did call him a piece of shit. That much is true. But at no point was his death celebrated. If it was, go find me a quote, go find me something that proves that we were celebrating his death. You’re not gonna find it, because it didn’t happen.“What did happen is one reporter that bought their ticket online came with the sole purpose of finding something to report and after I called [Kirk] a piece of shit and we played a song, they have written that up as a celebration. It’s not a celebration … Calm down.”The band subsequently tweeted: “They want us down so bad but we just played a sold-out Paradiso. It’s always love in Amsterdam.”Prior to the Amsterdam show, the band called BBC director general Tim Davie “a spineless puppet” on X in relation to the controversy around why the live feed of the band’s Glastonbury performance was not cut after he made his comments. “There was nothing antisemitic or criminal about anything I said at Glastonbury. Why do you think @metpoliceuk @ASPolice are taking so long?”Who are Bob Vylan?

A Boardmasters spokesperson said the festival did not “tolerate hate speech” or “incitement to violence”. Devon and Cornwall police said they were happy with the measures put in place at the festival.Legal timeframes meant the hearing could not happen until after the festival. The council also heard from locals who supported Bob Vylan’s appearance at the festival.There was ultimately no unrest or disorder during the band’s performance. Singer Bobby Vylan told the crowd: “It was a little bit of a battle to get here.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPunkNetherlandsEuropeCharlie Kirk shootingnewsShareReuse this content"

The prize will honour women across all genres who “have been trailblazers in their field, especially in the past when it was more difficult for women to have successful careers as writers”, said the RSL.The inaugural winner is 91-year-old Maureen Duffy, a poet, playwright, novelist, nonfiction writer and activist whose works include the 1966 novel The Microcosm, set in the lesbian club Gateways in London.Duffy found out she had won the prize when Evaristo visited her at home earlier this month. “I hope this encourages writers to keep on writing, because it is a hard thing to support yourself as a writer in this country,” she said.Asked by Evaristo how it felt to be acknowledged as a pioneer, Duffy said “it’s a funny old thing. I suppose I’ll get used to it. But at the moment it seems extraordinary, really.”Evaristo was announced as the Women’s prize outstanding contribution winner in June. The one-off prize, funded by Bukhman Philanthropies, was awarded to Evaristo based on her body of work, which includes the 2019 Booker winner Girl, Woman, Other, as well as her “unwavering dedication to uplifting under-represented voices across the cultural landscape”.“It felt right that I should share this substantial and unexpected windfall with other older women writers as a way to acknowledge their pioneer spirits and achievements,” said Evaristo. “It’s very easy to forget the feminist struggles of the past and the intrepid women who paved the way for successive generations, and it’s important to celebrate our trailblazers while they are still around to enjoy it.”“It’s no secret that older women writers tend to be overlooked, while older male writers often enjoy substantial careers until they topple over into their graves,” shewrote in the Observeron Sunday. “While Duffy has sadly slipped from view of late […] she deserves to be better known to younger generations﻿.”While Evaristo herself chose Duffy – in a decision she described as a “no-brainer” – for the inaugural prize, future years of the award will focus on a particular literary genre, and be judged by specialists in the field, including agents, publishers, critics, and writers. Each winner will be asked to spotlight a “deceased and forgotten” female writer who inspired them when they were starting out, as well as three emerging writers.Duffy has written more than 60 works across a range of genres. She won her first poetry competition aged 17, and completed her first play while studying English at King’s College London. In the late 1950s, she worked as a schoolteacher, before turning to writing full-time after being commissioned to produce a screenplay by Granada Television. In the early 60s, she began campaigning for gay rights, and was one of the first public figures to come out as lesbian.Duffy went on to write for stage, screen and radio. In 1968, she was one of the first group of women to have extracts of their plays staged by the National Theatre, and the first to have a full run of a play, Rites, produced by the Jeanetta Cochrane theatre, where the National was then based.She has written almost 30 plays and a dozen poetry collections, as well as works of nonfiction including a biography of English playwright Aphra Behn, considered the first English woman to earn a living by writing.“When I conceived of the prize, Maureen Duffy was always foremost in my mind as the recipient because she is a true trailblazer in every sense of the word,” said Evaristo. “Raised in a working-class, single-parent family, she has had a prodigious, prolific and varied career as a brilliant, imaginative and groundbreaking writer since the early 1960s, as well as being an advocate for writers. She was instrumental in campaigning for writers’ licensing rights, which led to the formation of the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society.”Duffy’s win will be marked at an event at the British Library, London, on 30 November.Explore more on these topicsBooksAwards and prizesBernardine EvaristoPoetrynewsShareReuse this content"

Together, we carry the legacy my husband and I began – one that nurtures children’s inner light and gives young artists the freedom to create outside the lines.”Malcolm-Jamal Warner often publicly shared his pride in his wife and their daughter but had chosen to keep their identities private before hisdrowning deathin Costa Rica in July.At the organization’swebsite, Tenisha Warner wrote that River & Ember stemmed from her knowledge of psychology as well as her “personal journey with grief and love”. She said the group’s name came from the presence and spirit her late husband embodied.Tenisha Warner called Malcolm both “a river – steady, sure and always moving toward what matters” and “an ember – glowing with encouragement, igniting possibility in those around him”.“Your love was the first story I ever wanted to keep telling,” Tenisha Warner wrote. “And now, through River & Ember, it becomes an invitation for every family – to tend their own light, to carry their own ember forward.”Tenisha Warner’s Instagram homage was widely applauded by users of the platform. A typical reply read: “This is such a beautiful, powerful tribute to Malcolm!”Another read: “What a beautiful photo and continuing of his mighty legacy!”A native of Jersey City, New Jersey, Warner and his family were vacationing in Costa Rica when a riptide ensnared him while he swam with his daughter, aged eight, off the shore of Cocles beach on 20 July.As the New York Daily Newsreported, there were no lifeguards on duty at the time. Surfers in the area saw Warner and his daughter struggling and managed to get the two to shore, the Daily News recounted.Death of Malcolm-Jamal Warner shocks fans: ‘We saw ourselves in him’Read moreBut emergency responders soon pronounced Warner dead at the scene.Warner, 54, was perhaps best known for his role as fictional teenager Theo Huxtable on the sitcom The Cosby Show from 1984 to 1992. He earned a 1986 Emmy nomination for outstanding actor in a comedy series.More recently, he starred on Malcolm & Eddie, its fellow sitcom Reed Between the Lines, and the medical drama The Resident.Warner earned a 2015 best traditional R&B performance Grammy for Jesus Children. He was also nominated for a 2023 best spoken word poetry album for Hiding In Plain View – and he launched a podcast series named Not All Hood that explored the lives of Black people in the US.“He transitioned from a teen star to a respected adult without the baggage we often from others in his generation,” Gil Robertson, the co-founder and president of the African American Film Critics Association,saidto the Associated Press in July. “That’s no small feat.”Warner’s Cosby Show co-star Phylicia Rashad – who portrayed his mother, Clair Huxtable, on the sitcom – honored him at Sunday’s Emmys at the top of the annual ceremony’s in memoriam segment by saying he “remains in our hearts”.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionUS televisionBlack US culturePhilanthropyCharitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

But could she ever have predicted that more than 200 years later, balls held in her honour would be selling out in 15 minutes?This year, the largest and longest-running Jane Austen festival, held in Bath, brings together more than 3,000 fans, or Janeites as they prefer to be called, to celebrate the life and legacy of the beloved author. From balls and cream teas to festival fayres and dance lessons, for 10 days the city transforms into a living homage to Austen’s world. But what keeps modern audiences so captivated by this imagined past?View image in fullscreenA group of re-enactors enjoy afternoon tea at the Bath BunElizabeth and Peter, a couple from London united by their shared love of Austen’s novels, have come down specifically to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the author’s birth. For Elizabeth, originally from Zimbabwe, Austen’s message of perseverance particularly resonates. “I grew up in a colonial era, it was difficult, but for me Austen’s novels helped me realise that everyone has a place in the world and that you do matter even if you’ve been told something different,” she says.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenThe re-enactment group His Majesty’s 33rd Regiment of Foot camp out overnight at the Holburne Museum (top) before leading the Grand Regency promenadeRecent film adaptations and TV series such as Bridgerton have helped to attract a broader, more diverse crowd. A group of bookTokers who met online more than a decade ago say they have seen a big shift in representation since they first came to the festival four years ago. “Things are changing for the better as more and more people see themselves represented,” says Lex, wearing a dandy outfit that feels more aligned with how they identify today.View image in fullscreenFriends at the Grand Regency Costume PromenadeSome fans are rewriting the script themselves. Joy Michelle Austin, a writer and blogger from California, sells her contemporary Austen adaptations at the author fayre organised by the festival. For her version of Pride and Prejudice, she reimagines prejudice as the prejudice of race, and the former antagonist Caroline Bingley has been rewritten and re-centred as a Nigerian American love interest. “For me as a woman of colour, it was important to write a story that we can see ourselves in,” she says.View image in fullscreenNo Austen festival is complete without a Regency ballView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFor Sanne, attending the festival gives her an opportunity to learn some new sewing skills. Many of the attenders we speak to have hand-sewn their outfits with the help of traditional patterns or with the help of Pinterest and YouTube.

There was an appreciation and knowledge of art and culture that just doesn’t exist today.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: Elizabeth and Peter share the same love for Jane Austen’s novels. Left: handmade stockings that read ‘Vintage fashion not vintage values’. Right: a festival steward wearing an elaborate waistcoatThere’s a synergy between the city and the festival that would be hard to recreate elsewhere, not least because Bath featured prominently in Austen’s life and novels. Despite her complicated relationship with the city, today’s Janeites revel in the ease with which the city evokes the Regency world so vividly depicted in her work. Cruising down the Georgian streets, eating Bath buns, enjoying croquet on the lawns, it’s hard to not feel instantly transported into Austen’s past.View image in fullscreenBath’s Parade GardensBut the festival has become a victim of its own success. “It’s like getting tickets to Glastonbury,” says a Janeite, bemoaning her lack of success with ticketed events this year. Another describes how she spent a lunch break trying to get tickets to the Pleasure Gardens, but the website crashed and she missed out.View image in fullscreenA couple of festivalgoers taking a break in McDonald’sFortunately, for those who aren’t in luck, the goodwill and passion of the Janeites means there is no shortage of informal Austen-inspired events taking place across the city – from the Bath backpackers’ hostel organising regency dress salsa classes for their guests, to an unofficial ball organised by festival newcomers determined not to miss out on the experience.View image in fullscreenA group from California celebrate their friend’s 40th birthday“Welcome ladies and …” a slight pause as the caller, Mrs Bennet, of the Bath Regency Phoenix ball, searches for the men in the room. “Ah, gentlemen,” she says, finally spying one.

Though it’s not a requirement, the Janeites slip into a more formal, flowery diction, not unlike their hero’s prose, and as they nibble on cucumber sandwiches and rout cakes, exchanging compliments about each other’s outfits and festival pleasantries, it’s hard to believe it’s 2025. A split-second later, a phone comes out and an Instagram story is posted and the illusion cracks.Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayJane AustenSomersetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both books are set at an Ivy League university in a crime-ridden New England town; from various well-seeded clues, we can identify this as Brown University. Here it is called Warren, because the Bunnyverse is unabashedly silly and self-referential. Rabbit jokes abound.The first book followed Samantha, an alienated, cash-strapped creative writing student cold-shouldered by her workshop cohort, a cabal of four ultra-feminine rich girls who all call each other Bunny. The Bunnies wear fluffy dresses, eat mini food and – as Samantha learns when she’s finally inducted into their cult – express their creativity through demonic rites that involve exploding rabbits. Samantha has to transcend them to find her voice as an artist. The story of Bunny is the result.We Love You, Bunny begins with Samantha bound and gagged in an attic. The Bunnies surround her, congratulating her venomously on the success of her book. Now they want to tell their story. Passing an axe like a talking stick, they introduce us to four versions of their Bunny-centric world. Then they pass the mic to a special guest.While Awad happily annihilates her characters, she seems to get a real kick out of bitchinessThis follow-up has the key strengths of the original, particularly its scabrous satire on upper-middle-class American femininity. The Bunnies binge-watch reality TV show The Bachelorette,are performatively gaga for the Brontës and Virginia Woolf, and hug each other incontinently, squealing insincere endearments. Their narcissism, when thwarted, fuels a rage that becomes only more explosive for being repressed. Their friendship is a psychic mind-meld that threatens to dissolve them, even as they resent, denigrate and seek to crush each other. Each Bunny writes in a precious-girl genre: the proem; the Angela Carter sex-with-monsters story; Kathy Ackerish shock porn; a post-feminist work apostrophising kitchen appliances. One Bunny imagines her mentor saying: “I will help you birth [this book] from your mind’s vagina … into a living entity of double-spaced pages beautifully screaming.”There is a brinkmanship to this kind of satire; it can all too easily cross into misogyny. But while Awad happily annihilates these characters, she seems to get a real kick out of femmeness, and even bitchiness. She fully understands the appeal of drinking a London Fog with a hot friend whose allegiance to you is uncertain, but whose apartment is much nicer than yours, and whose dedication to braiding your hair is total.We Love You, Bunny suffers from a certain sequelitis. It’s baggier than the original. Its metaphors for creativity feel less earned. The game of visiting each Bunny’s point of view also disappoints. They remain two-dimensional mean girls, each a slightly different flavour of shallow, insecure, pretentious and cruel. Where their viciousness is explained, it’s the legacy of wealthy families who can’t love. This use of popular-girl tropes was brilliant in Bunny, where theStepford wifesameness was key to the horror, and Samantha’s longing/loathing implicitly made it partly her projection. Here, inhabiting their loathsomeness becomes a bit of a chore.This is redeemed, however, when we come to the last voice of the novel. As those who have read it will remember, the exploded rabbits turn into hot-boyfriend golems with rabbit paws. Here we meet the first of these bunnymen, who comes into existence wearing the pearls of one Bunny and the dress of another, while carrying the axe of a third (a tool which sees plenty of use by the novel’s end). Unlike his successors, he is fully anatomically human and has a mind of his own, while remaining a Bunny product. Named Aerius after an allergy medication, he tells his story in a Brontë/chicklit Frankenspeech, peppered with both smiley and frowny faces, cutesy neologisms such as “Manny Scripts” and “Lappy Top” and words like “twas” and “afeared”. He’s prone to rhapsodising in breathless fragments: “The hum of Grasses! The Moon casting her slivery Light on my Face! Aerius felt alive!” In short, he is both adorable and hilarious.Toward the end, a writing professor passes judgment on the story we’re in: “A touch too camp.Zany.A sort of zanyromantasy,isn’t it?” Yes, it is, but Awad is here to show us that romantasy can be serious literature, andnothingcan really be too camp. And if We Love You, Bunny has weaknesses endemic to sequels, it also has their strengths. There’s the fun of meeting the old characters and seeing areas we wondered about before, but it also builds on the original, opening up new territory and making new jokes. And though it’s better to start with the first novel, We Love You, Bunny can be read alone. It’s a goofy, overblown flower of a book with lots of thorns that pleasurably scratch.We Love You, Bunny by Mona Awad is published by Scribner (£16.99).

In their third film together, the rising Canadian actor is at once magnetic and utterly heartbreaking as Simon, a young gay artist honing a budding career as a drag queen. At night, he transforms into Glory Gore, a glittery vision dressed in exquisite costumes that have been lovingly designed by his sister Maude (Alice Moreault). Off stage, Simon is much less self-assured, despite his swagger. An unexpected visit from his absent mother Claire (Anne-Marie Cadieux), along with a toxic romance with fellow drag performer Olivier (Félix Maritaud), soon throw this sensitive soul into an emotional whirlpool.Dupuis’s astute writing keenly conveys the paradox of falling for a narcissistic manipulator. At first glance Olivier is a perfect creative and life partner, but soon whittles down Simon’s self-esteem with jabs about the latter’s talent and looks. As the relationship grows more dysfunctional, Dupuis pushes Pellerin to the edge of the frame, a visual correlation of his isolation among his real-life and drag family. Pellerin, moreover, embodies the character’s turmoil with stunning physicality; his quivering gaze betrays a vulnerability that starkly contrasts with his larger-than-life stage persona – and yet, like a boiling frog, he also luxuriates in the attention of his cruel lover.Performing, here, is a double-edged sword. Even when Simon leaves the nightclub, he is compelled to continue playing the part of the cool, obedient boyfriend. But Solo is far from yet another queer tragedy, making space for the joy of self-expression, rendered through dazzling sequences of thrilling drag performances that range from sexy and political to plain silly. At a time when this art form is increasingly under threat, such representations feel particularly essential and powerful.Solo is in UK and Irish cinemas from 19 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDragLGBTQ+ rightsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Composed from a wealth of archive audiovisual material available on the internet, Elene Asatiani and Soso Dumbadze’s film is at once passionate and clear-eyed. Apart from reconstructing the chain of events through editing, the directors keep the found footage as it is, with no voiceover added, interviews, or digital manipulation. Their only visible intervention is to categorise the source of each video with small white text that reads “Pro-Government Camera”, “KGB Camera”, “Pro-Opposition Camera” and so on.These labels emphasise how records of history are rarely without bias. Presented with this plurality of viewpoints, we as viewers are granted the power to create our own interpretation out of these puzzle pieces. The jubilation surroundingZviad Gamsakhurdia’s swearing-in as president of Georgia quickly morphs into a spiral of violence and unrest. Taking to the streets, paramilitary forces led by opposition figures laid siege to the parliament building for 16 days, culminating in a blood-soaked coup d’etat. In footage captured by both sides of the conflict, the sounds ring out of indiscriminate gunshots and tanks rolling through civilian areas. One particularly harrowing closeup shows a woman cowering by her window, her face distorted by fear.Most of the footage contains pixelated sequences, some are even watermarked with TV channel logos – yet the horror is palpable. The lo-fi aesthetics of Limitation bristle with radical agitation, dismantling ideals about the pure, objective image and stressing the idea that, regardless of visual quality, all recorded footage is infected with hidden agendas and motives. Amid a sea of contradicting political arguments, what remains terrifyingly present in this film is the collective trauma thrust upon ordinary people, forever scarred by bloodshed.Limitation is on True Story from 19 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGeorgiaEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

The theatre’s seven-year renovation has been hard. In that time, many have been lost, including the victims of the pandemic and, only last month, the mightyGiles Havergal, the company’s artistic director from 1969 to 2003.Fitting, then, that the opening production should be a requiem. Less a drama than a mass, it is a eulogy to those killed in the Lockerbie bombing in 1988, the single biggest terrorist loss of life on UK territory. The powerful act one closing song has just three words: “Let us remember.”The nearest parallel to this sentiment-laden music-theatre piece by Frances Poet and Ricky Ross isCome from Away. Both shows are concerned with how small communities deal with global events. In the musical by Irene Sankoff and David Hein, the locals in a Newfoundland town care for those stranded after 9/11; here, the people of a small Scottish town cope with the grief of the downing of Pan Am flight 103 in the most practical way they can.The heartening moral of a heavy story is in the small acts of love they show towards the bereaved families, primarily American, who are otherwise unknown to them. They piece together belongings, clean clothes and create memorials. In the face of tragedy, they offer hope.Poet’s script is strong on detail: the stench of aircraft fuel, the debris causing punctures and the first responder who moves a child’s body for fear it will be eaten by foxes. Uninterested in the reasons for the attack, she presents the personal as political. If Small Acts of Love wallows in sadness, it does so unashamedly.Carrying much of the emotion are Ross’s songs, sweet celebrations of community, their Americana-tinged folk melodies given gentle force by the large – and excellent – ensemble and delicate arrangements by a chamber orchestra under the musical direction of Gavin Whitworth. In Dominic Hill’s consummate production, Tom Piper’s bare-bones set is dynamically lit by Bruno Poet, and even if you miss the grit of conflict, you would need a hard heart not to be moved by its humanist intent.At Citizens theatre, Glasgow, until 4 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreLockerbie plane bombingScotlandGlasgowreviewsShareReuse this content"

Meaning “much in little”, it has become the motto of this minuscule establishment in theWorcestershiretown of Malvern.This is the world’s smallest commercial theatre with room for 12 people – or 16 with some standing – that has been brought back to life by local residents after falling into disrepair and at risk of demolition.Called theTheatreof Small Convenience, it was once a Victorian toilet and measures just 10 sq metres – the stage itself is a snug 1.5 metres.“Places like this are so rare now,” said Loz Samuels, the theatre’s creative director and co-founder of the community interest company which runs it.“People’s experience of culture and entertainment is so digital and different to what it was. Places where you can come in and it’s so intimate and it’s really special – it’s really important to keep it alive.”View image in fullscreenThe exterior of the theatre in Malvern.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianThe theatre was created in 1997 by Dennis Neale, described as a local legend and eccentric performer who spent 19 years putting on puppetry shows in the space that captivated local children.In its heyday it was a much-loved and unique claim to fame for Malvern, with the theatre entering theGuinness World Recordsin 2002.But after Neale’s retirement in 2017, the building fell into disrepair and was badly damaged by a fire caused by a dehumidifier. With a destroyed roof, damp floor and damaged walls, local residents began to fear it would be lost for ever, especially with talk of a development next door.“The fire really damaged the roof, so water got in and the integrity of the building was really vulnerable. It was quite a major renovation,” said Samuels.Along with local volunteers Jan Birtle and Dibah Farooqui, they acquired the building from the council and raised £17,000 from the local community to help get the renovation off the ground.“It needs replastering, it needed rewiring, it needed a new floor, it needed underfloor heating. There’s obviously no room for heaters,” Samuels said. “We’ve still got the world record, but because we’ve had the plastering and the damp proofing, if there’s another contender we’ve got another couple of inches up our sleeve. Only a tad, but it all counts.”The theatre’s deep blue walls are adorned with a vivid gold constellation – with stars “sponsored” by local residents – while intricate wooden carvings frame the stage.The challenge hasn’t been plain sailing, and Samuels has fears for the long-term future of the theatre. The team were recently rejected for Arts Council funding, and admit that with just 12 seats, making the space financially viable will take some creative thinking.View image in fullscreenA plaque on the building honours Dennis Neale, who still lives locally and has given the rejuvenation project his blessing.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianSet to open its doors in October, the theatre’s first show is Sceptre, a seance-themed immersive show designed specifically for the space. There are plans for a Narnia-style Christmas grotto and even weddings in the future.“It is a challenge to find work that fits in here,” she said. “But I feel like the building creates opportunities, you’ve just got to be imaginative. You can make real sensory experiences because you can control the light. As soon as you step foot in here, you forget the world outside, you could be anywhere.”Neale, who still lives locally, has also given the project his blessing and recorded a message that will be played at the start of future performances.“I think what he did is so quintessentially English and so special,” Samuels said. “He’s really happy, although I think at first he was a bit like, who is this crazy woman who’s suddenly really determined to save the theatre, why would you do that?“I don’t think he could understand why anybody would think it was so important to save.”Samuels is urging performers and artists with original ideas for the space to come forward, and despite some nervousness, is optimistic for the future of the venue.“I feel like it’s a strangely magical place and I just believe that the universe will look after it somehow,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWorcestershireGuinness World RecordsEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Based on Carl Foreman’s screenplay, the production will receive its world premiere at the Harold Pinter theatre in London in December, providing a nail-biting alternative to Theatreland’s jollier festive fare.High Noon, once voted thegreatest western ever made, unfolds in real time counting down to the noon arrival of a train in the town of Hadleyville in New Mexico. In the film, Cooper plays Will Kane, a newly married marshal on the brink of retirement, who hears that an outlaw is heading to town seeking vengeance. The drama explores the divide between personal concerns and public duty, not just through the marshal’s dilemma but also through the characters of his wife, Amy, and the townspeople whose support he seeks.View image in fullscreenBilly Crudup.Photograph: Matt Baron/BEI/ShutterstockAmy will be portrayed by Denise Gough (People, Places and Things) in the play, adapted by Eric Roth (whose films include Forrest Gump) and directed by Thea Sharrock. It marks Crudup’s return to the West End after his debut in 2024 inHarry Clarke, a one-man play in which he assumed 19 characters. The star ofAlmost Famous, Big Fish andThe Morning Show, Crudup is a Tony award-winner who has starred on Broadway in plays by Stoppard, Beckett and Chekhov.Producer Paula Wagner said that High Noon “will bring the urgency and heart of the classic film to audiences in a way that feels both timeless and powerfully alive today”. Her fellow producer Tom Werner said: “Every once in a while, I see a play whose themes stick with me long after I leave the theatre. Those experiences are both thrilling and astonishing. It happened recently when I sawSarah Snook in The Picture of Dorian Gray. And it happened when I saw High Noon this summer in a workshop.”High Noon at 70: the politically loaded anti-western adored by US presidentsRead moreWesterns are rare in the West End although an adaptation of another Oscar winner,Brokeback Mountain, was staged in 2023 and Sam Shepard’s True West wasput on in 2018with Kit Harington and Johnny Flynn.High Noon has set and costume designs by Tim Hatley, lighting design by Neil Austin and music by Chris Egan.

Now he is back with an album of synthy pop pumpersLuke TurnerMon 15 Sep 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Sep 2025 06.04 EDTShareAt a recent Monday night gig in London, Joel Gibb – AKA the Hidden Cameras – took to the stage with his acoustic guitar dressed in a sensible white shirt, looking for all the world as if he’d come straight from an office job. As he played a suite of Hidden Cameras songs old and new, the guitar was dropped, the shirt came undone then was removed, revealing a white vest. The room starting shaking to an electronic backing track, and things got sweaty. “It was a rebirth,” he says from a booth in the studio where he recorded new album of electronic pop pumpers Bronto, “like the indie boy gone bad.”View image in fullscreenThe Hidden Cameras Bronto album coverPhotograph: PRThe synth-driven purr and slink of Bronto makes for a startling shift from country-tinged last album Home on Native Land and the exuberant multi-instrumental pop with which the Hidden Cameras first emerged from Toronto, Canada in the early 2000s. This genre twist was thanks to the melodies largely being written in Gibb’s head on the house and techno dancefloors of Berlin, his home for the last two decades. “I kept singing the same refrains to myself over other tracks – the ‘ooh’ and the ‘ah’, the ‘ah’, the ‘ooh’,” he says, “what else are you going to do?Dance musicis very empty, but dancing is meditative.”While this genesis means the album is in part his homage to Berlin, Gibb adds that it’s also a dialogue with Munich, where the songs were fleshed out and recorded with longtime collaborator Nicolas Sierig as they both got to grips with learning how to use a collection of old synthesisers. “It was better to work with someone that’s not in the dance world to make some dance tracks and to create a whole new way of making a record,” he says. Although Berlin is the place to “party in and gain experiences”, Munich became a lens through which to examine them. He praises the city for having “a different vibe. It’s fun to go there and record. It’s calm. It’s clean. It’s conservative.”View image in fullscreen‘Everyone has a song called I Want You, and I am making mine’ … Joel Gibb.Photograph: Max ZerrahnThe tension between the conservative and the hedonist is one of the constants between early Hidden Cameras, when he described the band as “gay church folk music”, and today. Their celebrated 2003 album The Smell Of Our Own celebrated gay sex and an escape from religious shame (Gibb was brought up in the Baptist church), making them outliers from what was still a fairly hetero-dominated indie rock scene. This included gloriously explicit songs referencing soldier orgies, kneeling “for the taste of a man” and about the joys of a golden shower. “I’m surprised I wrote those lyrics, actually,” says Gibb; “I’m very conservative now.” I am not entirely sure if his bashful tone is serious. There’s a pause. It is only in London, he adds, where he has been on gay dating apps and seen men stating they’re H&H, meaning high and horny and looking for chemsex. “How are people in London H&H?” he muses. “They’ve got rent to pay and it’s so expensive.”The world has become kinkier in the last 20 years, catching up with the Hidden Cameras. In a city where little is taboo, Bronto’s inspirations are not just from Gibb’s visits to the darker corners of clubs like Berghain. Some of the sensuality comes from more vanilla sources, such as the German openness around the body. “The whole nudity thing here is so much more normal,” says Gibb, “In Germany, you’re not allowed to wear your bathing suit in the sauna – they’ll yell at you. It forced me to be comfortable with nudity, and it did infiltrate the music.”Even more innocently, Bronto was inspired by Olivia Newton-John’s Physical, the first song Gibb loved on the radio. The booming drums of infernally catchy You Can Call, meanwhile, was his attempt to write a song that might win the Eurovision song contest. Gibb says that he wanted to use the minimalism of electronic music to write in a more directly romantic way. It’s an album about how the transience of life any city, not just Berlin, can impact sexual and romantic entanglements. “It’s more traditional on the lyrical side,” he says. “Everyone has a song called I Want You, and I am making mine.” There are nods to his heroes, two of whom (Erasure’s Vince Clarke and Pet Shop Boys) delivered remixes of Undertow and How Do You Love? that married their own classic electro pop sensibilities to the new, direct Hidden Cameras sound.Although Gibb describes Bronto as “a brand-new direction, feeling or representation of who I am”, he’s planning to carry on playing old songs on guitar before the sweat-in-a-vest electronic section in this autumn’s tour. After that, it’ll be a return to more familiar terrain with an album of “jangly” guitar music. He reflects that the commonality through these different periods of the Hidden Cameras is not just his voice and presence, but his exploration of the contradictory emotions that surround love. “There’s romanticism and there’s cynicism,” he says, “I still feel like there’s a part of me that’s not jaded.”Bronto by the Hidden Cameras is out now.They play Rough Trade East, London, on Monday 15 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndieDance musicShareReuse this content"

In 2009, I chose Derek as my specialist subject on Celebrity Mastermind, beating the comedian John Thomson, who chose James Bond villains. To be fair, I would also have won if I had done his round. I was getting questions like, “Which Japanese duo collaborated with Derek Bailey on the 1995 album Saisoro?” and John was getting, “What colour was Blofeld’s cat?”Musical minds immeasurably superior to mine have grappled more succinctly with the enigma of Derek, who died in 2005 at the age of 75.Writing in the Quietus four years ago, Jennifer Lucy Allan explained: “Derek Bailey is one antidote for anyone who thinks they’ll never understand improvised music. His guitar playing is that which requires a surrendering to your own ears. It is what it is, and that’s exactly what he intended it to be.” I, in turn, listen to Derek and think: “This, whatever it is, is resolutely and implacably this.” And that is what I, as a comedian, have tried to steal from it.I think I first saw Derek play at the ICA in the early 90s, as I started scouring pub attic evenings and Labour club Sunday afternoons for free improvised music, after I came to London to try standup in the winter of 1989. Voraciously curious about the capital’s concealed subcultures, I nonetheless rarely understood who or what it was I was watching. Seeing the band Morphogenesis burst a balloon and amplify pot plants as a lone cat crept audibly around them, upstairs in a squatted Hackney pub named after a Captain Beefheart song, I’m not sure I was aware that these musicians even made records. And there was no Google to tell me.But I do remember the first time I met Derek. In 1996, I visited his humble Hackney home to interview him for a Sunday newspaper about his new album Guitar, Drums ’n’ Bass, which Derek, then in his late 60s, had created by jamming along to pirate radio broadcasts of the brutal new dance music phenomenon, which had forced their way into his frequencies from concealed aerials on nearby tower blocks.I remember the room he practised in being sparse and white, empty and monastic, and that he affected a comical bemusement at the idea that anyone would buy his records: “Do you just sit still and listen to them, or do you potter about and make cups of tea while they’re on?” For Derek, music lived in the moment, perhaps as a reaction to the decades he spent as a successful session musician for hire – did he really play on Petula Clark’s Downtown? – before his Damascene conversion to the absolute abandonment of tyrannical composition.Derek sent me away with his seminal book, Improvisation: Its Nature and Practice in Music, and a cassette of the Scottish music hall comedian Chic Murray, both of which influenced me enormously. Fresh from the encounter, I wrote: “Bailey comes over like a cross between Clegg from Last of the Summer Wine and a harsh-but-fair science teacher, who illuminates the Genesis myths of improvised music without being remotely patronising.”A fractious exchange followed of which I am not entirely proud. I’m surprised the producer left it inFor the next decade, Derek supplied me with CDs of outtakes and postcards he inscribed with inspiring mantras, my favourite reading simply: “The struggle continues.” Derek died on Christmas Day 2005, Jesus Christ in reverse. At his funeral, I performed a Chic Murray routine, while the wake afterwards, upstairs in a Hackney pub, saw the veteran American jazz hoofer Will Gaines, then 78, sit in a chair and tap out a fond and furious farewell. I wish this had been preserved for posterity, but its undocumented passing is quintessentially Derek.I visited Derek’s Hackney Downs house for the fifth and final time earlier this year, ostensibly to hold a ladder for the archivist Tim Fletcher, as he scoured the dark attic for illuminating items before the property was sold. Shafts of sunlight shone through the lean-to extension Derek had improvised freely long ago, in simpler times, when marginal artists could still afford to live and create magic in the city’s neglected nether regions.The presenter of Great Lives, the former Tory MP Matthew Parris, had clearly arrived for the programme having prepared little, relying on notes supplied to him, and was taken by surprise by Derek’s music, which he described as sounding “like a chimpanzee”. A fractious exchange followed of which I am not entirely proud, mediated by the improv expert Ian Greaves. I’m surprised the producer left it in. But I suspect Derek would have enjoyed it.

It was filmed forSky Arts, the cameras so unobtrusive as to be almost unnoticeable, but was still an odd hybrid of an evening, with a talking-heads-and-bleeding-chunks format that seemed geared more to TV than to a theatre audience.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

If you wanted to learn much about the women in Mozart’s life you would probably have been disappointed, although several were at least mentioned in the informal scripted links from the presenterLauren Laverne, who slipped into friendly interviewer mode to ask the singers for more personal contributions. It was a big ask of the singers, who were required to appear at ease as themselves on stage, offer seemingly unscripted insights into the microphone, and then switch seamlessly into character – often to portray that character at a moment of peak emotional stress.View image in fullscreenMozart’s Women: A Musical Journey.Photograph: Chris Lobina/Sky ArtsIn the circumstances it wasn’t surprising that generally the arias – some sung in English translation, some not – felt a bit constrained. The lighter numbers came off best in Annilese Miskimmon’s sometimes updated direction: Golda Schultz as the Countess and Ailish Tynan as Susanna turning the letter-writing scene from The Marriage of Figaro into a texting duet, their moment of friendship sealed as they pressed send; Tynan sparring ridiculously with Rainelle Krause as the rival divas of Der Schauspieldirektor. Shorn of context, Nardus Williams’s introspective way with Donna Anna and Fiordiligi’s arias – with Filipe Manu filling in the tenor roles sweetly – came across less vividly than her sisterly duet with Bethany Horak-Hallett’s Dorabella. At the end, Krause nailed the Queen of the Night’s second aria fromThe Magic Flute, every high note crystal clear. Suddenly, the musical atmosphere was electric – just in time for the concert to end.On Sky Arts as part of December’s Mozart SeasonExplore more on these topicsClassical musicEnglish National Opera (ENO)Wolfgang Amadeus MozartSky ArtsOperaLauren LavernereviewsShareReuse this content"

Until this spring, she owned a photo booth. It was a private, almost confessional space, shut off from the bulk of the revelry in the bar’s side room. Soon after Varah bought the booth, someone directed her attention to its classic red curtains: the velvet drapes were short, coming down just above the hips of whoever sat in it, “so that you can’t get up to anything in there” – mainly sex or drugs. But Varah, who is 42, wanted her booth to be a space of indiscretion.“I immediately put a long curtain in,” she said. For five years, the bar had a house policy: take a nude inside the booth and receive a token for another free round.View image in fullscreenA person takes a photo at the Classic Photo Booth warehouse event in Old Bridge,New Jersey, as part of the International Photobooth Convention in New York City, on 30 August 2025.What is the most fun you can have in a film photo booth? Ask a room full of self-described “boothers” – those would be analog obsessives – and you will get a host of answers, only some of which are R-rated. (“Kissing inside of there is just really fun,” Varah said). Others are more innocent – or ridiculous. Jocelyn Dean, who worked as a photo booth technician in Portland, Oregon, once got proposed to as the flashbulbs went off (she said no). Kati Cleaver, who restores the machines in Chicago, took her engagement photos inside of one. When Justin Twaddell and his wife, Caitlin von Schmidt, had their son, Tom, 18 years ago, they brought the newborn to a booth near their home Greenfield, Massachusetts, for some of his first baby pictures. Every month since then, the family goes back for more film strips. It’s a ritual that continues even as Tom goes off to college this fall; luckily for them, he’s staying local.View image in fullscreenFrom left, Kati Cleaver’s and Hong Van’s photo booth strips taken at the Classic Photo Booth warehouse.These boothers gathered in New York City over Labor Day weekend for the International Photobooth Convention: anannual eventthat floats through cities boasting a large concentration of booths – last year’s took place in London – and includes technical demos of the machines, artists talks and art workshops. On a hot Saturday afternoon, they piled into chartered buses and drove over the bridge to New Jersey’s Classic Photo Booth warehouse to test various models, some dating back to the 1940s. Longtime enthusiast Max Sverdlov has run his company, Classic Photo Booth, for over 30 years, refurbishing broken machines and selling them to interested buyers.View image in fullscreenThe International Photobooth Convention.

Gonzalez and her boss, Jessi Bowman, made the trip toNew Yorkhoping to buy one. Boothers say there are no film photo booths left in Texas – in fact, there are fewer than 200 left worldwide, according to Autophoto, the organization that runs the convention. “I take a trip each year to a place that has one, so I can document myself the way I feel most represented,” Gonzalez said. The Texans left the convention without securing a machine, but they met some sellers they plan to work with in the near future.They’re a gathering place, and as soon as you’re in a booth together, you’re like a kid againRaya LiebermanBooths used to be ubiquitous in arcades, bars and some European metro stations, but over the years the mid-century machines became relics, expensive to maintain as only a handful of people are qualified to work on them – and because film, ink and replacement parts are not cheap. Today, many venues have digital machines – you have probably noticed pop-ups at work holiday parties or wedding receptions – but those tend to produce sharper, less forgiving images than their film predecessors. “I don’t like photos of myself, but I love photo booths,” said Peter McDaniel, 45, from Chicago.Emma Cooper, a 35-year-old from Los Angeles, makes a point to track down photo booths when she travels. It doesn’t always pan out. “I went all the way to Poland, and the booth was broken,” Cooper said. “Luckily, I headed to Berlin afterwards, which is so rich in photo booth culture.” (So-called “photoautomats” are spread all over the German city.)Some enter the booths without a plan. Others, like artist Lexi Darlin’, 42, storyboard out their poses with the intensity of a film director. Others still bring props – or pets: Alice Christine Walker, a photographer and former technician in Portland, Oregon, once got an urgent call from a woman who was trying to take headshots of her chickens in a booth. The chickens were dark-colored and were not showing up on film. Walker adjusted the exposure and all was well.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLexi Darlin’, 42, Cincinnati, Ohio, takes photo booth photos at the Classic Photo Booth warehouse.Why does Walker think photo booths are so special? “It’s private,” she said. “You can close the curtain, and it’s just you.” Except when there are chickens.Press a button, take your pictures, wait for the printing: photo booths might seem simple to the uninitiated, but they are a feat of chemistry and engineering. Dean, who fielded the photo booth marriage proposal, remembers changing the chemicals of a photo booth at the Ace Hotel in Portland. A young boy watching nearby asked how it all worked. She began explaining the process, but stopped as she watched the kid’s eyes glaze over. “So then I said: ‘It’s magic!’ and he went: ‘Oooo, OK!’ I should have started with that,” Dean said.View image in fullscreenÚnies Gonzalez, 29, poses in her photo booth strips.Melissa Veerasammy, 28, and Raya Lieberman, 30, who traveled to the convention from Montreal and Portland respectively, met in college and formed a friendship one strip at a time. “I love the tangible memories that are created, and that you only have four shots,” Veerasammy said.“There’s no negative – if you lose it, it’s gone,” Lieberman added. “And if you’re into them, you’re really into them. They’re a gathering place, and as soon as you’re in a booth together, you’re like a kid again.”View image in fullscreenHannah Roddam-Kitt, 40, owner of the only analog photo booth in Portugal, looks at her friends’ photo strips.But much like youth, a photo booth does not last forever. Even the most ardent devotees cannot keep every machine running. Varah, the Washington bartender, sold hers this spring. She needed to pay off credit card debt and could not afford costly repairs. “I hit the end of my run,” Varah said. “When the booth went on the truck, I felt the physical sensation of stress leaving my body.” And if she ever had the opportunity to buy another? “I would jump on it.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographyNew YorkNew JerseyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The couple were reported to police, fined €450 (£390) each and banned from Venice for 48 hours, effectively ending their holiday.That’s harsh.Not to Venetians. The supporters of a campaign group are calling for much higher fines and permanent bans.Whatcampaign group?It’s called Venezia NON è Disneyland.Are you allowed to swim in the canals atDisneyland, then?Not really, no. Two years ago, a man was arrested for stripping naked and wading into the water of the It’s a Small World ride, but that’s another story.I hadn’t realised canal swimming was such a big problem in Venice.It is certainly a perennial one.

And in 2022,two Australians were caught surfing in the Grand Canal.But apart from that, the tourists are pretty well behaved?Oh my, no. They sunbathe in bikinis in front of historic churches. They paddleboard on waterways. They speed through the world heritage site on bicycles and electric scooters.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There are many ways to make an entrance, but lurching into a pub full of smartly dressed diners while windswept, muddy and more than a little frayed wouldn’t be my first choice. At 7.30pm on a sunny Sunday evening, theWelldiggers Arms– a country pub just outside Petworth in West Sussex – is full of people tucking into hearty roasts, the glass-walled restaurant overlooking glorious downland scenery, the sun all but disappeared behind the hills. For my husband, Mark, and I, it’s more than a stop for supper; the pub marks the halfway point on our two-day walking adventure along a brand new trail, the 25-milePetworth Way.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Twenty-five miles may not sound like much (I have keen walker friends who would do it in a day) but, for us, it’s the perfect length, with plenty of pubs along the way. The first leg, from Haslemere to Petworth, covers countryside we’re both entirely unfamiliar with; the second, Petworth to Arundel runs through landscapes I’ve known since childhood. Happily, the start and finish points can be reached by rail – meaning we can leave the car at home and set off with nothing but small rucksacks, water bottles and detailed printed instructions.A map showing the Petworth Way and the South Downs national parkThings start easily enough; a brief weave through Haslemere’s residential streets before the first serious ascent, through fields and shady, fern-rippled woodland that opens out on to Black Down, the highest point in the South Downs national park. After the dim light of the wood, the heathland blazes with colours; bursts of butter-yellow gorse, purple heather and bottle-green pine trees, all set beneath an intensely blue sky.It reminds me of Ashdown Forest, which inspired Winnie-the-Pooh, and Mark and I bicker happily about who would be Christopher Robin and who Pooh, before arriving at the Temple of the Winds viewpoint, where we sink gratefully on to the seat and soak up the view. It is spectacular; green velvet hills and blueish-tinged valleys, church spires and the odd country estate dotted between the trees, all of Sussex laid out before us, half drenched in sunlight, half darkened by ominous clouds throwing down grey mists of rain on the horizon.View image in fullscreenSunset over Blackdown.Photograph: Roy Wylam/AlamyKeen not to miss lunch at theNoah’s Arkpub in Lurgashall, we set off again, at which point the bickering becomes slightly less good-humoured as we realise we’re going the wrong way. Ten minutes’ later, we’re properly lost, with an OS app on a phone that has unhelpfully lost all signal and directions that make no sense. Thankfully, a pair of local walkers point us in the right direction, and we make it down the hill, past vineyards and on to the pub, where we settle in with a couple of cold halves, some local salami and warm bread, eaten while watching a cricket match on the village green.Fortunately, the next few miles are more straightforward, until a final ascent that leads intoPetworth House’s great park; a glorious end to the day that makes us feel as if we’ve got this walking thing licked. That is, until we realise there are very few taxis in Petworth and we’ll have to walk the extra mile and a half to theWelldiggers, which, fortunately, proves to be a cocoon of loveliness; all soft clean linens, piping-hot showers, and staff who politely pretend not to notice our slightly catatonic state over dinner.As the Arun valley unfolds, I think of how many decades I’ve driven the road alongside and how different the countryside looks when taken at a slow paceNext morning, fuelled by deliciousshakshuka(poached eggs in a hot tomato sauce) and several buckets of tea, we hop in a taxi back to Petworth park to continue the walk across the Sussex Weald. The route drops in on a short section of theSerpent Trail– a 65-mile route from Haslemere to Petersfield that we pencil in for next year – before veering away past Burton Park, a grandiose, privately owned Greek revival mansion, all Doric columns and vanilla-hued walls. From here, the path heads downhill, which, we agree, is not a good thing, as it means going uphill is not far off.Uphill is something of an understatement, and the pull up through the villages of Barlavington and Sutton was made even more challenging as theWhite Horse Inn, earmarked for a restorative half, turns out to be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Fuelled instead by lukewarm water and half a Twix each, we carry on towards Bignor, the gradient steepening with every step. By the time we’re walking east along the South Downs Way, the 360-degree views – across a patchwork of faded cornfields and khaki grassland – are quite some reward. Even so, it’s a welcome change to begin the descent into Houghton village, where I know (because I’ve checked) lunch awaits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the Arun valley unfolds beside the wooded hills of the Arundel estate, I think of how many decades I’ve driven the road that runs alongside and how different the countryside looks when taken at a slow pace, with the chance to stop and look, rather than snatched glances through the windscreen. Thirty years ago, I’d sit over lunch with my mum and dad in theGeorge & Dragon’s garden, watching hikers amble down the very hillside we’re walking on. I’ve not been back to the pub for many years and it’s lovely – if slightly lump in throat – to return and have my parents suddenly conjured up so vividly.It’s tempting to stay all afternoon, but after a classic ploughman’s (what else?), we lace up our boots for the final stretch, past Houghton’s thatched, flint-walled cottages and along the River Arun, before one final ascent into the Arundel estate. Clouds glower, but we’re lucky; the rain holds off as we skirt the edge of Swanbourne Lake and pass the Hiorne Tower, built by architect Francis Hiorne in 1797, as part of his (failed) bid to rebuild Arundel Castle. When we pop out on to London Road and amble towards the familiar outline of the castle, we’re almost too focused on finding large slabs of cake to properly celebrate the fact we’ve arrived at our destination.Later, once the train has taken us back to our corner of the East Sussex countryside, I think about how little I know, really, of the landscapes I’ve visited since childhood. We’ll probably never be long-distance walkers, but weekend trails like this prove you don’t have to be; a couple of days is enough to see a familiar landscape in a whole new light.Accommodation was provided by theWelldiggers Arms, which has double rooms from £115 B&BExplore more on these topicsWalking holidaysSussex holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Put the bowl on a larger plate (to prevent spills), then microwave on a medium heat (on my microwave, that’s 600W out of a maximum 800W) for 11 minutes, then leave to stand, still covered, for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, whisk the peanut butter, miso, lime juice, chilli flakes and 50ml just boiled water to make the sauce: you’re aiming for something a little thicker than double cream, so if need be add more boiling water a tablespoon at a time.Boil the eggs for four to five minutes, for jammy yolks, then pop them in a bowl of cold water. Once cool enough to handle, peel them.Spoon the hot rice into bowls, top with the roast vegetables, eggs and peanut sauce, scatter over the sesame seeds (or salted peanuts) and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetarian food and drinkQuick and easyFoodVegetablesEggsRiceMain courseKorean food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

The sharpness of a fresh, herby chutney with salty butter, meanwhile, makes the perfect topping for barbecued corn on the cob. I often cook the corn straight on the hob, which is a bit tricky, but it’s how we did it when I was growing up in India.Corn on the cob curry (pictured top)Prep10 minCook45 minServes4-6For the curry4 corncobs, cut in half widthways2-3 tbsp peanut oil, or sunflower oil1 tsp cumin seeds4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped20 curry leaves400ml coconut milk1 tsp saltFor the curry paste40gfresh coriander, leaves and stalks10gfresh mint,leaves only6 garlic cloves,peeled2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled4 green chillies, stalks discarded, flesh roughlychopped (remove the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)1 medium-sized red onion, peeled and roughly chopped1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp black pepper2 tsp soft brown sugar½ tsp ground turmeric4 tbsp lime juicePut the corn pieces in a pan, cover with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 10 minutes, then drain. Meanwhile, put all curry paste ingredients and two tablespoons of water in a blender and blitz smooth.Heat the oil in a pan and add the cumin. Once they start to sizzle, add the chopped garlic and the curry leaves, and cook for a minute. Stir in the curry paste and 100ml water, and cook over a low heat for five minutes.Tip in the coconut milk, then add the salt and all but one of the pieces of corn. Shave the kernels off the remaining piece of corn, then add those to the curry with 100ml more water. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat, cover and cook for 10 minutes.Serve hot with a pile of fluffy rice.Coriander mint chutney butter cornView image in fullscreenChetna Makan’s coriander mint chutney butter corn.Photograph: Emma Guscott/The Guardian.
